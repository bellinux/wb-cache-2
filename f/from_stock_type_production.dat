40|$|In California, Drosophila simulans females {{from some}} populations (type W) produce {{relatively}} few adult progeny when crossed to males {{from some other}} populations (type R), but the productivity of the reciprocal cross is comparable to within-population controls. These two incompatibility types are widespread in North America and are also present elsewhere. Both types sometimes occur in the same population. Type R females always produce type R progeny irrespective of the father's type. However, matings between R males and females <b>from</b> <b>stocks</b> classified as <b>type</b> W produce type R progeny at low frequency. This suggests rare paternal transmission of the R incompatibility type, as we have found no evidence for segregation of incompatibility types in the W stocks. There is quantitative variation among type R lines for compatibility with W females, but not vice versa. Population cage studies and productivity tests suggest that deleterious side effects {{are associated with the}} type R cytoplasm...|$|R
50|$|The field {{performance}} {{among various}} <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> in Ontario plantations was examined by Paterson and Hutchison (1989): the white spruce <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> were 2+0, 1.5+0.5, 1.5+1.5, and 3+0. The nursery stock was grown at Midhurst Forest Tree Nursery, and carefully handled through lifting on 3 lift dates, packing, and hot-planting into cultivated weed-free loam. After 7 years, overall survival was 97%, with {{no significant differences}} in survival among <b>stock</b> <b>types.</b> The 1.5+1.5 <b>stock</b> with a mean height of 234 cm was significantly taller by 18% to 25% than the other <b>stock</b> <b>types.</b> The 1.5+1.5 <b>stock</b> also had significantly greater dbh than the other <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> by 30-43%.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{recognized}} types of Quarabs: Straight or Foundation, Stock and Pleasure. Straight/Foundation horses are an almost even blend of Arabian and stock horse traits, showing {{the influence of}} both bloodlines equally. This type is sought by most breeders, and is the type on which the registry standard is based. The <b>Stock</b> <b>type</b> Quarab has a greater amount of either Quarter or Paint horse breeding and traits; this type is often used by ranchers and Western riding breeders. The Pleasure type shows a strong Arabian influence, with less traits <b>from</b> the <b>stock</b> horse - these horses are often favored by endurance riders.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 A {{detailed}} {{analysis was performed}} on the juvenile growth of six <b>types</b> of Douglas-fir <b>stock</b> under the influence of typical seral Coast Range vegetation. Objectives were to analyze competitive influences important to the growth of tree seedlings and evaluate differences between <b>stock</b> <b>type</b> characteristics and growth patterns in response to competition of several kinds. Results were also compared as far as possible with an earlier analysis of the same trees to investigate the changing competitive status of Douglas-fir of various sizes as their competitors grow. Initial seedling height was consistently important in explaining variation in the seven-year growth of tree seedlings associated with a variety of vegetation groups, regardless of <b>stock</b> <b>type.</b> Correlations of growth with <b>stock</b> <b>type</b> and site location were also significant, although the importance of <b>stock</b> <b>type</b> decreased with the increasing age of the trees, while the importance of site increased. In addition, there was more unexplained growth variation at seven years than at five years indicating that factors not included in regression models, such as microsite variation and/or increasing size of trees, are becoming increasingly more important in determining seedling growth. At six and seven years, vegetation on cutover sites explained only a limited portion of the variation in current growth. Vegetation effects on tree seedlings appear to be cumulative however, with past competitive stress highly correlated with the present status of tree seedlings. In addition, after four or five field seasons, the competitive status of juvenile tree seedlings has already been determined and there is little tendency for change either to a more favorable or less favorable competitive environment without interference. Seral vegetation is more competitive and hence has a greater influence on tree seedlings if it overtops them, as with tall hardwoods and sprouts which reduce available light, than when it encroaches on them from the side or below as with low shrubs and herbs. The advantages of using larger <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> in mesic to moist Coastal brushy areas are still obvious at seven years, even though seedling growth at this time is not significantly different between <b>stock</b> <b>types,</b> vegetation groups or sites. Larger seedlings maintain their initial height. advantage, are able to become 'established' (reach 4 - 1 / 2 ft.) up to three years before smaller seedlings and have higher survival rates than smaller seedlings. In addition, larger <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> are less susceptible to adverse site influences and damage than smaller <b>stock</b> <b>types,</b> at seven years. Intensive forest management is dependent upon reforestation success. Options which enhance the survival and growth of crop trees {{in the early years of}} a rotation allow for increased and more dependable yields in subsequent years. The use of larger <b>stock</b> <b>types</b> on brushy Coast Range sites is an effective alternative for meeting these reforestation goals...|$|R

40|$|Kluskus {{is located}} south of Vanderhoof in the Vanderhoof Forest District, on flat to gently rolling terrain at an {{elevation}} of 1036 m. Soils are silt loam with high coarse fragment contents at depth. Forest floors are Mormoders and Hemimors, varying in thickness from 2 – 17 cm. Most of the site resembles the Sxw – twinberry – coltsfoot site series (SBSmc 3 / 05) (DeLong et al. 1993). However, compact basal till at depths of 20 – 40 cm restricts drainage and inhibits root penetration, and though soil moisture can be excessive in spring, moisture deficits occur during summer dry spells. At Kluskus, eight treatments were replicated in each of four experimental blocks, with 80 trees in total per plot, 48 of which were monitored. Site preparation treatments were {{carried out in the}} fall of 1986, and planting took place in May 1987.
