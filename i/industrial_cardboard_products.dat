40|$|DE 19822605 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - To form {{a durable}} marking {{in the top}} layer of paper substrates, {{at least one of the}} lower layers is treated with laser energy before the top layer is applied. The top layer is opaque using a {{printing}} and/or at least a varnish and/or at least a metallizing or combinations of them. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A coating is directly under the top paper layer, which has no pigments or contains white or colored pigments. The coating is calendered and can also be varnished. The same process can be used with layers of thicker fiber webs, of natural fibers, to give a <b>cardboard</b> <b>product.</b> The laser energy metallizes the surface to take printing and/or a varnish. The lower layer surface is treated with a carbon dioxide laser. The metallizing process uses copper, aluminum, gold or silver. The marking is a logo, name, trade mark, an image, or a security marking. The paper substrate is in a weight of 40 - 400 g/m 2. USE - The process is for the development of a durable marking in the paper or cardboard material, such as would be provided by a watermark or for the security of the document.

40|$|Cellulosic {{materials}} include wood, paper, rags, and <b>cardboard</b> <b>products.</b> These {{materials are}} co-disposed with radiological waste at the Savannah River Site's (SRS) E-Area Low-Level Waste Facility (ELLWF). Cellulosic materials readily degrade {{in the environment}} to form cellulose degradation products (CDP) that will partition to the sediment or remain mobile in the groundwater. Savannah River National Lab (SRNL) has conducted studies to estimate the impact of CDP on radionuclide sorption to SRS sediments (Kd values). It was found that CDP impact on radionuclide sorption varies with radionuclide and CDP concentration. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} the amount of carbon (C) in the system could increase or decrease Kd values with respect to the base case of when no CDP was added. Throughout the expected pH range of the ELLWF, a low concentration of CDP in the system would increase Kd values (because C would sorb to the sediment and provide more exchange sites for radionuclides to sorb), whereas greater concentrations of CDP ({ge} 20 mg/L C) would decrease Kd values (because C would remain in solution and complex the radionuclide and not permit the radionuclide to sorb to the sediment). A review of > 230 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) groundwater concentrations in the Old Radioactive Waste Burial Ground (ORWBG) at the SRS indicated that the average DOC concentration, a gross measure of CDP, was 5 mg/L C. At approximately this DOC concentration, the laboratory studies demonstrated that no anions (Tc, I, or Se) or cations (Ni, Sr, Ce, Eu, Zr, or Th) have decreased sorption in the presence of carbon (an analogue for CDP) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of magnesium-enriched liquid bittern {{in the treatment}} of a variety of industrial wastewaters was investigated. Fresh samples of effluents collected from such industries as ceramic, pulp and <b>cardboard,</b> dairy <b>products,</b> marble tiles, tannery and ready-mix concrete were initially adjusted to pH levels of 11. 4 ± 0. 1 by the addition of slaked lime. Serial dosages of liquid bittern were added, and the jar test technique was used to determine the impact of the process on a number of determinant parameters. The investigation also included bacterial population suppression, and carbonation involving the use of dry ice (CO 2) to adjust the effluent pH in order to meet discharge standards. The liquid bittern, with a potential for mass production by solar evaporation of seawater in coastal areas, was found to be an effective and economic coagulant {{in the treatment of}} industrial wastewaters. Turbidity and total suspended solids removals have exceeded 95 %, while the chemical oxygen demand removals ranged from 40 to 99 %, {{depending on the type of}} industry. Besides its reduced bulk when compared to seawater as the Mg 2 + source, liquid bittern has the added advantage of inducing the least increase in total dissolved solids in the treated effluent. A high degree of total and fecal coliform bacteria were removed from the supernatant liquid under the experimental conditions applied. Additions of (CO 2) in amounts ranging from 3. 8 to 46. 6 ml/l depending on pH and alkalinity prior to carbonation of the effluent were needed to neutralize the alkalized industrial wastewaters. <br/...|$|R

He had completed dumping the <b>cardboard</b> waste <b>product</b> onto an outdoor unloading pad, and pulled {{a short distance away}} to secure the tailgate of his truck. As he was securing the tailgate, a payloader backed out of the adjacent storage building, making a 90 degree turn in order to move the waste material from the unloading pad into the building. The operator of the payloader was unaware of the dump truck and backed into the truck, crushing the truck driver between the two vehicles. The operator of the payloader immediately went for help, notifying a co-worker who called 911 and notified the owner of the plant of the incident. An emergency squad responded within minutes. The truck driver was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. New York State Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (NY FACE) investigators concluded that to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future: Facilities should be properly designed and unloading procedures modified to promote safety; Payloader operators should survey the surrounding area prior to backing; Safety devices should be checked at each shift change to ensure proper operation. Additional safety devices should be installed in areas of high traffic; Truck drivers should pull dump trucks a safe distance away from the unloading area prior to securing the tailgate. Companies should consider instituting policies that specify this distance...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} fairly {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} state of the cereal crop industry in the Republic of Tajikistan and other regions of East and South-East Asia. Problems of generation of a huge amount of waste in the course of processing of cereals, in particular, rice straw processing by-products, are raised by the authors. The authors propose their original solution to the problems in question. Besides, traditional and original methods of application of rice straw in low-rise construction and production of building materials are presented in the article. The major part of the article covers traditional methods of disposal of rice straw as a raw material used in the production of cellulose, lignin biodegradable plastic, paper, <b>cardboard,</b> wicker <b>products,</b> thermal energy, etc. Another important issue, covered in the article, is the study of the straw/husk burning process, as well as the possibility of generating ash that contains various forms of silica. The fact that the ash content of the straw, according to various sources, varies within the range of 16 – 20 %, and its silica content may be up to 89 – 91 % make it possible for the authors to state that straw and husk ash can be used as an active mineral additive in the production of effective building materials. It is noteworthy that the problems raised in the article are relevant, and their practical solutions are feasible.

40|$|Design and {{construction}} of full-scale anaerobic digesters that co-digest manure with various materials requires analysis of each substrate. Substrate combinations should be analyzed through a scale up procedure in which substrates are characterized, and then evaluated using biochemical methane potential assays (BMPs) and anaerobic toxicity assays (ATAs). The BMPs provide a preliminary indication of the biodegradability of a substrate and of its potential to produce methane via anaerobic digestion, while ATAs determine {{the degree to which}} a particular substrate inhibits methane production. Mixture combinations that perform well in BMPs and ATAs should be tested in laboratory-scale anaerobic digesters. Once proven in lab-scale reactors for at least three hydraulic retention times, the best mixture should be tested in a pilot-scale reactor. This paper focuses on the first steps in this process using BMPs and ATAs results to select mixtures for laboratory-scale digester testing. The baseline feedstock was beef manure obtained from concrete feedlot pens (open and covered) in eastern Iowa. Various bedding materials were available, including oat hulls, corn stover, and wood shavings. To provide additional energy production, <b>industrial</b> byproducts from <b>cardboard</b> manufacturing, enzyme production, and corn and soybean processing were also potential substrates.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of utilizing handmade paper and <b>cardboard</b> <b>industrial</b> sludges {{in the production}} of edible mushrooms involves risk of introducing toxic substances into the human food chain. Therefore, in the present study, genotoxic assessment of P. florida (Pleurotus florida) cultivated on these industrial sludges and their combination with wheat straw was done by Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 100. Interestingly, P. florida carpophores, cultivated on wheat straw did not show either frameshift or basepair mutagenicity as revealed by mutagenicity ratio (< 2) and mean number of revertants which was found to be 81. 3 and 93. 4 revertants per plate in the absence of S 9 mix. However, this number was found to be increased to 112. 1 and 226. 3 revertants with S 9 mix. P. florida cultivated on waste and its combination showed increase in number of revertants (123. 4 - 170. 1 revertants with TA 100 and 79. 5 - 84. 1 revertants with TA 98) in the absence of S 9 mix over control. Further, increase in number of revertants (229. 0 - 247. 3 with TA 100 and 100. 3 - 129. 1 with TA 98) was observed on adding S 9 mix with both strains S. typhymurium but still mutagenicity ratio was found to be below 2. Hence, these mushrooms were not found to be genotoxic. This mushroom cultivation technique, will not only provide proteinaceous food but also help in reducing industrial wastes. Besides, these can serve as very good source of income for the poor workers working in these industries that can collect the waste from the industries and use it for P. florida cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Using a field-based model, {{mechanical}} transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was assessed throughout a coordinated {{sequence of events}} that replicated common farm worker behavior during cold weather (< 0 °C). The model involved fomites (boots and containers), vehicle sanitation, transport, {{and the movement of}} personnel. A field strain of PRRSV was inoculated into carriers consisting of snow and water, and carriers were adhered to the undercarriage of a vehicle. The vehicle was driven approximately 50 km to a commercial truck washing facility where the driver's boots contacted the carriers during washing, introducing the virus to the vehicle interior. The vehicle was then driven 50 km to a simulated farm site, and the driver's boots mechanically spread virus into the farm anteroom. Types of containers frequently employed in swine farms (styrofoam semen cooler, metal toolbox, plastic lunch pail, and <b>cardboard</b> animal health <b>product</b> shipping parcel) contacted drippings from footwear on the anteroom floor. The truck wash floor, vehicle cab floor mats, boot soles, anteroom floor, and the ventral surface of containers were sampled to track the virus throughout the model. Ten replicates were conducted, along with sham-inoculated controls. At multiple sampling points PRRSV nucleic acid was detected in 8 of 10 replicates. In each of the 8 PCR-positive replicates, infectious PRRSV was detected on the surfaces of containers by virus isolation or swine bioassay. All sham-inoculated controls were negative.

40|$|The global poultry {{industry}} generates at least 2 million tonnes of chicken feather every year. Feathers are currently hydrolysed into meal used for animal feed and fertilizer. Feather consists of 91 % keratin, 1 % lipid and 8 % water. Raw feather also contains preen oil, offal, faecal matter and poultry processing water. Its morphology consists of barbs extending {{at an angle}} from a central hollow rachis. Impurities coat the entire feather, and particulates are trapped by layers of barbules and hooked barbicels holding adjacent barbs together. These substructures present an extensive and tortuous hydrophobic surface. Feather fibre is a multipurpose, cost effective reinforcement for polymer composites. Its incorporation in plastic, wood, concrete and <b>cardboard</b> makes the <b>product</b> lighter, insulate from heat loss and improve sound attenuation properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a process to produce clean fibre recovered from chicken feather. In the treatment process, the heterogeneous characteristics of feather had to be considered. Raw feather was suspended in 25 L water in a pulper to be decontaminated using 2 stages of 0. 1485 % sodium hypochlorite adjusted to pH 10. 0 with 1 M sodium hydroxide and cleaned in 3 stages of 0. 15 % hydrogen peroxide. The pulper disc impeller agitated the suspension at 10 Hz for 30 minute at each stage. Bacteriological tests confirmed pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella and Enterobacteriaceae were removed during treatment. Off-white clean feathers were more than 10 % whiter than dull yellow raw feather. Cleaned feather was comminuted in 300 L water using a centrifugal pump at a flow rate of 30 Hz on full recycle for 4 hours. Rachis and partially cut feather were removed using a 5 mm aperture filter and fibre was recovered using a 1 mm filter. Wet fibre was dried to constant mass in an air-forced oven at 70 °C.
