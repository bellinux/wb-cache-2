5000|$|Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, {{petroleum}} jelly, calcipotriol, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) {{were found}} to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques. Emollients {{have been shown to}} be even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy. However, certain emollients have no impact on psoriasis plaque clearance or may even decrease the clearance achieved with phototherapy. The emollient salicylic acid is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), commonly found in sunscreen, and is known to interfere with phototherapy in psoriasis. Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy. [...] Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques. Ointment and creams containing coal tar, <b>dithranol,</b> corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogs (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used.

We studied the effectiveness of <b>dithranol</b> in a care instruction programme using short time exposures (short contact treatment), UVB-phototherapy and <b>dithranol</b> treatment in an inpatient setting. In an open randomised study we included 250 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

40|$|For {{more than}} 100 years <b>dithranol</b> has been {{successfully}} used {{for the treatment of}} psoriasis. It is still not fully understood, however, how it exerts its antipsoriatic effect. From the information available to date {{it is clear that the}} actual process of decomposition is central to the therapeutic action of <b>dithranol.</b> Since there is an obvious parallel between the mechanism of decomposition in solution and that of decomposition/metabolism in skin stability studies were carried out in aqueous buffer (PH 5. 5). The effect of various factors such as the presence of various metal ions and surfactants on the decomposition pattern (individual rates of dimer and danthron formation) of <b>dithranol</b> in solution were quantified. The effect of, in particular, surfactants on the skin permeation and decomposition/metabolism of <b>dithranol</b> were then investigated. Because of dithranol's poor water solubility it was necessary to develop an analytical technique capable of the successful quantification of low levels of <b>dithranol</b> and breakdown products in aqueous systems. A previously reported hplc system, which has adequate sensitivity for <b>dithranol</b> and danthron quantification, was used. Improved sensitivity for dimer (3 fold increase), thus allowing the accurate quantification of low levels of dimer in aqueous solutions, was achieved by a modification of the mobile phase. As it was also necessary to establish the amounts of <b>dithranol</b> and breakdown products on and in skin an appropriate extraction method was needed. A procedure whereby skin was first extracted using a mixture of trichloro acetic acid and methanol followed by hplc analysis of the extract was developed. Surfactant solubilisation of <b>dithranol</b> was used to enhance the water solubility of <b>dithranol.</b> Data from the solubilisation studies shows that in sodium lauryl sulphate and tween 80 (above c. m. c in aqueous buffer pH 5. 5) the amount of <b>dithranol</b> in solution is directly proportional to the % of surfactant present. In cetrimide, solubilisatiori was observed only at low pH e. g pH 0. 4. At pH 5. 5, because of the interaction that takes place between <b>dithranol</b> and cetrimide causing <b>dithranol</b> to ionise, <b>dithranol</b> ionisation is responsible for enhanced solubility. About 3 fold more <b>dithranol</b> goes into such cetrimide solutions compared to equivalent concentrations of sodium lauryl sulphate and tween 80. Surfactant presence, however, had implications on dithranol's decomposition pattern. In the sodium lauryl sulphate and tween 80 solutions little change from that seen in buffer pH 5. 5 was observed namely - 94 % dimer and - 4 % danthron were produced following complete decomposition. In the presence of cetrimide (PH 5. 5) a marked change was seen with - 84 % danthron and - 14 % dimer being formed on complete decomposition. The effect of the inclusion of metal ions i. e Cu 2 +, Zn 2 + and Fe 2 + on the kinetics of the decomposition of <b>dithranol</b> to dimer and danthron were quantified. All had a catalytic effect on the rate of dimer formation, while suppressing that of danthron. The catalytic coefficients were in the order of Cu 2 + > Fe 2 + > Zn 2 +. Concentration vs time data generated on placing surfactant solutions of <b>dithranol</b> in contact with animal skin (in vitro) and human skin (in vivo) allowed estimates of the amount of <b>dithranol</b> and breakdown products penetrating into the skin, along with the degree of skin surface decomposition taking place during the permeation process. A pronounced deviation was observed for <b>dithranol</b> decomposition in the formulations on the skin and when not in contact with skin. Skin surface decomposition was found to result in the formation of an,as yet unknown, breakdown product (P 4). Using the 12 - 0 -tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate/hairless mouse psonasls model it was visually established that the cetrimide-dithranol formulation negated the anti inflammatory effects of <b>dithranol.</b> The tween 80 and sodium lauryl sulphate <b>dithranol</b> formulations reduced the inflammatory response in the psoriasis model to the same degree as an equivalent amount of <b>dithranol</b> delivered in acetone. A preliminary clinical investigation on the influence of cetrimide on the therapeutic outcome of conventional <b>dithranol</b> therapy was carried out using two patients with psoriasis. Cleansing the skin with a solution of cetrimide before and after treatment with <b>dithranol</b> resulted in both a reduction of side effects and a loss in the therapeutic effectiveness of <b>dithranol.</b> The data gathered allowed the discussion of the effect of dithranol's decomposition pathway on its therapeutic outcome...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcipotriol {{has become}} a {{first-line}} treatment for psoriasis. Its efficacy and safety have been shown in many comparative clinical trials carried out in outpatients. In a comparative study in patients visiting the outpatient department once every 14 days, it was shown that calcipotriol was more effective and better tolerated compared with <b>dithranol.</b> OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical efficacy of calcipotriol ointment with that of <b>dithranol</b> cream in a supervised treatment regimen. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial in six centres in the Netherlands, 106 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were included, 54 receiving calcipotriol ointment twice daily and 52 <b>dithranol</b> cream once daily. Patients were treated at the day-care centre, using the care instruction principle of daily visits {{during the first week}} and twice-weekly visits subsequently for up to 12 weeks. RESULTS: This study failed to prove that calcipotriol is as efficacious as <b>dithranol</b> when used in a day-care setting (noninferiority test). The mean percentage reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index from baseline to end of treatment was 57. 0 % in the calcipotriol group vs. 63. 6 % in the <b>dithranol</b> group. However, the two-sided test for superiority indicated no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (P = 0. 39). At the end of treatment, 15 % of the patients treated with calcipotriol ointment and 25 % of those treated with <b>dithranol</b> cream did not require any further treatment. Although calcipotriol ointment appeared to be more effective during the first 8 weeks, a difference was no longer apparent at 12 weeks. In comparison with the high number of drop-outs due to cutaneous side-effects in the calcipotriol group, the frequency of a tolerable degree of irritation appeared to be higher in patients treated with <b>dithranol.</b> However, concomitant corticosteroid treatment of <b>dithranol</b> irritation in seven patients may have contributed to this difference between both treatments. Moreover, patients receiving therapy with calcipotriol ointment experienced fewer application-related skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders than patients treated with <b>dithranol</b> cream: 21 of 53 (40 %) and 37 of 52 (71 %), respectively. This difference is statistically significant (P = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that calcipotriol ointment might be at least as effective as <b>dithranol</b> cream in the day-care setting could not be proven in the present study. Whereas calcipotriol {{has become a}} mainstay in the routine outpatient treatment of psoriasis not requiring a day-care setting, <b>dithranol</b> treatment, being difficult as a routine outpatient therapy, has increased efficacy and improved tolerability if the treatment is carried out in a day-care settin...|$|E

The results demonstrate that Nap-DTH did not modify proliferation and only exhibited slight toxic effects after 24 h at concentrations > 21 μM. At a lower concentration (3. 4 μM), Nap-DTH did not alter cell proliferation or inflammation, which suggests that the codrug is therapeutically inert. Relating to this, the 1 : 1 mixture of naproxen:dithranol exhibited the lowest toxic effect and the highest antiproliferative effect on HaCaT keratinocytes compared to <b>dithranol</b> at the same concentration. Moreover, the 1 : 1 mixture exhibited a reduced inflammatory effect compared to <b>dithranol</b> alone, as reflected by the upregulation of cyclooxygenase- 2 by 45 % and 136 %, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relative}} cost effectiveness of topical calcipotriol and short-contact <b>dithranol</b> {{in the treatment}} of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.

Main outcome measures and results: The outcome measure used was the degree of improvement in psoriasis as judged by the patient. In the short term comparison, calcipotriol was the most effective treatment (60. 8 % success), but it was also the most expensive (Lstg 96. 03; 2000 values). The incremental cost per success was Lstg 577. 50 using a 12 -week course of calcipotriol compared with short-contact <b>dithranol.</b> Over the long term horizon, first-line treatment with calcipotriol still had the highest expected cost per successful treatment (Lstg 164. 91), but the incremental cost using this strategy was Lstg 38. 66 compared with short-contact <b>dithranol.</b> In terms of cost per successful day's treatment (i. e. the cost for a day in which the patient reported a marked improvement or cleared lesions), the cost of each additional successful day's treatment was Lstg 19. 93 when using calcipotriol as first-line treatment rather than short-contact <b>dithranol.</b> Conclusion: The combination of differences in drug acquisition costs and relapse rates can lead to large differences in the comparative cost effectiveness of topical treatments for plaque psoriasis.

Short contact therapy resulted in complete regression in 24 (60 %) patients, 90 % regression of lesions in 5 (12. 5 %) patients and deterioration in 2 (5 %) cases. The average rate of clearance of lesions was between 10 - 30 days. Psoriatic lesions disappeared without leaving spotty hyperpigmentation. <b>Dithranol</b> paste as used in the Ingram technique showed complete clearing in 11 (55 %) patients, 90 % clearing in 5 (25 %) cases and deterioration in 4 (20 %) patients. Ninety percent cases developed spotty hyperpigmentation and 50 % patients experienced marked to fiery red erythema {{during the course of}} treatment. Short contact therapy gave minimal side effects and good cosmetic results...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of psoriasis to ultraviolet radiation and <b>dithranol</b> was {{compared with the}} response to <b>dithranol</b> alone in 24 patients. The difference in rate of response, measured as change in plaque thickness, and the difference in time to complete clearance of psoriasis between irradiated and non-irradiated forearm lesions was significantly greater for patients treated using fluorescent lamps with negligible ultraviolet C emission (Wolff Helarium) than for those patients treated with a medium pressure mercury arc lamp (p less than 0. 01) or an array of fluorescent sunlamps (p less than 0. 05). The difference in therapeutic response shows that ultraviolet B phototherapy is effective when used in combination with <b>dithranol.</b> Nevertheless, radiation sources with substantial ultraviolet C emission, such as the medium pressure mercury arc lamp most commonly used to treat psoriasis in the United Kingdom, have little effect because delivery of therapeutic doses of ultraviolet B is limited by erythema induced by ultraviolet C...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to improve the {{stability}} of <b>dithranol</b> using solid dispersions (SD). Two different SD at a 1 : 9 ratio of dithranol/excipient were prepared: one of them using glyceryl behenate as excipient and the other using a mixture of argan oil with stearic acid (1 : 8 ratio) as excipient. Pure <b>dithranol</b> and SD of <b>dithranol</b> were incorporated in an oil-in-water cream and in a hydrophobic ointment in a drug/dermatological base ratio of 1 : 10. The physical and mechanical properties of semisolid formulations incorporating the pure drug and the developed SD were evaluated through rheological and textural analysis. To evaluate the stability, L*a*b* color space parameters of SD and semisolid formulations, and pH of hydrophilic formulations were determined at defined times, during one month. Each sample was stored at different conditions namely, light exposure (room temperature), high temperature exposition (37 °C) (protected from light) and protected from light (room temperature). Despite higher values of firmness and adhesiveness, hydrophobic ointment exhibited the best rheological features compared to the oil-in-water cream, namely a shear-thinning behavior and high thixotropy. These formulations have also presented more stability, with minor changes in L*a*b* color space parameters. The {{results of this study}} indicate that is possible to conclude that the developed SD contributed to the increased stability of <b>dithranol...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcipotriol {{ointment}} and short-contact <b>dithranol</b> cream therapy are well-established topical {{treatments for}} psoriasis. Quality of life, i. e. the physical, psychological, and social functioning {{and well-being of}} the patient, has become an essential outcome measure in chronic skin disease. OBJECTIVES: To compare the quality-of-life outcomes of calcipotriol ointment with that of short-contact <b>dithranol</b> cream in a supervised treatment regimen, and to determine the degree of improvement in quality of life these topical treatments can accomplish. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial in six centres in the Netherlands, 106 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were included, 54 receiving calcipotriol ointment twice daily and 52 <b>dithranol</b> cream once daily in a 12 -week intensive treatment programme. Patients were treated at the day-care centre, using the care instruction principle of daily visits {{during the first week}} and twice-weekly visits subsequently for up to 12 weeks. Quality of life was assessed with the Skindex- 29 and the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF- 36). RESULTS: At the end of treatment, no statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the calcipotriol and the <b>dithranol</b> group in any of the quality-of-life domains or scales of the Skindex- 29 and the SF- 36. Over time, a significant improvement of quality of life was found on all three scales of the dermatology-specific Skindex- 29, predominantly of a moderate magnitude. In the calcipotriol group, a significant change of a small magnitude was found in the Physical Component Summary of the SF- 36. No significant changes were found in the Mental Component Summary (or on any of the eight scales composing the questionnaire) of the SF- 36. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis was confirmed, that no statistically significant differences in improvement of quality of life could be found between calcipotriol ointment and <b>dithranol</b> short-contact cream in a day-care setting. Given this result, both calcipotriol and <b>dithranol</b> can be welcome alternatives for the patient. Calcipotriol, being more practical and patient friendly, can be considered as a first-line approach in clinical practice. However, in patients recalcitrant to calcipotriol and/or other topical treatments, preference should be given to the <b>dithranol</b> regimen. Topical treatment in combination with interventions explicitly focusing on improvement of coping behaviour and psychosocial functioning may further increase the degree of improvement in the psychosocial domains of quality of life. The results of this study are likely to give further evidence to the notion that the generic SF- 36 is little or not responsive to small to moderate changes in quality of life in mild to moderate psoriasi...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence on the {{effectiveness}} and safety of short-contact <b>dithranol</b> therapy in paediatric psoriasis is sparse and based only on retrospective data. The best results are achieved in a time-consuming day-care setting. OBJECTIVES: To study prospectively {{the effectiveness}} and safety of short-contact <b>dithranol</b> therapy in paediatric psoriasis. In addition, the effectiveness, safety, duration of treatment and number of visits between regular day care and day care with telemedicine were compared. METHODS: Data were collected from the prospective observational Child-CAPTURE registry of children with psoriasis. Effectiveness was measured as the mean percentage improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Safety was assessed by recording adverse events. The number of visits and duration of treatment were reported. RESULTS: For all patients a mean percentage reduction in PASI score of - 69. 3 % was found, with {{no significant differences between}} regular day care and day care with telemedicine. The only adverse event reported was irritation of the skin. Neither the frequency of irritation during treatment nor the mean duration of treatment significantly differed between the two groups. Patients with telemedicine had significantly fewer visits. CONCLUSIONS: This first prospective observational study demonstrates that short-contact <b>dithranol</b> therapy in paediatric psoriasis is effective and safe. Regular day care and day care with telemedicine are equally effective. Telemedicine can be of additional value as it is less time consuming. We hope it will therefore make <b>dithranol</b> treatment appropriate for a larger number of children with psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} skin disease with {{substantial}} impact on patients' social and relational ways {{of living and}} subsequently on their quality of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with short contact <b>dithranol</b> treatment, UVB phototherapy or inpatient <b>dithranol</b> treatment. HRQoL was evaluated in an open randomized multicentre study by appliance of the Dutch short form of the Sickness Impact Profile and the Psoriasis Disability Index; 250 patients were included. Successful short contact <b>dithranol</b> treatment and UVB phototherapy both led to a comparable improvement in HRQoL immediately after treatment until the end of the follow-up (maximum 1 year). Inpatients experienced a more impaired HRQoL and showed no significant improvement in HRQoL directly following treatment. At the end of the study HRQoL became comparable for all treatment groups. All three treatments led to substantial improvement in HRQoL; however, patients treated by short contact treatment or UVB showed a better HRQoL than inpatients...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is a common, chronic and {{relapsing}} inflammatory skin disease. It affects approximately 2 % of {{the western}} population and has no cure. Combination therapy for psoriasis often proves more efficacious and better tolerated than monotherapy with a single drug. Combination therapy could be administered {{in the form of}} a co-drug, where two or more therapeutic compounds active against the same condition are linked by a cleavable covalent bond. Similar to the pro-drug approach, the liberation of parent moieties post-administration, by enzymatic and/or chemical mechanisms, is a pre-requisite for effective treatment. In this study, a series of co-drugs incorporating <b>dithranol</b> in combination with one of several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, both useful for the treatment of psoriasis, were designed, synthesized and evaluated. An ester co-drug comprising <b>dithranol</b> and naproxen in a 1 : 1 stoichiometric ratio was determined to possess the optimal physicochemical properties for topical delivery. The co-drug was fully hydrolyzed in vitro by porcine liver esterase within four hours. When incubated with homogenized porcine skin, 9. 5 % of the parent compounds were liberated after 24 h, suggesting in situ esterase-mediated cleavage of the co-drug would occur within the skin. The kinetics of the reaction revealed first order kinetics, Vmax = 10. 3 μM/min and Km = 65. 1 μM. The co-drug contains a modified <b>dithranol</b> chromophore that was just 37 % of the absorbance of <b>dithranol</b> at 375 nm and suggests reduced skin/clothes staining. Overall, these findings suggest that the dithranol-naproxen co-drug offers an attractive, novel approach for the treatment of psoriasis...|$|E
