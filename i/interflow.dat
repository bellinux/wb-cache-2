40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to demonstrate limnological responses to a change in reservoir discharge from a predominantly surface withdrawal in 1991 to a hypolimnetic withdrawal in 2003. BACKGROUND: Control of reservoir discharge regime and flushing of different strata may be a viable means of improving water quality in Corps of Engineers reservoirs. For instance, a hypolimnetic withdrawal can be effective in removing internal phosphorus (P) loads from the system that would otherwise subsidize algal growth (Nürnberg 1987, Nürnberg et al. 1987). However, cold-water releases can also decrease thermal stability, making a reservoir more susceptible to mixing and vertical entrainment of nutrients, particularly from riverine <b>interflows</b> (Stauffer and Armstrong 1984, Gaugush 1984, Effler et al. 1986). In contrast, discharging primarily from the surface of a reservoir can result in strengthened thermal stability, reducing the potential for vertical entrainment of hypolimnetic nutrients for algal uptake. Increased flushing rates in the epilimnion may also be effective in removing algal populations from the system at a greater rate than their doubling time (Pridmore and McBride 1984, Soballe and Kimmel 1987). The objective {{of this research was}} to compare limnological responses of a Corps reservoir to changes in its withdrawal regime from predominantly surface discharge to hypolimnetic discharge during the summer period in order to explore the possibility of using selective withdrawal as a rehabilitation technique for reducing nuisance algae. This information represents an extension of earlier work on the impacts of withdrawal operations on reservoir water quality (Barbiero et al...|$|R

Dendrochronological study Tree ring thickness is measured on 24 core samples extracted from 12 dominant trees of the stand. Annual increments are standardised by the ARIMA function in order to produce the annual deviation of ring thickness. Means of annual deviation for the 12 trees are then related to annual soil drought intensities. Results Years 1976 and 1996 are emphasised by both the modelling outputs and the dendrochronological measurements as very dry. Model shows a severe drought and tree ring shows a very low growth. Years like 1990, 1992, 1994 and 2004 shows a less severe drought event but a drought that occurs in June-July, which seems to penalize spruce’s growth. On the other hand, years 1981 and 1998 show an important growth and a high value of mean soil moisture during June and July.

The study has two parts: field observations of an <b>interflowing</b> river in Lake Iseo (Italy); and laboratory experiments on basins fed by an underflow. In both, observations are compared to existing and new models. There is significant uncertainty in predicting contaminant transport from inflows to lakes. Reducing the uncertainty contributes both to understanding lake ecosystems and protecting water resources. In field observations, the progressive stages of the inflow were interpreted as a laterally falling plunge region with little mixing, an underflow region with substantial mixing, and finally an intrusion. A simple theory for a laterally falling plunge region was developed, giving the ratio of offshore extent of the plunge region to river width as equal to the initial densimetric Froude number. This theory agreed with the observed plunge location better than existing models. In laboratory experiments, the evolving density stratification in a basin fed by underflowing gravity currents was measured. The transport pathway of the inflowing fluid was visualised with dyes. Gravity currents underflowing uniform ambient uid over an intermediate range of source Reynolds number (Re_s) at constant Richardson number (Ri) had entrainment coefficients (E) that varied linearly with Res. The values for E were within the previously observed range, but were lower than previously observed for the Ri used here, because Re_s was lower here than in previous studies. Dye pulses showed that gravity currents in stratified ambients did not only entrain, as occurs when in uniform ambient fluid, but also effluxed fluid over the whole depth of the stratified ambient. Analytical expressions were developed for the evolving stratification generated by efflux from the gravity current. The new efflux model predicted the observed stratifications more closely than existing entrainment models. The efflux model could better match observations by including the continued mixing that occurs within the stratified ambient and including the undiluted sublayer observed within the gravity current. Future work should quantify efflux from gravity currents and incorporate the efflux mechanism into full lake basin simulations. Given the deviation of existing entrainment models from observations shown here, a better model of gravity current efflux would improve modelling of lakes {{and a variety of}} buoyancy driven flows, from building ventilation to ocean circulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of space governance is framed by its competition-cooperation-compromise hybrid nature which {{is different from}} other type of issue-area governance dealing with merely competition-driven issues (i. e. security), cooperation-oriented issues (i. e. environmental protection), or compromise-seeking issues (i. e. natural resource management) which actors’ competition and cooperation ought to be compromised. Outer space is commonly noted as global public goods to benefit all mankind because space technologies and their boundary-free applications have become ubiquitously valuable to handle various issue areas of safety, economic and social development, and ecological sustainability. Hence, the model of governing space related affairs throughout international cooperation and international regimes became commonplace. Nevertheless, since space remains crucial for many states to assure their national security and to gain economic interests, the internationalisation of space altruism needs habitually compelled to satisfy general interests and respective state’s self-interest concerns. In this context, actors from either intra- or extra-regional dimension of a predefined regional space community take initiative to lead or to support respective space regionalism {{in pursuit of the}} goals of aligning regional astropolitics, harmonising different intra-regional space systems, or developing or consolidating the foundation of regional space governance architecture. With these motivations and institutionalisation practices, the formal or informal regional space regimes stood out with their conductor role in the middle to connect global and national space communities, accommodate and transmit the dynamics <b>interflows</b> between global and national astropolitics within the currently imperfect global space governance architecture. To observe the role of regional space regimes alongside of their respective regionalisation processes, and moreover to analyse the impacts these regionalisation made on the architecture of global space governance, it seems essential to identify why and how the space regionalisation starts and their further expansion and fragmentation. As there is neither a single space hegemon power nor a unique global space regime which governs the space affairs alone, the start-up of space regionalisation with a group of neighboring countries in a predefined geographical area does not depend on a single actor, but on various factors from global, regional and national dimensions. These factors jointly trigger and boost the space regionalisation processes in different regions and subsequently make impacts on the consolidation of global space governance architecture. We note that the regionalization processes are sparked and fed by a mixture of numerous inputs from the intra- and extra-regional dimensions. In the intra-regional dimension, (1) the dynamics of regional astropolitics, (2) the quest for regional space capacity, and (3) the necessity for regional space governance; are the major inputs, which jointly simulate the processes of space regionalisation. In the extra-regional dimension, the inputs are generated from (1) extra-regional space powers’ stimulus, (2) inspiration from other regionalisation development (mirror effect), and (3) global regimes’ endorsements. Not an input alone but a mix of them results in the activation and the continued existence of the space regionalisation processes in different regions...|$|R

40|$|Subaqueous {{sediment}} density flows {{are one of}} the volumetrically {{most important}} processes for moving sediment across our planet, and form the largest sediment accumulations on Earth (submarine fans). They are also arguably the most sparely monitored major sediment transport processes on our planet. Significant advances have been made in documenting their timing and triggers, especially within submarine canyons and delta-fronts, and freshwater lakes and reservoirs, but the sediment concentration of flows that run out beyond the continental slope has never been measured directly. This limited amount of monitoring data contrasts sharply with other major types of sediment flow, such as river systems, and ensure that understanding submarine sediment density flows remains a major challenge for Earth science. The available monitoring data define a series of flow types whose character and deposits differ significantly. Large (> 100 km 3) failures on the continental slope can generate fast-moving (up to 19 m/s) flows that reach the deep ocean, and deposit thick layers of sand across submarine fans. Even small volume (0. 008 km 3) canyon head failures can sometimes generate channelised flows that travel at > 5 m/s for several hundred kilometres. A single event off SE Taiwan shows that river floods can generate powerful flows that reach the deep ocean, in this case triggered by failure of recently deposited sediment in the canyon head. Direct monitoring evidence of powerful oceanic flows produced by plunging hyperpycnal flood water is lacking, although this process has produced shorter and weaker oceanic flows. Numerous flows can occur each year on river-fed delta fronts, where they can generate up-slope migrating crescentic bedforms. These flows tend to occur during the flood season, but are not necessarily associated with individual flood discharge peaks, suggesting that they are often triggered by delta-front slope failures. Powerful flows occur several times each year in canyons fed by sand from the shelf, associated with strong wave action. These flows can also generate up-slope migrating crescentic bedforms that most likely originate due to retrogressive breaching associated with a dense near-bed layer of sediment. Expanded dilute flows that are supercritical and fully turbulent are also triggered by wave action in canyons. Sediment density flows in lakes and reservoirs generated by plunging river flood water have been monitored in much greater detail. They are typically very dilute (< 0. 01 vol. % sediment) and travel at < 50 cm/s, and are prone to generating <b>interflows</b> within the density stratified freshwater. A key objective for future work is to develop measurement techniques for seeing through overlying dilute clouds of sediment, to determine whether dense near-bed layers are present. There is also a need to combine monitoring of flows with detailed analyses of flow deposits, in order to understand how flows are recorded in the rock record. Finally, a source-to-sink approach is needed because the character of submarine flows can change significantly along their flow path...|$|R

The surveyed inner region of Bonavista Bay contains narrow, deep basins which commonly host four seismic units (A-D) above acoustic basement. [...] Glacial sediments are represented by seismic units 1 and A, {{both of which are}} acoustically incoherent. Unit 1 is generally < 15 ms thick and has a variable morphology. It is correlated with a stiff, sandy, gravelly mud (diamicton). Unit A is up to 110 ms thick and ponded. Units 2, B and C are proglacial sequences. Unit 2 is acoustically stratified, < 20 ms thick and has a draping basin-fill morphology. It is correlated with an interlaminated sequence of distal turbidites and hemipelagic/ice-rafted sediment. Unit B is acoustically transparent, ponded and up to 30 ms thick. It corresponds with a proglacial homogeneous silty mud, rapidly deposited under open water conditions until 12, 790 y BP (in Chandler Reach). Unit C, overlying B, is acoustically stratified, up to 90 ms thick and has a draping basin-fill morphology. It is correlated with a sandy, pebbly and shelly mud, deposited by hemipelagic, terrestrial and ice-rafted sedimentation from 12, 790 y BP to 10, 170 y BP. Seismic units 3 and D are acoustically transparent post-glacial sequences with an average thickness of 20 ms. They display a draping basin-fill morphology which has been altered by erosion and are correlated with a sandy, pebbly and shelly hemipelagic mud; initially deposited in the outer bay by 13, 500 y BP and in the inner bay by 10, 170 y BP (Chandler Reach). [...] Bonavista Bay was host to a grounded Late Wisconsinan ice sheet. Deglaciation of the bay was rapid and occurred at a time of rising sea level. Initially a thin basal till was deposited beneath grounded ice. With lift-off, an ice shelf formed over the basins of the outer bay. Retreat of the grounding line paused briefly on the basin margins, where discontinuous moraines were deposited. The ice sheet also became buoyant within the northeasternmost basin of the inner bay during this period. Diamictons (seismic units 1 and A) were subaqueously deposited within basins beneath the floating ice. Following ablation of the ice shelf, ice margins persisted near the SW and western regions of the outer bay, providing sediment for proglacial turbidity currents within the basins (unit 2). Geostrophic currents largely limited deposition of hemipelagic sediments to within the basins of the outer bay. [...] The basins of the inner bay were gradually deglaciated while unit 2 was deposited. Fine-grained outwash sediment (unit B), transported by <b>interflows,</b> was rapidly deposited as the ice margin retreated to a terrestrial position by at least 12, 790 y BP. The region of the inner bay remained under the influence of one or more ice margins until 10, 170 y BP, with ice at the position of an inland end moraine and probably on the Bonavista and Gander Peninsulas. Normal marine conditions were present in the outer bay by 13, 500 y BP and throughout the entire region by 10, 170 y BP. The Labrador Current has eroded Holocene and perhaps Wisconsinan sediments. [...] The deglacial sequence of events within Bonavista Bay and the sediments present, suggest that ice was channelized in the bay during the Late Wisconsinan, either at glacial maximum or during a deglacial surge which was driven by a collapsing ice cap from the SW...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{systematic}} development of mechanistic models of particulate processes {{for the purposes of}} nonlinear controller design and implementation. The methods investigated in this thesis were illustrated with an industrial hydrometallurgical process called the Silgrain® process (Elkem ASA), for which a model and a controller strategy have been developed from scratch. The class of processes studied in this thesis, particulate processes,has attracted and still attracts a great deal of interest from the international research community. Particulate processes are characterized by the presence of a continuous phase and a dispersed phase comprised of entities that have a distribution of properties. Such a distribution of properties has an important impact on the process operation and quality of the final products. Moreover, most of process industries contain one or more stages that involve particulate processes, among them the major Norwegian companies: Elkem, Hydro, Borealis, Statoil, etc. A systematic method to PBE modeling was suggested, consisting of the following stages: establishment of model purpose and model foundations, building of the model structure, determination of the constitutive relations, selection of a solution method, parameter estimation and model validation. Such an approach is general to any type of process, but when dealing with particulate processes special care should be placed on some of these stages. The method was thoroughly illustrated with the development of the model of the tworeactors of the Silgrain® process. The model was based on the traditional balance equations of mass, energy, and momentum, and on a balance of the distribution of properties, called the population balance equation (PBE). This is the first time PBE is used to model a hydrometallurgical leaching reactor where disintegration takes place. An experimental laboratory campaign had to be carried out {{in order to determine the}} constitutive equations of the disintegration event. Another experimental campaign at the plant level was carried out to gather data for parameter estimation and model validation. The results of the fitting were satisfactory. Besides the particular contribution of developing a detailed model for the case study, some general contributions of this research were: • it was shown how dividing the model into compartments according to the regions that are observed in practice in the reactors is key to obtaining realistic models; • it was discussed how the widely used assumption of complete mixing provides unrealistic models. Instead, the compartmentalization approach combined with a balance of forces on the entities to define the <b>interflows</b> among compartments improves the realism of PBE models to a great extent; • it was shown that the use of a systematic parameter identifiability analysis prior to parameter estimation can be very useful, and even essential. PBE models are large in size, typically nonlinear in the parameters, and many parameters may not be identifiable from theavailable measurements. Hence, if no parameter identifiability analysis is carried out, the parameter estimation algorithm may break down, or give very poor parameter estimates. An approach to process control called inventory passivity-based control was selected in this thesis, since this method handles nonlinear processes, is based on dynamic models, and it has suitable stability properties. In order to apply this method to particulate processes, the theory was extended in this thesis to handle rectangular systems, i. e. systems where the number of available manipulated variables is less than the number of inventories. Both chemical reaction networks and particulate processes fall under such a class of systems. An stability proof has been developed, by linking inventory passivity-based control to a relevant theory of nonlinear chemical dynamics, called the Feinberg Deficiency Theorems. In addition to stability, some other implementation issues were discussed in the thesis, such as the handling of constraints on the manipulated variables, the robustness of the controller against disturbances and model errors, the importance of observers, and the adaptation of the approach to semibatch control. Finally, the thesis also discussed the role of inventory passivity-based control within the framework of plantwide control, and the integration of inventory passivity-based control with a statistical process monitoring approach.
