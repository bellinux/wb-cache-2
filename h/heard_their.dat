5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E

5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E

25|$|In the Argonautica (third century BC), Jason {{had been}} warned by Chiron that Orpheus would be {{necessary}} in his journey.

25|$|According to Ovid (43 BC–17 AD), the Sirens {{were the}} companions of young Persephone. They were given wings by Demeter {{to search for}} Persephone when she was abducted. However, the Fabulae of Hyginus (64 BC–17 AD) has Demeter cursing the Sirens for failing to {{intervene}} in the abduction of Persephone. According to Hyginus, sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> songs were able to pass by them.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 Quon, his ex-wife, {{girlfriend and}} another officer, Steve Trujillo, sued the city, the department, {{the police chief}} and Arch in Central California U.S. {{district}} court, Eastern Division, in Riverside.

25|$|Apple's music {{publishing}} arm predated even the record company. In September 1967, the first artistes {{to be signed}} by Apple Publishing were two songwriters from Liverpool. Paul Tennant and David Rhodes were offered a contract after meeting McCartney in Hyde Park.

Epstein was to have managed the band but died before he could become involved. Terry Doran MD of Apple Publishing became their manager and they were signed by Deram Records. Apple published the group's self-penned songs from early 1968. Another early band on its publishing roster was the group Grapefruit.|$|E
25|$|In his memoirs, Slonim {{claims to}} have {{foreseen}} the danger posed by the reorganized Bolsheviks, having <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> leader, Vladimir Lenin, speak. He contrasts Bolshevik unity with the Esers' indecisiveness and factionalism. He was still active after the October Revolution, which placed Russia under a Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars. Slonim became an Eser candidate for the Russian Constituent Assembly in the November 25 election, running in the southwestern province of Bessarabia. He took his seat in the Eser landslide win, and, aged 23, was the youngest parliamentarian. Days after, Bessarabia formed its own government as the Moldavian Democratic Republic, and remained undecided about its future within the Russian Republic. The elections for the Constituent Assembly were chaotic, {{and the results were}} never fully recorded.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September 2011, Justice Johnson Lam of the Court of First Instance of the High Court (CFI) {{ruled in}} Vallejos' case that {{existing}} legislation restricting FDHs from qualifying for permanent residence contravened the Hong Kong Basic Law.

The Court of Appeal of the High Court overturned the CFI's decision on Vallejos' case on 28 March 2012.

25|$|The {{party was}} {{the brainchild of}} a group of discontented Western {{interest}} groups who were upset with the PC government and the lack of a voice for Western concerns at the national level. Leading figures in this movement included Ted Byfield, Stan Roberts, Francis Winspear, and Preston Manning. A major intellectual impetus at the time was provided by Peter Brimelow's 1986 book, The Patriot Game. They believed the West needed its own party if it was to be <b>heard.</b> <b>Their</b> main complaints against the Mulroney government were its alleged favouritism towards Quebec, lack of fiscal responsibility, and a failure to support a program of institutional reform (for example, of the Senate). The roots of this discontent lay mainly in their belief that a package of proposed constitutional amendments, called the Meech Lake Accord, failed {{to meet the needs of}} Westerners and Canadian unity overall.|$|E
25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} {{the cries of}} the hungry people and by the other deities who also <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
25|$|By August {{they had}} signed a two-EP {{distribution}} deal with EMI Music in Australia and independent label Independiente Records in the United Kingdom and relocated to London. On 26 August that year the six-track EP was officially released by EMI Music with Ian Prichett (The Beautiful Girls) producing. While in the UK, they were invited into Chris Potter's studio (The Verve, Richard Ashcroft) to record. Fran Healy from UK band Travis had also <b>heard</b> <b>their</b> debut EP and invited them to his house to record. The result of these two matchups was the duo's second EP, Heart Full of Wine, which also had six tracks, appeared on 3 February 2007. Again Connelly provided drums and percussion, but on bass guitar was James Perryman and on cello was Bethany Porter – both Angus and Julia also played harmonica. At the end of 2006, the duo signed a worldwide publishing deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Creative Artists Agency came on board as their UK-European agent.|$|E
