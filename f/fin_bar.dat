50|$|The yellowface {{angelfish}} {{grows to}} a maximum length of 38 cm and is laterally compressed. The mouth is just above {{the tip of the}} snout. The fins are large and rounded and are yellow, some edged with blue round the margins. The dorsal fin is set {{just in front of the}} caudal region, has a distinctive black eyespot at the base and has 13-14 spines and 16-18 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 16-18 soft rays. The scales are pale blue edged with yellow giving a reticulated pattern. The face is yellow with a dense network of brilliant blue lines on the bottom half and a plain yellow mask around the eyes. Juveniles are quite differently coloured with 6 vertical white bars separated by pale blue lines and a caudal <b>fin</b> <b>barred</b> in 2 shades of blue. The juveniles change colour gradually after reaching a length of 7 to 12 cm. This species can be confused with the queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris) or the blue angelfish (Holacanthus bermudensis), but both these have a completely blue face and lack the caudal eyespot.|$|R

50|$|Morrison's {{dragonet}} {{is a small}} fish, with {{a maximum}} recorded size of about 7 cm. Soft dorsal rays branched. In males the first dorsal fin is much taller than the second, and in females it is shorter. Colour is a mottled red with variably sizes white spots and a dark brown blotch covering {{at least half of}} the base of the pectoral.

25|$|The {{bar jack}} has a gray to grayish blue upper {{body with a}} silvery tint, which fades ventrally to a white belly. As {{indicated}} by their common name, adult bar jack have a horizontal stripe running along their back and through the lower lobe of the caudal <b>fin.</b> This <b>bar</b> is a golden brownish to blackish color, often with an electric blue bar running parallel immediately underneath it. All other fins are pale dusky to hyaline. Juveniles have up to 6 dark bands on their body and a darker lower caudal lobe than the upper lobe, foreshadowing the bar that develops at a later stage. At these early stages, they are difficult to distinguish from Carangoides bartholomaei, with the best identifier being gill raker counts. The entire body has been observed to change colour to a blackish colour when the fish is feeding near the bottom.|$|R
50|$|A. omanensis has a forked {{caudal fin}} however its pelvic and anal fins {{are black and}} the mid bar is much narrower. The forked caudal fin {{distinguish}}es A. latifasciatus from A. allardi, A. bicinctus, A. chrysopterus and A. clarkii. The wide mid-body bar of A. latifasciatus also helps to distinguish it from these species. A. allardi, A. bicinctus and A. chrysopterus can also be distinguished by their white caudal fin. The wide color variation of A. clarkii {{makes it more difficult}} to distinguish by color alone, although the presence of a white caudal <b>fin</b> or white <b>bar</b> {{at the base of the}} caudal fin indicates the fish is not A. latifasciatus.|$|R
40|$|Panaqolus tankei is {{described}} from the Xingu River, Brazil. The new species is diagnosed from P. albomaculatus, P. dentex, P. nix, P. nocturnus, and P. koko by its color pattern consisting of {{dark and light}} diagonal bars on the body and bands on the fins (vs. body and <b>fins</b> without <b>bars</b> or bands); from P. albivermis, P. maccus, and P. purusiensis by {{the width of the}} dark bars being {{more or less the same}} of the light bars (vs. dark bars at least two or three times wider than light bars) and from P. changae by the absence of vermiculation on the head (vs. vermiculation present on head). The new species differs from P. gnomus by the orientation of the bars from posterodorsal to anteroventral direction (vs. anterodorsal to posteroventral direction), and from P. claustellifer by the orientation of the bands in the dorsal fin that are not parallel to the margin (vs. parallel to the margin). The barcoding region (COI) was sequenced for the new species, sequences were deposited in GenBank and were compared with congeners from other drainages. With regard to the current construction of a hydroelectric power plant (a so-called mega dam) in the Xingu River, herewith we increase knowledge of the river Xingu's ichthyofauna and, thus improve the assessment of the impacts of that construction on the river...|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} banded archerfish is oblong {{in shape}} and raised on the {{posterior}} side. The body is generally silver-white in colour, though varying colourations, such as yellow, have been observed. Four to six broad black bars may be present on the dorsal side. The first bar is found anterior to the operculum, the bony plate covering the gills, {{and the second is}} found behind the operculum. The third bar is found below the origin of the dorsal <b>fin,</b> the fourth <b>bar</b> below the soft dorsal, and the fifth (if any) on the area between the anal fin and caudal fin (caudal peduncle).

40|$|Schistura sirindhornae, a {{new species}} of nemacheilid, is {{described}} from the Nan River basin in northern Thailand. It is distinguished from all other species of Schistura in having overlapping scales on the entire body similar to scales of balitorids, transparent scales on the belly and thorax, a lateral-line canal {{that is similar to}} that of most cyprinids and balitorids in being present across the entire lateral-line surface of the scale instead of being represented only by a pore. It also has a unique color pattern of irregular brown bars on the back and side of the faint yellow-orange body, a bright triangular orange mark on the occiput, an orange crown-shaped mark between the eyes, an uninterrupted black mark along the base of the dorsal <b>fin,</b> a crescent-shaped <b>bar</b> on the base of the caudal fin, and bright iridescent orange areas on the upper and lower extremities of the caudal-fin base.

50|$|Adults are mottled dark greyish, {{brown or}} grey-green with {{seven or eight}} {{irregular}} darker red and green bars extending in some cases obliquely onto {{the base of the}} dorsal. There is a narrow dark band at base of caudal, and a dark patch on nape. The head is spotted. There are dark spots on anal, pectoral and caudal, fewer on dorsal. There is a curved dark line near base of the caudal fin. Occasionally there are irregular reddish blotches on dorsal (males), and a reddish tinge on posterior margin of opercle. Sometimes a black spot appears on the membrane {{between the first and second}} dorsal spines. Occasional specimens have a pinkish or milky ground colour with darker pink bars, or a vermilion ground colour with dark brown <b>bars.</b> <b>Fins</b> are dark and irregularly barred. There is a characteristic translucent area in the membrane joining the dorsal soft rays. The belly is silvery white to greyish. There is sometimes a sprinkling of white spots over the body. The head has an irregular lacy pattern in the body colours, or is plain dark grey. There is usually a light-edged dark ocellate spot on the shoulder.|$|R
500|$|The {{body of the}} bowfin is {{elongated}} and cylindrical, {{with the}} sides and back olive to brown in color, often with vertical bars, and dark reticulations, or camouflaged pattern. The dorsal <b>fin</b> has horizontal <b>bars,</b> and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars. [...] The underside is white or cream, and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green. [...] During larval stage, hatchlings from about [...] total length are black and tadpole-like in appearance. [...] At approximately [...] total length they {{have been described as}} looking like miniature placoderms. [...] They grow quickly, and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching. Young males have a black eyespot on the base of the tail (caudal peduncle) that is commonly encircled by an orange-yellowish border while the female's is black, if present at all. [...] It is thought the purpose of the eyespot is to confuse predators, deflecting attacks away from the head of the fish to its tail, which affords the bowfin an opportunity to escape predation. The bowfin is so named for its long, undulating dorsal fin consisting of 145 to 250 rays, and running {{from the middle of the}} back to the base of the tail.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Visually guided motor {{behavior}} {{is assumed to}} be rather unreceptive to size illusions, indicating two different cortical processing streams for the purposes of perception and action (e. g., Aglioti, DeSouza Goodale, 1995; Current Biology 5, 679 - 685). Having shown - in contrary - that grasping and perception are equally influenced by the Ebbinghaus / Titchener Illusion (ECVP 98), we tested whether this is also true for the Mueller-Lyer Illusion. METHODS: Plastic bars (40, 43, 46 and 49 mm long, 5 mm wide) were positioned on top of a horizontally oriented monitor. Fins were presented on the monitor being directed either outwards or inwards, such that the <b>fins</b> and the <b>bars</b> resulted in the Mueller-Lyer Illusion. In the grasping task, twelve subjects grasped the bars and the maximal aperture between thumb and index finger was measured using an Optotrak (TM) system. In the visual perception task, the subjects adjusted the length of a comparison bar on the screen to match the length of the plastic bars. RESULTS: There were strong effects of the Mueller-Lyer Illusion on grasping as well as on visual perception. The effect on grasping (3. 5 +- 0. 5 mm) was even larger than on perception (2. 1 +- 0. 3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that grasping is influenced by visual illusions, indicating that the motor system is receptive to visual illusions...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Upper Cretaceous to Eocene Montgomery Creek Formation {{is exposed}} between the Klamath and Cascade Mountains in the {{vicinity}} of Big Bend and Montgomery Creek, northern California. The formation is divided into a northern and a southern section. The rocks consist of a basal conglomerate succeeded by feldspathic to lithic graywackes, conglomerates, shales, carbonaceous shales, and minor lignites. The northern section is 3, 188 feet thick. <b>Fining</b> upward point <b>bar</b> deposits, abundant foreset- and cross-bedding, and thick flood-basin deposits indicate the northen section strata were deposited by meandering rivers. Carbonaceous shales, lignites and fossil leaves define the swamps that were present in the basins. The southern section is 4, 596 feet thick. Thick and laterally extensive sandstone bodies, numerous conglomerate interbeds, and abundant planar cross-bedding suggest that these strata were deposited by braided rivers. A few outcrops low in the section resemble the northern section strata, and are interpreted to be meandering river deposits. A progressive change in composition of the sandstones from the base {{to the top of the}} formation occurs in both the northern and southern sections. This reflects the change from metamorphic and plutonic source rocks of the Klamath Mountains to volcanic source rocks of the early Cascade Range. The southern section maintains a more lithic-rich composition, reflecting higher discharge rates and steeper gradients responsible for braided-river deposition. Paleocurrent readings from foreset bedding and imbricated pebbles indicate a north-to-south transport direction in most of both sections. Some westerly transport occurred high in the southern section. Eocene strata four miles north of the northern section reflect a meandering river depositional environment. These strata have a higher shale-to-sandstone ratio, larger proportions of carbonaceous shales and coal, and a different sandstone mineralogy than Eocene rocks to the south. Analysis revealed that the Montgomery Creek Formation carbonaceous shales and coal are sufficiently rich in organic carbon to be hydrocarbon source rocks. Most of the samples are thermally immature, but could produce gas through bacterial-fungal breakdown of organic matter. The Eocene sandstones have adequate porosity and permeability to be petroleum reservoir rocks. The Klamath Mountains acted as a source area for Cretaceous marine deposits in basins north and south of the study area. Either the Cretaceous seas did not transgress into the study area, or such deposits were subsequently removed by erosion...|$|R
