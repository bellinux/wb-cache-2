It {{is based on}} the concept that some pieces of music can or will harm either the listener or the performer.

For example, Takehisa Kosugi's composition Music for a Revolution directs the performer to gouge out one of his or her eyes <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Works such as this are also sometimes referred to as anti-music because they seem to rebel against the concept of music itself.

40|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} {{greenhouse}} gases and control climate change implicate {{a wide range}} of social, moral, economic, and political issues, none of them simple or clear. But when regulators evaluate the desirability of climate change mitigation through cost-benefit analysis, one factor typically determines whether mitigation is justified: the discount rate, the rate at which future benefits are converted to their present value. Even low discount rates make the value of future benefits close to worthless: at a discount rate of three percent, ten million dollars <b>five</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> is worth thirty-eight cents today – that is more than we {{would be willing to pay}} now to save a life than under a standard cost-benefit analysis.

This Article evaluates the four principal justifications for intergenerational discounting, which often are conflated in the literature. It shows that none of these justifications supports the prevalent approach of discounting benefits to future generations at the rate of return in financial markets and, more generally, that discounting cannot substitute for a moral theory setting forth our obligations to future generations...|$|R

A wavelength routed wavelength division multiplexed optical network based on either transparent or opaque node architectures was examined considering exclusively either 10 Gbit/s or 40 Gbit/s per channel data rates. The results manifest that transparent optical networking technologies are expected to provide significant energy savings of the order of 35 % to 55 %.

It is suggested that good accuracy for station coordinates can be expected, even with the present gravity field model uncertainties, if sufficient measurement accuracy is achieved at a reasonable distribution of stations.
