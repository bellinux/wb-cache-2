Additional caution is required in critically <b>ill</b> <b>patients,</b> as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|The {{half-life}} of cTnI {{in adult}} cardiomyocytes {{is estimated to}} be ~3.2 days and there is a pool of unassembled cardiac TnI in the cytoplasm. Cardiac TnI is exclusively expressed in the myocardium and is thus a highly specific diagnostic marker for cardiac muscle injuries, and cTnI has been universally used as indicator for myocardial infarction. An increased level of serum cTnI also independently predicts poor prognosis of critically <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> in the absence of acute coronary syndrome.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} {{intensive}} care nurse is to give quality nursing to the critically <b>ill</b> surgical <b>patient</b> {{within the context of}} the family, as set out in her scope of practice.

The persons close to the critically <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> and the intensive care nurse form part of the patient's social external environment.

The study is done by means of an exploratory, descriptive and contextual design by using the phenomenological method of interviewing.

5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency medical system that transported patients.

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E

5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). This {{involves the use of}} endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E

30|$|Statins have {{beneficial}} effects on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes and are generally well tolerated in stable outpatients. Despite the possible {{beneficial effects}} noted {{in this work}} in patients with sepsis, statins may have adverse effects which could complicate their use, especially in the critically <b>ill</b> <b>patient.</b> Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy are known complications of statin use. Statins are metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 system in the liver, and liver disease, a common occurrence in the critically ill, affects the metabolism of these agents and {{increases the risk of}} muscle disease [32]. Food intake has a variable effect on statin bioavailability, which may have important consequences in the critically <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> that is unable to receive oral nutrition [32]. Statins are highly protein bound, a fact that may well be important in the critically <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> [32]. Interruption of chronic outpatient therapy in a critically <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> could lead to augmentation of cardiovascular risk [14]. We did not have specific information concerning potential adverse effects from statins, including cause-specific mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, which limits our study in recommendations concerning statin utility in sepsis.|$|R
