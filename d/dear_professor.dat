40|$|Abstract Since {{education}} {{is affected by}} technological developments, more than anything else, it needs to equip itself to the latest technologies. In this research, {{we have reviewed the}} reasons of disagreements in choosing technology in accounting educations in MA and PHD courses. This research which is an applied survey research is performed through choosing 11 different technologies and sending questionnaire to two groups of professors in MA and PHD courses of state and Azad universities, then by using this information we analyzed the results. The measurement tool in this research has been questionnaire, and research population has been the professors of MA and PHD of accounting course in state, Azad, Payam-Noor and nonprofit universities of Iran. Statistical method of this research is t test. The results indicate that there is a significant difference between uses of above mentioned cases between two groups of accounting professors of MA and PHD courses of state and Azad universities. Practical solution to cover this gap is to use more information technology in accounting education, in order {{to improve the quality of}} education by <b>dear</b> <b>professors</b> in one side, and the affairs of students in learning modern technologies and applying them practically in another side...|$|R

6000|$|Now {{speaking}} seriously, my <b>dear</b> <b>Professor,</b> it {{will not}} do. It could be easy to fence with you for ever and parry every point you attempt to make, until English people began to think {{there was nothing wrong}} with England at all. But I refuse to play for safety in this way. There is a very great deal that is really wrong with England, and it ought not to be forgotten even in the full blaze of your marvellous mistakes. I cannot have my countrymen tempted to those pleasures of intellectual pride which are the result of comparing themselves with you. The deep collapse and yawning chasm of your ineptitude leaves me upon a perilous spiritual elevation. Your mistakes are matters of fact; but to enumerate them does not exhaust the truth. For instance, the learned man who rendered the phrase in an English advertisement [...] "cut you dead" [...] as [...] "hack you to death," [...] was in error; but to say that many such advertisements are vulgar is not an error. Again, it is true that the English poor are harried and insecure, with insufficient instinct for armed revolt, though you will be wrong if you say that they are occupied literally in shooting the moon. It is true that the average Englishman is too much attracted by aristocratic society; though you will be in error if you quote dining with Duke Humphrey as an example of it. In more ways than one you forget what is meant by idiom.|$|E
60|$|Through {{neglect of}} these maxims, my <b>dear</b> <b>Professor,</b> {{every one of}} your attacks upon England has gone wide. In pure fact they have not touched the spot, which the real critics of England know {{to be a very}} {{vulnerable}} spot. We have a real critic of England in Mr. Bernard Shaw, whose name you parade but apparently cannot spell; for in the paper to which I have referred he is called Mr. Bernhard Shaw. Perhaps you think he and Bernhardi are the same man. But if you quoted Mr. Bernard Shaw's statement instead of misquoting his name, you would find that his criticism of England is exactly the opposite of your own; and naturally, for it is a rational criticism. He does not blame England for being against Germany. He does most definitely blame England for not being sufficiently firmly and emphatically on the side of Russia. He is not such a fool as to accuse Sir Edward Grey of being a fiendish Machiavelli plotting against Germany; he accuses him of being an amiable aristocratic stick who failed to frighten the Junkers from their plan of war. Now, it is not in the least a question of whether we happen to like this quality or that: Mr. Shaw, I rather fancy, would dislike such verbose compromise more than downright plotting. It is simply the fact that Englishmen like Grey are open to Mr. Shaw's attack and are not open to yours. It is not true that the English were sufficiently clearheaded or self-controlled to conspire for the destruction of Germany. Any man who knows England, any man who hates England as one hates a living thing, will tell you it is not true. The English may be snobs, they may be plutocrats, they may be hypocrites, but they are not, as a fact, plotters; and I gravely doubt whether they could be if they wanted to. The mass of the people are perfectly incapable of plotting at all, and if the small ring of rich people who finance our politics were plotting for anything, it was for peace at almost any price. Any Londoner who knows the London streets and newspapers as he knows the Nelson column or the Inner Circle, knows that there were men in the governing class and in the Cabinet who were literally thirsting to defend Germany until Germany, by her own act, became indefensible. If they said nothing in support of the tearing up of the promise of peace to Belgium, it is simply because {{there was nothing to be}} said.|$|E
60|$|First, {{stick to}} one excuse. Thus if a tradesman, with whom your social {{relations}} are slight, should {{chance to find}} you toying with the coppers in his till, you may possibly explain that {{you are interested in}} Numismatics and are a Collector of Coins; and he may possibly believe you. But if you tell him afterwards that you pitied him for being overloaded with unwieldy copper discs, and were in the act of replacing them by a silver sixpence of your own, this further explanation, so far from increasing his confidence in your motives, will (strangely enough) actually decrease it. And if you are so unwise as to be struck by yet another brilliant idea, and tell him that the pennies were all bad pennies, which you were concealing to save him from a police prosecution for coining, the tradesman may even be so wayward as to institute a police prosecution himself. Now this is not in any way an exaggeration {{of the way in which}} you have knocked the bottom out of any case you may ever conceivably have had in such matters as the sinking of the Lusitania. With my own eyes I have seen the following explanations, apparently proceeding from your pen, (i) that the ship was a troop-ship carrying soldiers from Canada; (ii) that if it wasn't, it was a merchant-ship unlawfully carrying munitions for the soldiers in France; (iii) that, as the passengers on the ship had been warned in an advertisement, Germany was justified in blowing them to the moon; (iv) that there were guns, and the ship had to be torpedoed because the English captain was just going to fire them off; (v) that the English or American authorities, by throwing the Lusitania at the heads of the German commanders, subjected them to an insupportable temptation; which was apparently somehow demonstrated or intensified by the fact that the ship came up to schedule time, there being some mysterious principle by which having tea at tea-time justifies poisoning the tea; (vi) that the ship was not sunk by the Germans at all but by the English, the English captain having deliberately tried to drown himself and some thousand of his own countrymen in order to cause an exchange of stiff notes between Mr. Wilson and the Kaiser. If this interesting story be true, I can only say that such frantic and suicidal devotion to the most remote interests of his country almost earns the captain pardon for the crime. But do you not see, my <b>dear</b> <b>Professor,</b> that the very richness and variety of your inventive genius throws a doubt upon each explanation when considered in itself? We who read you in England reach a condition of mind in which it no longer very much matters what explanation you offer, or whether you offer any at all. We are prepared to hear that you sank the Lusitania because the sea-born sons of England would live more happily as deep-sea fishes, or that every person on board was coming home to be hanged. You have explained yourself so completely, in this clear way, to the Italians that they have declared war on you, and if you go on explaining yourself so clearly to the Americans they may quite possibly do the same.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the <b>dear</b> memory of <b>Professor</b> Fokko du Cloux. Abstract. In this paper we formulate a conjecture about the unitary dual of the metaplectic group. We prove this conjecture for the case of Mp(4,R). The result is a strengthening, for this case, of the following result by the third author: any unitary representation of a real reductive Lie group with strongly regular infinitesimal character can be obtained by cohomological induction from a one dimensional representation. Strongly regular representations are those whose infinitesimal character is at least as regular as that of the trivial representation. We are extending the result to representations with omegaregular infinitesimal character: those whose infinitesimal character is at least as regular as that of the oscillator representation. The proof relies heavily on Parthasarathy’s Dirac operator inequality. In one exception we explicitly calculate the signature of an intertwining operator to establish nonunitarity. Some of the results on intertwining operators presented in section 5. 2 are joint work of Dan M. Barbasch and the first author...|$|R
