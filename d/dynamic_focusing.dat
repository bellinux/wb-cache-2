50|$|One typical {{implementation}} of the SAU is the one proposed by Jensen. In his model, only one array element in the transducer is used each time to emit a nearly spherical wave that will cover the whole region of interest. All elements are used to receive the back-scattered signal at the same time, obtaining a low-resolution for each firing. The back-scattered signal contains information required to form the image in all directions and the specific direction can be acquired by applying different delays to signals received by different elements, thus this process works as <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing</b> at the receiver. By summing all the low-resolution images acquired each time with a determined weight, the final high resolution image is formed and <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing</b> at transmission is synthesized.|$|E
50|$|The {{important}} {{advantage of}} SAU {{is its ability}} to achieve <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing</b> at both transmission and reception without repeating the transmission process with all array elements for each focal zone, thus it saves large computational requirements for delay-and-sum beamforming and leaves space for increasing the frame rate. Also the single transmission and receiving requirement for each firing significantly reduces the hardware complexity for system implementations.|$|E
50|$|The {{bi-directional}} pixel-based focusing (BiPBF) {{method was}} proposed {{to solve the}} problem that SAU imaging suffers from low SNR as the transmission is done by {{a small part of the}} array. In BiPBF, the same firing sequence is used in the transmission process as in the traditional array imaging, but the radio frequency (RF) data collected using adjacent groups of array elements are compounded in the receive process. The pixel-based time delays used for compounding are calculated using the distances between pixels and virtual sources located at the successive lateral positions of the transmission focus. Experiments have been done in both phantom and in-vivo experiments; the image quality of the SAU-BiPBF method was considerably improved compared to imaging by conventional <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Set in 1490, {{only two}} years before the arrival of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, the comic follows the life of a Taíno yucayeque or village in the island of Borikén (Puerto Rico). Among them {{was a member of the}} worker naboría class named Turey, who despite being {{significantly}} shorter than his counterparts, dreamed of becoming a member of cacique Yaguaca's royal guard. The series also follows the exploits of his family, particularly his wife Yaya and his son Tureycito, as well as his finds and other members of the village. Eventually, Turey's courage earned him the respect of his yucayeque. In its different issues, Álvarez Rivón covers different aspects of Taíno culture, ranging from their complete reliance on nature to their territorial disputes with the neighboring Carib tribes. However, these aspects are included as part of a larger story, which in turn balance its educational content with entertainment. After its third issue, the stories ended with a moral message authored by Meléndez. Each issue introduced new words from the Taíno language, with their meaning being discussed in detail in a section titled Vocabulario Taíno (lit. [...] "Taíno Vocabulary") included towards the end of each magazine. The newspaper strips relaxed this <b>dynamic,</b> <b>focusing</b> on a humorous approach that sometimes bordered on the absurd, surreal or hypothetical. From 2000 onwards, Turey was more often depicted in large single-panel strips depicting his reaction when placed in contemporary situations or historical events, a change based on the editorial decisions of El Nuevo Día's staff.|$|E

The first experiment examined the impact of the quantification of the root concept in the map. The second experiment explored the effect of the focus question of the map.

The results showed that the quantification of the root concept and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>focus</b> question “how ” significantly increased dynamic thinking. In addition, the focus question affected the selection of concepts used in the maps and how those concepts were used.

40|$|The Synthetic Aperture Focusing (SAF) {{technique}} {{makes it}} possible to achieve a higher and more uniform quality of ultrasound images throughout depth, as if both transmit and receive <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing</b> were applied. In this work we combine a particular implementation of SAF, called Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) technique, in which a single element in turn transmits and all the array elements receive the ultrasound wave, with the Filtered-Delay Multiply and Sum (F-DMAS) non-linear beamforming algorithm that we presented in a previous paper. We show that using F-DMAS, which is based on a measure of backscattered signal spatial correlation, B-mode images have a higher contrast resolution but suffer from a loss of brightness away from the transmit focus, when a classical scan with receive-only <b>dynamic</b> <b>focusing</b> is performed. On the other hand, when synthetic transmit focusing is achieved by implementing STA, such a loss is compensated for and a higher depth of field is obtained, as signal coherence improves. A drawback of SAF/STA however is the reduced signal-to-noise ratio, due to single-element transmission; in the paper we also analyze how this influences F-DMAS images. Finally, a preliminary investigation {{on the use of the}} classical monostatic SAF technique with F-DMAS beamforming is also carried out to evaluate its potential performances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effective}} use of concept maps in education has been limited by a generalized tendency amongst learners to construct descriptive concept maps, characterized primarily by static propositions. Adequate representation of knowledge, however, calls for both description and explanation, that is, {{a combination of both}} static and dynamic propositions. This is especially true of scientific and mathematical reasoning, where dynamic relationships are necessary to establish interdependencies and covariation among two or more concepts. Experiments have shown that <b>dynamic</b> <b>focus</b> questions significantly increase the presence of dynamic propositions in concept maps. The results presented in this paper confirm this finding, and suggest further that the two vary in direct proportion to one another, that is the more open and <b>dynamic</b> the <b>focus</b> question, the more dynamic the resulting propositions. ...|$|R
