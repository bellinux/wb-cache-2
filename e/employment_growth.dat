25|$|The {{population}} of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and Rother district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and <b>employment</b> <b>growth</b> within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades. This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} debate, however, around liberalisation as an inclusive economic growth strategy. Since 1992, income inequality has deepened in India with consumption among the poorest staying stable while the wealthiest generate consumption growth. As India's {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) growth rate became lowest in 2012–13 over a decade, growing merely at 5.1%, more criticism of India's economic reforms surfaced, as it apparently failed to address <b>employment</b> <b>growth,</b> nutritional values in terms of food intake in calories, and also exports growth – and thereby leading to a worsening level of current account deficit compared to the prior to the reform period. But then in FY 2013–14 the growth rebounded to 6.9% and then in 2014–15 it rose to 7.3% {{as a result of}} the reforms put by the New Government which led to the economy becoming healthy again and the current account deficit coming in control. Growth reached 7.5% in the Jan–Mar quarter of 2015 before slowing to 7.0% in Apr–Jun quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Relief Line is to help reduce current and {{projected}} congestion in downtown Toronto. In 2012, it was becoming apparent to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and Metrolinx that even with proposed improvements, the Yonge line and Bloor–Yonge station was facing significant capacity constraints. , the Yonge line operates 11% over its capacity south of Line 2 during the morning rush hour. The new Toronto Rocket trains operating on the line, and the future implementation of Automatic Train Control will help increase {{the capacity of the}} Yonge line. Other factors are expected to reduce demand such as the extension of the University–Spadina portion of Line 1 into Vaughan, and other local transit improvements. However, after factoring in population and <b>employment</b> <b>growth</b> and the proposed extension of the Yonge line into Richmond Hill, the Yonge line is projected to be at 96% of its capacity by 2031. The Relief Line will provide an alternate route for commuters heading downtown by allowing them to bypass the congested Yonge line and avoid transferring at Bloor–Yonge Station.|$|E
25|$|John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport is {{the busiest}} air cargo hub {{in the country}} and as well the fastest growing airport in Canada. Originally, in the 1940s the airport was used as a wartime air force {{training}} station. Today TradePort International Corporation manages and operates the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport. Under TradePort management, passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has increased from 90,000 in 1996 to approx. 900,000 in 2002, and has grown dramatically since then. The airport's mid-term target for growth in its passenger service is five million air-travelers annually. Air cargo has increased by 50% since 1996; 91,000 metric tonnes (100,000tons) of cargo passed through the airport in 2002. Hamilton's air cargo success is due to its 24-7 operational capability and strategic geographic location. Courier companies with operations at the airport include United Parcel Service and Cargojet Canada. In 2003, the city began developing a 30-year growth management strategy which called, in part, for a massive aerotropolis industrial park centred around Hamilton Airport. The aerotropolis proposal, now known as the Airport <b>Employment</b> <b>Growth</b> District, is touted as a solution to the city's shortage of employment lands. Hamilton turned over operation of the airport to TradePort International Corp. in 1996. In 2007 YVR Airport Services (YVRAS), which runs the Vancouver International Airport, took over 100 per cent ownership of TradePort in a $13-million deal. In 2008 Citigroup Inc., one of the world's largest financial institutions, invested in 50 per cent of YVRAS, the owner of TradePort, which runs Hamilton airport. The airport is also home to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum.|$|E

The arrival of the ICR in Moncton was a seminal event for the community. For the next 120years, the history of the city would be firmly linked with that of the railway. In 1875, Moncton was able to reincorporate as a town and adopted the motto [...] "Resurgo" [...] (Latin for I rise again). One year later, the ICR line to Quebec was opened.

40|$|Europe {{is faced}} with serious {{problems}} of slow <b>growth</b> and little <b>employment</b> creation. Are the two problems related at all? Our proposed answer is: yes, they are. Building on Daveri and Tabellini (1997), we developed an infinite-horizon model with endogenous growth due to learning-by-doing and unemployment due to monopoly union bargaining in the labor market. In this framework, high labor and capital taxes and unemployment subsidies may in principle reduce <b>employment</b> and <b>growth.</b> The model is then calibrated using actual data {{from a variety of}} countries in Continental Europe, which we identify as the closest to our toy model. We run two types of balanced-budget fiscal policy experiments, focusing on their <b>employment</b> and <b>growth</b> effects. First, we separately change tax rates on capital, labor and subsidies, as well as replacement rates, while assuming that the government budget is kept balanced by appropriate changes in lump-sum trasnfers. Second, we cut labor taxes and adjust capital taxes {{in order to keep the}} GDP share of lump-sum transfers unchanged. Our numerical results suggest that, in the absence of binding revenue constraints, reducing labor taxes and unemployment subsidies is beneficial to both <b>employment</b> and <b>growth,</b> while capital taxes are less useful. f revenue constraints are binding, instead, cutting labor taxes is in general ineffective in boosting <b>employment</b> and <b>growth.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|The JG {{introduces}} no relative wage {{effects and}} the rising demand per se does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire {{of the private sector}} (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today’s demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase capacity utilisation to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any demand-pull inflation it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand will stimulate private sector <b>employment</b> <b>growth</b> while reducing JG employment and spending. [...] However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.|$|E
