3000|$|With PAN {{solutions}} in DMAc and PVP K 90 {{solutions in}} ethanol {{as the model}} working fluids, elevated temperature electrospinning processes were successfully carried out to synthesize nanofibers under a series of working temperatures by using a homemade electrospinning system. Regardless of protic solvent (ethanol) or aprotic solvent (DMAc) and their volatilization property, elevated working temperature generated {{both positive and negative}} influences on the formation of polymer nanofibers. Temperature elevation decreased surface tension and viscosity, which consequently resulted in facile electrospinning and downsized resultant products.

40|$|Under certain conditions, inlets with a Borda type {{geometry}} {{were shown}} to exhibit sufficiently strong separation effects to permit the working fluid to flow through the duct {{as if it were}} a free jet. Mass limiting flow data and associated pressure profiles for tubes of 14, 53, 64, 73, and 105 L/D with a Borda type inlet were taken to determine bounds of the free jet phenomena. For a given tube roughness, the limits appear to be one dimensional and dependent only on inlet stagnation conditions. For smooth tubes the upper L/D boundary is related by P sub R roughly equal to CT to the 17 th power and sub R, C roughly equal to 00017 (L/D) to the 2. 5 power where F sub R = P/P sub c is reduced pressure and T sub R = T/T sub c is reduced temperature. The lower bound appears to be saturation conditions at the inlet. Similar free jet effects were found for fluid hydrogen indicating that <b>fluid</b> <b>jetting</b> may be common to all fluids.

50|$|As an {{air bubble}} rises, {{there is a}} {{difference}} in pressure between {{the top and bottom of}} the bubble. The higher pressure at the bottom of the bubble pushes the bubble's bottom surface up faster than the top surface rises. This creates a <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> that moves up through the center of the bubble. If the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> has enough energy, it will puncture the top of the bubble and create a bubble ring. Because of the motion of the fluid moving through the center of the bubble, the bubble begins to rotate. This rotation moves the fluid around the bubble creating a toroidal vortex. If the surface tension of the fluid interface or the viscosity of the liquid is too high, then the liquid jet will be more broad and will not penetrate the top of the bubble. This results in a spherical cap bubble. Air bubbles with a diameter greater than about two centimeters become toroidal in shape due to the pressure differences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Crater-like Taylor cone electrospinning is a novel, simple, and {{powerful}} approach to mass produce nanofibers. The Taylor cone, crater-like liquid bump {{on the free}} liquid surface, in this electrospinning process {{plays a key role}} to produce multiple <b>fluid</b> <b>jets</b> which finally solidifies nanofibers. A multi-physics coupled FEM method was employed to simulate the dynamic formation process of crater-like Taylor Cone in crater-like electrospinning. A blended k−ω /k−ε model for turbulence and dynamic overset grids to resolve large amplitude motions were used to simulate two-dimensional uncompressed flow, which was described in axisymmetrical coordinates. The numerical calculation results were obtained by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The effect of gas flow on the formation of crater-like Taylor cone and the production of nanofibers were also discussed. The experiments were carried out to validate the numerical results. The Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) / distilled water solution with 18 wt % and the air pressures ranged varied from 4 to 50 kPa were used in our experiments. The results showed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results.

5000|$|More broadly, some {{consider}} the effect {{to include the}} tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a <b>fluid</b> <b>jet.</b> It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some {{to explain why the}} air flow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil. Jef Raskin, for example, describes a simple demonstration, using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing. The wing deflects upwards, thus demonstrating that the Coandă effect creates lift. This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coandă effect as a <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> (the exhaust from a straw) adhering to a curved surface (the wing).

The usage in this sense is encountered in some popular references on aerodynamics. This is a controversial use of the term [...] "Coanda effect." [...] The more established view in the aerodynamics field is that the Coandă effect is defined in the more limited sense above, and the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary-layer separation and is not an example of the Coandă effect.|$|E
5000|$|Impulse {{turbines}} {{change the}} direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the turbine blades (the moving blades), {{as in the case}} of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid's pressure head is changed to velocity head by accelerating the fluid with a nozzle. Pelton wheels and de Laval turbines use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. Newton's second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines. Impulse turbines are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high.|$|E

5000|$|Nozzles direct forceful, {{high-speed}} {{streams of}} water against a rotary series of spoon-shaped buckets, {{also known as}} impulse blades, which are mounted around the circumferential rim of a drive wheelalso called a runner (see photo, 'Old Pelton wheel..'). As the water jet impinges upon the contoured bucket-blades, the direction of water velocity is changed to follow {{the contours of the}} bucket. Water impulse energy exerts torque on the bucket-and-wheel system, spinning the wheel; the water stream itself does a [...] "u-turn" [...] and exits at the outer sides of the bucket, decelerated to a low velocity. In the process, the water jet's momentum is transferred to the wheel and hence to a turbine. Thus, [...] "impulse" [...] energy does work on the turbine. For maximum power and efficiency, the wheel and turbine system is designed such that the water jet velocity is twice the velocity of the rotating buckets. A very small percentage of the water jet's original kinetic energy will remain in the water, which causes the bucket to be emptied at the same rate it is filled, (see conservation of mass) and thereby allows the high-pressure input flow to continue uninterrupted and without waste of energy. Typically two buckets are mounted side-by-side on the wheel, which permits splitting the water jet into two equal streams (see photo). This balances the side-load forces on the wheel and helps to ensure smooth, efficient transfer of momentum of the <b>fluid</b> <b>jet</b> of water to the turbine wheel.|$|E
