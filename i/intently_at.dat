5|$|In The Orrery, all the {{subjects}} {{have been identified}} apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to Isaac Newton but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint Portrait of a Young Man of 1760–1761 and {{the figure of the}} boy with his head cocked staring <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, An old man leaning on a staff, which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's Figure with Candle. Though Henry Fuseli would later also develop on the style of Frye's work {{there is no evidence of}} him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the Air Pump was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
500|$|In 1922, Macdonald {{became a}} {{part-time}} lecturer {{at the law}} school. When he left the attorney-general's office in 1924, he became a full-time professor. Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher. One former student describes him {{sitting at his desk}} on the rostrum speaking slowly and deliberately while gazing <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling. [...] "The more students disagreed (with one another in class) the more Angus encouraged it." ...|$|E

500|$|That day, Metzengerstein, in his home, sits staring <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> an old {{tapestry}} depicting [...] "an enormous, and unnaturally colored horse" [...] {{that belonged}} to the Berlifitzing clan. Just behind the horse, Frederick sees its rider who has just been killed by [...] "the dagger of a Metzengerstein". Soon, Frederick sees the horse move and assume [...] "an energetic and human expression". Immediately, Frederick opens the door to leave, and the action strikingly causes his shadow to fall exactly on the spot of the murderer in the tapestry.|$|E
500|$|Jolie {{began her}} {{professional}} film career in 1993, when she played her first {{leading role in}} the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel Cyborg 2, as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year. Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [...] and is that rare female hacker who sits <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> her keyboard in a see-through top." [...] Hackers failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors {{did not have much}} to do in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E

They are looking <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> each other, their legs and feet touch, and the genitals of the younger male are exposed.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Schmidt and Jared Cohen, {{director}} of Google Ideas visited North Korea along with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson. The trip was highly publicized and controversial {{due to the}} ongoing tension between North Korea and the United States. Tumblr, a Yahoo!-owned social-blogging site, featured a page titled, [...] "Eric Schmidt looking at things", and included photographs of Schmidt looking <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> computer screens and other scenes in North Korea. On August 10, 2013, North Korea announced an indigenous smartphone, named Arirang, that may be using the Google Android operating system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{video was}} shot in a wide frame with the artists in {{what looks like a}} [...] "parking garage, rapping as the camera pans across the room" [...] with a Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 {{featured}} in the background. The video contains numerous cameos by other artists signed to GOOD, including Kid Cudi, Cyhi the Prynce, Teyana Taylor, Hit-Boy, D'banj and Mr. Hudson. Taylor whips her black dress back and forth, Cyhi poses behind a pair of sunglasses, Mr. Hudson stares <b>intently</b> <b>at</b> the camera, and D'banj and Cudi dance along with their own unique moves. In the video Big Sean is wearing a turban-styled headpiece as he raps first. At the end of the clip a Lamborghini Gallardo moves past the screen and the artists are gone from the scene after it passes by. Marc Hogan of Spin praised the video, writing that [...] "as with the track itself, the visuals at first might not appear to involve anything flashy – just West and friends, all lurking about and looking chic in stark black-and-white. But there's one big exception: If the highlight of the audio is the moment where the synths lift off right before West's laconic verse, then that's where the video peaks, too – watch closely, or you'll miss two Wests lip-syncing for the price of one!" [...] Pitchfork Media's Carrie Batton commented that [...] "it's a simple but cinematographically impressive black-and-white clip with lots of leather and keffiyehs and sharp angles." ...|$|E

60|$|Nothing in {{the least}} like a mysterious figure passed us in the twilight. The few {{scattered}} laboring people, whom I had already seen, I saw again--and that was all. Lucilla was silent--suspiciously silent as I thought, after what Zillah had told me. She had, as I fancied, {{the look of a}} person who was listening <b>intently.</b> Arrived <b>at</b> the cottage of the rheumatic woman, she stopped and went in, while I waited outside. The affair of the embrocation was soon over. She was out again in a minute--and this time, she took my arm of her own accord.|$|R
60|$|The shadows {{were growing}} heavier and deeper, it lacked {{only a few}} moments of the sunset bugle, when he was {{recalled}} to himself by that singular instinctive consciousness, common to humanity, of being <b>intently</b> looked <b>at.</b> He turned quickly,--the door behind him closed softly. He rose and slipped into the hall. The tall figure of a woman was going down the passage. She was erect and graceful; but, as she turned towards the door leading to the offices, he distinctly saw the gaudily turbaned head and black silhouette of a negress. Nevertheless, he halted a moment {{at the door of the}} next room.|$|R
