5|$|A {{small group}} of reptiles, the diapsids, began to diversify <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Triassic, notably the dinosaurs.

All current major groups of sauropsids evolved <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Mesozoic, with birds first appearing in the Jurassic as a derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. Many groups of synapsids such as anomodonts and therocephalians that once comprised the dominant terrestrial fauna of the Permian also became extinct <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Mesozoic; <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Triassic, however, one group (Cynodontia) {{gave rise to the}} descendant taxon Mammalia, which survived through the Mesozoic to later diversify <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Cenozoic.|$|E
