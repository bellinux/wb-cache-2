5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Research into self-harm in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting {{a high incidence of}} suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015 COPD {{affected}} about 174.5 million (2.4%) of {{the global}} population. It typically occurs in people {{over the age of}} 40. Males and females are affected equally commonly. In 2015 it resulted in 3.2 million deaths, up from 2.4 million deaths in 1990. More than 90% of these deaths occur in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> and an aging population in many countries. It resulted in an estimated economic cost of $2.1trillion in 2010.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that two billion cases of gastroenteritis resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those below age five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths. In the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> are {{deficient}} in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes {{to the death of}} about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools.

As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E
