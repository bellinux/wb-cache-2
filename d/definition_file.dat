These functions are built into the CoSort package or through spin-offs for data extraction, generation, security, and migration. Each tool uses the same graphical IDE built on Eclipse, and metadata format for defining and manipulating data. IRI's open data <b>definition</b> <b>file</b> format is also supported by AnalytiX DS and Meta Integration Technology (MITI) so that third-party ETL, BI, and data modeling tool users can convert or re-use their existing metadata in IRI product environments.|$|E
2500|$|First {{issued in}} 2002 Hauptwerk Virtual Organ was {{developed}} to cater for virtual organs in general and {{has been found to}} be popular by amateurs and professional alike, with an interest in Theatre Organs. It uses sample sets which contain all of the digitised samples required for a Theatre Organ, along with an Organ <b>Definition</b> <b>File</b> (ODF) which specifies how an entire organ is defined. Sample sets are supplied by many suppliers, with a few devoted exclusively to Theatre Organs and most suppliers allow the use of their samples by ODFs that have been written by users to suit their own particular requirement, often using the Custom Organ Design Module (CODM) supplied with the Hauptwerk package. Physical console controls may be connected to Hauptwerk via MIDI MIDI and for those with limited space, touch screen control is often available. [...] The Free Edition allows you to 'try before you buy' and there is even a free to use sample set, containing a fully featured 3 manual, 10 rank Theatre Organ, supplied by Paramount Organ Works [...] Other Theatre Organ sample set suppliers are Milan Digital Audio [...] and Key Media Productions ...|$|E
