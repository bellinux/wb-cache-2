His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected {{by some of}} his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent</b> to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate {{after the death of}} Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.|$|E

2500|$|Carp was {{appointed}} Head of Mission {{to the newly}} proclaimed German Empire, where he served until April 1873 and negotiated further German credits for the Railways. It was in part a mission of appeasement: Carp persuaded German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck not to switch to the [...] "enemies of Romania" [...] side, playing down the riots as a short-lived liberal nuisance (the [...] "Strousberg Affair" [...] was only solved in 1880, when the Romanian state purchased the German stock). Following this venture, Carp was also dispatched to the Kingdom of Italy, as Romanian <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Sayre left England in {{the summer}} of 1777, going on to serve the United States as a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent</b> in various parts of Europe, from Prussia to Russia, where he tried unsuccessfully to charm the Empress Catherine.

[...] He was also active in diplomatic efforts to prevent hostilities between Britain and the new French Republic, which failed when the two countries [...] in February 1793. [...] Back in the United States he continued to argue the French case, giving him the reputation of a political extremist, which seemed to be confirmed by his hostility to the emerging Federalist Party. [...] Disappointed in his attempts to obtain a position within the federal government, he finally retired to Virginia, where he died in 1818.|$|E
6000|$|This is {{the point}} that has perplexed me, for Knox, {{no less than the}} Congregation, seems to have {{deliberately}} said good-bye to truth and honour, unless the Lords elaborately deceived their secretary and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent.</b> The only way in which I can suppose that Knox and his friends reconciled their consciences to their conduct is this: ...|$|E

That book, as he wrote to a friend named Railton {150} on October 23, 1559 (when much of it was already penned), is meant as a defence of his party against the charge of sedition, and was clearly intended (we reiterate) for contemporary reading at home and abroad, while the strife was still unsettled. This being so, Knox continues his policy of blaming the Regent for breach of the misreported treaty of July 24: for treachery, which would justify the brethren's attack on her before the period of truce (January 10, 1559) ran out.|$|E

6000|$|... [Footnote 36: This was {{the opinion}} of the writer, while in Europe. Since his return, he has seen much reason to confirm it. Last year, in a free {{conversation}} with a foreign <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent</b> on the state of public feeling in regard to certain political measures, the diplomate affirmed that, according to his experience, the talent, property, and respectability of the country were all against the government. This is the worn-out cant of England; and yet, when reform has been brought to the touchstone, its greatest opponents have been found among the parvenus. On being requested to mention individuals, the diplomatic man in question named three New York merchants, all of whom are foreigners by birth, neither of whom can speak good English, neither of whom could influence a vote--neither of whom had, probably, ever read the constitution or could understand it if he had read it, and neither of whom was, in principle, any more than an every-day common-place reflection of the antiquated notions of the class to which he belonged in other nations, and in which he had been, educated, and under the influence of which he had arrived here.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{obstacle}} to a pacific solution, perhaps most formidable of them all, was Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the British ambassador at Constantinople. Animated by a vehement antipathy to Russia, possessing almost sovereign ascendency at the Porte, {{believing that the}} Turk might never meet a happier chance of having the battle out with his adversary once for all, and justly confident that a policy of war would find hearty backers in the London cabinet--in him the government had an agent who while seeming to follow instructions in the narrow letter baffled them in their spirit. In the autumn of 1853 Lord Aberdeen wrote to Graham, 'I fear I must renounce the sanguine view I have hitherto taken of the Eastern question; for nothing can be more alarming than the present prospect. I thought {{that we should have}} been able to conquer Stratford, but I begin to fear that the reverse will be the case, and that he will succeed in defeating us. Although at our wit's end, Clarendon and I are still labouring in the cause of peace; but really to contend at once with the pride of the Emperor, the fanaticism of the Turks, and the dishonesty of Stratford is almost a hopeless attempt.'[303] This description, when he saw it nearly forty years later, seems to have struck Mr. Gladstone as harsh. Though he agreed that the passage could hardly be omitted, he confessed his surprise that Lord Aberdeen should have applied the word dishonesty to Lord Stratford. He suggested the addition of a note that should recognise the general character of Lord Stratford, and should point out that prejudice and passion, by their blinding powers, often produce in the mind effects like those proper to dishonesty.[304] Perhaps we may find this a hard saying. Doubtless when he comes to praise and blame, the political historian must make due allowance for his actors; and charity is the grandest of illuminants. Still hard truth stands first, and amiable analysis of the psychology of a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent</b> who lets loose a flood of mischief on mankind is by no means what interests us most about him. Why not call things by their right names?[305] ...|$|E
6000|$|One afternoon, {{not long}} after Ernest and Edie had taken rooms at Mrs. Halliss's, they were {{somewhat}} surprised at receiving the honour of a casual visit from a very unexpected and unusual quarter. Ronald was with them, talking earnestly over the prospects of the situation, when a knock came at the door, and to their great astonishment the knock was quickly followed by the entrance of Herbert. He had never been there before, and Ernest felt sure he had come now for some very definite and sufficient purpose. And so he had indeed: {{it was a strange}} one for him; but Herbert Le Breton was actually bound upon a mission of charity. We have all of us our feelings, no doubt, and Herbert Le Breton, too, in his own fashion, had his. Ernest was after all a good fellow enough at bottom, and his own brother: (a man can't for very rospectability's sake let his own brother go utterly to the dogs if he can possibly help it); and so Herbert had made up his mind, much against his natural inclination, to warn Ernest of the danger he incurred in having anything more to do or say with this insane, disreputable old Schurz fellow. For his own part, he hated giving advice; people never took it; and that was a deadly offence against his amour propre and a gross insult to his personal dignity; but still, in this case, for Ernest's sake, he determined after an inward struggle to swallow his own private scruples, and make an effort to check his brother {{on the edge of the}} abyss. Not that he would come to the point at once; Herbert was a careful <b>diplomatic</b> <b>agent,</b> and he didn't spoil his hand by displaying all his cards too openly at the outset; he would begin upon comparatively indifferent subjects, and lead round the conversation gradually to the perils and errors of pure Schurzianism. So he set out by admiring his niece's fat arms--a remarkable stretch of kindliness on Herbert's part, for of course other people's babies are well known to be really the most uninteresting objects in the whole animate universe--and then he passed on by natural transitions to Ernest's housekeeping arrangements, and to the prospects of journalism as a trade, and finally to the necessity for a journalist to consult the tastes of his reading public. 'And by the way, Ernest,' he said quietly at last, 'of course after this row at Pilbury, you'll drop the acquaintance of your very problematical German socialist.' ...|$|E
