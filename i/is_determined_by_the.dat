5|$|Each {{radioactive}} isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of time}} needed for half of a sample to decay.

5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities.

5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that {{the path of a}} singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E

5|$|The NHL Entry Draft {{eligibility}} requires {{players to}} have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order of placement in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular season is over, a weighted lottery is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the lottery could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing some teams from winning the top selection regardless of winning the lottery. During that time, the Islanders won the lottery twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009). The team finished last in the league standings in the 2000–01 season, but picked second in the draft after the Atlanta Thrashers won the lottery.|$|E
