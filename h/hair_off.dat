5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's <b>hair</b> <b>off.</b> Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the liberation movement.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, the teenaged Canaan—under {{the stage}} name Angel—joined the heavy metal band Equation, who until then had been intent on finding a male lead singer. Canaan's talent, personality, and stage {{presence}} gained her national popularity among Lebanese youth. The same year, she donned {{what would become}} her trademark, trend-setting look: revealing, studded leather outfits with dramatic capes and hip-length blonde-streaked <b>hair.</b> <b>Off</b> stage, Canaan's Alma Mater, Brummana High School (BHS), voted her “Best Dressed”. On stage, her provocative costumes contributed to the perception {{of her as a}} sex symbol. The Daily Star wrote: “On stage, with her daring looks and style, Canaan became a role model”. At the height of their success the band drew a crowd of over 15,000.

25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip <b>hair</b> <b>off</b> when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E
25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's <b>hair</b> <b>off</b> while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E

Bart and Lisa inform Grampa about what they did and the three of them conspire to continue passing off Bart and Lisa's scripts as Grampa's own, splitting the money three ways.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} {{desirable}} in the pet trade {{because of the}} females' long lifespan and reputation for being docile and gentle in temperament, {{as well as for}} its appealing dark coloration. These traits make them rather expensive when buying from a breeder. It is said to have a reduced tendency to kick urticating <b>hairs</b> <b>off</b> when handled, which adds to its desirability as a pet. Many times, they do not spread urticating hairs around their homes, as observed in other tarantula species. Because of a ban on the export of wild caught specimens and its slow growth, mature females (preferred because of their long life) are generally expensive.|$|R

500|$|In November 1962 Espanto I and II {{were joined}} by Espanto III, Espanto I's younger brother Miguel Vázquez Bernal, forming an [...] "identical trio" [...] where all three members wore the same mask and used {{basically}} the same ring name just with a number to differentiate them. Outside of teaming with Espanto III, Espanto I and II also regularly teamed up with El Santo, often headlining shows across Mexico. Teaming with El Santo {{was part of a}} storyline where Espanto I and II would attack El Santo after a match, turning Santo to the tecnico side (those that portray the [...] "good guys") in the process. On Jun 22, 1963, Espanto I, II and El Santo lost a match to Rito Romero, Rayo de Jalisco, and Henry Pilusso. Being disappointed with the loss Espanto II attacked El Santo, but ended up with his own mask torn up and his face covered in blood when El Santo fought back. Espanto I and II also formed a team with El Gladiador, often facing El Santo and various partners. One particularly heated match saw Los Espantos and Gladiador fight their opponents, Ray Mendoza, René Guajardo, and Karloff Lagarde {{all the way back to}} the locker rooms in an era where such a thing was unheard of in Mexico. At the first EMLL 30th Anniversary show Espanto II lost a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match" [...] to Rubén Juárez and as a result was forced to unmask. In Lucha libre losing an Apuesta match is seen as the ultimate humiliation and an Apuesta win is considered more prestigious than winning a championship. Three weeks later, on September 27, 1963 at the second EMLL 30th Anniversary show, Espanto I defeated Rubén Juárez in a Lucha de Apuesta and forced Juárez to have his hair shaved off. In the winter of 1963 Espanto II was forced to shave his <b>hair</b> <b>off</b> as El Santo defeated him in a Lucha de Apuestas match. A few weeks later they followed up the storyline with El Santo unmasking Espanto I.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also common}} for {{competitive}} swimmers to shave <b>hair</b> <b>off</b> their legs, arms, and torsos, to reduce drag {{and provide a}} heightened [...] "feel" [...] for the water by removing the exterior layer of skin along with the body hair.
