For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things.

500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose myself. What I <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco." ...|$|E

"We <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> two things: {{encourage}} students to think of journalism as a grand opportunity for public service, and to promote {{a deeper understanding of}} a remarkable region that struggles to adapt to changing times," [...] wrote Tiner in his introduction to the project.|$|E
2500|$|Initial reviews {{immediately}} following the film's debut at the Edinburgh International Film Festival were generally positive. The performances of the two leads, Mullan and Lowden, were widely praised. A few reviewers felt that the film may <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> too much due to having several themes, and a few felt {{that some of the}} golfing sequences were repetitive.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{that is all}} I <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> This book is not {{an attack}} on any person, on the death penalty, or on {{anything}} else, though if it makes people think about these things, so much the better.

2500|$|Browning {{testified that}} the Madagascar Plan of 1940–41 was [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "bizarre", but countered Irving's {{suggestion}} that this proves the alleged impossibility of the Holocaust by stating: [...] "...I do think they took it seriously. It is fantastic, but of course, Auschwitz is fantastic, too". Browning {{testified that the}} Madagascar Plan was not [...] "Hitler's pipe dream" [...] as Irving claimed, and that [...] "I would not call it a pipe dream, because I think, if England had surrendered, they would <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. They {{would have tried to}} implement it just as they tried to implement the Lublin reservation plan [...] and just as they tried and succeeded in implementing the death camp plans." ...|$|E

Despite campaigning by the Kutteleses and LGBT activist groups, the Commanding General of Fort Campbell {{at the time of}} the murder, Major General Robert T. Clark, refused to take responsibility for the purported anti-gay climate at Fort Campbell under his command. In May 2003, he met with Patricia Kutteles, who opposed his promotion saying: [...] "He doesn't have the command authority or responsibility. The promotion would be another obstacle in the way of everything we <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to honor our son." [...] His promotion to lieutenant general was delayed in October 2002 and May 2003. After being exonerated, he was nominated and approved for promotion to lieutenant general on December 5, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{interest}} in a bout with Amir Khan, Mayweather {{announced that he would}} fight 30 year old Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on May 3, 2014, in a unification bout at MGM Grand Garden Arena, with Mayweather's WBC and The Ring welterweight titles at stake, as well as Maidana's WBA (Super) welterweight title. Maidana won the WBA tite in December 2013 against Mayweather friend, Adrien Broner. Mayweather tweeted the news the day after his 37th birthday. The Barclays Center in Brooklyn also made a case to showcase the fight. Mayweather explained why he chose Maidana, [...] "Marcos Maidana's last performance immediately brought him to my attention. He is an extremely skilled fighter who brings knockout danger to the ring. I think this is a great fight for me and he deserves the opportunity to see if he can do what 45 others <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before him – beat me." [...] Maidana was a 12-to-1 underdog going into the fight.|$|E

2500|$|Statues were {{erected in}} Trafalgar Square, London, in Chatham, Gravesend, Melbourne (Australia), and Khartoum. Southampton, where Gordon had stayed with his sister, Augusta, in Rockstone Place before his {{departure}} to the Sudan, erected a memorial in Porter's Mead, now Queen's Park, near the town's docks. On 16 October 1885, the [...] "light and elegant structure" [...] was unveiled; it comprises a stone base on {{which there are}} four polished red Aberdeen granite columns, about twenty feet high. The columns are surmounted by carved capitals supporting a cross. The pedestal bears {{the arms of the}} Gordon clan and of the borough of Southampton, and also Gordon’s name in Chinese.
