He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to tolerate the relationship {{for the sake of}} her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in Military District III (Berlin-Brandenburg).

25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil.

25|$|The battle {{took place}} {{less than a}} month after Britain's {{declaration}} of war against Germany on 5 August 1914. Initially, the war on land went badly for the French and their allies, with German forces invading France and an urgent need to gather all possible troops to send to France to resist them. The British government was in a position of having nothing but bad news, and looked to the navy, the largest in the world and traditionally the mainstay of British military power, for some success to report. British naval tactics had typically involved a close blockade of enemy ports, taking the fight to the enemy, and this had been the British plan for war against Germany up to 1913. Such an approach was still expected by the British population. However, it was realised that the advent of submarines armed with torpedoes and mines hidden in open sea meant that any operations involving stationing capital ships near enemy ports would place them at great risk of surprise attack and loss. Then, there was the issue of fuel: powered ships, obliged to keep moving to reduce their vulnerability as sitting targets, were continuously using fuel and had to return to port <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

25|$|Newborn golden mice {{are fairly}} coordinated at birth; however, {{they have a}} {{tendency}} to remain quietly in one spot. By day 1, they are able to take their first steps and right themselves up easily. Their prehensile tail tendencies become evident by day 2 and by day 4 they exhibit a sense of balance and are able to balance themselves and hang upside down. By day 10, young golden mice display a tendency to crawl upward and by day 15, they are able to jump. Days 17 and 18 are when young mice are seen to become even more active, yet they remain docile when held in a hand. The first attempts at bathing have been observed at day 7 and by day 12, young golden mice attempt to wash behind their ears but they are still relatively unsteady. Between days 12 to 21 newborn golden mice bathe frequently and thoroughly. By day 21, a considerable amount of time was spent outside the nest. Upon birth, if handled <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> once their eyes opened, the mice became more docile and were easily managed through their adult life. If young golden mice were not handled frequently during this period, {{they were more likely to}} be wild and difficult to manage.|$|E
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the fishplate bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E

500|$|Cimon's Eurymedon {{campaign}} itself {{seems to}} have begun {{in response to the}} assembly of a large Persian fleet and army at Aspendos, near the mouth of the Eurymedon River. It is usually argued that the Persians were the would-be aggressors, and that Cimon's campaign was launched to deal with this new threat. Cawkwell suggests that the Persian build-up was the first concerted attempt to counter the activity of the Greeks since the failure of the second invasion. It is possible that internal strife within the Persian empire had contributed to the length of time it took to launch this campaign. Cawkwell outlines the Persian strategic problems: [...] "Persia was a land power which used its naval forces in close conjunction with its armies, not free ranging in enemy waters. In any case, secure naval bases were necessary. In the Ionian Revolt with land forces already operating in Ionia and elsewhere along the Aegean seaboard, it was easy for a Royal army and navy to deal with the revolt, but in view of the general revolt of the [...] cities in 479 BC and the subsequent successes of the Greek navies the only way for Persia must have seemed to be to move along the coast restoring order in city after city, with fleet and army moving together." [...] The nature of naval warfare in the Ancient world, dependent as it was on large teams of rowers, meant that ships would have to make landfall <b>every</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> to resupply with food and water. This severely limited the range of an Ancient fleet, and essentially meant that navies could only operate in the vicinity of secure naval bases. Cawkwell therefore suggests that the Persian forces gathered at Aspendos were aiming to move along the southern coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city, until eventually the Persian navy could begin operating in Ionia again. Alexander the Great would employ this strategy in reverse in winter of 333 BC. Lacking a navy with which to take on the Persians, Alexander settled instead for denying the Persian navy suitable bases, by capturing the ports of southern Asia Minor.|$|E

During the 2002 - 2004 outburst the appearance of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) coincide with the onset of anomalous state. There are two distinct QPO states: namely the single QPO state with one QPO and the twin QPO state with two QPOs not related harmonically. The spectral features of this state are corroborated by a previous outburst in 1998. The evolution of the inner disc temperature and the inner disc radius suggest the possible onset of geometrically thicker, slim disc as a possible explanation of the energy spectral features. The other possibilities involving the Comptonizing cloud also exist that may explain the anomalous state. The two different QPO states exhibit different spectral features, and we provide a possible empirical physical scenario from the observation of the evolution of the spectral features.
