40|$|A general {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} computer code (ICRKFLO) has been developed for the simulation of the multi-phase reacting flow in a <b>petroleum</b> fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> riser. ICRKFLO has several unique features. A new integral reaction submodel couples calculations of hydrodynamics and cracking kinetics by making the calculations more efficient in achieving stable convergence while still preserving the major physical effects of reaction processes. A new coke transport submodel handles the process of coke formation in gas phase reactions and the subsequent deposition {{on the surface of}} adjacent particles. The code was validated by comparing with experimental results of a pilot scale fluid cracker unit. The code can predict the flow characteristics of gas, liquid, and particulate solid phases, vaporization of the oil droplets, and subsequent cracking of the oil in a riser reactor, which may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the internal processes of the riser and the impact of riser geometry and operating parameters on the riser performance...|$|R

The fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and a diesel hydro desulphuriser were commissioned in November 2006.The FCC and DHDS plants were modified so as to be compliant with the cleaner Euro III and Euro IV fuels. The refinery configuration lends itself well to de-bottlenecking and its capacity is enhanced to 14mtpa in 2009.The docking facilities include an SBM capable of handling vessels up to 350,000DWT with a capacity of 25mtpa, tankages with interconnecting pipelines of 20mtpa capacity, marine product dispatch capacity of 12mtpa and rail-car and truck-loading facilities.|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the automobile in the early 1900s created a mass market for gasoline, and a shortage soon developed of the lighter gasoline fractions of crude oil. The shortage was solved by {{the invention of the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> which broke long hydrocarbon chains into smaller molecules.|$|R
40|$|Arising {{from the}} {{discussion}} about a sustainable development of the energy sector, more and more interest of different industrial branches (e. g. in the automotive field or by the energy supply companies) is actually directed {{to the use of}} fuel cells. They show high degrees of ef-ficiency, little pollution and the ability of combined heat and power generation, and moreover they are modularly built. As a fuel they need hydrogen, but the infrastructure of its supply is much worse than necessary. So, at least for a time of transition, hydrogen must be produced from hydrocarbon fuels. A new idea is the hydrogen production from liquid higher hydrocar-bon compositions, as diesel fuel, in a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker.</b> This diesel processor is based on a technology developed by the University of Essen-Duisburg at Duisburg. Liquid higher hydrocarbons, as diesel, also contain different sulfur compounds. The aim of this work was to gain knowledge about the influence of sulfur to a complete <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> system. The study consists of two parts, the first dealing with the influence of sulfur com-pounds to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> itself, and the second with the influence of the products of the reaction of sulfur compounds flowing with the resultant gas into the low-temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell, PEMFC. In the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> the influence of sulfur on the activity and the hydrogen selectivity of catalysts of two different precious metals  used separately as well as in mixture  is investi-gated. Furthermore, the catalysts stability under the cracking temperature of nearly 1, 200 K is tested. As an example, the effect of sulfur-containing fuel to a PEMFC is shown and analysed. Moreover, a mathematical-physical model is developed, describing the effects of the degra-dation of a PEMFC by sulfur contamination. Finally, the efficiency of a desulfurizing unit, pre-connected to the fuel cell to extend its lifetime, is investigated...|$|R

A demand model is specified and estimated.
