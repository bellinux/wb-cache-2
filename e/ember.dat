5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of <b>Ember</b> Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a trachytic matrix of plagioclase. About 35% of <b>Ember</b> Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of <b>Ember</b> Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with <b>Ember</b> Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, <b>Ember</b> Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. <b>Ember</b> Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, <b>Ember</b> Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own <b>ember</b> on that loaf. The sort whose <b>ember</b> retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
50|$|<b>Embers</b> {{received}} numerous festival accolades including Best Feature at New Orleans Film Festival, SciFi London, Feratum Film Festival, and Oxford Film Festival, where Carré {{also was}} given the Alice Guy-Blaché Award. At Newport Beach Film Festival, <b>Embers</b> won both Best Feature and Best Director, and the film received awards for Best Feature and Best Editing at Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre Film Festival. <b>Embers</b> also received Best New Director at Brooklyn Film Festival, and both the Juice Award and Special Jury Prize at Sarasota Film Festival. Trieste Science+Fiction Festival in Italy awarded <b>Embers</b> the prestigious Asteroide.|$|R

5|$|The {{obedience}} of Anacletus II may be reconstructed basing on {{the letter}} addressed to king Lothair III of Germany by his cardinals {{soon after his}} coronation. This letter bears the subscriptions of 27 cardinals, including five created by Anacletus II on February 21, a Friday of the <b>ember</b> week. To them should be added also cardinal Oderisio of S. Agata, who later subscribed the bulls issued by Anacletus II.|$|E
5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing <b>ember</b> effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Embers</b> {{which have}} not burned long enough can burn feet more quickly. <b>Embers</b> contain water, which {{increases}} their heat capacity {{as well as their}} thermal conductivity. The water must be evaporated already when the firewalk starts.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>embers</b> can {{be carried}} away from a bushfire by the wind, they {{pose a threat to}} houses that one would {{intuitively}} assume are far enough away from the fire. Fire authorities advise vigilance by home owners before and after a fire front passes. <b>Embers</b> can ignite combustible materials outside the home. A danger also exists of <b>embers</b> entering the home, in particular the roof space, requiring occupants to inspect for signs of fire in the roof.|$|R
5|$|Alumni Hall was {{constructed}} by the Benedictine monks and local contractors from 1891 through the winter of 1892; the building was designed by Patrick W. Ford, an Irish-American architect from Boston. Nearing completion in February 1892, {{all that remained was}} for workers to continue to plaster the interior walls; sadly, a fire which was most likely caused by a heating stove's gate not closed completely, sparked an <b>ember</b> and destroyed the entire structure. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had only received $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. In an effort to save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house {{was constructed}} separately from the building. Farmland complete with livestock, beanpoles and tomato plants lined the present-day quad and adjacent fields, as the monks were completely self-sufficient. In 1912, the bell tower (the inside is pictured to the right) and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. Today this second chapel is the college's Chapel Arts Center, which hosts art exhibits and other cultural events. It still boasts ornate stained glass windows and painted ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bishop of}} Manchester, Denis Mary Bradley, invited the Benedictine monks of St. Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, {{to form a}} college and preparatory school in his diocese. The monks that came to Manchester from Saint Mary's were {{primarily}} of German descent. This {{is due to the}} fact that Manchester was heavily populated with French Canadian and Irish immigrant mill workers, and Bradley was unable to find a suitable religious community that would not stir up ethnic tensions. The German monks accepted, and founded the third Catholic college in New England. On August 1, 1889, the New Hampshire legislature approved the incorporation of the Order of Saint Benedict of New Hampshire “for religious and charitable purposes, for the education of youth, for establishing churches and conducting services therein.” This historic date marked the founding of Saint Anselm College. A six-year curriculum in philosophy and theology was developed. In 1892, as Alumni Hall neared completion, a fire destroyed the college on a cold winter night in February. The fire was most likely caused from an <b>ember</b> from the heating stove's gate as it was not closed properly. Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had received only $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. To save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. The monks rebuilt the college, and on October 11, 1893 the college was officially rededicated. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house, which today serves as the college print shop, was constructed separately from the building. Two years later, in 1895, the New Hampshire legislature granted Saint Anselm College the right to bestow standard academic degrees upon its graduates. In 1912, the bell tower and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. The second chapel serves today as the Alva deMars Megan Chapel Arts Center.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Embers</b> play a {{large role}} in forest fires. Since <b>embers</b> are {{typically}} burnt leaves and thus small and lightweight, they can easily become airborne. During a large fire, with the right wind conditions, <b>embers</b> can be blown far ahead of the fire front, starting spot fires several kilometres away. A number of practical measures can be undertaken by homeowners to reduce the consequences of such an [...] "ember attack" [...] that bombards especially wooden structures and starts property fires.|$|R

An update of the burning <b>embers</b> diagram was later provided by a group of IPCC authors (Smith et al., 2009). These authors were responsible for writing the chapter in AR4 which contains the written update of the reasons for concern. Their revision of the burning <b>embers</b> diagram was published independently of the IPCC process, and appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America scientific journal. The revision shows increased risks in all five reasons for concern.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} design was a bonnet chimney. The bonnet was a funnel-shaped sheet metal cone fitted over a {{conventional}} cylindrical chimney. The lower, small-diameter {{portion of the}} cone served as a collection hopper for falling <b>embers.</b> The upper portion of the cone concealed an inner cone {{at the top of}} the cylindrical chimney which deflected escaping steam, smoke and <b>embers</b> outward against the inner walls of the outer cone. The heavier <b>embers</b> were expected to fall into the hopper below while the lighter steam and smoke passed upward through a wire screen over the upper, large-diameter end of the outer cone. Deflection of the <b>embers</b> typically lengthened screen life to three or four weeks. Some of these chimneys had provisions dropping collected <b>embers</b> into a portion of the smokebox called the subtreasury. Sophisticated designs like the Radley & Hunter included various centrifugal separation baffles into the bonnet. As coal replaced wood fuel, the bonnet was reduced into a simple diamond stack housing the inner deflecting cone (with or without the upper wire screen) but without any collection hopper.|$|R
