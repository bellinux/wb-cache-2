The NBM has been, and will continue to be, implemented in two stages: First is a demonstration project, which was carried out over the period 2003-2007 aimed at cultivating 400,000 hectares of Jatropha expected to yield about 3.75 tons of oilseed per hectare annually. The project has also demonstrated the viability of other related activities/projects such as seed collection and oil extraction. In addition, the government will build a transesterification plant. Second, a commercialization period which started in 2007 and will proceed until 2012 will continue with Jatropha cultivation. The plan also involves the installation of more transesterification plants that will position India to meet 20 per cent of its diesel needs through biodiesel. High ethanol prices and low availability of sources has compelled the government to amend its 5% blending target with the notification that 5% bioethanol blended petrol shall be supplied in identified areas if (a) the indigenous price of ethanol offered for ethanol blended petrol programme is comparable to that offered by the indigenous ethanol industry for alternative uses, (b) the indigenous delivery price of ethanol offered for the ethanol blended petrol programme at a particular location is comparable to the <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> of petrol at that location, and (c) there is an adequate supply of ethanol. To encourage investment, there are also tax incentives and excise cuts. At the state level, the Maharashtra government offers waivers of government fee from the 1 percent turnover tax on anhydrous ethanol, INR500 per kiloliter (US$0.048 per gallon) permit fee, 4 percent sales tax, 10 percent surcharge on sales tax, INR1,500 per kiloliter (US$0.14 per gallon) import fee, INR300 per kiloliter (US$0.029 per gallon) service charges and 3 percent Octroi, which is a local tax collected on various articles brought into the district for consumption.

We begin by presenting various estimates of the volume of rice imports, including estimates derived from data on rice-exporting countries, which show that official figures for imports have substantially understated actual imports. Next, we discuss the price incentives for imports, as determined by exchange-rate and rice trade policy (import tariffs and periodic import bans). Price distortions created by these policies are summarized in calculations of nominal rates of protection.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which Bangladesh should rely on imports for rice price {{stabilization}} is a contentious policy issue. This issue was underscored {{in the wake of}} the 2007 – 08 world food crisis, during which international rice prices skyrocketed and rice import supplies from India were disrupted. For more than a dozen years, from 1994 to 2007, private-sector rice imports made a major contribution to price stabilization and food security in Bangladesh, adding to domestic supplies following production shortfalls. In particular, following massive floods in 1998, private-sector imports sourced from wholesale rice markets in India contributed more than 2 million tons to rice supply in Bangladesh. Subsequently, between 2003 and mid- 2007, Bangladesh prices were particularly stable. This paper presents econometric evidence that trade with India was a determining factor in this price stability. In particular, the authors show that in this period, Bangladesh domestic wholesale prices were co-integrated with <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>prices</b> of subsidized below-poverty-line rice from India’s public stocks. Import flows in these years generated an estimated total of 1. 0 to 1. 6 billion US dollars in consumer surplus for Bangladesh households but reduced producer surplus by a similar amount.

50|$|The basic {{challenge}} facing WFP under P4P was to shape and manage {{a process that}} involved creating extra demand for staple food crops produced by smallholder farmers, reaching an appropriate level of supply adapted to that demand, and ensuring that benefits accrued to the smallholder farmers. WFP succeeded in procuring over 367,000 metric tons (mt) of food over the five-year pilot, putting more than US$148 million more directly {{into the hands of}} smallholder farmers (US$30 million/year on average). Further, farmer organizations not previously selling collectively sold another US$60 million worth of quality food to buyers beyond WFP. Almost all P4P contracts were below <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>prices,</b> therefore respecting WFP’s principle of “cost-efficient procurement” and realizing cost savings relative to importation. Compared to <b>import</b> <b>parity,</b> total savings {{over the course of the}} five years exceeded US$40 million. These outcomes hinged on several important investments. Novel partnerships and platforms was a necessity, along with a range of new products and services. In many important ways, therefore, WFP and its partners ventured into virgin territory under P4P. A core principal guiding the thoughts of the original designers was that the pilot’s “failures” would yield learnings and lessons at least as important as its “successes.” The charge to WFP was to think outside the box, innovate, and evolve, knowing that not everything attempted would work. This report provides a comprehensive view of key aspects of that experimentation and learning process, detailing the extraordinarily wide array of opportunities generated by the P4P approach, along with the correspondingly deep set of challenges addressed.|$|R

40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} in {{the early}} 1990 s in Bangladesh has enabled {{the private sector to}} respond with market-stabilizing inflows of rice and wheat following major production shortfalls. At the same time, easing of restrictions on foreign investment, combined with substantial depreciation of the Taka, have enabled exports of the labor-intensive ready-made garment industry to expand significantly. Moreover, recently discovered natural gas resources might be exploited, creating new revenues for the country. A proper assessment of the impact of such policies and economic developments on the poor requires a comprehensive framework to analyze interactions between different sectors, and linkages between macro and micro levels. In this paper we develop a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) with special treatment of the rice and wheat sectors, and we use it to simulate the impact of (i) a decline in rice production due to floods, (ii) a cut in food aid of wheat, and (iii) increased revenues from the exploitation of natural gas resources. The results suggest that most households benefit from more liberalized rice and wheat trade, particularly after rice production shocks. Impacts of a decline in wheat food aid are relatively modest, as food aid imports are not large enough to have major macroeconomic effects. The simulations of natural gas export revenues suggest that the extent of disincentives to agriculture will depend on whether or not the resulting real exchange rate appreciation is sufficient to lower the <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> of rice enough so that domestic prices are affected. Finally, all three simulations show that the effects of economic shocks on women’s labor and female headed poor households can differ significantly from the effects on men’s labor and other households.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 112 - 116. This {{dissertation}} investigates {{barriers to}} entry into the downstream petroleum industry of South Africa. The study seeks to understand why there is insignificant entry into the downstream petroleum industry by Historically Disadvantaged South Africans (HSDA's), while the government has set itself an objective of achieving sustainable presence, control and ownership by HDSA's of approximately a quarter in all facets of the industry. The government has set this objective {{in order to address}} the past imbalances before the industry could be deregulated. In an endeavour to ascertain why this key policy objective was not achieved, the study investigated {{barriers to entry}} into the industry, and revealed a number of these impediments. There are three categories of these impediments or barriers to entry, namely, economic barriers to entry, non-economic barriers, and cross-sectoral barriers. These barriers contribute towards deterring entry by HDSA's and hold back the BOC's from increasing their market share in the downstream industry. In order to address some of these barriers a business model for economic empowerment has been developed, which seeks to assist in the achievement of the government's set key policy objective. The barriers to entry could be circumvented through this business model, with an aim of making entry into the industry easy for HDSA's. The model could create a business environment that will allow the BOC's to increase their market share in the downstream {{while at the same time}} alleviating the identified barriers to entry in order to achieve approximately twenty five percent sustainable presence, control and ownership of the industry by HDSA's. The model would also enable BOC's to capture five percent (5 %) of the market share of the refiners in a sustainable way without significantly harming the established oil companies. The role of government in this regard would be limited to issuing a licence to the BOC's in order to acquire the 5 % target at an <b>Import</b> <b>Parity</b> <b>Price</b> (IPP), which is far less than the Basic Fuel Price (BFP).

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{remarkable}} growth in Ethiopia’s agricultural production and overall real incomes (GDP/capita) from 2004 / 05 to 2008 / 09, prices of major cereals (teff, maize, wheat and sorghum) have fluctuated sharply in both nominal and real terms. International prices of cereals also fluctuated widely, particularly between 2006 and 2008. However, {{the links between}} Ethiopia’s domestic cereal markets and the international market {{are by no means}} straightforward. Among the major staples, only wheat is imported or exported on a significant scale. And frequent changes in trade and macro-economic policies, movements in international prices and fluctuations in domestic production have at times eliminated incentives for private sector imports of wheat. From July 2005 to March 2007, private sector wheat imports were profitable and domestic wheat <b>prices</b> closely tracked <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> Then, from April 2007 to May 2008, good domestic harvests coincided with increase international wheat prices, so private sector wheat imports were no longer profitable. Most recently, rationing of foreign exchange for imports effectively stopped private sector wheat imports beginning in about April 2008. Partial equilibrium analysis shows, however, that government imports and sales in 2008 - 09 effectively increased domestic supply and lowered market wheat prices. These sales at the low official price also implied that recipient households, traders and flour mills enjoyed a significant subsidy. Allowing the private sector access to foreign exchange for wheat imports or auctioning government wheat imports in domestic markets would eliminate these rents and generate additional government revenue, while having the same effect on market prices as government subsidized sales.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Sunflower seed is {{the third}} most {{important}} field crop in South Africa after maize and wheat. During the period of regulated marketing (1980 s - 1990 s) the Oilseed Board controlled {{the majority of the}} oilseed industry in South Africa. Prices were determined by domestic demand and supply, as well as the export pool prices that were derived by the Oilseed Board. Prices were fixed for a particular production season and producers were faced with a single-channel marketing scheme. However, this situation changed with the introduction of the Marketing of Agricultural Products Act (No. 47 of 1996 as amended). This legislation led to the deregulation of the South African agricultural industry and the abolishment of the Marketing Boards. Since the deregulation of the oilseed industry in South Africa, the prices of sunflower products are determined under free market conditions (that is demand and supply). Sunflower products are formally traded on the Agricultural Products Division (APD) of the JSE Securities Exchange. This division is frequently referred to as the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX). This dissertation aims to examine the structure of the South African sunflower price with the aid of various economic theories and econometric modeling techniques. Furthermore, the specific objective of this dissertation is to develop a series of South African sunflower price models to identify the factors that influence the price of sunflower in South Africa (the general objective of this dissertation). These models can accordingly be utilised to make definite projections of the price of sunflower in South Africa. Vector Auto-Regression Estimations, Vector Error Correction Models and First-Order Autoregressive Models are applied to monthly data (January 2000 - March 2007) to develop four different South African sunflower price models. The results of the different sunflower price models yielded a number of influential price factors that are categorised into macroeconomic, South African oilseed supply and demand, South African vegetable oil import and international oilcake/meal price factors. The macroeconomic factors that influence the price of sunflower in South Africa are the Brent crude oil price per barrel, and the Rand/US-Dollar exchange rate. The South African oilseed supply and demand factors comprise the North-West Province rainfall, and the closing stock of sunflower in South Africa. The South African vegetable oil import factors that influence the price of sunflower in South Africa include the sunflower <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> quoted by SAFEX, and South Africa's 750 ml cooking oil price. The international oilcake/meal price factors are the Argentinean soybean meal price and the Argentinean sunflower meal price. Although these sunflower price models are based on a South African specific case study, a number of generic shortcomings in the composition, significance and applicability of such models were identified during their development. Consequently, these shortcomings need to be considered and addressed in future agricultural price modeling studies. Master...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Agriculture, Economics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Statistics paint {{a picture}} of a wheat {{industry}} under severe pressure, with the number of hectares dedicated to wheat production that have decreased while imports notably increased since 1997. This has had a negative impact on the industry‘s global competitiveness. The direct and indirect linkages between wheat and wheat products, together with the benefits that the industry can bring to the economy in the form of heightened food security and employment opportunities, highlight the need for a competitive wheat industry in South Africa. Clearly, the underlying causes of the declining wheat production in South Africa need to be investigated and understood. The presence of strict wheat quality standards and the fact that one of the general characteristics of wheat is the defect of conversion (that is, yield declines as quality improves) help to explain why wheat production in South Africa has declined in recent years. This can also negatively affect prices received for produce because South African wheat prices are determined by the lowest <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>price</b> and not by the specific quality of the wheat. The fact that market concentration has been observed in certain parts of the wheat industry in South Africa has raised concerns that this phenomenon could potentially have had a negative impact on the performance of the country‘s wheat production sector. Consequently, this study revolves around the following main questions: ―could the evident market concentration in the South African wheat industry influence the performance of the wheat production sector by prescribing certain quality standards which attract relatively low prices?‖, and if so, ―can the wheat quality standards and prices be held responsible for the decline in the industry‘s performance, and to what extent?‖ Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in pursuit to answer these questions. The qualitative approach was used to describe the theoretical basis of performance, competitiveness and concentration. Three different quantitative approaches were employed to determine the current state of competitiveness (Relative Trade Advantage (RTA) method), the factors influencing it (hedonic price model) and the extent of such influence (dynamic linear model). From the RTA, it was clear that South Africa is the only country, compared to its trading partners, that has an uncompetitive unprocessed (production) wheat sector alongside a competitive semi-processed (flour) wheat sector. The hedonic price model supported the finding that the institutional environment of the wheat industry uses quality-related mechanisms such as the cultivar release criteria to influence the competitiveness of the wheat production sector. Four comparisons were developed to determine whether the strict qualities required for the release of new cultivars are justified. It was found that with all four of these comparisons, the strict prescribed wheat quality was not justified in terms of the quality and demand considerations. It was found that when prescribed wheat quality could be relaxed to accommodate market supply and demand, an estimated 12. 8 percent increase in yields could have been realised equating to a loss of approximately R 606 million in Net Farm Income (NFI) per annum. When increasing this percentage to 20 percent, it was seen that the effect on NFI per annum would be R 920 million. This study therefore provides evidence as to why the performance of the wheat industry has been declining {{over the last two decades}} and also contributes to the development of a framework for policy and decision makers which will encourage more competition and a freer market in terms of quality standards. Further contributions of this study lies in the body of literature on competitive behaviour by showing how concentrated industries can use statutory bodies to manipulate markets for rent-seeking purposes. It further shows how these decisions impact on important aspects like the profits of role players in an industry. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|Zambia {{ranks as}} one of the lowest cost {{producers}} of sugar. However, Zambia’s domestic sugar price has been high and volatile and is substantially higher than the world price. This has raised concern among stakeholders and further raises questions about the efficient functioning of the market. The study sought to determine and explain efficiency and integration in Zambia’s sugar value chain by analysing price spreads, price formation, and price transmission through a price transmission and partial equilibrium model. The study hypothesised that the Zambian sugar market is both inefficient and it is not integrated with the world market. This was tested through the price transmission and partial equilibrium models. Price transmission is conceptually premised on the Law of One Price (LOP) which postulates that in a frictionless undistorted market, the difference between markets spatially separated should only be explained by transaction costs. To test the hypothesis long-run equilibrium between prices was tested through a series of cointegration tests and an Error Correction model (ECM) was built for cointegrating price series. Model simulations were run and tests for asymmetry for cointegrating price series were conducted. A partial equilibrium framework was developed to determine price formation for Zambia’s sugar market from a number of behavioural equations. The study establishes cointegration in the spatial price transmission (between world sugar prices and Zambia’s wholesale prices) and vertically (between the domestic wholesale prices and sugarcane prices). The ECM for the spatial price transmission reveals low integration and efficiency evidenced by the low speed of adjustment, the Error Correction Term (ECT) of - 0. 09 and the model simulation, which shows that it takes approximately 3 years for the markets to revert to long run equilibrium after experiencing a price shock. The study also establishes that the spatial price adjustment is asymmetric. The vertical price transmission analysis reveals that it is relatively more integrated and efficient as it has a higher speed of adjustment (ECT of 0. 199) which is twice that of the spatial price transmission. The model simulation reveals that it takes about 1 year and 6 months to revert to long run equilibrium after experiencing a shock. The vertical price adjustment is also found to be symmetric. A negative short-run elasticity of - 0. 29 is found for the spatial price transmission while the long-run transmission is found to be inelastic (0. 91) which is close to unitary elasticity. The short-run vertical transmission is found to be very inelastic (0. 009) while the long-run transmission of 0. 94 is similar to the spatial transmission (inelastic but close to unitary). Farm to Retail Price Spreads are found to be widening with growing volatility owing to the volatile nature of the Retail Value. While the Farm Value has been increasing, recent spikes experienced in the Retail Value have resulted in an overall widening of the Farm to Retail Price Spread. The partial equilibrium analysis indicates that the price formation in Zambia’s sugar market is determined by the world price through the export parity price, domestic demand, supply conditions as well as policy. The elasticity between Zambia’s sugar price and the export parity price is found to be unitary (1. 09). The price space analysis reveals that although Zambia’s domestic price is correlated with the export parity prices it is trending closer to the <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>price.</b> This suggests that there are distortions in the sugar market, which may include high transaction costs, high concentration in the market structure as well as inappropriate policies such as high taxation, high interest rates and a policy requiring fortification of all sugar with Vitamin A, which are driving the domestic price upwards to exceed the export parity price. The sugar baseline for Zambia is generated for 2012 to 2015 based on a number of assumptions in the exogenous variables. Sugar production domestic use and exports are on the rise while the domestic price rises in 2011, falling between 2013 and 2014 then rising in 2014 to 2015. Model simulation of the removal and/or modification of the policy requiring sugar fortification reveals that there is an increase in the flow of imports to about 25, 000 tons per year. This results in a 3. 2 per cent loss in production and a 6. 1 per cent gain in exports while the domestic sugar price falls by 23. 9 US Cents/kg (18. 8 per cent). Thus Zambia gains in terms of increased consumer welfare and producer welfare because production losses are offset by revenue gains through exports since the world price also increases. The study recommends that transaction costs which include transportation costs, energy, taxation which are pushing the domestic price upwards need to be lowered. The study emphasises the need to promote investments in the sugar industry especially for smaller emerging sugar mills by lowering interest rates and taxes as well as a need to strengthen competition laws governing the industry which will protect consumers,would-be- investors and cane producers from uncompetitive pricing. It further recomments the lifting and /or modification of the barrier on imports of unfortified sugar but stresses that government can allow raw sugar imports which can be fortified in Zambia. A more open and undistorted sugar market in Zambia will result in a competitive, efficient and integrated market governed by market dynamics.

40|$|The world {{economic}} scenario {{is set for}} change under free trade regime, increasing competition and relative competitiveness of different countries. A significant change in economic policies of Pakistan has profound implications for national economy, the study of comparative advantage is of major importance to know the extent and potential for comparative advantage and competition of agricultural commodities. This {{is also important to}} identify the priorities for resource allocation among competing crops. This study is aimed at analyzing the changing agricultural comparative advantage over time and its implications for trade development. The extent of policy distortion and agricultural protection is also determined by the study. Four major corps i. e wheat, rice cotton and sugarcane are analyzed by taking the data of two main provinces for three harvesting years i. e 2001 - 01 to 2002 - 03. The data were analyzed to smooth out variations over time. Initially crop budgets were considered to analyzed the crop performance, in financial terms. Later on the <b>import</b> and export <b>parity</b> estimates were obtained to evaluate comparative advantage, in economic prices. The policy analysis matrix (PAM) was developed for four major crops that nearly consume 90 percent of the domestic resources and have high economic importance. The static analysis showed that Pakistan has comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices</b> for cotton and rice. The wheat and sugarcane have comparative advantage but at <b>import</b> <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> They have no comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> The DRC is fairly high for wheat and sugarcane. The analysis was further subjected to Risk analysis. The price of commodities and prices of DAP and Potash were taken as risk variables to evaluate comparative advantage and competitiveness of crops in the changing scenario. The risk analysis showed that rice and cotton in Pakistan have comparative advantage at export <b>parity</b> <b>prices.</b> Both maintained comparative edge even under price risk situation in wake of trade liberalization and export trade regimes in the next five years. The wheat and sugarcane showed a significant comparative advantage as import substitution crops but showed marginal competitiveness in the risk situation in the next five years, at national level. The analysis showed that Pakistan has to maintain competitive edge in rice and cotton through quality produce and value addition. The productivity of wheat and sugarcane should be enhanced along with reduction in cost of production. The subsidy on urea (given on gas) and irrigation water should be reviewed. Sugarcane is highly water consumptives crop. Its area may be reduced and the production loss thus created can be covered through manifold increase in yield...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper has been to {{quantify}} and discuss the implications of implicit taxes in Pakistan's agriculture. The methodology of the paper consisted of defining the <b>import</b> and export <b>parity</b> <b>prices</b> of major agricultural commodities grown in Pakistan, by comparing them with domestic procurement prices. Although the analysis covered only four commodities, implicit tax rates in some of the years from 1970 - 71 to 1989 - 90 were as high as 75 percent for certain commodities. It was only in the case of IRRI rice and sugarcane that domestic prices were above the world levels in some years of the period under consideration. When shown {{as a percentage of the}} value-added by agriculture, the taxes on these four commodities, net of the total budgetary subsidies on agricultural inputs, varied from 1. 9 percent to 14. 9 percent. These tax rates in agriculture compared favourably with the overall tax rates in Pakistan's economy for most of the years. Judged in the light of the relative taxable capacities of agriculture and Pakistan's economy as a whole, implicit taxes were much higher in agriculture than in the other sectors of the economy. ...|$|R
