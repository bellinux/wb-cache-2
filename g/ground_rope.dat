5000|$|This the commonest of the towed fishing gear; it is {{also known}} as [...] "otter trawling". Trawl nets are shaped like a funnel with the sides {{extended}} ahead to guide the fish into the net. Otter boards (sometimes called [...] "doors") spread the towing wires and keep the net open horizontally. The mouth of the net is held open vertically by the use of floats attached to the headline, while weight distributed along the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> allows the net to make good contact with the sea floor. The otter boards would scrape along the seabed making noises that attract fish. The fish would congregate between the boards keeping up with them until they tired and the net would then overtake them. This method is used mainly to catch the demersal species such as cod, haddock, whiting and flatfish. The boats themselves can be less than 10 metres in length for inshore fishing to 60 metres or more for deep sea fishing.|$|E
40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of <b>ground</b> <b>rope,</b> and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> shape. The author assumed the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a circulating tank. Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> for making a certain <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> and considered a fish herding model for the <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of <b>ground</b> <b>rope,</b> middle-weighted Bull Trawl type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> In the case of thinking on the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> to make a trapezoid-shape <b>ground</b> <b>rope.</b> It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> and the design of lacing lines...|$|E

We would like to report on the results of our investigation of catch of two types of trawl net. Results obtained can be as follows; Catch of fish grouped into eleven classes by their swimming layer and form of body, then catches of two types of trawl net were compared. Catches of otter trawl net was significantly larger than that of sea slater net in fishes of sea bream, flat head, sea robin, goosefish and flat fish, but they were almost equal in fishes of cutlassfish, squid and shrimp. It estimated that the fact originated in the difference of the reaction to the fishing gear in each types of fish. Gear efficiency of sea slater net depended on the distance from sea bottom. It was over 20 cm of distance from sea bottom that sea slater net indicated its gear efficiency. 31 species of fish were caught in ordinary net which attached bobbin typed <b>ground</b> <b>rope,</b> while in sea slater net which attached chain typed <b>ground</b> <b>rope,</b> 31 species of fish were caught in a series of experiment.

40|$|International audienceA {{dedicated}} trawling {{experiment was}} performed at three {{sites on the}} Gulf of Lion continental shelf, {{with the aim of}} assessing the resuspension of particulate and dissolved matter triggered by different types of trawls on muddy sediments. The different configurations were: (i) bottom trawl, with bobbin for <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> (Rockhopper) : (ii) bottom trawl, without bobbin (Medits); and (iii) pelagic trawl, towed at 1 and 10 m above the seabed.;The plumes of resuspended sediment were measured using the acoustic backscattered intensity, from a towed ADCP. Concomitant profiles of particle size-distribution, light transmission and water samples were collected, outside and inside the plumes. The analysis of the data enabled derivation of the major physical and chemical characteristics of the plumes generated by the trawls; likewise, and to quantify the resuspension fluxes of sediment, particulate (PN, POC) and dissolved (nutrients) elements. The residence time and dispersal of the plumes were monitored and modelled, considering the settling velocity of the particulate matter and the near-bottom turbulence.;The results indicate that the bottom trawls produce significant resuspension, whilst the near-bottom and mid-water pelagic trawls have no impact upon the sediment. The sediment clouds at several hundreds metres astern of the bottom trawls are 3 - 6 m high and 70 - 200 m, wide; they were generated both by the otter doors and the net. The average suspended sediment concentrations measured in the plumes reach 50 mg l(- 1). Resuspension fluxes of sediment along the path of the trawls range from 190 g m(- 2) s(- 1), for the coarsest sediment (clayey silt) to 800 g m(- 2) s(- 1) for the finest sediment (silty clay). Whilst the resuspended loads of dissolved elements (nutrients) within the plume segment suggest a release of porewater, present at least in the first few centimetres of sediment, the particulate matter load only resulted from the resuspension of less than 1 mm thickness of the sediment bed. This discrepancy shows that a very small fraction of the sediment ploughed by the trawl is effectively injected into the water column.;The monitoring of the settling of the plumes indicates a rapid decay of the sediment load, during the first hour after its generation. Some of the sediment (about 10 - 15 % of the initial load) remains in suspension; this is due, probably, to the near-bottom turbulence that prevents the redeposition of the fine particles and aggregates. Lateral spreading of the plume is strongly dependent upon the variability of horizontal currents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{with the use of}} the three kinds of trawling net using of by the fishing boats, namely, trawlers, bull trawlers or Danish seiners belonging to the groups of the fishing boats of the mother ship fishery, fishing on the continental shelf of the eastern part of the Bering Sea including near the shelf, during the term from April to October for the three years of 1963, 1965 and 1967. As to the items of the fishing gears used in this research, in table 3, are shown the tonnage of the fishing boat, its number and the scale of the net used in this experiment. Namely, the number of the monther ship is 3; the number of the fishing boats belonging to those mother ships, is as in the following : ― the number of the side trawlers with tonnage of 370, is 2; that of the stern trawlers with the tonnage of 299, is 3; the total of which being 5; that of the bull trawler with the tonnage of 121 and with the tonnage of 98, is 4 and 2; the total number of with being 6; the total number of the Danish seiner is, 11; with the tonnage range from 65 to 92. In case of those trawling nets, in accordance with varieties in the sort of the net, a considerable difference is to be noted both in the weight of the <b>ground</b> <b>rope</b> and in the buoyancy of the float, but the whole lengths of the nets are almost equal. As may be seen in the introduction of this thesis, the purpose of this research is as in the following : ― through the three sorts of the fishing net used as the materials of this experimental research, namely, the trawl net, the bull trawl net, and the Danish seine, the following 3 items were aimed : (1) the attempted clarifications of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net by means of actual measurements and the model experiments; (2) the confirmation of the fundamental characteristics in the designing and making-up the respective net; (3) accompanied with the analyses of the physical and biological factors in drawing the design of the trawling net in possession of high effectivity. The experimental methods used in this research are as in the following : 1. With the use of Radar equipped on board of the mother ship lying at anchor, some tracings were made of the towing speed and the removing distance concerning the nets towed by trawlers, bull trawlers and Danish seiners and as the result of the tracings the sweeping area of the actual net towing was counted, and after combining this counted value with the value of the filtering volume, which will by mentioned in item 3, some numerical value, which is assumed to be indispensable for the determination of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net, was obtained. 2. Concerning Danish seine, in the three stages of the commencement of net to wing, its finishing and the end of net-lifting, the gradual changes in the status of boat and net happening in the lapse of time, were ascertained with the use of experimental models in 50 m. -pool, with the counting clarification of the towing speed, interval between the wing ends, and the sweeping area of the towing rope. 3. On the three sorts of trawling net (trawl net, bull trawl net, Danish seine), model experiments were carried out; and in those experiments, first the area of the net mouth under towing was counted, and {{with the use of the}} counted value, the filtering volume was fixed out, and after combining this with the sweeping area mentioned in item 1, some numerical value was fixed, and by which the fishing efficiency of the various kinds of fishing net was compared. 4. For the purpose of using as the fundamental criterion in drawing the basic designs of the respective trawling net, the following experiments were carried out : ― a) Three sorts of trawling net having the bag nets made to be equal typed, in spite of their being made of 2 sheets, 4 sheets and 6 sheets of net, each of which being typical of the trawling net, were designed, and with the use of these, some model experiments were carried out, and the respective characteristics and efficiency were brought under comparative examinations. b) Concerning the shape of the net under towing, its resistance against the flowing water and the behaviours of the fish schools entering into the net; the causes of such phenomena were put under considerate examinations, and the distribution of the current velocities in and out of the net were measured by using model nets. c) The border line of the limited possibilities of making the turning movements or the respective fish body within the bag net, in other words, the dimension of the swimming capabilities was fixed experimentally. d) The problem of what behaviour is to be taken by the fish schools against the variations of the flowing velocity within the bag net, was put under consideration to bring it to a reasonable solution, in connection with the size of the fish body and in that with the size and the scale of the fish schools, respectively; and at the same, the net formation and the net resistance at that time, were put under investigations. e) In the 50 m. -pool, using gold fish, the behaviours of the fish schools to the rope were brought under grasping, with the investigations of the driving-in effects of the net performed...|$|E
