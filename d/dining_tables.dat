500|$|As {{early as}} 1876, there were rumours of an engagement. However, several hurdles {{had to be}} {{overcome}} before a marriage could take place. While the Jewish Rothschilds were accepted into society, and indeed were close friends of {{some members of the}} royal family including the Prince of Wales, as elsewhere in Europe, antisemitic feelings were prevalent in the upper echelons of society and particularly so among those closest to the Queen at court, where following the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 the Rothschilds became pointedly excluded. The Queens equerry Arthur Edward Hardinge referred to the Rothschild's <b>dining</b> <b>tables</b> as [...] "resplendent with the Hebrew gold" [...] going so far as to say a visiting Russian royal needed a [...] "corrective" [...] visit to Westminster Abbey following acceptance of Rothschild hospitality. Queen Victoria herself expressed antisemitic views in 1873 when it was proposed that Lionel de Rothschild be elevated to the peerage the Queen refused and expressed a reluctance to make a Jew a peer– saying [...] "to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to" [...] and furthermore stated to give [...] "a title and mark of her approbation to a Jew". Lord Spencer advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against attending a Rothschild ball with the words [...] "The Prince ought only to visit those of undoubted position in Society." [...] However, this did not prevent the Prince from accepting Rothschild's invitations and gifts privately. While one could be friends with Jews and accept their hospitality, their social status was still not sufficiently elevated to include marriage into the peerage without unfavourable comment.|$|E
