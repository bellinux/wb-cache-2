5|$|The plot of Guillaume {{revolves}} around the common theme of the , a young man who, because of a wager (in the case of Guillaume, because of jealousy) needs to find a young woman's favor. He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded, causing the ruin of a husband (if the gageure had claimed to have succeeded with another man's wife) or, in this case, the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> a brother. Usually the young man's story is believed at first because he reveals an intimate detail about a young woman, who then has to prove her innocence.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill's plays {{were among}} the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve {{characters}} on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, but ultimately slide into disillusionment and <b>despair.</b> <b>Of</b> his very few comedies, only one is well-known (Ah, Wilderness!). Nearly all of his other plays involve some degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.|$|E
25|$|Crimea was the {{background}} for Adam Mickiewicz's seminal work, The Crimean Sonnets {{inspired by his}} 1825 travel. A series of 18 sonnets constitute an artistic telling of a journey to and through the Crimea, they feature romantic descriptions of the oriental nature {{and culture of the}} East which show the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> an exile longing for the homeland, driven from his home by a violent enemy.|$|E

25|$|The {{toxicological}} {{cause of}} the disease {{has been attributed to}} the neurotoxin ODAP which acts as a structural analogue of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Ingestion of legumes containing the toxin occurs, although knowledge of how to detoxify Lathyrus is present, but drought conditions can lead to fuel and water shortages preventing the necessary steps from being taken, particularly in impoverished countries. Lathyrism usually occurs where the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> poverty and malnutrition leaves few other food options. Lathyrism can also be caused by food adulteration.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996, Warner LeRoy, {{who owned}} Tavern on the Green, bought the {{restaurant}} from Stewart-Gordon for $6.5 million {{and closed it}} down, much to the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> New York high society. After four years and $36 million in renovations, it reopened, {{but it was never}} the same; it closed with little notice on Sunday, July 28, 2002, after declaring bankruptcy. LeRoy's health was failing. Also, the local economy did not recover quickly enough to make payments on the substantial loans for the renovations.|$|E
25|$|From this point, the English fielding {{began to}} go {{downhill}} in no uncertain fashion. Sheppard ran round and round a skier from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely. This is the worst fielding I had seen from an M.C.C team. Bailey emulated Sheppard by running round and round a catch, and not touching it, and Brown seemed to <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen would know that they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E

25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} to Hell and {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast to}} the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the agony and the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse.|$|E

Burglar Michael Rodwell {{played by}} comedian Les Dennis, was introduced through a restorative justice storyline with Gail McIntyre.

Hayley {{was diagnosed with}} a terminal cancer of the pancreas after a check-up in 2013. Hayley decided to end her life before she succumbs to her illness much to the <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> her husband Roy Cropper. Roy reluctantly agreed to his wife's demands and Hayley drank a concoction of mashed up pills and died in bed of an overdose with her husband lying beside her.|$|E

Five of {{the character}}s give insight, called confessions, of what was their previous sexual experience with Hester, and Hester presents her own thoughts near the end. The Doctor's confession is how Hester gave herself {{to help him out}} of <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> being alone. The Welfare lady's confession is her first threesome experience thanks to Hester's assistance. Amiga Gringa's confession is what sexual experience Hester and she had to make money together. Reverend D's confession is how Hester's predicament turned him toward God. Finally, Hester's confession is about men's quick love and that she should have thousands of bad children.|$|E

25|$|The {{youngest}} in the group, Lester has {{the ability}} to shape-shift, and appears initially in the series as a teen with long red hair tied in a single braid. He has a rather sadistic personality. He is particularly skillful at creating illusions. It is later revealed he is the incarnation of Aporia's preteen years, and his <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> becoming an orphan. Lester's ace monster is Meklord Emperor Skiel. He transfers into Duel Academy in order to get close to Luna, and ends up dueling both her and Leo. After the duel, Lester wipes the memories of the Duel Academy students so they behave like he doesn't exist. He is also the first character in the series to use a Duel Board.|$|E
25|$|The marbles {{generally}} {{were very}} dirty...from a deposit {{of dust and}} soot....I found {{the body of the}} marble beneath the surface white....The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt....The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt...but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed....The examination has made me <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> the possibility of presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} time between the 1930s and the 1950s was one of growth and {{expansion}} for social group work (Alissi, 1980; Wilson, 1976). The economic <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> and varied psychosocial needs resultant of the Great Depression {{paved the way for}} greater affiliation between the social work profession and the field of group work (Alissi, 1980; Konopka, 1983; Wilson, 1976). The psychological needs of returning war veterans who served in World War II resulted in the more frequent application of social group work in psychiatric treatment (Konopka, 1983). During this {{period of time}} not only would the field of social group work debut at the National Conference for Social Work but additional advances would be made. Academic courses and research institutions were established; a professional organization was formed, The American Association of Social Work with Groups (AAGW); and a journal, The Group, was established. The first textbooks would appear as well, written by Harleigh Trecker (1948) and Gertrude Wilson and Gladys Ryland (1949).|$|E
