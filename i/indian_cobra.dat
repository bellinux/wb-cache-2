25|$|Snake House is the serpentarium of the Lahore Zoo. It {{was closed}} in June 2007 when about 20 snakes {{died because of}} suffocation. After being renovated, it was reopened on April 30, 2010.

25|$|In December 2015, the zoo rescued a {{juvenile}} <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra</b> which had stowed {{away on a}} cargo ship destined for New Jersey. The snake was found in poor condition being dehydrated, cold, and exposed to oil residue. The animal {{was brought to the}} zoo for recovery. It's unclear how the snake got onto the ship since it set out from Singapore, which is outside of the species' natural range.|$|E
25|$|The name swamp adder is an invented one, and the {{scientific}} treatises of Doyle's time do not mention any kind of adder of India. To fans of Sherlock Holmes who enjoy treating the stories as altered accounts of real events, the true identity of this snake has been a puzzle {{since the publication of}} the story, even to professional herpetologists. Many species of snakes have been proposed for it, and Richard Lancelyn Green concludes the <b>Indian</b> <b>Cobra</b> (Naja naja) is the snake which it most closely resembles, rather than Boa constrictor, which is not venomous. The <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra</b> has black and white speckled marks, {{and is one of the}} most lethal of the Indian venomous snakes with a neurotoxin which will often kill in a few minutes. It is also a good climber and is used by snake charmers in India. Snakes are deaf in the conventional sense but have vestiges to sense vibrations and low-frequency airborne sounds, making it remotely plausible to signal a snake by whistling.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the advent}} of antivenom, bites from some species of snake were almost universally fatal. Despite huge {{advances}} in emergency therapy, antivenom is often still the only effective treatment for envenomation. The first antivenom was developed in 1895 by French physician Albert Calmette {{for the treatment of}} <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra</b> bites. Antivenom is made by injecting a small amount of venom into an animal (usually a horse or sheep) to initiate an immune system response. The resulting antibodies are then harvested from the animal's blood.|$|E

50|$|Reptiles like <b>Indian</b> pythons, <b>Indian</b> <b>cobras,</b> krait, rat snakes, vipers, keelbacks {{and grass}} snakes are nocturnal animals, and are {{therefore}} rarely seen. There are many species of turtles as well as amphibians found {{in or near the}} water bodies.|$|R

25|$|In Myanmar (Burma), {{approximately}} 70 to 80% of bites are {{inflicted by}} the Russell's viper, which is frequently found in rice fields. In Japan, {{the majority of}} venomous bites are inflicted by the Asian pit vipers. In Sri Lanka, approximately 40% of bites are caused by the Russell's viper, while 35% are caused by the <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra.</b> In Thailand, the monocled cobra {{is responsible for the}} majority of snakebite fatalities. Tea plantations are sometimes associated with elapids such as the common cobras and the king cobra.|$|E
25|$|The reptile fauna {{recorded}} {{from the}} park is 47 and six of them are endemic. Sri Lankan krait, Boulenger's keelback, Sri Lankan flying snake, painted-lip lizard, Wiegmann's agama, and Bahir's fan-throated lizard are the endemic species. The coastal line of the park is visited by the all five globally endangered sea turtles (leatherback turtle, olive ridley, loggerhead sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, and green turtle) that visit Sri Lanka. The two breeding crocodile species of Sri Lanka, mugger crocodile and saltwater crocodile, inhabit the park. The <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra</b> and Russell's viper are among the other reptiles.|$|E
25|$|On the Indian subcontinent, {{almost all}} snakebite deaths have {{traditionally}} been attributed to the Big Four, consisting of the Russell's viper, <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra,</b> saw-scaled viper, and the common krait. However, {{studies have shown that}} the hump-nosed viper, previously considered essentially harmless and misidentified as the saw-scaled viper, is capable of delivering a fatal bite. In regions of Kerala, India, it may be responsible for nearly 10% of venomous bites. Commonly used antivenoms in India do not appear to be effective against hump-nosed viper bites. According to the most conservative estimates, at least 81,000 snake envenomings and 11,000 fatalities occur in India each year, making it the most heavily affected country in the world. The Malayan pit viper and banded krait are two other species involved in a significant number of venomous bites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>cobras</b> are oviparous and {{lay their}} eggs between the months of April and July. The female snake usually lays between 10 and 30 eggs in rat holes or termite mounds and the eggs hatch 48 to 69 days later. The {{hatchlings}} measure between 20 and 30 cm in length. The hatchlings are independent from birth and have fully functional venom glands.|$|R

5000|$|This {{species is}} highly venomous. The {{subcutaneous}} [...] for the venom of W. aegyptia is 0.4 mg/kg. For comparison, the <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra's</b> (Naja naja) subcutaneous [...] is 0.80 mg/kg, while the Cape cobra's (Naja nivea) subcutaneous [...] is 0.72 mg/kg. This makes the W. aegyptia (or Desert Black Snake) a more venomous snake than both. [...] Like all elapid snakes, the venom is primarily neurotoxic {{and effects of}} envenenomation are from systemic circulation of the toxins rather than from local effect on tissue {{near the site of}} injection.|$|R
2500|$|Two of {{the largest}} snakes in the world (the {{reticulated}} python and the rock python) {{as well as the}} longest venomous snake in the world (the king cobra) are common inside the park. The park also contains Bengal monitor and water monitor populations. The park is home to the rare monocled cobra, as well as three of the Big Four â€” <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra,</b> Russell's viper and common krait.|$|E
2500|$|Fauna: The mammals {{found here}} are Indian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus indicus), gaur (Bos gaurus), sambar (Cervus unicolor), chital or spotted deer (Axis axis), muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) or barking deer, mouse deer (Moschiola indica), bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata), slender loris (Loris tardigradus), red giant flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurista), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), Indian leopard (Panthera pardus), {{common palm civet}} (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), dhole or Asiatic wild dog (Cuon alpinus), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), golden jackal (Canis aureus), ruddy mongoose (Herpestes smithii), smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), Indian pangolin (Manis crassicaudata). Among the 230 species of birds identified here, some of the important groups include herons, storks, egrets, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, wildfowl, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias. Reptiles like marsh crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), Indian pond terrapin, starred tortoise (Geochelone elegans), common Indian monitor (Varanus bengalensis), Indian chameleon (Chamaeleo zeylanicus), skinks (Mabuya spp.), geckos (Hemidactylus), common rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra</b> (Naja naja), Russell's viper (Daboia russelli), common krait (Bungarus caeruleus), Indian python (Python molurus), checkered keelback, green whip snake, common Indian bronzeback (Dendrelaphis tristis) and trinket snake (Elaphe helena) are found here ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the genus}} Elaps, above {{referred}} to, the very peculiar style of colour and marking is evidently a [...] "warning colour" [...] {{for the purpose}} of indicating to snake-eating birds and mammals that these species are poisonous; and this throws light on the long-disputed question of the use of the rattle of the rattlesnake. This reptile is really both sluggish and timid, and is very easily captured by those who know its habits. If gently tapped on the head with a stick, it will coil itself up and lie still, only raising its tail and rattling. It may then be easily caught. This shows that the rattle is a warning to its enemies that it is dangerous to proceed to extremities; and the creature has probably acquired this structure and habit because it frequents open or rocky districts where protective colour is needful to save it from being pounced upon by buzzards or other snake-eaters. Quite parallel in function is the expanded hood of the <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra,</b> a poisonous snake which belongs also to the Elapidae. This is, no doubt, a warning to its foes, not an attempt to terrify its prey; and the hood has been acquired, {{as in the case of}} the rattlesnake, because, protective coloration being on the whole useful, some mark was required to distinguish it from other protectively coloured, but harmless, snakes. Both these species feed on active creatures capable of escaping if their enemy were visible at a moderate distance.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1981, this zoo and children's park covers nearly 2.4 {{hectares}} and hosts {{a variety}} of fauna including blackbuck, spotted deer (chital), jackal, crocodile, <b>Indian</b> peafowl, <b>cobra,</b> python, bear, panther, boar, etc. This zoo is due to be relocated to a new facility.|$|R
50|$|The type of snake {{that most}} often {{delivers}} serious bites {{depends on the}} region of the world. In Africa it is mambas, Egyptian cobras, puff adders, and carpet vipers. In the Middle East it is carpet vipers and elapids. In Central and South America it is snakes of the Bothrops and Crotalus types, the latter including rattlesnakes. In North America, rattlesnakes are the primary concern, and up to 95% of all snakebite-related deaths in the United States are attributed to the western and eastern diamondback rattlesnakes. In South Asia it was previously believed that <b>Indian</b> <b>cobras,</b> common kraits, Russell's viper and carpet vipers were the most dangerous; other snakes, however, may also cause significant problems in this area of the world.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>cobra's</b> celebrity {{comes from}} its {{popularity}} as a Nipaie {{of choice for}} snake charmers. The cobra's dramatic threat posture makes for a unique spectacle as it appears to sway {{to the tune of}} a snake charmer's flute. Snake charmers with their cobras in a wicker basket are a common sight in many parts of India only during the Nag Panchami or Naagula Chavithi festival. The cobra is deaf to the snake charmer's pipe, but follows the visual cue of the moving pipe and it can sense the ground vibrations from the snake charmer's tapping. Sometimes, for the sake of safety, all the venom in the cobra's teeth is removed. The snake-charmers sell the venom at a very high price. In the past Indian snake charmers also conducted cobra and mongoose fights. These gory fight shows, in which the snake was usually killed, are now illegal.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{hematology}} and serum biochemistry parameters of <b>Indian</b> spectacled <b>cobra</b> (Naja naja) and Indian rat snake (Ptyas mucosa) and {{to evaluate the}} differences in the same between captive and wild populations. Materials and Methods: Animals were categorized into four groups, viz., wild <b>Indian</b> spectacled <b>cobra</b> (n= 10), wild Indian rat snakes (n= 10), captive <b>Indian</b> spectacled <b>cobra</b> (n= 10), and captive Indian rat snake (n= 10). The snakes were restrained with restraint tubes, and 2 ml of blood was collected from either heart or ventral coccygeal vein. Hematological examinations were performed manually and serum biochemistry assays were performed on semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Results: The values of total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume, and hemoglobin were slightly low in captive spectacled cobras and captive rat snakes compared to wild ones, whereas total leukocyte count was found to be slightly high in wild spectacled cobras compared to captive ones. All the recorded values of biochemical and electrolyte analytes were found to be well within expected range for snakes except for total protein and chloride levels in both the species which was slightly above the expected range. Conclusion: The hematology and serum biochemistry intervals of the two most common Indian snakes are presented here. The data will be useful in routine health evaluations and aiding in better medical management of the species studied. Since this study is the first to report complete hematologic and blood biochemical ranges for the study species, observations made here can also be used as referral intervals for future use...|$|R

40|$|A fibrinogenolytic toxin of {{molecular}} weight 6. 5 kDa has been purified from the venom of <b>Indian</b> monocled <b>cobra</b> (Naja kaouthia) by repeated cation exchange chromatography on CM-sephadex C- 50. The purified toxin {{did not show}} any phospholipase activity but was mildly hemolytic on human erythrocytes. This toxin, called Lahirin, cleaved fibrinogen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The digestion process apparently started with the AÎ± chain, and gradually other lower-molecular-weight chains were also cleaved to low-molecular-weight peptides. The fibrinolytic activity was completely lost after treatment with ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). However, exposure to 100 Â°C for 1 min or pre-treatment with phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) {{did not affect the}} fibrinolytic activity. Cleavage of di-sulphide bonds by Î²-mercaptoethanol or unfolding the protein with 4 M urea caused complete loss of activity of pure Lahirin.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{parasitic}} fauna on serpentines under captive condition in zoological park of Tamilnadu, India. Methods: Fecal {{samples were collected}} from (n = 247) serpentines, Arignar Anna Zoological Park (n = 22), Vandalur, Tamilnadu, India and Snake Park (n = 27), Guindy, Tamilnadu, India and screened for endoparasites using sedimentation techniques. Ectoparasites were also reported in this study. Results: Coprological examination (n = 247) from captive snakes (n = 49) on random analysis revealed strongyles were predominant in Arignar Anna Zoological Park, Vandalur and Snake Park, Guindy, however the parasites were absent in king cobras (Ophiophagus hannah). Eggs of Capillaria sp. showed less predominance in Vandalur and Gunidy. Rat snakes [Ptyas mucosus (P. mucosus) ] showed higher prevalence of strongyle infection in Vandalur, and Russellâ€™s viper (Daboia russelii) showed higher prevalence in Guindy. Study on ectoparasites revealed Aponomma gerviasii ticks in P. mucosus, <b>Indian</b> <b>cobras</b> (Naja naja), king cobras (Ophiophagus hannah), reticulated pythons (Python reticulates) and Indian rock pythons (Python molurus), among them, the most heavy infestation was documented in P. mucosus (n = 9).
