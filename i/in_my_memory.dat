25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory.</b> He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> as the time when I won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday.

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E
500|$|In Entertainment Weekly, Alejandro Garay wrote, [...] "One of my {{favorite}} episodes of 2008 was Lost’s 'The Constant.' [...] It was a beautiful episode that made us fans {{fall in love with}} the show even more. [...] The creators managed to build momentum with smart narrative, by using the romance card to develop such a complicated topic as time traveling. [...] It was exquisite, mind-blowing, impeccably done, and unforgettable." [...] Bill Keveney of USA Today wrote that it is [...] "arguably the most highly praised episode of [...] well-received fourth season", while his colleague Robert Bianco deemed Henry Ian Cusick worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times called the episode a [...] "mind-blowing tour de force". [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "for-the-ages episode" [...] with [...] "a classic Lost moment" [...] in Desmond and Penny's phone call and [...] "an especially spine-tingling performance" [...] by Cusick. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday wrote, [...] "last night's forty-four minutes of Lost were among the most satisfying forty-four minutes in front of the tube in my life." [...] He added that [...] "it wasn't merely a brilliant episode, which pushed the mythology forward more rapidly and richly than any episode <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory,</b> but it was an emotional release … I actually cried when Penny and Desmond finally…connected" [...] and [...] "there wasn't one, single, solitary false note". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "it was brilliantly executed, as both a brain-twister and as a love story" [...] with an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance by Jeremy Davies. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "the best single outing since season 1's 'Walkabout'" [...] and named the phone call between Desmond and Penny the best moment of the season excluding any moments from the then yet-to-air season finale. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard described [...] "The Constant" [...] as [...] "mindblowing" [...] and cited it as [...] "the reason the hardcore fans love Lost." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that [...] "the time-tripping went into overdrive with this week's brilliant episode … [...] worked beautifully as a showcase for Henry Ian Cusick as the tormented Desmond. [...] It was almost a stand-alone episode, a Twilight Zone/X-Files-style adventure with a start, middle and killer finish." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé's {{mother and}} {{designer}} Tina Knowles, House of Deréon, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Elie Saab and Herve Leger {{served as the}} designers for the outfits of the tour. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the clothes as mainly silvery, ranging from miniskirts to formal dresses, flesh-toned bodysuit to bikini to negligee. Pareles further noted that [...] "The wardrobe entices men, but it's also a means of self-assertion". J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the costumes during the show as [...] "spangly". Lee Hildebrand of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the costumes saying that [...] "every one [...] fabulously glamorous, most of them tailored to highlight the singer's ample cleavage {{and a pair of}} legs to rival Tina Turner's. At one point, when the legs were concealed by a long scarlet gown, wind blew from underneath to expose them." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe praised the floor-length gown but disliked the tinfoil mini worn by Knowles. Lisnaree Vichitsorasatra of The Nation praised Knowles' look, saying that she was like a [...] "glittering goddess in a revealing outfit". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter also echoed her statements, [...] "to say that Beyonce looks terrific is probably redundant. Her fashion parade of form-fitting, eye-catching costumes -- most notably a belly dancer's get-up in which she demonstrated some hip-shaking moves that indicated Shakira better watch her back -- provided ample opportunities for shameless leering." [...] John Aizlewood of the Daily Mail described the fashion as [...] "majestic". Gordon Smart from the newspaper The Sun praised the [...] "sexy costumes" [...] like the silvery dresses worn by Knowles and added that [...] "her audiences certainly haven't had a bum deal". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "the camouflage outfits her male dancers sometimes wore... felt right for a show that sometimes seemed like a military operation, expertly executed." [...] Irish Independents Eamon Sweeney noted that Knowles looked [...] "absolutely stunning" [...] and added, [...] "I have to confess that the sight of Beyoncé ripping off a short cocktail dress to reveal a barely there bodysuit will linger <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> for years to come." [...] A writer of The StarPhoenix wrote that Knowles looked like a [...] "silver-clad siren rose" [...] further saying that [...] "it was almost surreal to see the woman who frequents the covers of fashion magazines in the same room". Tonya Turner from The Courier-Mail praised Knowles for looking [...] "every bit the dream girl in a sparkling silver floorlength gown".|$|E

Michael Medved stated: [...] "My main objection to Million Dollar Baby always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female Rocky, with barely {{a hint of the}} pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer [...] [...] [...] to declare that 'no movie <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>memory</b> has depressed me more than Million Dollar Baby.'" ...|$|E

And so somebody got a burnt cork and produced the moustache and a comb on the hair, and there they were assembled before me, all this mass of gold braid. And I gave them several minutes of harangue in mock-German, and eventually I finished and a great roar went up with a mass of hands going up at forty-five degrees baying [...] "Sieg, heil!, Sieg, heil!"
