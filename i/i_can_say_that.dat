In Tommy Smith's view, Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool; he loved the supporters and they loved him, mainly [...] "because they knew he understood them".|$|E
500|$|According to Ivry, {{many of the}} SAM {{batteries}} were on the Syrian side of the border. [...] Said Eitan, [...] "From {{the operational}} point of view <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we used the mini-RPVs, long before the war, to identify and locate all the Syrian missile batteries. We then used superior electronic devices which enabled us to [...] "blind" [...] or neutralize the missile sites' ground-to-air radar. We rendered them ineffective to take reliable fixes on our aircraft aloft. But in advance of direct aerial attacks, we used long-range artillery".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was happy}} with his players after they had come from behind to win the match: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} game. We were controlling the game, passing the ball around and then {{we made a mistake}} and had to work really hard to get back. They played well, but I think we controlled the game. To score three goals is not easy. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory." [...] With five days of the transfer window left, Benítez refused to speculate on whether Liverpool would sign Michael Owen, stating, [...] "I like good players, {{we have a lot of}} them here." ...|$|E

It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E
500|$|West {{released}} his first album, Blue Cowboy, in 1987. Blue Cowboy is {{an album of}} three original songs and five covers. Chuck Yarborough of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, [...] "Listening to the first excerpt of his [...] "Blue Cowboy" [...] made me balk—you'll pardon the expression—at listening to the second. But I did. And the third. And so on. And now? Well, if I'm Nashville, I run West outta the game. The Hook. The Heave-Ho. The Thumb." [...] In a September 2012 review, music blog Long After Dark said, [...] "Blue Cowboy easily ranks with Ron Artest and Carl Lewis {{as one of the}} worst albums that a sports figure has cut ... ever. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I managed {{to make it through the}} record, although it was not easy." ...|$|E

500|$|The Mozarts {{were free}} to leave Milan early in November, but they stayed another month because Leopold hoped {{that the success of}} Ascanio would lead to an {{appointment}} for Wolfgang from a royal patron. He apparently solicited Archduke Ferdinand on 30 November, and his request was passed on to the imperial court in Vienna. It is possible that Leopold's pushiness in Vienna over La finta semplice still rankled, or that word of his crowing over Hasse's failure had reached the Empress. For whatever reason, Maria Theresa's reply to the archduke was unequivocal, describing the Mozarts as [...] "useless people" [...] whose appointment would debase the royal service, and adding that [...] "such people go around the world like beggars". Leopold never learned this letter's contents; by the time it reached Milan the Mozarts had left, disappointed but still hopeful. [...] "The matter is not over; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> much", Leopold wrote as he and Wolfgang made their way home.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything in this whole career that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

2500|$|The seventh series {{aired in}} early 1991. Jason and Sullivan were {{involved}} with other projects, and {{it was confirmed that}} there were no plans for a new series.

In late 1996, three more one-hour episodes were filmed, to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received and, due to the ending, were assumed to be the last. The show made a return in Christmas 2001 with the first of three new episodes which were shot together but ultimately broadcast over three consecutive Christmases from 2001 to 2003. Despite rumours of further episodes, in a 2008 interview, Sullivan was quoted as saying: [...] "There will not be another series of Only Fools And Horses. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> We had our day, it was wonderful but it is best to leave it now".
