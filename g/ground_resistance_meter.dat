A method for calculating the <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance</b> was presented in [2] based on the theoretical manipulations of the numerical moment method and the current image. This method {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the substation grounding grid design. Ref. [3] presented an analysis on evaluating grounding grids of different shapes in substations. Different shapes of grounding grids have also been considered in [4] in calculating <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> using the finite-element method (FEM). A substation grounding grid has been analyzed with the variation of soil layer depth in [5]. Ref. [6] conducted a study where they measured the impedances of four grounding grids using tuned-frequency test equipment operating close to the system operating frequency. FEM was used in [7] for computing the <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance.</b> A scheme was proposed in [8] for calculating the <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> using FEM to the resolution of solid models in 3 D view. As discussed in many literatures including [3, 4, 7], although FEMs are the most accurate methods for computing <b>grounding</b> grid <b>resistance,</b> these methods are quiet complicated and time consuming for grounding system design purpose. In [9], it is shown that the low or high resistivity soil layer formed in raining or freezing season affects the safety of grounding system, and leads to the changes of <b>grounding</b> <b>resistance</b> of the <b>grounding</b> system, step and touch voltages on the ground surface. A practical example of <b>ground</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement has been presented in a 154  kV substation under commercial operating condition [10].
