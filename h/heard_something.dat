Approximately 15 minutes later, Ruetten made {{the first of several}} unanswered calls home {{over the course of the}} day. Rasmussen's sister also called without answer. At noon, two men, who the neighbor believed were gardeners in the compound, gave her and her husband a purse they had found that turned out to be Rasmussen's. A maid cleaning a nearby unit said she <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> that sounded like two people fighting, and then something falling, at around 12:30p.m.|$|E
25|$|Adams was {{appointed}} as West Indies captain in 2000, replacing Brian Lara. He would not last long, leading {{the team to}} a 5–0 series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia; after the tour he lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and {{his place in the}} national team. News of his impending termination was broken to Adams by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. The ever-cool Jamaican simply responded, ¨Have you <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> I haven't?¨ He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened it had all been a blessing – both the good and bad. Adams´ grace {{in the face of what}} would crush many a lesser person reflects the nature of the man; a cricketer whose best attributes can never be recorded on the score sheets.|$|E

25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the grand jury {{that by the time}} Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but that he could not recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the grand jury that he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E

[...] "The Oceanides was totally and completely different from three years ago under Schnéevoigt", he wrote. [...] "In this beautiful poem one really <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> of {{the sound of the}} Aegean Sea and of Homer".|$|E

Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but gets no response, leading him to say [...] "it's nothing" [...] to the girl and assure her that they [...] "are alone". The girl says [...] " [...] ok, that's good", after which she turns to face the boy, revealing her facial morph into her true identity; a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck. She is later revealed to be Darla.|$|E

The second time I was so nervous that I began to sing to keep my spirits up, and I went on singing till three of the hands of the Susan Emily, wot was lying alongside, came up from the fo'c'sle and offered to fight me.

500|$|As for her name, Kubo stated that, because Kuchiki [...] "looks like a shinigami", {{he wanted}} her name to sound like {{something}} a shinigami would have as a name. When deciding upon her family name he considered using [...] because {{it sounded like a}} name a shinigami would have, and then decided to use [...] He adds that he once <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> that sounded like [...] "Kuchiki Rukia" [...] on Japanese television, and liked it enough {{to use it as a}} name. Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E

Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> salacious; she also wore {{her hair in}} a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical [...] "one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy", and, [...] "is this the party to whom I am speaking?" [...] In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.

2500|$|Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye {{would seek}} {{inspiration}} in fellow label mates such as David Ruffin of The Temptations and Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] and [...] "That's the Way Love Is". Later in his life, Gaye {{reflected on the}} influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, [...] "I had <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> in their voices something my own voice lacked". He further explained, [...] "the Tempts and Tops' music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man." ...|$|E

The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his {{daughter}} Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During his {{appearance}} at Libby's trial, Cooper recounted how he first learned about Valerie Wilson on July 11, 2003, from Rove.

[...] "Don't go too far out on Wilson," [...] Cooper recalled Rove saying, adding that Wilson's wife worked at [...] "the agency." [...] Rove reportedly ended the call by saying, [...] "I've already said too much."

It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was {{obviously}} the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It {{gave me a chance to}} say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E

I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E

[...] Saying that his album Darkness on the Edge of Town was [...] "filled with Animals," [...] Springsteen played the opening riffs to [...] "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" [...] and his own [...] "Badlands" [...] back to back, then said, [...] "Listen up, youngsters!

In the sixth inning, he took over {{pitching}} duties, and in his next at bat he hit a home run. However, during the swing, he suffered an injury in his abdominal area. According to Jack Chapman, who played for the Atlantics, when Creighton crossed home plate, he commented to Flanley that he <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> snap, thinking {{that it might have}} been his belt. After the game, he began to experience severe pain and hemorrhaging in his abdomen. He died in his father's home on October18 at the age of 21.

2500|$|The band showed promise but had yet {{to evolve}} into a decent line-up capable of {{fulfilling}} it and spent several years treading water. According to their publisher Charlie Pinder: [...] "They were a band {{that everyone in the}} A community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren’t very good.

[...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: [...] "He told us we were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy. He didn't believe my lyrics and told me to write what I believed in and not tell lies. He was Mary Poppins, he sorted us out." [...] The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song [...] "All I Want to Do Is Rock".|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Butler had recommended Chris Thomas as their producer. Thomas was more experienced and had previously worked with punk rock bands The Pretenders and the Sex Pistols; however Suede's label Nude Records dismissed the idea, saying he was too expensive. Nude's owner Saul Galpern claimed that the guitarist became impossible to reason with and also made threats to him and Buller. Buller claims he received phone calls where he <b>heard</b> <b>something</b> akin to scratching knives. Butler issued the band and their management an ultimatum: either they sacked Buller, or he would walk out. The rest of the band refused to comply with Butler's demands and decided to let him walk out before the record was finished. Butler insisted he was kicked out the band, as he turned up to the studio one day to find he was not allowed in. He went {{back the next day}} to pick up his guitar and was told through the intercom that his guitar would be left in the street for him. Suede's manager Charlie Charlton made a final attempt to reach consensus between the two parties, however during a tense phone conversation the final words Butler uttered to Anderson were along the lines of [...] "you're a fucking cunt." ...|$|E
