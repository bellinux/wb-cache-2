40|$|INTRODUCTION Matching has a {{long history}} of uses in {{statistical}} surveys and administrative data development. A business register consisting of names, addresses, and other identifying information such as total <b>financial</b> <b>receipts</b> might be constructed from tax and employment data bases (see chapters by Colledge, Nijhowne, and Archer). A survey of retail establishments or agricultural establishments might combine results from an area frame and a list frame. To produce a combined estimator, units from the area frame would need to be identified in the list frame (see Vogel-Kott chapter). To estimate the size of a (sub) population via capture-recapture techniques, one needs to accurately determine units common to two or more independent listings (Sekar and Deming 1949; Scheuren 1983; Winkler 1989 b). Samples must be drawn appropriately to estimate overlap (Deming and Gleser 1959). Rather than develop a special survey to collect data for policy decisions, it might be more appropriate...|$|E

During his lifetime, he maintained meticulous <b>financial</b> <b>receipts,</b> invoices and correspondence, and the collection includes his notebooks, trade directories and catalogues, and a significant study collection of related works and art materials. This evidence makes for a better understanding of Heysen’s technical practice, the making of his works of art and the merchandising, distribution and uptake of art materials in the British colony of South Australia. Previously, very little was known of the history of trading in art materials in Adelaide. The use of complementary written and object-based sources served to identify both patterns in Heysen’s purchases of artists’ materials and his preferred suppliers of materials. Between 1898 and 1918, there were no businesses trading exclusively in artists’ materials in South Australia, so Heysen bought materials through hardware and building suppliers, stationers and music sellers. Study of financial records along with exhibition catalogues and trade directories together with remaining artists‘ materials in Heysen studio confirmed the predominant presence of British manufactured artists’ materials that had been suspected.

Using data from a national sample of financially independent college students in the United States, I do not find that students bunch below earnings protection thresholds in a manner that would indicate attempts to avoid reductions in financial aid in total or grants specifically. Moreover, I do not find evidence that implicit income taxes predict lower earnings in a manner that suggests that students meaningfully reduce earnings in response to the tax. Therefore, while economically efficient, the reduction in aid has the potential to burden low-income students who need to both work and receive financial aid in order to afford college expenses...|$|R

This goal {{can be reached by}} providing financial assistance to patients facing difficulties in the accomplishment of activities of daily living, in order to encourage utilization of professional service and therefore alleviate informal caregiver burden. The main issue is to understand if and how financial assistance is correlated with the distribution between informal and professional care. We used a cross-sectional sample of 1131 French elderly patients (>= 65) with mild to moderate AD. Informal and professional service resource use was measured in hours per month using a validated instrument, the Resource Use in Dementia questionnaire. Our results confirmed the utter dominance of informal care, which represented more than 80 % of total care even among patients receiving public financial support. However <b>financial</b> support <b>receipt</b> was associated with differences in care utilization: higher use of total non-medical care (formal and informal) and lower proportion of informal care in total non-medical care. Our results suggested the presence of a threshold effect that would influence non-medical care demand decisions. Even if on average the use of informal care in total was 13. 3 % lower among patients receiving public financial support, informal care use represented more than 80 % of total non-medical care use. Providing robust evidence of these associations is crucial to further identify the right dosage between professional service demand and informal care utilization that could be associated with a lower burden and therefore a lower probability of institutionalization.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{the general}} {{association}} between socioeconomic status (SES) and hospitalization {{has been well}} established, few studies have considered the relationship between SES and hospital length of stay (LOS), and/or hospital re-admission. The primary objective of this study therefore, {{was to examine the}} relationship of SES to LOS and early re-admission among adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia in a setting with universal health insurance. Methods Four hundred and thirty-four (434) individuals were included in this retrospective, longitudinal cohort analysis of adult patients less than 65 years old admitted to a large teaching hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia. Hospital chart review data were linked to population-based health plan administrative data. Chart review was used to gather data on demographics, illness severity, co-morbidity, functional status and other measures of case mix. Two different types of administrative data were used to determine hospital LOS and the occurrence of all-cause re-admission to any hospital within 30 days of discharge. SES was measured by individual-level <b>financial</b> hardship (<b>receipt</b> of income assistance or provincial disability pension) and neighbourhood-level income quintiles. Results Those with individual-level financial hardship had an estimated 15 % (95 % CI - 0. 4 %, + 32 %, p = 0. 057) longer adjusted LOS and greater risk of early re-admission (adjusted OR 2. 65, 95 % CI 1. 38, 5. 09). Neighbourhood-level income quintiles, showed no association with LOS or early re-admission. Conclusion Among hospitalized pneumonia patients less than 65 years, financial hardship derived from individual-level data, was associated with an over two-fold greater risk of early re-admission and a marginally significant longer hospital LOS. However, the same association was not apparent when an ecological measure of SES derived from neighbourhood income quintiles was examined. The ecological SES variable, while useful in many circumstances, may lack the sensitivity to detect the full range of SES effects in clinical studies. </p...|$|R
