40|$|A digital Holter {{recorder}} {{was modified}} and assembled with a dedicated portable, water- and pressure-proof, hydrodynamic protective case to detect electrocardiograms (ECGs) in marine water on free swimming dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and human divers using a {{self-contained underwater breathing apparatus}} (SCUBA). Employment of a non-invasive appliance leaves subjects awake and not annoyed {{by the presence}} of the instrument. Recordings with a good signal-to-noise ratio were obtained, thus revealing electric events throughout the heart cycle of subjects diving at the water surface level and at depth. Results demonstrate that while dolphins show the already known <b>apnoea</b> <b>diving</b> bradycardia, normoxic-air breathing subjects display noteworthy increases in heart rate and atrium ventricular conduction velocity which likely represent functional adjustments to the performing of swimming and diving physical exercise. The instrument appears as a promising diagnostic tool for future studies in the fields of scuba and <b>apnoea</b> <b>diving</b> sports, occupational medicine and veterinary science...|$|R

50|$|The {{sport was}} created and {{developed}} during the years 1980 to 1982 by Igor Ostrovsky, an underwater sports coach at the Moscow Technological Institute. It was first officially demonstrated in April 1982 in Moscow. The first International Competition was held during August 1993 in Moscow. During March 1996, representatives of <b>diving</b> <b>federations</b> from Russia, Ukraine and Israel met in Moscow to establish the International Aquathlon Association (IAA). IAA’s goals are to develop the sport, encourage the foundation of national federations and associations to play the sport throughout the world, ensure the adoption of international rules of competition and authorise official international competitions. The sport was presented to CMAS in 2007 at the CMAS Games in Bari, Italy. It received recognition from CMAS at the General Assembly held in May 2008 and international level competition {{under the auspices of}} CMAS commenced in late 2008.

40|$|Multi-unit {{recordings}} of muscle-nerve sympathetic activity (m. s. a) or skin-nerve sympathetic activity (s. s. a) {{were made in}} the left peroneal nerve of sixteen healthy volunteers during simulated diving by immersion of the face in a tub of water. The procedure was varied by the use of different water temperatures, by diving with snorkel breathing, by <b>apnoea</b> without <b>diving,</b> and by <b>apnoea</b> with a stream of air against the face instead of immersion in water. Diving for 12 s elicited a pronounced activation of m. s. a., the mean increase from control periods being 360 %. The response was stronger with lower water temperatures. Immersion of the whole face evoked a stronger increase in m. s. a. than immersion of mouth and nose only. <b>Diving</b> without <b>apnoea</b> elicited a significant but weaker increase in m. s. a., whereas apnoea only for 12 s did not influence the sympathetic outflow. Cool air against the face during apnoea for 12 s was associated with a significant increase in m. s. a. The increase in m. s. a. usually occurred before the bradycardia. On emersion, m. s. a. ceased abruptly, whereas the bradycardia persisted for a few seconds. Mental arithmetic during diving did not change the m. s. a. response but reduced the bradycardia. M. s. a. increased despite increasing blood pressure levels. On emersion, m. s. a. did not reappear until the pre-diving blood pressure level was attained. S. s. a was inhibited on diving, with concomitant vasodilatation in the skin as recorded in the big toe. It is concluded that the response of m. s. a. to diving is initiated by a central 'pattern recognition' of an input from facial receptors, that this input and the effects of apnoea, acting by mutual reinforcement, maintain the strong sympathetic outflow, and that the mechanism releasing m. s. a. on diving overrides the normal blood pressure regulatory function of m. s. a. Diving exerts differentiated influence on different parts of the sympathetic nervous system, as illustrated by the inhibition of s. s. a...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceAim: Voluntary <b>apnoea</b> induces several {{physiological}} adaptations, including bradycardia, {{arterial hypertension}} and redistribution of regional blood flows. Elite breath-hold divers (BHDs) {{are able to}} maintain very long apnoea, inducing severe hypoxaemia without brain injury or black-out. It has thus been hypothesized that they develop protection mechanisms against hypoxia, {{as well as a}} decrease in overall oxygen uptake. Methods: To test this hypothesis, the apnoea response was studied in BHDs and non-divers (NDs) during static and dynamic apnoeas (SA, DA). Heart arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), and popliteal artery blood flow were rate, recorded to investigate the oxygen-conserving effect of apnoea response, and the internal carotid artery blood flow was used to examine the mechanisms of cerebral protection. Results: The bradycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction were accentuated in BHDs compared with NDs (P < 0. 01), in association with a smaller SaO(2) decrease (- 2. 7 % vs. - 4. 9 % during SA, P < 0. 01 and - 6 % vs. - 11. 3 % during DA, P < 0. 01). Greater increase in carotid artery blood flow was also measured during apnoea in BHDs than in controls. Conclusion: These results confirm that elite divers present a potentiation of the well-known apnoea response in both SA and DA conditions. This response is associated with higher brain perfusion which may partly explain the high levels of world apnoea records...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceObstructive sleep <b>apnoea</b> (OSA) {{syndrome}} {{in adult}} {{is defined as}} an Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) of 5 or more per hour of sleep {{in a context of}} excessive daytime sleepiness and snoring. OSA is considered as mild with an AHI of 5 - 15, moderate with an AHI of 15 - 30, and severe with an AHI greater than 30. OSA is a highly prevalent disease since it should affect 7 - 15 % of the middle-aged population, but most patients are not yet diagnosed for OSA. Middle age, male gender, obesity and arterial hypertension are main risk factors for OSA in adults. OSA patients are exposed to higher neurological and cardiovascular morbidity, including stroke, depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias. Because OSA may lead to life-threatening problems if undiagnosed, anaesthesiologists should be aware of their screening role in the preoperative period. In that way, the STOP-BANG questionnaire is a well-adapted instrument to screen patients for OSA during the preoperative visit. OSA patients are exposed to higher preoperative morbidity in relation with OSA severity, particularly difficult manual ventilation with mask, difficult tracheal intubation and postoperative upper airway obstruction. The unknown diagnosis of OSA is one major contributor to facilitate the occurrence of those events. In the postoperative period, early resuming continuous positive airway pressure and installing the OSA patient in a nonsupine position could be effective in preventing pharyngeal obstruction. Considering the timing of postoperative complications, a careful monitoring in the post-anesthesia care unit for three hours is an appropriate strategy for a majority of OSA patients. Alternatives to opioids should be promoted for postoperative pain control...|$|R
