50|$|The {{aerial parts}} and roots of <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> {{are used in}} herbalism. The {{above-ground}} parts are gathered during the flowering season and dried at high temperatures. The root is harvested in autumn between August and October and dried. The fresh rhizome is also used. Celandine has a hot and bitter taste. Preparations are made from alcoholic and hot aqueous extractions (tea). The related plant bloodroot has similar chemical composition and uses as <b>greater</b> <b>celandine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine</b> and Swallowwort {{were each}} often {{categorized}} with Tetterworts {{because they were}} used to treat Tetter. This led to nomenclature confusion among these worts.|$|E
50|$|The {{closely related}} Hylomecon vernalis {{has only one}} flower on each stem, and the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus) has {{branched}} stems and no bracts or bracteoles.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} latex {{also contains}} proteolytic enzymes and the phytocystatin chelidostatin, a cysteine protease inhibitor. These co-constituents {{could explain the}} topical use of <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> against warts and moles.|$|E
50|$|Upon Wordsworths death it was {{proposed}} that a celandine be carved on his memorial plaque inside St Oswalds Church, Grasmere, but unfortunately the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> Chelidonium majus was mistakenly used.|$|E
50|$|The acrid yellow sap of <b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine</b> {{is used as}} a {{traditional}} wart remedy. The sap can be applied directly to the wart in a similar manner to concentrated salicylic acid solution, but in more modest quantities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>celandine</b> is a {{perennial}} herb with an erect habit, and reaches 30 to 120 cm high. The leaves are pinnate with lobed and wavy-edged margins, up to 30 cm long. When injured, the plant exudes a yellow to orange latex.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus), {{a member}} of the Poppy family (Papaveraceae) was used in Colonial America as a wart remedy. Bloodroot has been {{similarly}} applied in the past. This may explain the multiple American and British definitions of [...] "Tetterwort" [...] in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Chelidonium majus, {{commonly}} known as <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> or tetterwort,(although tetterwort also refers to Sanguinaria canadensis), nipplewort, or swallowwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant, the only species in the genus Chelidonium. It is native to Europe and western Asia and introduced widely in North America.|$|E
5000|$|Some herbal {{remedies}} have been advocated for chronic liver disease {{but the evidence}} is not conclusive.

50|$|D-Chelidonine, {{the main}} {{alkaloid}} of Chelidonium majus, was first isolated in 1839. The supposed healing properties of <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus) were believed in throughout Europe and Asia during the Emperial Roman period (Pliny 1966), and New World aboriginal cultures used BIA-containing plants by using sap or root extracts to treat minor cuts and infections.|$|E
50|$|Chelerythrine is a benzophenanthridine {{alkaloid}} {{present in}} the plant Chelidonium majus (<b>greater</b> <b>celandine).</b> It is a potent, selective, and cell-permeable protein kinase C inhibitor in vitro.

It {{is also found in}} the plants Zanthoxylum clava-herculis and Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, exhibiting antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and other human pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} no record of Salendine Nook in the 1086 Domesday Book nearby Lindley (Lilleia) and Quarmby (Cornebi) are both mentioned, albeit as `waste'. One {{explanation}} is that Salendine refers to the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine,</b> part of the poppy family.“Nook” means secluded place or corner. So it is speculated that Salendine Nook was so named because it was a secluded place or corner where the celandine plant grew in abundance.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> {{is one of}} {{the many}} species {{described}} by the father of taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, in volume one of his Species Plantarum in 1753. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, celandine comes from Late Latin celidonia, from earlier Latin chelidonia or chelidonium, and ultimately from Ancient Greek , from [...] (chelidṓn) [...] "swallow". Ancient writers said that the flower bloomed when the swallows returned and faded when they left.|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{used by some}} Romani people as a foot refresher; modern herbalists use its purgative properties. The modern herbalist Juliette de Baïracli Levy recommended <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> diluted with milk for the eyes and the latex for getting rid of warts. Chelidonium was a favourite herb of the French herbalist Maurice Mességué. Chelidonium majus has traditionally been used for treatment of various inflammatory diseases including atopic dermatitis. It is also traditionally used {{in the treatment of}} gallstones and dyspepsia.|$|E
50|$|Treben used {{traditional}} German/Eastern European remedies {{handed down}} from previous generations. She only used local herbs and always accompanied her remedies with advice on diet.

5000|$|Scientific classification, taxonomy, and {{geographical}} categorization conventionally include the adjectives greater and lesser, {{when a large}} or small variety of an item is meant, as in the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> {{as opposed to the}} lesser celandine. These adjectives may at first sight appear as a kind of null comparative, when as is usual, they are cited without their opposite counterpart. It should be apparent, however, that an entirely different variety of animal, scientific, or geographical object is intended. Thus it may be found, for example, that the lesser panda entails a giant panda variety, and a gazetteer would establish that there are the Lesser Antilles as well as the Greater Antilles. It is in the nature of grammatical conventions evolving over time {{that it is difficult to}} establish when they first became widely accepted, but both greater and lesser in these instances have over time become mere adjectives (or adverbial constructs), so losing their comparative connotation. Further, Greater indicates the inclusion adjacent areas when referring to metropolitan areas, such as when suburbs are intended. Although it implies a comparison with a narrower definition that refers to a central city only, such as Greater London versus the City of London, or Greater New York versus New York City, it is not part of the [...] "comparative" [...] in the grammatical sense of this article. A comparative always compares something directly with something else.|$|E
40|$|Chelidonium majus or <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> {{is spread}} {{throughout}} the world, {{and it is a}} very common and frequent component of modern phytotherapy. Although C. majus contains alkaloids with remarkable physiological effect, moreover, safety pharmacology properties of this plant are not widely clarified, medications prepared from this plant are often used internally. In our study the inhibitory effect of C. majus herb extracts and alkaloids on hERG potassium current as well as on cardiac action potential were investigated. Our data show that hydroalcoholic extracts of <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> and its alkaloids, especially berberine, chelidonine and sanguinarine have significant hERG potassium channel blocking effect. These extracts and alkaloids also prolong the cardiac action potential in dog ventricular muscle. Therefore these compounds may consequently delay cardiac repolarization, which may result in the prolongation of the QT interval and increase the risk of potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E
40|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus L.) is used {{internally}} as a herbal remedy besides external applications. It {{was supposed}} that the elements besides organic compounds in <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> also have favourable effect as adjuvants, therefore, {{the aim of}} the study was to evaluate the bioavailability of the elements. The element transfer through the gastrointestinal system was measured by in vitro model from the pressed extract into buffer solutions with different pH (stomach pH= 1. 1, intestine pH= 2. 8, plasma pH= 7. 5). It was stated that the elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, S, Zn) were able to be absorbed through the stomach-bowel system, since they passed through the membrane. The transfer of the elements from the latex into the different buffer solutions greatly depends on the element and the pH of applied buffer solution. The transfer of the elements from the latex ranged between 0. 9...|$|E
40|$|Seeds of the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus L.) {{contain a}} lectin {{which could be}} {{isolated}} {{using a combination of}} affinity chromatography on chitin and ion exchange chromatography on sulphopropyl-Sephadex. The purified lectin was partially characterized with respect to its biochemical and physicochemical properties. It is a small dimeric protein composed of two different subunits of Mr 9, 500 and 11, 500, respectively. Its amino acid composition is typified by high contents of glycine and cysteine. No covalently bound carbohydrate could be detected. Hapten inhibition experiments indicated that the lectin exhibits specificity towards oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine, the potency of inhibition increasing with chain length up to four residues. The <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> lectin is the first lectin to be isolated from a species belonging to the plant family Papaveraceae (poppy family).

40|$|Examination on {{antioxidant}} {{activity in}} the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus L.) extracts by FRAP method+ Mária Then 1 *, Klára Szentmihályi 2, Ágnes Sárközi 1, Ilona Szöllôsi Varga 3 ABSTRACT Antioxidant {{activity in the}} alcoholic extracts (20 and 40 %) of the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus L.) herb was investigated by FRAP (ferric reducing and antioxidant power) method. Since the antioxidant activity of the extracts greatly depends {{on the quality of}} compounds, the phytochemical examination for alkaloid- and element content were also examined. According to the results the antioxidant activity does not depend on the alkaloid content of the drug during the vegetation period and on the alkaloid content of the alcoholic extracts. It seems that the antioxidant activity of the extracts is also independent from the transition metal element content.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: Folk {{medicine}} {{is a rich}} source of useful therapeutic tools. Nevertheless, use of medicinal plants can have unwanted, negative effects. By means of the description of an adverse reaction to a herbal remedy, we highlight the need for better efficacy-toxicity studies on these products. Aim of the Study: To report a case of possible Chelidonium majus L. (<b>Greater</b> <b>celandine)</b> -induced hepatitis and evaluate the past published cases. Materials and methods: We outlined the main features of hepatitis associated with use of Chelidonium majus by providing a review of cases reported and analysing in detail a new one. Results: Several cases of acute hepatitis related to <b>Greater</b> <b>celandine</b> consumption were found in the literature. The assessment for causality using Naranjo probability scale showed a probable relationship between the liver injury and the consumption of Chelidonium majus in the case we described. Conclusions: Our case, along with the other ones reported in the literature, increases the concern about the safety of oral use of Chelidonium majus. Plants used in traditional medicine are not necessarily harmless. Customers and prescribers should be aware of this, especially when a herbal drug is used with therapeutic purposes in absence of reliable studies of clinical efficacy and benefit-risk assessment.

40|$|The {{available}} literature assessing Chelidonium majus L. (CM) hepatotoxicity potential, and its risk {{to benefit}} assessment has been reviewed in this paper. Identification of significant scientific literature was performed via {{the following research}} databases: Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, using the following keywords: "Chelidonium majus", "greater celandine", "Hepatotoxicity", "Liver" "Injury", "Toxicity" individually investigated and then again in association. CM named also <b>greater</b> <b>celandine,</b> swallow-wort, or bai-qu-cai (Chinese), {{has been used for}} a long time in traditional Chinese medicine and phytotherapy. Its extracts have been claimed to display a wide variety of biological activities: antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, antineoplastic, hepatoprotective, and analgesic. Moreover, herbal medicine suggests this plant have numerous additional effects which have not yet been scientifically evaluated, such as antitussive, diuretic, and eye-regenerative. However, despite its claimed hepatoprotective effects, several hepatotoxicity cases have been reported to be probably or highly probably connected with CM exposure, after their evaluation through liver-targeted causality assessment methods. CM hepatotoxicity has been defined as a distinct form of herb-induced liver injury (HILI), due to an idiosyncratic reaction of the metabolic type. This evidence has to be considered in relationship with the absence of considerable benefits of CM therapy. Therefore, the risk to benefit ratio of the use of herbal products containing <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> can actually be considered as negative...|$|E

The thin layer chromatography final analysis shows that different concentrations (70 and 96 %) ethanol extracts obtained from the entire plant contain a big number of compounds. We observed an important TLC - profile after four extraction steps (using ethylic ether, ethanol, chloroform and methylene chloride). We can conclude that a big number of extraction steps are needed in order to obtain a concentrated mixture with a limited number of compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of chromoplasts, with {{special emphasis on}} the formation and the organisation of chromoplast fibrils, was followed in the petals of the <b>greater</b> <b>celandine,</b> Chelidonium majus L. Electron microscopic observations showed that, in the epidermis, {{differentiation of}} chromoplasts started from leucoplasts, while mesophyll chromoplasts originated from chloroplasts. During petal maturation, fibrils accumulated in the plastids, often arranging in a parallel fashion to form compact birefringent bundles. Immediately before flower opening, these fibrillar bundles started to disorganise, and, at anthesis, most chromoplasts contained widely spaced fibrils which were irregularly dispersed through the plastid interior. During chromoplast differentiation, fibrils were commonly observed to protrude from plastoglobules, suggesting the possible site of their formation. Western analysis indicated that a protein antigenically related to fibrillin from pepper chromoplasts participates in the constitution of fibrils in Chelidonium petals...|$|E

40|$|Herbal {{drugs have}} become {{increasingly}} popular and their use is widespread. Licensing regulations and pharmacovigilance regarding herbal products are still incomplete and clearcut proof of their efficacy in liver diseases is sparse. Nevertheless, a number of herbals show promising activity including silymarin for antifibrotic treatment, phyllantus amarus in chronic hepatitis B, glycyrrhizin to treat chronic viral hepatitis, {{and a number of}} herbal combinations from China and Japan that deserve testing in appropriate studies. Apart from therapeutic properties, reports are accumulating about liver injury after the intake of herbals, including those advertised for liver diseases. Acute and/or chronic liver damage occurred after ingestion of some Chinese herbs, herbals that contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, germander, <b>greater</b> <b>celandine,</b> kava, atractylis gummifera, callilepsis laureola, senna alkaloids, chaparral and many others. Since the evidence supporting the use of botanicals to treat chronic liver diseases is insufficient and only few of them are well standardised and free of potential serious side effects, most of these medications are not recommended outside clinical trials. Particularly with regard to the latter, adequately powered randomised-controlled clinical trials with well-selected end points are needed to assess the role of herbal therapy for liver diseases...|$|E
40|$|Herbal {{hepatotoxicity}} is a {{rare and}} poorly described disease because reported cases are mostly scattered and lack an appropriate causality assessment. We now describe in detail the clinical picture of herbal he-patotoxicity by extracts of <b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine</b> (GC), syn. Chelidonium majus L. from the Papaveraceae fa-mily, which contain more than 20 ingredients including various biologically active isoquinoline alkaloids. For this purpose, we analyzed and reviewed published cases of 16 patients from various European countries. In all patients, herbal hepatotoxicity was of probable and highly probable causality for GC, using the original and updated scale of CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences). GC associated hepatotoxicity usually has an acute clinical course exhibiting a hepatocellular pattern of injury and is co-rrelated to an idiosyncratic reaction with its metabolic subtype. Jaundice combined with high values of serum aminotransferases was present in virtually all cases with favourable outcome despite severe clinical course. In conclusion, GC hepatotoxicity is a typical herbal hepatotoxicity with a sound causality track for GC, but there is uncertainty regarding the respective causative compound(s). The present detailed review of GC hepatotoxicity may serve as an example for clinical causality assessments of future cases of liver in...|$|E

UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Kristina Stinson Plant invasions {{represent}} a significant {{threat to the}} structure and function of natural ecosystems. Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) {{has been identified as}} a threat to native communities mostly through small-scale studies and focused experiments. In this in situ observational study I examined the effects of garlic mustard invasion on species composition across multiple sites by comparing plant diversity and composition in invaded and adjacent non-invaded communities. Mean Shannon diversity was higher in invaded compared to non-invaded plots and invasion was associated with greater densities of invasive species such as burning bush (Euonymus alatus), and <b>greater</b> <b>celandine</b> (Chelidonium majus). In ordination space, the sites grouped more closely by geographic region than by invasion status, suggesting that regional environmental variation is important for community structure. My findings indicate that garlic mustard invasion is associated with other invasive plants, and that the understory plant community varies considerably across the region regardless of invasion status. Overall we show that community structure in garlic mustard invaded forest understories is not consistent across the landscape...|$|E
40|$|Milky sap {{isolated}} from Chelidonium majus L. (<b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine)</b> {{serves as a}} rich source of various biologically active substances such as alkaloids, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Previous research showed that the activity of Ch. majus milky sap may depend also on the presence of biologically active proteins. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the biological effect of two nucleases {{isolated from}} Ch. majus milk sap, CMN 1 of 20 kDa and CMN 2 of 36 kDa, on HeLa and CHO tumour cell lines. Both studied nucleases together with other proteins in the sap of the plant are involved in stress and defence reactions against different pathogens. After 48 h incubation of CMN 1 and CMN 2 only with HeLa cells, the dependence between the number of apoptotic lesions and the concentration of applied nuclease was observed. The highest proapoptotic activity was induced by 13. 3 ng/ml concentration of CMN 2 collected in May (62 +/- 3 % HeLa cells were apoptotic). Moreover, the proportion of necrotic cells in all concentrations of the nucleases and both cell lines was relatively low (1 - 8 +/- 0. 5 %). In summary, results of this study show that purified nucleases CMN 1 and CMN 2 isolated from Ch. majus milky sap exhibit apoptotic activity in HeLa tumour cell line, but not in CHO cells, without inflammatory reaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Corydalis cava Schweigg. & Koerte, {{the plant}} of {{numerous}} pharmacological activities, {{together with the}} studied earlier by our group Chelidonium majus L. (<b>Greater</b> <b>Celandine),</b> belong to the family Papaveraceae. The plant grows in Central and South Europe and produces the sizeable subterraneous tubers, empty inside, which are extremely resistant to various pathogen attacks. The Corydalis sp. tubers are {{a rich source of}} many biologically active substances, with the extensive use in European and Asian folk medicine. They have analgetic, sedating, narcotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-tumour activities. On the other hand, there is no information about possible biological activities of proteins contained in Corydalis cava tubers. Methods Nucleolytic proteins were isolated from the tubers of C. cava by separation on a heparin column and tested for DNase activity. Protein fractions showing nucleolytic activity were tested for cytotoxic activity in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. Cultures of HeLa cells were conducted in the presence of three protein concentrations: 42, 83 and 167 ng/ml during 48 h. Viability of cell cultures was appraised using XTT colorimetric test. Protein fractions were separated and protein bands were excised and sent for identification by mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Results The studied protein fractions showed an inhibiting effect on mitochondrial activity of HeLa cells, depending on the administered dose of proteins. The most pronounced effect was obtained with the highest concentration of the protein (167 ng/ml) - 43. 45 ± 3 % mitochondrial activity of HeLa cells were inhibited. Mass spectrometry results for the proteins of applied fractions showed that they contained plant defense- and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. Conclusions The cytotoxic effect of studied proteins toward HeLa cell line cells has been evident and dependent on increasing dose of the protein. The present study, most probably, represents the first investigations on the effect of purified PR proteins from tuber extracts of a pharmacologically active plant on cell lines. </p...|$|E
