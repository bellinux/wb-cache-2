40|$|Dans cette thèse, le {{traitement}} des effluents de conserveries de fruits (ananas, litchi et longane) a été étudié. Dans un premier temps, leur biodégradabilité a été caractérisée en réacteur AnSBR fonctionnant par cycles. Les résultats montrent que la biodégradabilité est très élevée (> 95 %) mais les charges appliquées restent faibles (95 %) but the OLR remained low (< 2. 4 g COD/L. d). In {{a second}} step, anaerobic Fixed Film Reactors with different supports {{were used to}} try to improve the performances of the anaerobic digestion of fruit canning wastewater. Two kinds of supports were used: Cloisonyle®, a well-ordered support, and bioflow 30 ®, a loose floating support. The rate of colonisation of the Cloisonyle® was studied at pilot scale during 6 months using distillery vinasses as a substrate and then, the performances of a fixed bed with Cloisonyle® treating <b>fruit</b> <b>caning</b> wastewater was studied in a lab-scale reactor. The maximum OLR values were very different according to the substrate used with values between 13 to 16 kg COD/m 3. d with distillery vinasses and only between 3. 9 to 5. 7 kg COD/m 3. d for fruit canning wastewater with always more than 80 % COD removal. When comparing biofilm development with wine distillery vinasses and with fruit canning wastewater, it was found that biofilm formation with wine distillery vinasses was quicker and more important than in fruit canning wastewater, result which can explain why lower OLR were obtained with <b>fruit</b> <b>caning</b> wastewater. Higher OLR were obtained with the loose floating support with a maximum OLR of 23 kg COD/m 3. d for lab-scale AnFFR, due to the accumulation of a high quantity of biomass inside the reactor with this support making its industrial application conceivable. The dynamics of the microbial communities was studied on the pilot-scale reactor with Cloisonyle® fed with vinasses and two main conclusions can be drawn: i) the establishment of biofilm is rapid after its initial growth, and ii) attached and suspended fractions have completely different behaviour...|$|R
25|$|From the cordon, plant shoots {{emerge from}} the bud that {{eventually}} develops mature bark and becomes the <b>fruiting</b> <b>cane</b> from which grape clusters will emerge. These canes can be positioned and trained to whatever angle is desired by the grower. Typically, they are positioned upwards {{but they can be}} bent into an arch such as a Pendelbogen or Mosel arch system, or trained to point downwards such as the Scott Henry and Sylvos system. The latter method requires more labor-intensive trellising and training for Vitis vinifera vines which are naturally more inclined to grow upwards rather than down. In systems such as the Scott Henry, this downward growth is achieved by the use of movable wires that first allow the canes to grow upwards until about 2 to 3 weeks before harvest when they are then shifted downwards where the weight of gravity on the hanging grape clusters helps keep the canes pointing down.|$|R

Colorado’s climate is not especially favorable for bramble fruit production, and only red and yellow raspberries are recommended for general cultivation. Several {{varieties of}} blackberries can be grown in the lower-elevation areas of the state. Purple raspberries, boysenberries, loganberries and dewberries require special winter protection and are not recommended for Colorado. Black raspberries are not currently recommended, but new varieties suited to Colorado conditions should be available by 2012.
