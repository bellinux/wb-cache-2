40|$|Our novel concept {{utilizing}} continuous {{emission of}} unipolar ions, {{which has been}} recently proven to enhance the efficiency of facepiece respirators, was applied to conventional HVAC filters. Laboratory study demonstrated that the air ion emission {{in the vicinity of}} a low-efficiency HVAC filter significantly improves its performance. For example, the collection efficiency of two commercial HVAC filters challenged with 1 孠PSL particles jumped from 5 - 15 % (measured with no ion emission) to 40 - 90 % (when the ion output rate was ~ 1012 e-/sec). The enhancement effect depends on the filter type and, generally, on the distance from the <b>ion</b> <b>emitter</b> to the filter surface. The results were explained as follows. The air ions with high mobility are deposited on the fibers forming a macroscopic electric field, which shield out some incoming unipolarly charged particles due to repelling forces.

40|$|The {{emission}} of unipolar air ions {{in the vicinity}} of a filtering facepiece respirator has been recently shown to considerably enhance its respiratory protection efficiency. The effect is driven by the electric repelling forces that develop between the unipolarly charged mask and the aerosol particles, thus creating a shield for the incoming particles and consequently decreasing the penetration efficiency through the filter. The manikin-based preliminary evaluation of this concept has been performed with a very limited number of variables. In this study, four types of half-mask facepiece filtering devices (N 95, R 95, and dust-mist respirators, as well as surgical masks), operating at two different breathing flow rates, were tested with unipolar air <b>ion</b> <b>emitters</b> exhibiting different emission rates and polarities. The particle penetration efficiency through the facepiece filter was determined in a room-size indoor test chamber by a real-time particle size selective aerosol monitoring performed inside and outside of the mask, which was face-sealed onto a manikin.

In this study, we investigated the ion-induced enhancement effect while challenging a low-efficiency heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) filter with viable bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and viruses. The aerosol concentration was measured in real time. Samples were also collected with a bioaerosol sampler for viable microbial analysis. The removal efficiency of the filter was determined, respectively, with and without an <b>ion</b> <b>emitter.</b> The ionization was found to significantly enhance the filter efficiency in removing viable biological particles from the airflow. For example, when challenged with viable bacteria, the filter efficiency increased as much as four- to fivefold. For viable fungal spores, the ion-induced enhancement improved the efficiency by a factor of similar to 2. When testing with virus-carrying liquid droplets, the original removal efficiency provided by the filter was rather low: 9. 09 +/- 4. 84 %. While the ion emission increased collection about fourfold, the efficiency did not reach 75 - 100 % observed with bacteria and fungi.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community's recent {{interest in}} Field Emission Electric Propulsion for drag-free spacecraft represents {{a major breakthrough}} for this technology. While FEEP was traditionally intended {{as a candidate for}} the attitude control and fine pointing of small satellites, i. e., for mN level thrust missions, this new, previously unforeseen application opportunity is due to its capabilities in the very low thrust range (about 1 µN). A major project such as LISA, presently a candidate for the next cornerstone in Horizon 2000, features FEEP as a mission-enabling technology. Several other concepts have been proposed, ranging from AU baselength interferometry, to a spaceborne constellation of antennas for syntetic aperture radiometry to be used for high accuracy weather forecasting, to noiseless microgravity laboratories. A recent proposal to the Italian Space Agency highlights the benefits of adopting a Field Emission Electric Propulsion system for a Flight Experiment on the Equivalence Principle (FEEP 2). As far as the concept is concerned, FEEP is a thoroughly proven technology. Tests in space simulators were extensively carried out at both the Electric Propulsion Laboratory of ESTEC and at Centrospazio, covering all of the thruster’s subsystems (<b>ion</b> <b>emitter,</b> propellant feeding system, neutralizer, power electronics).

The use of a (kinetic) monoenergetic population for the attracted species, well known in passive probe theory, gives both accuracy and tractability to the theory. The monoenergetic population is proved to behave like an isentropic fluid with radial plus centripetal motion, allowing direct comparisons with ad hoc fluid models. Also, a modification of the original monoenergetic equations permits analysis of contactors operating in orbit-limited conditions. Besides that, the theory predicts that, only for plasma emissions above certain threshold current a presheath/double layer/core structure for the potential is formed (the core mode), while for emissions below that threshold, a plasma contactor behaves exactly as a positive-ion emitter with a presheath/sheath structure (the no-core mode). <b>Ion</b> <b>emitters</b> are studied as a particular case.

Attention {{is limited to}} the diagnostic exploitation of absolute measured spectral intensities. Such measurements reflect the population distributions of the excited emitting species in the beams and in the plasma and the influences upon them. For the neutral beam atom emitters, impact of plasma impurity ions is the primary influence in the medium/high energy regime, but the effective emission at tokamak densities represents the collective effect of many re-distributive processes. Also, the method of analysis is governed by the relaxation lengths of populations in the beam compared with density and temperature scale lengths in the plasma and the spatial resolution expected of spectroscopy measurements. For impurity <b>ion</b> <b>emitters</b> in the plasma, emission follows the primary charge transfer from the neutral beam donor. The distribution of capture is influenced by the various donor states and the consequential effective emission again influenced by re-distributive processes in the plasma.

While several test results are available on the behaviour and performance of single ion sources and prototype thruster units, the design and testing issues arising from the combined operation of a multi-thruster assembly were never thoroughly addressed, nor was the assessment of potential interaction effects that may impair the thruster performance. A two-emitters test was therefore recently carried out to assess possible interactions between incident ion beams from adjacent thrusters. A pair of identical, 5 -mm linear slit FEEP emitters, was integrated in Alta’s IV 1 vacuum facility. The two emitters’ slits were mounted parallel to each other at a distance of 10 cm. The ion beam density was evaluated using a set of single-filament Langmuir probes immersed in the thrusters’ plume. It was observed that the beam profile resulting from combined operation is essentially coincident with the sum of the individual profiles, as indicated by a numerical plume simulation of the test configuration run using Alta’s proprietary 3 -D code.
