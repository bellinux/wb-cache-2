50|$|Focussing {{of these}} plate cameras {{was by the}} use of a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> at the point of focus. Because lens design only allowed rather small {{aperture}} lenses, the image on the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a dark slide. To make the exposure, the dark slide was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the dark slide replaced.|$|E
50|$|The CE-5 {{was shipped}} {{with a full}} <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> along with a split image range finder and a microprism collar to aid focusing. Other screens were made available.|$|E

50|$|The depth-of-field adapter (also {{called a}} DOF adapter or 35 mm adapter) is a largely {{obsolete}} device {{that uses a}} <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> focusing <b>screen</b> to enable the use of interchangeable lenses on a fixed lens camcorder. There are also lens adapters made for other optical systems, including microscopes and telescopes.|$|R
50|$|The EVF has a {{high enough}} {{resolution}} view that manual focusing is possible. Unlike traditional optical viewfinders which may use a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> focusing <b>screen,</b> the GH1 EVF takes {{a small portion of}} the scene and magnifies it 10X. This magnified portion may be moved around to any section of the live view. In manual focus mode, touching the lens focus ring will immediately turn on the magnification for manual focusing.|$|R
50|$|The view {{camera is}} a large format camera in which the lens forms an {{inverted}} image on a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> directly at {{the plane of the}} film. The image viewed is exactly the same as the image on the film, which replaces the viewing screen during exposure.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted {{single-stroke film advance lever}} is again wound. Focusing is via a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|E
5000|$|Cameras with a bellows {{typically}} support 'tilt and shift' of the lens. Together with 1:1 focusing (via a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> {{mounted at}} the rear in the film plane position), this permits landscape photography with an extremely {{large depth of field}} [...] - [...] from closest foreground to the far horizon [...] - [...] to be achieved.|$|E
50|$|As camera a lens {{technology}} {{developed and}} wide aperture lenses became more common, rangefinder cameras {{were introduced to}} make focusing more precise. Early rangefinders had two separate viewfinder windows, {{one of which is}} linked to the focusing mechanisms and moved right or left as the focusing ring is turned. The two separate images are brought together on a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> viewing <b>screen.</b> When vertical lines in the object being photographed meet exactly in the combined image, the object is in focus. A normal composition viewfinder is also provided. Later the viewfinder and rangefinder were combined. Many rangefinder cameras had interchangeable lenses, each lens requiring its own range- and viewfinder linkages.|$|R
50|$|The first {{photographic}} camera {{developed for}} commercial manufacture was a daguerreotype camera, built by Alphonse Giroux in 1839. Giroux {{signed a contract}} with Daguerre and Isidore Niépce to produce the cameras in France, with each device and accessories costing 400 francs. The camera was a double-box design, with a landscape lens fitted to the outer box, and a holder for a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> focusing <b>screen</b> and image plate on the inner box. By sliding the inner box, objects at various distances could be brought to as sharp a focus as desired. After a satisfactory image had been focused on the screen, the screen was replaced with a sensitized plate. A knurled wheel controlled a copper flap in front of the lens, which functioned as a shutter. The early daguerreotype cameras required long exposure times, which in 1839 could be from 5 to 30 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{perforated}} 35mm {{motion picture}} film {{had been used}} in miniature cameras {{for more than two decades}} using the 24x36mm negative format. The single lens reflex principle is even older and was widely used in cameras for the medium format plate- and film material. However, several obstacles had to be overcome to device a useful miniature SLR camera apart from the fact that the film material itself seriously restricted the usefulness of the negative: It is impossible to determine sharp focus on a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> for this format with the naked eye - even with a large aperture lens. To overcome this, Ihagee substituted the traditional <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> focusing <b>screen</b> with a Plano-convex magnifying glass with the flat side facing downwards and ground to form a focusing screen visible magnified in the finder. To further improve focusing accuracy, a small magnifying glass could be swung into place for accurate focusing on a small part of the image. Also to improve focusing accuracy fast lenses were needed, and right from the start Carl Zeiss Jena provided the Tessar 1:2.8 f=5cm, soon to be followed by the Biotar 1:2 5cm and the Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1:2 f=5cm for the Kine Exakta.|$|R
50|$|Double-lens {{cameras were}} first {{developed}} around 1870, {{due to the}} realization that having a second lens alongside the taking lens would mean that one could focus without having to keep swapping the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> for the plate, reducing the time required for taking a picture. This sort of approach was still used as late as the 1960s, as the Koni-Omegaflex testifies.|$|E
50|$|Georgiou's {{early work}} was in {{black-and-white}} but for Fault Lines and subsequent work {{he moved to}} colour, using a compact camera with an articulated LCD that may be viewed from above, like the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> of a twin-lens reflex camera; this is because he believes it less intimidating for the people photographed than a camera held to the eye.|$|E
50|$|Crown Camera 1896Patent GB189602965 {{was granted}} on February 10 1896 to Thomas Peter Bethell of Crown Works, Boundary Place, Liverpool {{for a simple}} {{construction}} of camera {{to be made of}} cardboard of metal, or a combination of both. The Crown Camera had a quarter-plate cardboard-body with two waist level finders, cardboard rubber-band powered shutter, four-position rotary stops marked 1 2 3 4, a single meniscus lens, removable <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen,</b> rear sliding sheath and leather carrying strap.|$|E
50|$|The Reisekamera {{might be}} {{considered}} the portable version of the studio camera, to be used outside the professional photographic studio, on assignment at location, for architectural work or documentation away from the studio, in homes or museums. It is collapsible, yet not small, and it is much too cumbersome and large for the travelling amateur to bring along. The bellows extension would allow a selection of focal length lenses to be employed covering the required field of view. The back panel may be tilted and turned slightly, and at the front, the lens plate may slide vertically and horizontally to control perspective and distortion. The Reisekamera {{would be one of}} several cameras suitable for field assignments. A black cloth is required to keep stray light out while observing the image on the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> focusing <b>screen.</b> When the image is composed and focused, the focusing screen is replaced by the plate holder. The lens cap is placed on the lens, the dark slide removed from the plate holder, and the lens cap is removed for the required exposure time and replaced. If an auxiliary shutter is present, it may perform the function of the lens cap. After the exposure the dark slide is replaced to protect the exposed plate from stray light. The plate holder is either turned for a second photo, or brought to the darkroom for plate development and copying. The camera would be supplied with a number of plate holders, each usually holding two plates, one on either side.|$|R

50|$|Crude {{versions}} of conically tapered <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints {{have been made}} for quite a while, particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts. These days, <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape. They are made to join two glassware pieces together. One of the glassware items to be joined would have an inner (or male) joint with the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> surface facing outward and the other would have an outer (or female) joint of a correspondingly fitting taper with the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> surface facing inward.|$|R
50|$|Twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras {{had a large}} lens {{above the}} taking lens, and a large mirror at 45°, {{projecting}} an image onto a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> viewable from above, with the camera at waist level. The viewfinder lens was of similar size and focal length to the taking lens, though the optical quality was less critical; the mirror was of similar size to the film. These cameras were relatively expensive; the Rolleiflex and cheaper sister Rolleicord were the pioneers. Both single- and twin-lens reflexes allowed focussing by adjusting the lens until the image was sharp.|$|E
5000|$|If media, {{especially}} {{that of the}} cornea, are opaque, optical section images are often impossible depending on severity. In these cases, diffuse illumination {{may be used to}} advantage. For this, the slit is opened very wide and a diffuse, attenuated survey illumination is produced by inserting a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> or diffuser in the illuminating path. [...] "Wide beam" [...] illumination is the only type that has the light source set wide open. Its main purpose is to illuminate as much of the eye and its adnexa at once for general observation.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1700s, small, easily {{portable}} box-form units {{equipped with a}} simple lens, an internal mirror, and a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> had become popular among affluent amateurs for making sketches of landscapes and architecture. The camera was pointed at the scene and steadied, a sheet of thin paper was placed {{on top of the}} ground glass, then a pencil or pen could be used to trace over the image projected from within. The beautiful but fugitive little light-paintings on the screen inspired several people to seek some way of capturing them more completely and effectively—and automatically—by means of chemistry.|$|E
30|$|In all cases, the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> {{component}} and {{the solid}} component had increased in size (median increase: 12  mm and 16  mm for <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> and solid components, respectively).|$|R

50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> {{and frame}} assembly, {{known as the}} spring back, is {{held in place by}} springs that pull and hold the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> firmly into the plane of focus during the {{focusing}} and composition process. Once focusing is complete, the same springs act as a flexible clamping mechanism to press the film holder into the same plane of focus that the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> occupied.|$|R
50|$|Rangefinder cameras {{allow the}} {{distance}} to objects to be measured {{by means of a}} coupled parallax unit on top of the camera, allowing the focus to be set with accuracy. Single-lens reflex cameras allow the photographer to determine the focus and composition visually using the objective lens and a moving mirror to project the image onto a ground glass or plastic micro-prism screen. Twin-lens reflex cameras use an objective lens and a focusing lens unit (usually identical to the objective lens.) in a parallel body for composition and focusing. View cameras use a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> which is removed and replaced by either a photographic plate or a reusable holder containing sheet film before exposure. Modern cameras often offer autofocus systems to focus the camera automatically by a variety of methods.|$|E
5000|$|In the Cursus mathematicus, Hérigone {{describes}} a camera obscura {{in the form}} of a goblet (Chapter 6, page 113). Hérigone did not depict his goblet, but Johann Zahn would illustrate the design in his Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium (1685). Hérigone's goblet-camera obscura, more a novelty than anything else, was constructed in such a way that you could spy on others while taking a drink. The device's 45-degree angle mirror had a stylized opening for the lens. The goblet had a cup made of glass where images could be seen. The lid bore a magnifying lens at the top.http://www.precinemahistory.net/1650.htm The lens and mirror of this dinner table device for spying was situated at the base of the goblet's stem, and served to project a real-time image onto the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> in the cup of the goblet.|$|E
50|$|The {{photographic}} single-lens {{reflex camera}} (SLR) {{was invented in}} 1861 by Thomas Sutton, a photography author and camera inventor who ran a photography related company together with Louis Désiré Blanquart-Evrard on Jersey. Only {{a few of his}} SLR's were made. The first production SLR with a brand name was Calvin Rae Smith's Monocular Duplex (USA, 1884). Other early SLR cameras were constructed for example by Louis van Neck (Belgium, 1889), Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer (England, 1894) and Max Steckelmann (Germany, 1896), and Graflex of the United States and Konishi in Japan produced SLR cameras as early as 1898 and 1907 respectively. These first SLRs were large format cameras. While SLR cameras were not very popular at the time, they proved useful for some work. These cameras were used at waist level; the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> was viewed directly, using a large hood to keep out extraneous light. In most cases, the mirror had to be raised manually as a separate operation before the shutter could be operated.|$|E
40|$|Finely <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> has {{pozzolanic}} {{properties that}} make attractive its recycling as supplementary cementitious material. This paper compares {{the behavior of}} waste glass powders of different fineness with that of natural pozzolana, coal fly ash and silica fume. Chemical analysis, compressive strength measurements and durability tests were carried out to investigate the effect of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> on strength and durability performances of mortars. Blended both with portland cement and lime, <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> improved strength, resistance to chloride penetration and resistance to sulphate attack of mortars more than natural pozzolana and similarly to fly ash. Mortars with <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> immersed in water for seven years did not show any sign of degradation and increased their compressive strength.

5000|$|The angle {{measured}} by the graticule also caused a metal wire to rotate around {{the face of a}} large circular display {{on one side of the}} HACS, known as the Deflection Display. The measured value of altitude and range, and estimated value of target speed, caused optics to focus a lamp onto a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> behind the wire, displaying an ellipse who's shape changed based on these measures. The deflection operator used two controls to move additional wire indicators so they lay on top of the intersection of the outer edge of the ellipse where it was crossed by the rotating metal wire. The intersection of the ellipse and the target direction was used as a basis for calculating elevation and training of the guns. The ellipse method had the advantage of requiring very little in the way of mechanical computation and essentially modelled target position in real-time with a consequent rapid solution time.|$|E
50|$|After Niépce's {{death in}} 1833, his partner Louis Daguerre {{continued}} to experiment and by 1837 {{had created the}} first practical photographic process, which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839. Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor {{to give it a}} coating of light-sensitive silver iodide. After exposure in the camera, the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt (sodium chloride). Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. As commercialized, both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes. The rear box had a removable <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen</b> and could slide in and out to adjust the focus. After focusing, the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped. Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder, uncapped the lens, and counted off as many minutes as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder. Despite this mechanical simplicity, high-quality achromatic lenses were standard.|$|E
50|$|Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras {{viewed the}} scene through the taking lens. Early SLRs were plate cameras, with a {{mechanism}} to insert a mirror between the lens and the film which reflected the light upwards, where it could be seen at waist level on a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> <b>screen.</b> When {{ready to take the}} picture, the mirror was pivoted out of the way (without moving the camera). Later SLRs had a mechanism which flipped the mirror out of the way when the shutter button was pressed, followed immediately by the shutter opening. Instead of a waist-level arrangement, a prism was used to allow the camera to be held to the eye. The big advantage of the SLR was that any lens, or other optical device, could be used; the viewfinder always showed exactly the image that would be projected onto the film. The live preview feature of digital cameras share this advantage of the SLR, as they also show the image exactly as it will be recorded, with no additional optics or parallax error.|$|E
