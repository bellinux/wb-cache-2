In this study, we demonstrate the variable uptake feature of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in Tc- 99 m phytate scintigraphy. We reviewed all patients who underwent Tc- 99 m phytate <b>hepatic</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> between 2008 and 2012 in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Cases with FNH were diagnosed {{on the basis of}} pathology or at least one or more prior imaging with a periodic clinical follow-up. All patients received a standard protocol of dynamic flow study and planar and Tc- 99 m phytate single-photon emission computed tomography (E. CAM; Siemens). The correlation of variable nodular radioactivity with parameters such as tumor size and localization was analyzed. In total, 15 lesions of 14 patients in the clinic were diagnosed as FNH. The tumor size was approximately 2. 9 – 7. 4  cm (mean size 4. 6  cm). Four lesions were larger than 5  cm. The major anatomic distribution was in the right hepatic lobe (10 lesions), particularly in the superior segments (7 lesions). Tc- 99 m phytate single-photon emission computed tomography imaging for determining the functional features of Kupffer cells included cool/cold (8 lesions), isoradioactive/warm (6 lesions), and hot (1 lesion) patterns of uptake. We did not observe any statistically significant correlation between variable nodular radioactivity and tumor size (p= 0. 68) or localization (p= 0. 04). Herein, we demonstrate the variable uptake feature of FNH in Tc- 99 m phytate scintigraphy. In small FNH tumors (< 5  cm), increased or equal uptake still provided specificity for the differential diagnosis of hepatic solid tumors...|$|E

In 9 patients the MF to the tumour region was within the normal range suggesting that some tumours may possess a portal venous supply. The MF to the uninvolved liver regions was below the normal range in 25 % of patients, indicating that HAE could be hazardous in this group. Following HAE the MF rose in all 4 tumour regions and fell in 4 non-embolized uninvolved liver regions.

Her poor condition made a rapid diagnosis imperative and precluded a normal diagnostic work-up. Echocardiography confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). A <b>hepatic</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> and an abdominal echo-Doppler study excluded liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed marked dilation of the right ventricle with significant hypertrophy of the free wall, a finding that is uncommon in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or PPHTN. Right heart catheterisation demonstrated severe pre-capillary PH without response to acute vasodilator testing. Finally the patient underwent computed tomography angiography, which showed marked dilation of the pulmonary artery without thromboembolic disease and, unexpectedly, a partially calcified large patent ductus arteriosus. The correct diagnosis of the underlying cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension is essential. Patients with underlying heart defects may have an atypical presentation and be referred to expert centres with an incorrect diagnosis.

The accuracy and clinical relevance of transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), static scintigraphy, dynamic scintigraphy (HPI), intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) and manual palpation, in the detection of intrahepatic colorectal metastases were assessed in 73 consecutive patients presenting with colorectal carcinoma; 39 were male and 34 female {{with a mean age}} of 68 years (range 43 - 90 years). In 33 patients either intraoperative ultrasound or palpation were omitted owing to emergency presentation (n = 14) or subsequent non-operative management (n = 19).

However, if the prognostic ability of HPI is confirmed on subsequent follow-up, the accuracy of HPI will rise with time, whereas that of CT will fall. Intraoperative ultrasonography took time to perform and did not alter the management of any patient within the study.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to report our 44 -year {{experience}} (1963 – 2006) in the management of primarily infected hydatid cyst of the liver. This is a retrospective review of demographic data, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, surgical management, and long-term outcome of patients treated at our center. Material and methods. There were 77 patients with operated infected liver cysts. In the same period, a total of 460 cases with liver hydatidosis were treated surgically. Of those with suppurated cysts, 27 were men and 50 were women, with a mean age 54. 5 years. Results. Clinical manifestations of an abscess were identified in 75 % of the patients. In the earlier cases of the study, the diagnosis was made from the clinical picture, laboratory studies, in combination with plain X-ray, <b>hepatic</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> and in the later cases with US (ultrasonography), CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and ERCP (endoscopic cholangiopangreatography). Abdominal and, rarely, thoracic and abdominal or thoracoabdominal incisions were used. Total cystopericystectomy in 8 patients and partial pericystectomy and proper drainage with one or two drainage tubes of the cystic cavity in the other 69 patients were carried out. Hospital stay was between 13 and 146 days with 5 re-operations. Two patients with grossly suppurated cysts and coexistent medical problems died. The disease recurred in five patients. Conclusions. We conclude that, under good perioperative antibiotic and metabolic coverage, the infected hydatid cysts have to be completely evacuated and properly drained. The application of “conservative” surgical procedures should be preferred. Further studies are needed to solve the clinical and therapeutic problems of this serious complication...|$|E
40|$|The differentiation, in {{an infant}} with cholestasis, between extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) and the {{neonatal}} hepatitis syndrome (NHS) {{is important in}} that laparotomy is always indicated in EHBA but is undesirable in NHS. This differentiation is particularly difficult in those infants with complete cholestasis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a commonly used investigation in infants with obstructive jaundice. The scintigraphic demonstration of excretion into the gut excludes extrahepatic obstruction, however, absence of excretion {{may be due to}} EHBA, severe cholestasis with patent extrahepatic bile ducts or poor uptake of the agent, and is therefore not diagnostic. This study has examined the quantitative measurement of the hepatic uptake of p-butyl IDA and Sn colloid, and an estimation of liver shape, in a group of patients with complete cholestasis in whom conventional scan interpretation, based on excretion into the-gut, would not be useful. The scans were recorded as dynamic studies and the resultant time-activity curves were subjected to curve fitting to calculate a rate constant for uptake of radiopharmaceutical. Liver shape was determined from the anterior static image of the colloid scan. The results show {{a significant difference between the}} EHBA and the NHS patients in the rate of uptake of p-butyl IDA, in the ratio of the rate of uptake of p-butyl IDA/the rate of uptake of colloid and in the measurements used to express liver shape. Using this method of scan interpretation, a diagnostic accuracy of 85 % was achieved in this study of patients who clinically, and on scan, had no evidence of bile flow. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> is therefore a useful investigation in the diagnostic work-up of infants presenting with obstructive jaundice even when bile flow is completely absent...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described for {{the measurement of}} the relative magnitudes of the hepatic-artery and portal-vein components of liver perfusion, using a gamma cam era and on-line computer system. This ratio is obtained from analysis of the time variation in liver activity on the first pass following bolus intravenous injection of a Tc- 99 m-labeled radiocolloid. The arterial and portal components are separated by their times of arrival at the liver. These arrival times are evaluated from activity time variations for spleen, left ventricle, and left kidney. Physiological validation of the technique was provided in a digestion study in which normal volunteers showed {{a significant increase in}} the portal-vein component 1 hr after a meal rela tive to the fasting situation. The results are compared with those from studies by other workers. The uncertainties and limitations of the technique are discussed and potential clinical uses suggested. J NucÃ-Med 24 : 1108 - 1113, 1983 Radionuclidcs have been used extensively in the study of liver perfusion and function (/). The total liver perfusion can be estimated from the rate of clearance of intravenously injected radiocolloid (2, 3). It may also be useful to measure the magnitudes of the hepatic-artery and portal-vein components of hepatic perfusion in a number of situations: 1. In portal hypertension and the assessment of sub sequent surgery. 2. In mesenteric vascular disease. 3. In studies of regenerative response. 4.

40|$|Background and aims—The liver is {{frequently}} involved in amyloidosis but {{the significance of}} hepatic amyloid has not been systematically studied. We have previously developed scintigraphy with 123 I serum amyloid P component (123 I-SAP) to identify and monitor amyloid deposits quantitatively in vivo and we report here our findings in hepatic amyloidosis.  Methods—Between 1988 and 1995, 805 patients with clinically suspected or biopsy proven systemic amyloidosis were evaluated. One hundred and thirty eight patients had AA amyloidosis, 180 had AL amyloidosis, 99 had hereditary amyloid syndromes, and 67 had dialysis related (β 2 microglobulin) amyloid. One hundred and ninety two patients with amyloidosis were followed for six months to eight years.  Results—Hepatic amyloid was found in 98 / 180 (54 %) AL and 25 / 138 (18 %) AA patients but in only 1 / 53 patients with familial transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy and in none with dialysis related amyloidosis. There was complete concordance between <b>hepatic</b> SAP <b>scintigraphy</b> and {{the presence or absence}} of parenchymal amyloid deposits on liver histology. Amyloidosis was never confined to the liver. Mortality was rarely due to hepatic failure, although hepatic involvement with AA amyloid carried a poor prognosis. Successful therapy to reduce the supply of amyloid fibril protein precursors was followed by substantial regression of all types of amyloid.  Conclusions—SAP scintigraphy is a specific and sensitive method for detecting and monitoring hepatic amyloid. Liver involvement is always associated with major amyloid in other organ systems and carries a poor prognosis in AA type. Appropriate therapy may substantially improve prognosis in many patients. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} two distinct imaging techniques to predict, before operation, unresectability compared with standard computed tomographic scan (CT). SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative identification of the number, size, and location of hepatic lesions is crucial in planning hepatic resection for colorectal hepatic metastases. Although infusion-enhanced CT is the standard, its limitations are the imaging of relatively isodense and/or small (< 1 cm) lesions. The increased sensitivity of CT arterial portography (CTAP) may be offset by false-positive results caused by benign lesions and flow artifacts. METHODS: Fifty-eight selected patients considered {{to be eligible for}} resection by standard CT had laparotomy. Before operation and in addition to CT, all patients had CT arterial portography and <b>hepatic</b> artery perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> (HAPS) using radiolabeled macroaggregated albumin. Early studies showed an increased sensitivity for detecting small lesions using the invasive CTAP. Similarly, the HAPS study has detected malignant lesions not observed by standard CT. RESULTS: Of 58 patients having laparotomy, 40 were resectable by either lobectomy (22) or trisegmentectomy (1) and the rest by single or multiple wedge resections. Eighteen patients could not be resected because of combined intra- and extrahepatic disease or the number and location of metastases. Standard CT detected 64 % of all lesions (12 % of lesions less than 1 cm). Unresectability was accurately predicted by CTAP and HAPS in 16 (88 %) and 15 (83 %), respectively, of the 18 patients considered ineligible for resection at laparotomy. Of the 40 patients who had resection for possible cure, CTAP and HAPS falsely predicted unresectability in 6 of 40 patients (15 %) and in 10 of 40 patients (25 %), respectively. The positive predictive value for unresectability of CTAP and HAPS was 73 % and 60 %, respectively. False-positive lesions after CTAP included hemangiomas, cysts, granulomas, and flow artifacts. False-positive HAPS lesions included patients in whom no tumor was found at surgery but with some identified by intraoperative ultrasound, blind biopsy, and blind resection. CONCLUSIONS: False-positive results by HAPS and CTAP may limit the ability of these tests to accurately predict unresectability before operation and may deny patients the chance for surgical resection. The HAPS study does, however, detect small lesions not seen by CT or CTAP. Standard CT, although less sensitive, followed by surgery and intraoperative ultrasound, does not necessarily preclude patients who could be resected...|$|R
40|$|Renal vein {{thrombosis}} in early infancy is a complication of dehydration and prolonged hypotension. The onset is usually acute {{and the most}} common clinical signs are uni- or bilateral frank masses, hematuria, proteinuria and thrombocytopenia. In most cases, with conservative management, the late outcome is favorable. In the adult, renal {{vein thrombosis}} is often a silent complication of the nephrotic syndrome, the hypercoagulability {{of which may be}} an important factor in the pathogenesis of the thrombosis. Clinically, the presentation of a sudden complete occlusion is that of severe abdominal and lumbar pain with hematuria and loss of function of the kidney that suffers hemorrhagic infarction. Physical examination often reveals an enlarged kidney. With gradual occlusion, renal function is preserved. The initial diagnostic approach is with ultrasound studies and computed tomography; definitive diagnosis is established by renal venography or by selective renal arteriography. In general, a conservative approach including the use of anticoagulant treatment is preferred to surgical intervention. Priapism is a persistent painful penile erection due to ischemic or non-ischemic causes; therapeutic intracavernosal injection of papaverine is becoming the most common cause. In early and mild stages, aspiration of blood from the corpora cavernosa supplemented with intracavernosal irrigation with alpha-stimulating agents is the procedure of first choice; in late and severe ischemia, a shunt procedure may become necessary. Hepatic vein thrombosis occurs in association with a number of conditions considered predisposing factors including the use of oral contraceptives. The clinical picture may be that of an acute illness with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, ascites and hepatic failure as well as early death. More often, the onset is insidious with slowly developing ascites and wasting. For the diagnosis, <b>hepatic</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> may be helpful but, at present, ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance scanning are procedures of choice. There is, as yet, no adequate treatment. A fatal outcome may be prevented by surgical decompression of the congested liver and, in recent years, liver transplantation has been employed. Portal vein thrombosis, in children, is usually considered a complication of umbilical sepsis or a result of a congenital abnormality of the portal vein. In adults, the most frequent causes are hepatic cirrhosis and neoplasia. Clinically, there may be a sudden appearance of ascites with resolution in a symptom-free interval until the onset of other features of portal hypertension occur. Currently, ultrasound real-time imaging supplemented with Doppler capability, computed tomography and magnetic resonance scanning provide the necessary diagnostic information. Variceal hemorrhage is often the first major complication requiring treatment. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|E
