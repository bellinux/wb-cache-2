At the American Music Awards of 2004, West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer Gretchen Wilson. He later commented, [...] "I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> new artist this year." [...] After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would [...] "really have a problem" [...] if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, [...] "I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want to hear all of that politically correct stuff." [...] On November 2, 2006, when his [...] "Touch the Sky" [...] failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for [...] "We Are Your Friends" [...] and argued that he should have won the award instead. Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst. On November 7, 2006, West apologized for this outburst publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane. He later spoofed the incident on the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live in September 2007.|$|E

Likewise she taught me such practices of our religion as I had not learnt from my grandmother, {{and then it was}} I found that I was to be brought up differently from Eustace and the others. I cried at first, and declared I would do like Eustace and my father.

60|$|TOMARCHER, I am now a {{distinguished}} litterytour, {{but that was}} not the real bent of my genius. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> player of hide-and-seek going; not a good runner, I was up to every shift and dodge, I could jink very well, I could crawl without any noise through leaves, I could hide under a carrot plant, it used to be my favourite boast that I always walked into the den. You may care to hear, Tomarcher, about the children in these parts; their parents obey them, they do not obey their parents; and I am sorry to tell you (for I dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one) that it does not pay one halfpenny. There are three sorts of civilisation, Tomarcher: the real old-fashioned one, in which children either had to find out how to please their dear papas, or their dear papas cut their heads off. This style did very well, but is now out of fashion. Then the modern European style: in which children have to behave reasonably well, and go to school and say their prayers, or their dear papas will know the reason why. This does fairly well. Then there is the South Sea Island plan, which does not do one bit. The children beat their parents here; it does not make their parents any better; so do not try it.|$|E

I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her [...] "no, only coarse-hand," [...] and then she said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.|$|E

Shall I tell you a compliment the Captain paid me? I must, it is so pretty.

60|$|I had half-expected {{a person}} of so much decision, and above all of so much consistency, would make me feel {{the weight of her}} disapproval of my own share in that little act of revelry by the most raffish part of the lakeside. But she {{maintained}} her claim to being a highly reasonable woman—I couldn’t but admire the justice of this pretension—by recognising my practical detachment. I had taken her daughter as I found her, which was, according to Mrs. Church’s view, in a very equivocal position. The natural instinct of a young man in such a situation is not to protest but to profit; and it was clear to Mrs. Church that I had {{had nothing to do with}} Miss Aurora’s appearing in public under the compromising countenance, as she regarded the matter, of Miss Ruck. Besides, she liked to converse, and she apparently did me the honour to consider that of all the inmates of the Pension Beaurepas <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> prepared for that exercise.
