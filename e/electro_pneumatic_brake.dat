5000|$|On 18 September {{there was}} another {{incident}} of the same type as in 1925 when a driver overshot the buffers {{and ran into the}} station offices, killing the assistant station master. Once again the driver was not familiar with the new type of brakes that had been introduced with the new train stock - this time 1951 <b>electro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> electric multiple units. [...] The report notes that the 4EPB units had been gradually introduced from 1951 and that all trains on the line were at that point of this type. The train was the 3:12 pm from Waterloo which stopped at Wimbledon, Surbiton and then all stations down the branch line. It arrived at Guildford at 4:0 pm (sic, and standard terminology at the time for 4:00 pm or 16:00). (Note the scheduled arrival time would have been 4:04 pm which accords more with the statement in the report that fire engines arrived within 4 minutes and the first ambulance at 4:10, but in any case this is not relevant to the accident as excessive speed was not considered as a cause).|$|E
5000|$|Currently {{electric}} train stock is kept and serviced at Durnsford Road depot, Wimbledon and formerly at Effingham Junction. The latter depot was closed in 1990 {{and has been}} refurbished as a servicing centre for track maintenance Multiple Purpose Vehicles (MPV) for AMEC SPIE and Railtrack. From electrification to the early 1960s train stock was formed of 3 and latterly 4 car 3-SUB and 4-SUB units. In the early 1940s a new 4-SUB was introduced, as shown in this photo by the Southern Railways Group. Subsequently, following World War 2, {{a large number of}} a sleeker design of 4-SUB was made as shown by Hart and Law. For a while in the late 1950s and 1960s the line was the only route from Waterloo that had 4-SUB units substituted by EPB units. For many years new train stock was tested for long periods on this route. New mainline 4LAV units were tried out in public service in the spring of 1932 on the Waterloo - Cobham - Guildford route, where the best known publicity shot was taken of an unidentifiable unit carrying headcode H with a bar above. The line received the first post-World War 2 EPB (<b>Electro</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Brake)</b> electric stock that became the standard for British Railways Southern Region for many years. In January 1952, 4EPB set number 5001 entered service on the line. One of the new {{electric train}}s in the 1950s is illustrated in (Sep 1959 The Railway Magazine).|$|E

Specifically, it adopts expert elicitation and fuzzy set theory to evaluate the failure rate of the basic events for the braking system, and uses a dynamic fault tree model to capture the dynamic failure mechanisms and calculates some reliability results by mapping a dynamic fault tree into an equivalent Bayesian network (BN). Furthermore, the schemes are proposed to update the diagnostic importance fac-tor (DIF) and the cut sets according to the sensors data. Finally, an efficient diagnostic algorithm is developed based on these reliability results to guide the maintenance crew to diagnose the braking system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can locate {{the fault of the}} braking system with less diagnosis cost...|$|R

40|$|Precision {{stopping}} is {{an important}} automated vehicle control function that is critical in applications such as precision bus docking, automated truck or bus fueling, as well as automatic intersection, or toll booth stopping.

40|$|The {{technology}} and systems used draw from both British and North American systems. Structure and rollingstock gauges are clearly {{influenced by the}} British railway practice, as are braking systems. Wagon couplings on freight trains are predominately auto couplers with friction wedge type draft gear packages showing the North American influence. Privately owned railways on iron ore mines in the Australia’s North West show even more North American influence with American style braking and larger structure and rollingstock gauges. Australia is also characterized by three track gauges a legacy of colonial and state governments before federation. The presence of narrow gauge of 1067 mm, results in a large fleet of rollingstock with design differing from standard gauge rollingstock in North America, Britain and the southern states of Australia. The chapter is arranged to firstly give an overview of longitudinal train dynamics. The second section goes into considerable detail on approaches to modelling longitudinal train dynamics. The most space {{is given to the}} modelling of the wagon connection model. Sub-sections are also devoted to modelling traction and dynamic braking systems, rolling resistance, air resistance, curving resistance, the effect ofgrades and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking.</b> The sub section on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> only provides an explanation of the effect of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> on train dynamics. Modelling <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems would require a chapter in itself.

40|$|The {{development}} of soft actuator for the rehabilitation device and power assisting devices has been required based on aging society. However, a flexible actuator that can generate both larger force and longer displacement {{has not been}} developed.

In the previous study, the flexible actuator with larger force and longer stroke that can adjust its stroke by giving stepping motion using <b>pneumatic</b> balloons and <b>brakes</b> was proposed and tested. However, the slipping of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> prevents the larger generated force.

40|$|Abstract––Milling is a {{metal removal}} process {{by means of}} using a {{rotating}} cutter having one or more cutting teeth. A milling machine is a machine tool used to machine solid materials. Milling machines are often classed in two basic forms horizontal and vertical. This refers to {{the orientation of the}} main spindle. At all types of milling machines, the cutting tool performs a rotational motion that is the cutting motion. The rotation axis of the tool could be horizontal or vertical, depending on machine tool version. The feeding motion is achieved either by part or tool, or both; usually on three perpendicular directions. Milling machine is automated using <b>Electro</b> <b>pneumatic</b> system. Milling process is the second most common method (after turning) for metal cutting and especially for the finishing of Machined parts. In modern industry the goal is to manufacture low cost, high quality products in short time. Keywords––Milling, <b>Electro</b> <b>pneumatic,</b> cutting tool, cutter, automated. I...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} an ASR system that is to control the slip of driving wheels of a vehicle by making use of the construction, function and operation of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> system and the pneumatic suspension control equipment. The essence of the solution presented is the use of the piston-spring part of the spring brake chamber as an actuator in the anti-slip regulation system. In the modernised version of the prototype, the system is controlled by means of a pneumatic solenoid valve, which performs the functions of an ASR modulator. The above concept may be implemented in trucks, buses, or other vehicles provided with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. The prototype ASR system proposed was verified by computer simulation tests. Dominika Trębac...|$|R
