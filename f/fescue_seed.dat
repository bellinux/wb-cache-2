Although milk yield of groups did not differ before treatment, at dry off (- 60 d prepartum) INF and BROMO cows produced less milk than CON. Throughout the treatment period, basal concentrations of PRL and the prepartum increase in plasma PRL were reduced in INF and BROMO cows compared with CON cows. Three weeks after the end of treatment, circulating concentrations of PRL were equivalent across groups. In the subsequent lactation milk yield was not decreased; in fact, BROMO cows exhibited a 9 % increase in milk yield relative to CON.

In Expt 1 steers weighed 286 kg, gained 0. 61 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 2. 72 mg ergot alkaloids including 1. 60 mg ergovaline per steer daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 23. 6 and 32. 3 °C. In Expt 2 steers weighed 348 kg, gained 1. 03 kg BW/d, E+ supplied 3. 06 mg ergot alkaloids including 2. 00 mg ergovaline daily, and mean minimum and maximum daily ambient temperatures were 11. 9 and 17. 4 °C. Dry matter intake was not affected by <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> treatment (P < 0. 20) in either experiment. In both experiments, E+ reduced HR (P < 0. 01) and increased insulin (P = 0. 07). Systolic BP minus diastolic BP decreased (P< 0. 05) for E+ in both experiments, due to increased diastolic BP in Expt 1 (P < 0. 03) and decreased systolic BP in Expt 2 (P < 0. 07).

Spring cereals reduced the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) available for grass seedling growth, causing transient increases in chlorophyll content and lower soil temperatures. Soil water content was also depleted, causing increased stomatal resistance and lower transpiration rate. Reductions in PPFD and soil water were responsible for poor stand establishment and grass crop growth.

40|$|Spotted {{knapweed}} (Centaurea stoebe), {{a common}} invasive {{plant in the}} Pacific Northwest, produces the racemic chemical ±-Catechin. Current research suggests that ±-Catechin inhibits root growth in Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), a common native bunch grass. These findings suggest that competition between these two species results in a negative fitness and diminished ecological success of Idaho fescue. This phenomenon of one species’ chemical exudate affecting another species’ fitness is known as allelopathy. Current allelopathic research is conducted in the dark to highlight any differential growth between control and experimental groups due to the over-expression of gibberellin hormones resulting in etiolation. It is difficult to simulate environmental conditions completely, and it is unknown if energy input through photosynthesis would affect ±-Catechin’s inhibition of Idaho fescue root elongation. Therefore, we will investigate if ±-Catechin’s allelopathic effects are mitigated by the input of energy by replicating previous ±-Catechin research under similar conditions and using light as the experimental variable.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Legislation {{to reduce}} open field burning in grass seed fields within the Willamette valley of western Oregon changed {{established}} production practices. In the creeping grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and {{creeping red fescue}} (Festuca rubra L.) non-thermal management resulted in reduced yield. Studies were conducted {{to examine the effects}} of three stubble height treatments in comparison to open field burning in creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> production. The effects of light quality on characteristics of plant development were investigated in field and controlled environments. Exogenous applications of plant growth regulators (PGR's) were made to elucidate the causes of low seed yields observed without burning. Field plots were prepared in fall of 1994, and 1995 in creeping red fescue commercial production fields as well as at Hyslop research farm in 1995. Three cultivars were included in the trial; Shademaster and Hector, which produce many rhizomes, and Seabreeze which produces few rhizomes. The effects of stubble height, PGRs, and field burning were measured during fall regrowth and flowering. Non-structural carbohydrates available for early regrowth were reduced when stubble was removed below 5. 0 cm, particularly in first-year stands. Fall tiller height was increased by stubble remaining and was negatively correlated with flowering. Rhizome development was reduced when stubble was removed mechanically or burned to the crown, whereas yield potential was increased. Fall ethylene application reduced fall tiller height, fall tiller number, and percent fertile tillers the following spring and was similar to control treatment compared with burn. Other PGRs did not produce consistent results in this study. Excess ethylene produced by decaying stubble may impact floral induction and reduce yield potential in creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops. Light quality as measured by red:far-red ratio (R:FR) was reduced by canopy closure during regrowth but not by the presence of stubble. In controlled environment studies, red light (R) promoted taller tillers, greater stage of development, and greater tiller number than far-red (FR) light. Sunlight enriched with FR completely inhibited rhizome formation. Results suggest that environments with excess reflected FR may negatively impact early development of creeping red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Some {{perennial}} {{grass seed}} {{crops such as}} red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) do not produce a profitable seed crop during the first growing season. The present establishment method in Oregon for red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops generally entails spring planting which does not satisfy vernalization requirements for seed production {{in the year of}} planting. This establishment procedure relies on the amortization of establishment costs over the seed producing life of the stand. In Europe, perennial grass seed crops are often established with annual companion crops such as winter rape, flax, peas and cereals. Companion crops provide income in the year of establishment, thereby increasing the profitability of the seed production venture {{over the life of the}} stand. However, the companion crop competes with the grass seed crop for light, soil moisture and nutrients which often causes unsatisfactory establishment. The primary objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of establishing red fescue with cereal companion crops in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The second objective was to examine the influence of cereal companion crops, cultivars and row spacings on the growth and environment of red fescue. This was investigated to identify companion cropping methods that would be the least competitive with the establishing seed crop. The third objective was to evaluate the effect of companion cropping on subsequent red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> production and income relationships over a two-year period. Two experiments were initiated in October 1982 and October 1983 at the Oregon State University Hyslop Crop Science Field Laboratory. 'Pennlawn' red fescue was established with two winter wheat cultivars, 'Hill 81 ' and 'Yamhill 1, and two winter barley cultivars, 'Hesk' and 'Scio', as companion crops. Cereal companion crops were drilled in 15 -, 30 -, 45 -, and 60 -cm row spacings, perpendicular to red fescue rows. Red fescue was also established without a companion crop as a control. Companion crop tiller height, tillers m⁻² and leaf area tiller⁻¹ were measured to determine their influence on red fescue growth and development during establishment. The effect of cereal companion crops on red fescue environment was investigated by measuring photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) incident on red fescue plants and by determining soil moisture levels. Red fescue tiller height, leaf area, dry matter production, and tillers m⁻² were examined to evaluate the effect of companion crops on red fescue growth. Companion crop grain yields were obtained to calculate additional revenues from establishment with companion crops. First-year red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield and yield components were measured to determine the seed production capability of red fescue established with cereal companion crops. Finally, a partial budgeting technique was employed to evaluate the economic feasibility of companion cropping in Oregon. Cereal companion crops markedly reduced PPFD incident on red fescue plants. This greatly decreased red fescue tiller m⁻², dry matter m⁻², individual tiller weight, and increased the height of tillers. Leaf area tiller⁻¹ was generally unaffected by companion crops. Increasing companion crop row spacing resulted in more red fescue tillers m⁻², dry matter m⁻² and reduced etiolation of tillers because of higher PPFD availability. Soil moisture content was not decreased by establishment with cereal companion crops. Although companion crops adversely affected red fescue growth during the establishment year, first-year seed yield was not significantly reduced. Red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yields ranged from 490 kg ha⁻¹ when planted with Hill 81 wheat to 654 kg ha⁻¹ with Scio barley. The seed yield of red fescue planted without a companion crop was 589 kg ha⁻¹. Establishment with Yamhill wheat in 15 -cm rows increased net income over a two-year period by 416 ha⁻¹ over monocultural red fescue. Establishment with Hesk barley proved to be the least successful in terms of income. Establishment with companion crops was shown to be most profitable when cereal market prices were high and red fescue prices low. The results of this research clearly indicate the potential for increased profits by establishment of red <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> crops with cereal companion crops...|$|E
40|$|Invasive plants {{decrease}} native plant {{diversity and}} alter ecosystem structure and function, and controlling their spread represents a significant cost to taxpayers. Most exotic species are not invasive {{in their native}} range, so successful invasive management requires understanding the biological mechanisms that allow exotic plants to gain advantage over native plants and become invasive. The Novel Weapons Hypothesis postulates that exotic plant exudates, compounds released from plant roots, have an allelopathic effect on native plants that reduces their fitness and decreases their ecological success. The allelopathic compounds could thus allow an exotic plant to become a superior competitor over native species and reach invasive status. Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), an introduced European annual, produces the racemic chemical (±) -catechin, which has allelopathic qualities on the native grass Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), although {{the severity of the}} allelopathy is contentious and uncertain.

Moreover, more {{studies are needed to}} determine which species will be benefitted or unaffected by the availability of roadside habitat. Bird censuses, nest searches and small mammal sampling were conducted along Illinois Route 5 (111 - 5) ROW’S in northwestern Illinois (Whiteside County).

The Red-winged Blackbird, however, made 92. 9 % of all bird nests. Thus, the 111 - 5 ROW in northwestern Illinois was not used by a wide array of birds for foraging or nesting. Small mammals, on the other hand, found these areas attractive.

Rough bluegrass is less tolerant of heat stress than desirable cool-season {{species such as}} tall fescue (TF, Festuca arundinacea Schreb. Syn [italicize]Schedonorus [italicize]arundinaceus Schreb.), and often declines during mid-summer due to biotic or abiotic stresses. The objectives of these 2011 - 2013 controlled environment and field experiments were to: 1) observe growth and physiological differences between ‘Laser’ and ‘Pulsar’ RBG and TF; 2) differentiate between physiological and pathological contributors to RBG decline; 3) {{determine the effects of}} TF seeding rate and mowing height on TF/RBG establishment when RBG is a seed contaminant; 4) evaluate herbicide combinations for selective RBG control; and 5) evaluate seasonal timing of glyphosate for nonselective RBG control. Tall fescue was less affected by elevated temperature than RBG. At 35 °C, Laser and Pulsar experienced similar reductions in quality, gross photosynthesis (Pg), shoot and root biomass, and root length density compared to when grown at 23 °C, but maximum electrolyte leakage was greater for Pulsar (63 %) than for Laser (49 %). Cell membrane thermostability could contribute to the better heat tolerance of Laser RBG. Evaluation of RBG foliage and roots did not reveal a fungal pathogen associated with RBG decline. Still, repeated applications of azoxystrobin (610 g a. i. ha⁻¹) or pyraclostrobin (556 g a. i. ha⁻¹) increased RBG quality, cover, and Pg during summer compared to untreated RBG, possibly due to poorly understood non-target physiological effects of the fungicides.

Alley cropping is an agroforestry practice that utilizes the space between rows of trees to produce an alternate crop. Tall fescue demonstrates shade tolerance and may be well suited for the production of certified seed in alley-cropping systems in Missouri. The objective was to evaluate tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> production in alley cropping. Three management practices associated with grass seed production were also evaluated; row spacing, N fertilization, and post-harvest residue management. In 2004 seed yields in the alley-cropped plots were similar to the open plots; in 2005, all plots had reduced yield and the alley-cropped plots yielded significantly less than the open plots. We attribute the decrease of the second year harvest to poor soil moisture and increased competition from trees. Seed yield was closely related to the number of reproductive culms m- 1 of row; however, there were no differences among treatments for seed weight and seeds culm- 1. This research shows that tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield in an alley-cropping system can be equal to yields from pasture until competition for resources from trees has a negative influence on the crop.

Ergot alkaloid concentrations in feces (p = 0. 02; 31. 02 to 225. 53 ng g - 1) and urine (p - 1 creatinine) were greater for mares receiving E+, E+ 5, or E+ 10 than E- and supplemental GLMN did not alter urinary ergot alkaloid excretion.

40|$|Many Poaceae grasses form a {{symbiosis}} with Epichloë fungal endophytes. Initially {{a serious}} problem in agriculture due to their production of alkaloids toxic to livestock, endophyte strains were identified that were less toxic to livestock whilst also possessing advantageous traits, including insect deterrent alkaloids. Selection and transfer of these endophytes into elite grass cultivars has resulted in pastures with improved persistence with no, or reduced, livestock toxicosis. These novel associations are now successfully marketed in New Zealand (NZ), Australia, USA and South America. Epichloë species exhibit strong host specificity and the asexual form is exclusively vertically transmitted through maternal lines via the seed embryo. In New Zealand, the dominant commercially available agricultural associations are between perennial ryegrass and E. festucae var. lolii strains that rely on the production of peramine, epoxy-janthitrems and ergovaline for their insect deterrent properties. However, AgResearch Ltd. and PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd. have developed a novel association between a tall-fescue-derived endophyte (designated strain AR 501) and a perennial ryegrass host. This brings {{a new set of}} secondary metabolites to the New Zealand agriculture scenario based on perennial ryegrass pastures, namely the loline alkaloids. An association formed between this fungus and perennial ryegrass would provide the grass sward excellent protection against ASW and grass grub, without creating any animal health problems. However, this process is far from perfect because of endophyte transmission failures. Possible reason for these failures include endophyte and host genotype incompatibility, environmental factors and crop management regimes. This study was an investigation of two of the factors that may affect the vertical transmission of AR 501 and the maintenance of endophyte viability in stored seeds. A controlled environment was used to determine the influence of temperature on endophyte transmission frequency, on fungal biomass and on concentrations of loline alkaloids, in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. Seedlings of both associations were arranged in a controlled environment at four temperature regimes ranging from 6 - 25 °C. After three and six weeks, endophyte transmission frequencies and endophyte biomass were quantified. After three weeks plants from both associations were transferred from a 12 / 6 °C to a 25 / 16 °C environment and their endophyte biomass re-calculated. For perennial ryegrass, the endophyte transmission frequency was significantly higher in plants kept at a cold (day/night 12 / 6 °C) temperature regime compared to the warm (day/night 25 / 16 °C) regime. This was not observed in tall fescue. The endophyte biomass concentrations of both associations increased when after three weeks plants were transferred from the cold to warm temperature regime. To better understand how the endophyte and its host behaved under different temperature regimes, the cardinal temperature for AR 501 and the host was determined. The cardinal temperatures for AR 501 were higher in perennial ryegrass (Tb of - 1. 82 °C, Topt of 25. 26 °C and Tm of 54. 94 °C) than in tall fescue (Tb of - 0. 04 °C, Topt of 15. 90 °C and Tm of 29. 04 °C). Cardinal temperatures were also higher for perennial ryegrass than for tall fescue. However the induction of thermodormancy in tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> interfered with the calculation of cardinal temperatures for the endophyte and tall fescue host, and it is probable that the optimal temperature for AR 501 in the tall fescue host may be higher than determined in this study. Storage factors such as temperature, seed moisture content and length of storage can affect the viability of both seed and endophyte. Seeds of both associations were stored for 12 months under four storage temperature regimes (5 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C and 30 °C) and at two seed moisture contents (10 % and 14 %) to investigate whether temperature and/or seed moisture content would affect endophyte viability in stored seeds. In both associations, endophyte in seeds stored at 30 °C and 14 % SMC had died after 12 months of storage, but in seeds stored in moisture proof packaging at lower temperature (5 or 10 °C), endophyte viability was maintained throughout the 12 months. In addition, the thermal time model was used to predict time for AR 501 viability in the stored seeds. The prediction was that AR 501 viability would remain above 70 % for 13 months longer in tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seeds</b> than in perennial ryegrass seeds if they were stored at low temperature (≤ 10 °C) and at 10 % SMC. The effect of seed crop management factors, such as nitrogen (N) fertiliser, fungicide and plant growth regulator application on AR 501 infection frequency in perennial ryegrass and Italian ryegrass was also investigated. None of the three seed production management factors affected the transmission of AR 501 from plant to seed in perennial ryegrass, but did so in Italian ryegrass. This requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm. ] is a warm season, {{perennial}} grass {{native to}} the Great Plains from southern Canada to Mexico (Beetle, 1950). This newly developed, low input, turf-type grass is recommended for use on low maintenance sites (Falkenberg-Borland and Butler, 1982; Pozarnsky, 1983; Wu and Harivandi, 1989; Shearman et al., 2005). Recently, the use of buffalograss as a turfgrass has increased due to its drought tolerance, low nutrient requirements, and low growing height (Harivandi and Wu, 1995; Frank et al., 2004). It is an excellent choice in California where water use is limited. Unsightly winter dormancy of buffalograss can be overcome by growing mixtures of buffalograss and fine fescue (Festuca spp.). Overtime species composition can be overtaken by the fine fescue, unintentionally converting the mixed turfgrass stand to a fine fescue monostand (Severmutlu, et al., 2005). Research on buffalograss establishment in fine leaved <b>fescues</b> from <b>seed</b> or by vegetative methods was completed from 2007 to 2009 at the California Polytechnic State University Horticulture Unit in San Luis Obispo, California. Comparisons were made between mixtures of eight cultivars of buffalograss (Prairie, Prestige, UC Verde, 609, Bowie, Cody, Texoka, and Bison) and three fine leaved fescue species [hard fescue (Festuca trachyphylla Thuill.), sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L), and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) ] to determine which combination and establishment strategy provides the highest quality turf for the California central coast region. Evaluations made on buffalograss establishment and competitive ability when grown in pre-existing fine <b>fescue</b> turfgrasses showed <b>seeded</b> cultivars (Bowie, Cody, Texoka, and Bison) were unsuccessfully established (zero percent coverage in two growing seasons), and vegetative cultivar (Prairie, Prestige, 609 and UC Verde) establishment was greatly dependent {{on the type of}} cultivar planted. After two growing seasons, buffalograss cultivar UC Verde had the highest establishment rate (38. 6 percent living ground cover) and Prestige had the lowest (11. 4 percent living ground cover). Results from this study do not recommend establishing seeded buffalograss cultivars into pre-existing fine leaved fescue turfgrass stands. Vegetative buffalograss cultivars can be established into pre-existing fine leaved fescue turfgrass stands; however, this process is too slow for most turfgrass practitioners and is quite unsightly in winter dormancy during the establishment process...|$|R

In contrast to highly significant impact on tall <b>fescue</b> <b>seed</b> yield examined, interrow spacing and the application of mineral fertilizer did not show significant effect on germination energy and total germinability. Although the impact of interrow spacing on the 1000 seeds mass appeared significant, application of mineral fertilizer did not.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] mixtures and pure stands of perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, white clover and red clover were grown in three-cut and five-cut systems at ?s, southern Norway, at a low fertilization rate (100 kg N ha? 1 year? 1). Over a three-year experiment, we found strong positive effects of species diversity on annual dry-matter yield and yield stability under both cutting frequencies. The overyielding in mixtures relative to pure stands was highest in the five-cut system {{and in the second}} year. Among the possible pairwise species interaction effects contributing to the diversity effect, the grass?grass interaction was the strongest, being significant in both cutting systems and in all years. The grass?legume interactions were sometimes significant, but no significant legume?legume interaction could be detected. Competitive relationships between species varied from year to year and also between cutting systems. Estimations based on species identity effects and pair-specific interactions suggested that the optimal proportions of red clover, white clover, perennial ryegrass and tall <b>fescue</b> in <b>seed</b> mixtures would have been around 0 ? 1, 0 ? 2, 0 ? 4 and 0 ? 3 in the three-cut system, and 0 ? 1, 0 ? 3, 0 ? 3 and 0 ? 3 in the five-cut systemauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Given the {{relatively}} low temperatures and short duration of fires in shortgrass steppe (Augustine et al. 2014 b), {{it is unlikely that}} the mechanism for reduction in sixweeks <b>fescue</b> is heat-induced <b>seed</b> mortality (Odion 2000, Vermeire and Rinella 2009). Burning when the dominant perennial grasses are dormant (typically late October to early April) corresponds to burning during the early vegetative stages of growth of sixweeks fescue, likely leaving the plants vulnerable to the lethal aboveground temperatures created by fire. In turn, fire-induced direct mortality of sixweeks fescue at this early vegetative stage increased the productivity of C 4 perennial grasses. Similarly, in mixed-grass prairie, spring burning killed seedlings of Bromus arvensis and B. tectorum, and increased productivity of C 4 perennial grasses (White and Currie 1983, Whisenant and Uresk 1990, Vermeire et al. 2011).|$|R
