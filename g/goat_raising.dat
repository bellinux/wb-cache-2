In Mamber goats, PEG supplementation was associated with higher body weight (BW) gain during pregnancy (p< 0. 01), higher kid birth-weight (p< 0. 05) and daily BW gain until weaning (p< 0. 10 and p< 0. 05 in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively), and no difference in milk yield. In contrast, the response of DamascusAnglo-Nubian goats to PEG was a 43 % increase in milk yield (p< 0. 001) but no response in kid weight at birth. These responses are consistent with previous findings that show the resilience of Mamber goats to practices aimed at increasing their milk production while these goats respond well to practices that improve the probability of successful reproduction in harsh environments. In contrast, DamascusAnglo-Nubians respond to increased available nutrients by increasing their milk production. Supplementation with PEG has the potential to improve the profitability of systems in which liberally supplemented and high-yielding dairy goats feed on Mediterranean browse.

During the pre-hispanic period, the region was inhabited by many different Native American cultures that made use of fire, mostly for agricultural or agroforestry purposes. The main crop was maize.

The natives were the servants of feudal systems dominated by the conquerors. The Catholic Spaniard friars protected the native populations.

Today, these activities include the dominant traditional uses of fire and are an important cause of forest fires (Rodríguez-Trejo and Sierra-Pineda 1992, Paz 1993).

40|$|The United Nations have {{established}} eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) during the Millennium Summit in 2000. Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger before 2015 {{has been the}} first of them. To achieve these goals, funding has been provided by several foundations and International Organizations such as the International Found for Agriculture and Development (IFAD). Goat activities are considered pathway out of poverty for poor smallholder farmers {{in the developing world}} and many projects have been implemented to promote <b>goat</b> <b>raising.</b> Unfortunately, references to scale up their successful factors are still very scarce and many projects were failures by lack of references, basic initial information, and business planning. The present study has been realized for IFAD to scale up and transfer successful practices and know –how on projects involving goats. A comparative analysis of more than 12 significant cases all over the world has been realized to scale up the successful factors on sustainable pro-poor small ruminant development projects. Dairy, meat and fiber commodities have been considered. By using Knowledge Harvesting methodology and exchanges with experts and actors involved in the several projects, the context of each case and the actors system have been described as well as the main productions systems. For each situation, Strong and Weak internal points, external Opportunities or Threats (SWOT) have been identified and discussed within two working group meetings and one seminar. After these general considerations on goat production systems and commodities, a typology based the possible objectives of each project has been built. The most accurate investments for each type are described and a methodology is proposed to choose them and how to monitor the implementation of each project. A special focus has been on the importance on the Goat Value Chain and a full Goat Value Chain specific tool kit has been prepared to support operationally the project leaders. A cost–benefits analysis evaluating the Investment Return Rates (IRR) and based on the studied cases has been realized by a FAO agro-economist expert. This collective project has shown that by using simple tools and indicators, it is possible to monitor professionally the development projects by minimizing the risks of failure. Besides, it confirmed that the development of livestock by small holders can be in many cases profitable and economically, environmentally and socially sustainable solutions for many territories. The organization of a competitive intelligence and information system is necessary in these specific situations for a better governance of development projects...|$|E
40|$|Abanoz Plateau {{is located}} in 36 o 18 ’ north {{latitude}} and 32 o 56 ’ east longitude on Taşeli plateau in the borders of ÇukurabanozVillage connected to Anamur district of Mersin city. The plateau was set on a polje that is surrounded by the contour line of 1450 m. on the 52 nd km. of Anamur-Ermenek highway. The {{aim of this study}} is to contribute to its presentation by determining geographical elements that are efficient for thesettlement and improvement of Abanoz Plateau. In the preparation of the study firstly in the different times of the year (2008 July, 2008 December) land studies and required negotiations were performed. In the meantime, both ÇukurabanozHeadmanship’s and some official institutions’ data were followed up. Then the land data obtained in the plateau (photograph,statistical information and negotiation notes) and gathered statistical data were commented and the plateau was evaluated in termsof accommodation geography. At the end of the study, some advices and results were tried to be set forted about the plateauaccommodation. Transhumance in Anamur is a significant activity. Transhumants that use Anamur beaches as winter quarters in winter,migrates to plateaus that have various altitudes being on Taşeli Plateau as from April. There are 37 small and large plateausettlements belonging to district centre and villages in Taşeli Plateau. The most important plateaus of these are: Kaş, Abanoz,Akpınar, Kaysan, Çandır, Çamurlu, Barçın, Elbalak, Halkalı, Sanova, Kırkkuyu. The improvements in socio-economic structuresof people living in Anamur and Anamur villages have changed the transhumance based on husbandry in a big deal. Instead ofthat, countryside transhumance has come into prominence in order to get rid of hot and moist air. After all, plateaus in whichtranshumance are being performed are available. The most developed caduceus countryside settlement in Anamur is Abanoz Plateau. Geographical elements have gotsignificant roles on the establishments and developments of this plateau. In terms of physical geography, the plateau reflects thefeatures of Taşeli Plateau character. Because in Taşeli Plateau, Miocene limestone that is horizontally stratified and eligible to melt,is common. A number of karstic melting and deposition patterns developed on these limestones. One of the karstic meltingpatterns, Abanoz polje has been the most important factor enabling the emplacement of the plateau. Since the plateau is in high place comparing with coastal zone in Mediterranean climate (1450 m.) becomes an auspicioushabitat in terms of climate conditions in summer. When the distribution of climate data is taken into account according to seasonsand months, in the plateau around Mediterranean mountain climate is seen that is hot, dry in summer and rainy, harsh climate Depressive air conditions of which moisture gradient is extremely high affect human life negatively. That reason comprises asignificant effect in moving plateaus of people in summer months. And this shows us the effect of physical geographical elementsin improvement of transhumance that is the one of anthropogeography elements. Yoruks who settled around Anamur in Seljuk Period, continued transhumance through long ages that is based on husbandryas a continuance of Middle East migration culture. However, improving of life conditions of the public in aspect of socioeconomyalso affected transhumance activity. Because the public getting along with nomadic livestock, inclined to agriculturebased on greenhousing. As a result of this, leisure and recreation activities became widespread. In the mean time we performed land studies in Abanoz Plateau, making the amount of population is hard due to the fact thatthere is no regular enumeration. However, according to both Çukurabanoz Headmanship and the numbers of electric and watersubscribers, 7500 people were determined involving in the activity of transhumance in 2008 transhumance period. Thepopulation in the plateau starts coming beginning from April and becomes the highest level in July and August. In the plateau, local services that are necessary to be in a settlement are available. In the period of transhumance, social andcommercial services like health centre, mosque, grocery store, restaurant, bake house, butcher, coffee houses that can fulfil theneeds are available. There has been no important substructure problem like electric supply, transportation, water supply,telephoning. However, there can be some water cuts when population level is high in summer months (July, August) While traditional houses that are suitable for nature conditions were common in Abanoz Plateau in the past, today concretetype houses (two-three storey in patches) that do not reflect natural beauty of the plateau are being built. In these buildings,manufacturing-produced construction material (like cement, brick, iron and lime) is used mostly. Ponding that is made by doline’snot being able to debark the upward water in winter months that evacuates water, is built on concrete poles in order not todamage the houses are polje base. Economic activity areas of people going up to the plateau in Abanoz, are mostly in the permanent settlements. For thatreason, economic activity is not common in the plateau. However, economic activities of which gaining are not so much high likecommercial shops, husbandry, agriculture and apiculture that fulfil the needs of transhumants. In 2008 transhumance season, ascommercial workplaces, 6 grocery stores, 6 bake houses, 3 restaurants, 3 butchers, 4 coffee houses offered services. Most of thecommercial workings in the plateau are food premises. This is because the population predominantly consists of consumingpeople like retired, student, worker and officer. Transhumants fulfil their needs from plateau bazaar that is set every Wednesday. In husbandry which is an old economic activity in plateau, mostly hair <b>goat</b> <b>raising</b> is in the foreground. However, thedecadence of the husbandry value every passing day decreased the number of families dealing with husbandry. In the study weperformed in the plateau in 2008 summer, 1700 hair goats, 120 sheeps, 30 dairy cattles were ascertained. Products like meat, milk,cheese, butter, skim-milk cheese are taken from animals. The plateau where the altitude is high and grass variety is excessive,apiculture is also performed and honey obtained from this production is famous named Abanoz plateau honey. Around Abanoz plateau, as agricultural crops; especially wheat, tomato, onion, cucumber, paprika, bean and some field cropslike apple, pear, greengage, grape are grown up. These crops are for their own needs and have unimportant commercial value. While weaving was an important activity in the past in the plateau, today it is mostly abandoned. Within these traditionalweaving products, yoruk rugs, saddlebags, hairy sackings, gunny bags, salt bags are the most conspicuous. The alternation of the Abanoz plateau from transhumance function based on husbandry to the transhumance aiming leisureand recreation has brought along some changes and troubles. Especially; 1 - The most remarkable feature of the plateau is administrational problem. Because Abanoz that absorbs population intranshumance season is administrated by Headmanship that is rudimentary in aspect of functioning. Therefore, Headmanshipremains incapable of fulfilling the services of the plateau. 2 - Especially for weaving, some hand crafts and life culture as nomadic transhumance based on husbandry caused largely tobe abandoned. 3 - In the plateau, accessibility, compliance of substructure services caused population increasing. And gradually increasingpopulation has brought along problems like irregular settlements, the lack of potable water and environmental pollution. 4 - In the past traditional houses that are compatible with nature were abandoned in the plateau and today concretereinforced buildings that are high-rise and do not reflect environment beauty become widespread. This situation is going toconvert the plateau into a city scene that is out of its function. 5 - In the plateau, there is no accommodation places (except for forestry department guesthouse) in which outer guests canstay. 6 - The reawakening of the plateau in tourism with completing tourism substructure by determining cultural, natural,historical values must be aimed. I am of opinion that the expanding to tourism of the plateau will contribute to both Turkey andregion econom...|$|E
