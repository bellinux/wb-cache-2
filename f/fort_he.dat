5|$|In 1644, Giovanni de’ Medici {{proposed}} that Fort St. Angelo in Birgu be abandoned {{and a new}} fort be constructed on Orsi Point. The new fort would have been also called Fort St. Angelo, and would be manned with the garrison of the old <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> drew up plans for the proposed fort, but they were never implemented.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} a rival railroad {{company and}} laying track {{to supply the}} US Cavalry near the Mexican border, Amelia meets a French prospector named Pierre Beaumont, who helps her and US Cavalry commander, Major Cooper, defeat a Mexican army attacking a <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> then lures Amelia to a mine in Colorado where a surprise visit from an aged Kanyenke, who has brought Cooper and the cavalry with him, reveals Beaumont {{as the leader of}} Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase Beaumont through the mines, where they find a map to the Lake of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Henry Dodge was at Gratiot's Grove {{when the}} war descended upon Spafford Farm, having just sent his volunteers to their forts to {{resupply}} and recuperate. Shortly after he arrived back at his home <b>fort,</b> <b>he</b> received word of the Aubrey murder at Fort Blue Mounds and the incident at Spafford Farm. Dodge ordered militia detachments from Fort Defiance, Fort Jackson, and Fort Hamilton {{to the scene of}} the massacre.|$|E

5|$|Finn wanders {{all over}} Ooo until {{he manages to}} locate Jake, who is {{fulfilling}} a bizarre lifelong ambition of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn expresses his support, but decides {{to head back to}} the Tree <b>Fort.</b> <b>He</b> leaves a walkie talkie with Jake. After a period of time passes, Jake begins absentmindedly narrating the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery began entrenching {{his troops}} around the fort on September 18, and {{constructing}} a mortar battery {{south of the}} <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie, one of the sites {{where there was a}} crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal. Ethan Allen went with a small company of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, and take them to monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him there. Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.|$|E
50|$|Leadbetter was {{promoted}} to captain on October 16, 1852 and spent 1853 - 57 at Mobile, Alabama, working on the construction and/or repair of the city's harbor <b>forts.</b> <b>He</b> resigned from the U.S. Army {{on the last day}} of 1857 and settled in Alabama. There he later became the state's chief engineer.|$|R
50|$|Claude-Godefroy Coquart (February 2, 1706 - July 4, 1765) was a Jesuit {{priest who}} {{probably}} arrived in Quebec in 1739. He was almost immediately assigned to accompany La Vérendrye {{to the western}} <b>forts.</b> <b>He</b> was to replace Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau who had lost {{his life in the}} massacre on Lake of the Woods in 1736.|$|R
50|$|In early 1564, Spanish {{governor}} Pedro de Villagra, {{was taking}} {{measures to protect}} all the towns and <b>forts</b> <b>he</b> already held against the growing Mapuche revolt and to organize a field army in Concepcion. He knew {{that one of the}} Mapuche objectives was to surround Concepcion, and preparations were made to support a long siege.|$|R
5|$|Scott {{served under}} George Washington in the Braddock Expedition, a {{failed attempt to}} capture Fort Duquesne from the French. For most of 1756 and {{the early part of}} 1757, he divided his time between Fort Cumberland and Fort Washington, {{conducting}} scouting and escort missions. In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to Captain Robert McKenzie at Fort Pearsall. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned little on either mission. In November, Scott was part of the Forbes Expedition that captured the <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> spent {{the latter part of the}} year at Fort Loudoun, where Washington promoted him to ensign.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Henry, the Confederates faced some difficult choices. Grant's army now divided Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston's two main forces: P.G.T. Beauregard at Columbus, Kentucky, with 12,000 men, and William J. Hardee at Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 22,000 men. Fort Donelson had only about 5,000 men. Union forces might attack Columbus; they might attack Fort Donelson and thereby threaten Nashville, Tennessee; or Grant and Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who was quartered in Louisville with 45,000 men, might attack Johnston head-on, with Grant following behind Buell. Johnston was apprehensive about {{the ease with which}} Union gunboats defeated Fort Henry (not comprehending that the rising waters of the Tennessee River played a crucial role by inundating the <b>fort).</b> <b>He</b> was more concerned about the threat from Buell than he was from Grant, and suspected the river operations might simply be a diversion.|$|E
5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} fort by straight forward attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort. Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into the <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements to fall outside the fort, while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons to reply, the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E
50|$|Moropant {{introduced}} sound revenue {{administration to}} Shivaji's regime, and {{played an important}} role in resource planning concerning defenses and maintenance of strategic <b>forts.</b> <b>He</b> was also responsible for the construction and administration of Pratapgad.

2500|$|After the war, Farnsworth {{was sent}} to Alaska where he founded and {{constructed}} <b>Fort</b> Gibbon. <b>He</b> was then sent to the Philippines where he founded and built <b>Fort</b> William McKinley. <b>He</b> also expanded the cantonments at the Presidio of San Francisco.|$|R

5|$|Matthias {{introduced}} {{new taxes}} and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in Transylvania in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias {{declared war on}} George of Poděbrady, the Hussite King of Bohemia, and conquered Moravia, Silesia, and Lausitz, {{but he could not}} occupy Bohemia proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Poděbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected Vladislaus Jagiellon, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother Casimir, but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at Breslau in Silesia (now Wrocław in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia, enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized Šabac, an important Ottoman border <b>fort.</b> <b>He</b> concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied Lower Austria between 1482 and 1487.|$|E
5|$|Paskevich {{expected}} a Polish counter-attack aimed at recapturing the lost forts, so he ordered his troops {{to halt the}} advance, rebuild the ramparts and construct new artillery emplacements facing the city. Further movement {{in the vicinity of}} Wola was blocked by Polish artillery from Fort 59, but within two hours Russian sappers prepared Fort 56 to serve as an artillery outpost for up to 20 pieces of artillery. Paskevich also sent tirailleurs and rifle-armed skirmishers forward to probe and harass Polish defences around Fort 23. Polish field artillery left Fort 21 and pushed back the Russian light infantry, but were then attacked by Russian I Corps' artillery and forced to flee. Only then did General Bogusławski realise that Fort 56 might need assistance. To reconnoitre enemy movements and possibly deliver munitions to the <b>fort</b> <b>he</b> dispatched General Młokosiewicz with his infantry brigade of 1,000 men. Two Russian rifle regiments fled before his columns and Młokosiewicz's men almost reached the fort, but Russian artillery opened fire and inflicted several dozen casualties on the Poles. Młokosiewicz realised that Fort 56 was lost and quickly retreated towards Forts 21 and 22. Two Russian rifle regiments (1st and 2nd) tried to pursue, but were defeated by Polish artillery and retreated.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{had been}} an Ottoman sanjakbey, who {{defected}} from the empire and united several Albanian princes under the League of Lezhë. From Krujë, his main <b>fort,</b> <b>he</b> {{led the league in}} the Ottoman-Albanian wars. Having defeated the Ottomans in many battles he allied with Western Christian states and leaders, especially with Alfonso V of Aragon and the Papal States. On 14 August 1464, Pope Pius II, one of Skanderbeg's major benefactors, died and his plans for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The alliances and promises for help from the major Christian powers were canceled {{with the exception of the}} Kingdom of Hungary under Matthias Corvinus and the Republic of Venice. Sultan Mehmed II realized the power vacuum created after Pius died and he tried to take advantage of the situation. He thus attempted to sign a peace agreement with Hungary and Venice so that his forces could focus on Albania to gain a base for future campaigns in the Italian peninsula. His efforts were unsuccessful, however, since neither Venice nor Hungary accepted his proposed treaty. Mehmed thus kept his armies stationed in the Balkans, one force near Jajce in Bosnia, one in Ohrid, and another one in the Morea.|$|E
