60|$|To conclude. Beside those before-mentioned primary {{qualities in}} bodies, viz. bulk, figure, <b>extension,</b> <b>number,</b> and motion of their solid parts; all the rest, whereby we {{take notice of}} bodies, and {{distinguish}} them one from another, are nothing else but several powers in them, depending on those primary qualities; whereby they are fitted, either by immediately operating on our bodies to produce several different ideas in us; or else, by operating on other bodies, so to change their primary qualities as to render them capable of producing ideas in us different from what before they did. The former of these, I think, may be called secondary qualities IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVABLE: the latter, secondary qualities, MEDIATELY PERCEIVABLE.|$|E
60|$|Fifthly, This further may be {{observed}} concerning simple Simple ideas and their names, {{that they have}} but few ascents in linea praedicamentali, (as they call it,) from the lowest species to the summum genus. The reason whereof is, that the lowest species being but one simple idea, nothing can be left out of it, that so the difference being taken away, it may agree with some other thing in one idea common to them both; which, having one name, is the genus of the other two: v.g. {{there is nothing that}} can be left out of the idea of white and red to make them agree in one common appearance, and so have one general name; as RATIONALITY being left out of the complex idea of man, makes it agree with brute in the more general idea and name of animal. And therefore when, to avoid unpleasant enumerations, men would comprehend both white and red, and several other such simple ideas, under one general name, they have been fain to do it by a word which denotes only the way they get into the mind. For when white, red, and yellow are all comprehended under the genus or name colour, it signifies no more but such ideas as are produced in the mind only by the sight, and have entrance only through the eyes. And when they would frame yet a more general term to comprehend both colours and sounds, and the like simple ideas, they do it by a word that signifies all such as come into the mind only by one sense. And so the general term QUALITY, in its ordinary acceptation, comprehends colours, sounds, tastes, smells, and tangible qualities, with distinction from <b>extension,</b> <b>number,</b> motion, pleasure, and pain, which make impressions on the mind and introduce their ideas by more senses than one.|$|E

50|$|The “call park” {{feature is}} {{activated}} by pressing a preprogrammed button (usually labelled “Call Park”) or a special sequence of buttons. This transfers the current telephone conversation to an unused <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> and immediately puts {{the conversation on}} hold. (This is called parking the call; and the call {{is said to have}} parked onto a certain extension. Essentially, call parking temporarily assigns an <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> to an incoming call.) The telephone system will then display the <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> of the parked call so that the call can later be retrieved.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} the pro-Σ anabelian {{geometry}} of hyperbolic curves, where Σ is a nonempty set of prime numbers, over Galois groups of “solvably closed <b>extensions</b> ” of <b>number</b> fields — i. e., infinite <b>extensions</b> of <b>number</b> fields which have no nontrivial abelian extensions. The main {{results of this}} paper are, in essence, immediate corollaries of the following three ingredients: (a) classical results concerning the structure of Galois groups of number fields; (b) an anabelian result of Uchida concerning Galois groups of solvably closed <b>extensions</b> of <b>number</b> fields; (c) a previous result of the author concerning the pro-Σ anabelian geometry of hyperbolic curves over nonarchimedean local fields. 1...|$|R

50|$|When the PBX {{is capable}} of direct inward dialing, the <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> should be written {{directly}} after the phone number, without using any distinct symbols. If {{there is a need}} to indicate in-dialing capability of the telephone number, a number of dots (....) corresponding to the length of the <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> can be added at the end.|$|E

5000|$|While persons {{within an}} {{enterprise}} {{served by a}} PBX can call each other by dialing their <b>extension</b> <b>numbers,</b> incoming calls, i.e., calls originating from a telephone not served by the PBX but intended for a party served by the PBX, required assistance from a switchboard operator (also called a [...] "switchboard attendant") or a telephone service called DID ("Direct Inward Dialing"). Direct Inward Dialing has advantages such as rapid connection to the destination party and disadvantages including cost, lack of identification of the called organization and use of ten-digit telephone numbers.|$|R
60|$|Let us examine that {{principle}} of mathematics, viz. THAT THE WHOLE IS BIGGER THAN A PART. This, I take it, is reckoned amongst innate principles. I am sure it has {{as good a}} title as any to be thought so; which yet nobody can think it to be, when he considers the ideas it comprehends in it, WHOLE and PART, are perfectly relative; but the positive ideas to which they properly and immediately belong are <b>extension</b> and <b>number,</b> of which alone whole and part are relations. So that if whole and part are innate ideas, <b>extension</b> and <b>number</b> must be so too; it being impossible to {{have an idea of}} a relation, without having any at all of the thing to which it belongs, and in which it is founded. Now, whether the minds of men have naturally imprinted on them the ideas of <b>extension</b> and <b>number,</b> I leave to be considered by those who are the patrons of innate principles.|$|R

50|$|The Cisco Extension Mobility feature, {{sometimes}} referred to as hoteling, allows a user to temporarily configure another IP telephone as his own. He therefore has to log into that IP telephone with a username and PIN. Once logged in, the phone has the users profile information, including his <b>extension</b> <b>number</b> (the reason for calling it ‘extension mobility’), dial permissions and other feature settings (e.g. call forwards).|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} number assignments may {{be independent of}} any direct inward dialing (DID) services provided by external telecommunication vendors. For numbers without DID access, the internal switch relays externally originated calls via an operator, an automated attendant or an electronic interactive voice response system. Telephone numbers for users within such systems are often published by suffixing the official telephone number with the <b>extension</b> <b>number,</b> e.g., 1-800-555-0001 x2055.|$|E
