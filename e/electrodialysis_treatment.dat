40|$|The dyeing agate employs large {{quantities}} of potentially harmful wastewater to the environment, such as, effluent with chromium and nitrate ions. The aim {{of the present study}} was investigate the electrodialysis technique efficiency in the removal of contaminant ions present in wastewater generated by the agate dyeing industry and evaluate the toxicity of the effluent studied. The electrodialysis experiments were performed in acrylic cell 5 compartments separated by ion selective membranes and ﬁtted with a 70 TiO 2 / 30 RuO 2 DSA® anode and a titanium plate as cathode. After application of the <b>electrodialysis</b> <b>treatment,</b> toxicity of the effluent was evaluated in two different trophic levels, Artemia salina and Lactuca sativa. The results indicated the removal of 233. 3 mg L- 1 of nitrate and 223. 6 mg L- 1 of chromium was extracted, in flow mode. The toxicity tests showed a tendency to decrease the percentage of mortality of organisms after application of the electrodialysis technique. Thus, it concludes that the electrodialysis is an effective method for treating effluents containing metal ions, and is possible reuse the recovered solutions in the dyeing process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFouling of {{membrane}} is {{the major}} scientific lock for electromembrane process intensification limiting their applications. The fouling evolution on ion-exchange membranes was monitored during three consecutive <b>electrodialysis</b> <b>treatments</b> of a solution containing a high magnesium/calcium ratio. Following these experiments, we proposed a mechanism to explain the change in fouling nature on the CEM from a mix of calcite, brucite, and portlandite after the first ED run to a predominant amorphous Mg(OH) 2 after the third run {{and the formation of}} calcite cubic crystal on the AEM, although Mg 2 +, an inhibitor of CaCO 3 formation, was present in the solution. It was also demonstrated that the nature and structure of the AEM and CEM foulings formed were self-oriented by the formation of the CEM first layer of fouling appearing during the first run. Our findings have implications for electromembrane process fouling control {{as well as in the}} understanding of CaCO 3 crystallization phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Using the <b>electrodialysis</b> in <b>treatment</b> of rinsewater, {{two other}} {{solutions}} are obtained: one concentrated, whichcan {{be returned to}} the galvanic bath; and the other diluted, which has perfect conditions to be reused in aclosed circuit as rinsewater. The aim of this work was to evaluate the competitiveness between metallic ions(iron, niquel and zinc) during the electrodialysis technique as a method for treatment of wastewater produced bythe phosphatization process. Experiments were conduced with different rinsewater composition and Nafion® 450 and Selemion® AMP membranes. The results obtained show correlation between percentual extractions, currentefficiency and the presence of metallic ions in solution...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{finishing}} wastewater containing ions of Zn, Ni, Cu, Fe and Al, {{as well as}} of Na and CN- in alkaline pH {{was treated}} by <b>electrodialysis.</b> The <b>treatment</b> was conducted in a laboratory cell and in a pilot plant unity. The experiments were carried out using Nafion and Selemion membranes. Results showed most of the metallic ions to have an anionic nature, due to the formation of coordination complexes. Each metallic ion showed a different rate of extraction from the treated solution, depending on the galvanostatic or potentiostatic operation mode. Zn, Ni and Cu have shown higher extraction under galvanostatic control. For Al, higher extraction was observed when the experiment was conducted in a potentiostatic mode. Fe ions exhibited an unexpected behavior, not being removed {{in the same way as}} the other ions. The best extraction results were obtained within 2 - 3 h of treatment...|$|R
40|$|The metal-finishing and tannery {{industries}} {{have been under}} strong pressure to replace their current wastewater treatment based on a physicochemical process. The electrodialysis process is becoming an interesting alternative for wastewater <b>treatment.</b> <b>Electrodialysis</b> is a membrane separation technique, in which ions are transported from one solution to another through ion-exchange membranes, using an electric field as the driving force. Blends of polystyrene and polyaniline were obtained {{in order to produce}} membranes for electrodialysis. The produced membranes were applied in the recovery of baths from the metal-finishing and tannery industries. The parameter for electrodialysis evaluation was the percentage of chromium extraction. The results obtained using these membranes were compared to those obtained with the commercial membrane Nafion 450...|$|R
40|$|A new {{substituted}} polythiophene derivative bearing malonic acid, poly(2 -thiophen- 3 -yl-malonic acid), {{has been}} prepared and characterized using {{a strategy that}} combines both experimental and theoretical methodologies. The chemical structure of this material has been investigated using FTIR and 1 H NMR, and its molecular conformation has been determined using quantum mechanical calculations. Interestingly, {{the arrangement of the}} inter-ring dihedral angles was found to depend on the ionization degree of the material, that is, on the pH, which has been found completely soluble in aqueous base solution. Thus, the preferred anti-gauche conformation changes to syn-gauche when the negatively charged carboxylate groups transforms into neutral carboxylic acid. UV−vis experiments and quantum mechanical calculations on model systems with a head-to-tail regiochemistry showed that the lowest π−π* transition energy is 2. 25 and 2. 39 eV for the negatively charged and the neutral polymer, respectively. These values are slightly larger than those previously reported for other polythiophenes with bulky polar side groups. The polymer presents a good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature above 215 °C and an electrical conductivity of 10 − 5 S/cm, which is characteristic of semiconductor materials. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs showed that, after doping, the surface of this material displays regular distribution pores with irregular sizes. This surface suggests that poly(2 -thiophen- 3 -yl-malonic acid) is a candidate for potential applications such as selective membranes for <b>electrodialysis,</b> wastewater <b>treatment,</b> or ion-selective membranes for biomedical uses.

40|$|We {{provide a}} thermoeconomic {{assessment}} of electrodialysis {{indicating that the}} technology is most productive and efficient for the partial desalination of feed streams at the higher end of the brackish range of salinities. After optimising the current density to minimise the sum of energy and equipment costs, we demonstrate that at low feed salinities the productivity, and hence equipment costs, of electrodialysis are hampered by the limiting current density. By contrast, at higher feed salinities both productivity and efficiency are hampered by the reduced chemical potential difference of salt in the diluate (low salinity) and concentrate (high salinity) streams. This analysis indicates the promise of further developing <b>electrodialysis</b> for the <b>treatment</b> of waters from oil, gas and coal-bed methane as well as flue-gas de-sulphurisation, where the partial desalination of streams at the high-end of the brackish range can be beneficial.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for clean industrial processes has intensified {{the use of}} <b>electrodialysis</b> in the <b>treatment</b> of metal containing effluents and encourages {{the investigation of the}} different phenomena involved in the transport of metal ions through cation-exchange membranes. Ion sorption, chronopotentiometric and current–voltage characteristics have been obtained to characterize the transport of sodium and iron through homogeneous and heterogeneous cation-exchange membranes. The heterogeneous membranes having a broader pore size distribution showed increased electrical resistances with solutions of trivalent iron, which may be caused by the blockage of the smallest pores by multivalent ions. However, for both types of membranes an unexpected decrease of the electrical resistance with increasing current densities was verified with concentrated solutions of Fe 2 (SO 4) 3. This behavior was explained to be a consequence of the dissociation of FeSO 4 +FeSO 4 + ions into more conductive Fe 3 + and SO 42 −SO 42 − ions as the depleting solution layer becomes diluted. When tested with multicomponent mixtures, the homogeneous perfluorosulfonic membranes show an increased preference for Na+ ions at low current densities and, once Na+ ions are depleted from the membrane surface Fe 3 + ions are transported preferentially at higher current densities. On the contrary, both Na+ ions and Fe(III) species are responsible for the ion transport through the heterogeneous membranes within the ohmic regime of currents. CAPE...|$|R
