5000|$|Emerson’s first Section {{commissioned}} mural, entitled The Fertile Land Remembers, (10’ x 5’ oil on canvas) {{was for the}} Worland, Wyoming {{post office}} in 1938. There was some controversy over a Colorado artist being chosen to execute a Wyoming mural, but Edward Rowan, the Superintendent of the Section of Painting & Sculpture said in a memo to the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procurement,</b> “The artists of Wyoming had an equal chance with those in Colorado {{to compete in the}} regional competition. The artists of Wyoming according to all records are very poor”. [...] In preparation for the project, she researched Wyoming history and consulted with the Worland postmaster. The approved design depicted a determined looking pioneer farming family in a Conestoga wagon pulled by oxen heading directly toward the viewer. In the background/sky are Indians riding horses chasing buffalo, executed in a translucent cloud-like manner. The Indians and the pioneer farming family were both historically dependent on the land and they are shown being displaced by the new, thriving and growing oil industry. The mural has since been moved and installed in the downtown Casper, Wyoming Post Office in the Dick Cheney Federal Building.|$|E
