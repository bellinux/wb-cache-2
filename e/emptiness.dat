5|$|Taoism on {{the other}} hand also {{incorporated}} Buddhist elements during the Tang period, such as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of <b>emptiness,</b> and collecting scripture in tripartite organisation.|$|E
5|$|The comedian Alvy Singer {{is trying}} to {{understand}} why his relationship with Annie Hall ended a year ago. Growing up in New York, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the <b>emptiness</b> of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{portrait}} Paul had convinced Alessandro to retain the post, hinting that he would later succeed him as pope– an aspiration that was ultimately frustrated. As Alessandro realised the <b>emptiness</b> of the promise he lost confidence in both his grandfather's word and political credibility.|$|E
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the <b>emptiness</b> outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is {{described}} in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
5|$|Project 86 is an American {{rock band}} from Orange County, California, formed in 1996. The band has {{released}} eight albums, which have collectively sold nearly 500,000 units worldwide, two EPs, two DVDs, and one live album. Their music {{is considered by}} most to be a rock/post-hardcore/alternative style. Frontman Andrew Schwab's poetic and introspective lyrics have addressed {{a wide variety of}} topics such as conformity and <b>emptiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} <b>emptiness</b> when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to the human species.|$|E
5|$|Vocalist Andrew Schwab has {{remained}} the band's lead lyricist. Schwab has said most lyrics are based on his emotions. He also tries to incorporate social commentary from literature. Prominent influences include comic book artist Chris Ware and writers Chris Bachelder, Don DeLillo, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and T. S. Eliot. He has written lyrics around {{a variety of topics}} that include alcohol abuse ("One-Armed Man"), conformity ("S.M.C."), <b>emptiness</b> ("Evil (A Chorus of Resistance)"), greed ("Cold and Calculated"), nightlife ("Molotov"),, spirituality ("Chapter 2"), pornography ("P.S."), and child molestation ("Sioux Lane Spirits").|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late for the train he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of <b>emptiness</b> stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|The Triple Gate (Tam Quan) is {{accessible}} by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use {{the left and}} right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent <b>emptiness,</b> impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism. On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located in a concrete lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths.|$|E
5|$|Book One, Awake to <b>Emptiness,</b> {{begins with}} Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, {{discovering}} a Magyar village {{where all the}} inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe (encountering only one lone native). Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for {{what they have done}} to him and he incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, they realized that the <b>emptiness</b> of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E
25|$|The idea of <b>emptiness</b> {{as lack of}} {{inherent}} existence {{has very}} little to do with what the Buddha himself said about <b>emptiness.</b> His teachings on <b>emptiness</b> — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience <b>emptiness</b> in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E
25|$|In Dzogchen, <b>emptiness</b> {{does not}} refer to the mere {{negation}} of inherent existence, but to profound <b>emptiness,</b> the Ground and nature of mind which is free from temporary characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Experiential <b>emptiness,</b> {{which is}} {{realized}} when {{the understanding of}} intellectual <b>emptiness</b> {{gives way to the}} recognition of the true nature of mind, c.q. rigpa. This is the view of Nyingma (Dzogchen) and Sakya.|$|E
25|$|The Sakya school {{originated}} in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century. Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, established an understandings of Prasangika which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, <b>emptiness</b> is not just mere <b>emptiness,</b> the absence of inherent existence, but profound <b>emptiness,</b> {{the absence of the}} four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free from even grasping the mind.|$|E

25|$|Mun-Keat Choong and Yin Shun {{have both}} {{published}} {{studies on the}} various uses of <b>emptiness</b> in the Early Buddhist Texts (Pali Canon and Chinese Agamas). Choong has also published a collection of translations of Agama sutras from the Chinese {{on the topic of}} <b>emptiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings {{contain a}} Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or {{essential}} inner nature'. The Tathāgatagarbha sutras presents a further developed understanding of <b>emptiness,</b> wherein the Buddha Nature, the Buddha and Liberation {{are seen as}} transcending the realm of <b>emptiness,</b> i.e. of the conditioned and dependently originated phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Madhyamaka is the {{dominant}} Buddhist philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism, but is interpreted in various ways. Sunyata, {{the true nature of}} reality, or the <b>emptiness</b> of inherent existence of all things, is propounded according to a typical Tibetan classification of four classical Indian schools of philosophical tenets. While the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelugpa, is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the shentong-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical <b>emptiness</b> of the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential <b>emptiness</b> of the Nyingma and the Shakya.|$|E
25|$|For they worship vanity and <b>emptiness,</b> {{and pray}} to a god who cannot save.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} themes of Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra (3rd-4th century) is dharma-śūnyatā, the <b>emptiness</b> of phenomena.|$|E
25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by other writers, who state that Madhyamaka is not nihilistic {{but it is a}} middle way between nihilism and eternalism. Some scholars interpret <b>emptiness</b> as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, while other scholars consider it a mistake. The consensus is that Nāgārjuna defended the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as <b>emptiness</b> is the soteriological middle way.|$|E
25|$|Yogācāra, {{the other}} {{prominent}} Mahāyāna school in dialectic with the Mādhyamaka school, gave a special {{significance to the}} canon's Lesser Discourse on <b>Emptiness</b> (MA 190). A passage there (which the discourse itself emphasizes) is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of <b>emptiness.</b> According to Walpola Rahula, the thought presented in the Yogācāra school's Abhidharma-samuccaya is undeniably closer {{to that of the}} Pali Nikayas than is that of the Theravadin Abhidhamma.|$|E
25|$|Over time, many {{different}} philosophical schools or tenet-systems (Sanskrit: siddhānta) have developed within Buddhism {{in an effort}} to explain the exact philosophical meaning of <b>emptiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tsongkhapa, and the {{subsequent}} Gelugpa tradition, lay emphasis on a strict Prasangika interpretation of <b>emptiness.</b> It sees its own interpretation as the final truth on sunyata.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} no {{doctrine}} and spiritual community, How can there be a Buddha? If <b>emptiness</b> is conceived {{in this way the}} three jewels are contradicted.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have coined the term, Sunday neurosis. The term refers to a form of anxiety {{resulting}} from an awareness in some people of the <b>emptiness</b> of their lives once the working week is over. Some complain of a void and a vague discontent. This arises from an existential vacuum, or feeling of meaninglessness, which is a common phenomenon and is characterised by the subjective state of boredom, apathy, and <b>emptiness.</b> One feels cynical, lacks direction, and questions the point of most of life's activities. (see noogenic neurosis).|$|E
25|$|The Sarvastivadin school's Abhidharma texts {{like the}} Dharmaskandhapāda Śāstra, and the later Mahāvibhāṣa also {{take up the}} theme of <b>emptiness</b> vis a vis {{dependent}} origination as found in the Agamas.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the complementation it is decidable whether a deterministic PDA accepts all words over its input alphabet, by testing its complement for <b>emptiness.</b> This is not possible for context-free grammars (hence not for general PDA).|$|E
25|$|Some {{questions}} that are undecidable for wider classes of grammars become decidable for context-free grammars; e.g. the <b>emptiness</b> problem (whether the grammar generates any terminal strings at all), is undecidable for context-sensitive grammars, but decidable for context-free grammars.|$|E
25|$|Śūnyatā (Sanskrit; Pali: suññatā), {{translated}} into English as <b>emptiness</b> and voidness, is a Buddhist concept which has multiple meanings depending on its doctrinal context. It is either an ontological feature of reality, a meditation state, or a phenomenological analysis of experience.|$|E
25|$|When Buddhism was {{introduced}} to China, in the 1st century CE, Buddhism was understood through comparisons of its teachings to Chinese terms and ways of thinking. Immortality and <b>emptiness,</b> central notions in Taoism, gave a frame of reference for the understanding of reincarnation and sunyata.|$|E
25|$|Zen is the Japanese {{variant of}} Chan Buddhism, a Mahayana school that {{strongly}} emphasizes dhyana concentration-meditation. This practice, according to Zen proponents, gives insight into one's true nature, or the <b>emptiness</b> of inherent existence, which opens {{the way to}} a liberated way of living.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist {{understanding}} of nirvana are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, <b>emptiness,</b> but the nirvana of the Gita means peace {{and that is}} why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).|$|E
25|$|According to Heng-Ching Shih, the tathāgatagarbha/Buddha-nature {{does not}} {{represent}} a substantial self (ātman). Rather, it is a positive language expression of <b>emptiness</b> (śūnyatā), which emphasizes the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. The intention of the teaching of tathāgatagarbha/Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical.|$|E
25|$|According to the Nyingma and Sakya schools, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of {{the clarity}} and <b>emptiness</b> of one's mind. According to the Jonang school, {{it refers to}} the innate qualities of the mind which expresses itself in terms of omniscience etc. when {{adventitious}} obscurations are removed.|$|E
