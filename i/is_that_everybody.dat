500|$|Remembered {{well for}} his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, [...] "If you {{happened}} to drive from Mobile to Dowell [...] with a carload of pool hustlers, {{you would get}} bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well", a reference {{not only to the}} area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E

2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
60|$|Not {{the least}} curious feature in this {{assemblage}} <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> present <b>was</b> so much surprised and {{embarrassed by the}} sight of <b>everybody</b> else, <b>that</b> nobody ventured to speak. Mr Chuzzlewit alone broke silence.|$|R

6000|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> {{delights in}} bits, in parts, {{that the public}} insists on noses, gaiters, white rabbits, bits of fluff, automata and gewgaws. If they do, then let 'em. Chu Chin Chow for ever! ...|$|R

[...] Lord Llwddythlw had also heard the story of what the Prince had said that he expected, and he {{scratched}} his head again with vexation. It had been reported that the Prince had declared that he had hoped to be asked to be godfather long ago. Lady Amaldina had probably heard some other version of the story. [...] "What I mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> was surprised that it should be so long postponed, but that they now begin to think it is abandoned altogether." ...|$|E

Therefore, I say, let's try to get it done. And {{everybody}} says, difficult, difficult, and nobody lifts a finger to try. And the only real difficulty <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> for one reason or another says that it's difficult. It's against human nature. Granted! Every decent thing is. It's socialism. Who cares? Along this line of comprehensive scientific control the world has to go or it will retrogress, it will muddle and rot...." ...|$|E
60|$|Right away {{everybody}} {{began to}} talk at the same time. It was such a simple plan <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> agreed to it.

Some people never do any work at all, all their lives long--yet they live better than the toilers. Why is that? And what justification have I? And how will {{all the people who}} give their orders justify themselves? What have they lived for? But my idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> ought, without fail, to know solidly what he is living for. Is it possible that a man is born to toil, accumulate money, build a house, beget children, and--die? No; life means something in itself. [...] . A man has been born, has lived, has died--why? All of us must consider why we are living, by God, we must! There is no sense in our life--there is no sense at all. Some are rich--they have money enough for a thousand men all to themselves--and they live without occupation; others bow their backs in toil all their life, and they haven't a penny." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was very}} little in the {{examination}} of Sir Thomas Underwood to interest any one. No one really suspected him of corrupt practices. In all such cases the singular part of the matter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody,</b> those who are concerned and those who are not concerned, really know the whole truth which is to be investigated; and yet, that which everybody knows cannot be substantiated. There were not five men in court who were not certain that Griffenbottom was corrupt, and that Sir Thomas was not; that the borough was rotten as a six-months-old egg; that Glump had acted under one of Trigger's aides-de-camp; that intimidation was the law of the borough; and that beer was used so that men drunk might not fear that which sober they had not the courage to encounter. All this was known to everybody; and yet, up to the last, it was thought by many in Percycross that corruption, acknowledged, transparent, egregious corruption, would prevail even {{in the presence of a}} judge. Mr. Trigger believed it to the last.|$|E
6000|$|In my Washington doubts I {{recalled}} Dolby for conference, and {{he joined}} me yesterday afternoon, {{and we have been}} in great discussion ever since on the possibility of giving up the Far West, and avoiding such immense distances and fatigues as would be involved in travelling to Chicago and Cincinnati. We have sketched another tour for the last half of March, which would be infinitely easier for me, though on the other hand less profitable, the places and the halls being smaller. The worst of it <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> one advises with has a monomania respecting Chicago. [...] "Good heaven, sir," [...] the great Philadelphian authority said to me this morning, [...] "if you don't read in Chicago, the people will go into fits." [...] In reference to fatigue, I answered: [...] "Well, I would rather they went into fits than I did." [...] But he didn't seem to see it at all. ---- alone constantly writes me: [...] "Don't go to the West; you can get what you want so much more easily." [...] How we shall finally decide, I don't yet know. My Brooklyn church has been an immense success, and I found its minister was a bachelor, a clever, unparsonic, and straightforward man, and a man with a good knowledge of art into the bargain.|$|E
5000|$|Web is an {{information}} space through which people can communicate, but communicate {{in a special}} way: communicate by sharing their knowledge in a pool.

They should have called me in sooner. That was the mistake. If they had sent for me at once and had put my picture in the papers both in England and Germany, with the inscription 'The True Woman of To-day,' I doubt if any of the men who looked at it would have felt that it was worth while to fight. But, as things are, the only advice I can give is this. Everybody is wrong (except me). The Germans are a very naughty people. But the Belgians are worse. It was very, very wicked of the Germans to bombard the houses of the Belgians. But how naughty of the Belgians to go and sit in their houses while they were bombarded. It is to that that I attribute--with my infallible sense of justice--the dreadful loss of life. So you see the only conclusion that I can reach <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> is very naughty and that the only remedy would be to appoint me a committee--me and a few others, though the others don't really matter--to make a proper settlement. I hope I make myself clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{has seemed}} to me that there are not so many hotels garnis in Rome as there used to be in Italian cities, but they, too, abound in {{pleasant}} streets, and the stranger who has a fancy for lodgings with breakfast in his rooms, and likes to browse about for his luncheon and dinner, will easily suit himself. If it comes to taking a furnished apartment for the season, there is much range in price and much choice in place. The agents who have them to let will begin, rather dismayingly, [...] "Oh, apartments in Rome are very dear." [...] But you learn on inquiry that a furnished flat in the Ludovisi region, in a house with a lift and full sun, may be had for two hundred dollars a month. From this height the rents of palatial apartments soar to such lonely peaks as eight hundred and sink to such levels as a hundred and twenty or a hundred; and for this you have linen and silver and all the movables and utensils you want, as well as several vast rooms opening wastefully from one to another till you reach the salon. The rents of the like flats, if vacant, would be a quarter or a third less, though again the agents begin by telling you that there is very little difference between the rents of furnished and unfurnished flats. The flats are in every part of the old town and the new; and some are in noble sixteenth and seventeenth century palaces, such as we are accustomed to at home only in the theatre. My own experience <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody,</b> especially in houses where there are no lifts, lives on the top floor. You pass many other floors in going up, but you are left to believe that nobody lives on them. When you reach the inhabited levels, you find them charming inside for their state and beauty, and outside for their magnificent view, which may be pretty confidently relied upon to command the dome of St. Peter's. That magnificent stone bubble seems to blow all round the horizon.|$|E

5000|$|Arguably, {{a modern}} {{differentiated}} society contains as many generalized others {{as there are}} social groupings: as Mead put it, [...] "every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to {{a large number of}} such different functional groups".

5000|$|Heinlein Society {{member and}} {{researcher}} Robert James {{has noted that}} Heinlein wrote a letter in which he [...] "firmly states" [...] that Rod Walker is black.

50|$|A second key {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everybody</b> {{benefits from}} inclusion.

60|$|Mrs. Reginald Clapper, as I was {{relieved}} to know she now was, received my salute to a subdued murmur of applause. She looked to my eyes handsomer than when I had last seen her, or maybe my taste was growing less exacting. She also trusted she might always regard me as a friend.
