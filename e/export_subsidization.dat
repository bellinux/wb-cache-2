40|$|This paper {{shows that}} in a duopoly model of {{international}} market competition, threatened imposition of countervailing duties by a domestic country generally deters a foreign country from subsidizing its exports to the former. To explain the coexistence of <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> and the GATT-conform countervailing duty measures, factors such as delay in retaliation, the GATT constraint {{on the amount of}} countervailing duties, and voluntary export restraints must be considered. We find that these factors lessen the efficacy of countervailing duty retaliation and therefore fail to deter <b>export</b> <b>subsidization.</b> Â© 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the occurrence of}} export subsidy competition {{and a series of}} accusations by the exporters that follows it, and also examines the welfare implications of the WTO agreement that prohibits export subsidies for the countries concerned and {{the world as a whole}}. It is shown that the welfare of the exporter with low costs of production is higher when <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> is permitted than when it is prohibited. Furthermore, the world as a whole is better off when exporting countries subsidize their exports. Export Subsidy Competition, WTO...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reports that}} an export subsidy is optimal for a unionized Bertrand duopoly. Following results {{published}} by Brander and Spencer (1988), this establishes the robustness of <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> to {{the mode of}} competition (Cournot or Bertrand), and contrasts with nonunion results in the literature. If both firms are unionized and both governments pursue active trade policies, a subsidy remains optimal except for a narrow range of extreme substitutability between products. Nations with a lower opportunity cost of labor employ more aggressive policies in equilibrium. Copyright 2000 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|E
40|$|A new welfare-enhancing role is {{identified}} for {{a policy of}} <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> in a new-product industry. An export subsidy policy promotes the (rational) perception that a high-quality export can be provided at a relatively low price. Thus, an export subsidy generates a first order benefit to welfare by enabling a high-quality export to be sold at a less-distorted, high price. The subsidy will also introduce distortions into {{the price of a}} low-quality export and, when product quality is policy-sensitive, the quality selection process. Since these choices are initially undistorted, however, the export-country welfare loss arising from new distortions is of second order importance. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changing nature}} of EU and US trade policy toward developing countries. While previous GATT and WTO rounds of trade negotiations had been largely dominated by EU-US bilateral bargaining in a multilateral context, much of the Doha Round agenda has seen the EU and US face the need to respond to developing country calls for reductions in EU and US trade protection and <b>export</b> <b>subsidization.</b> This paper 1) outlines asymmetries in {{the changing nature of}} EU and US trade protection against developing country imports; 2) examines commonalities in EU and US Doha Round negotiating positions towards developing countries and 3) discusses EU and US responses to recent WTO decisions in cases brought by developing countries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that vertically aligned private or public organizations {{are capable of}} generating strategic trade advantage similar to that acquired through direct government <b>export</b> <b>subsidization.</b> The model considers two forms of vertical coordination that lead to advantageous trade positions in international markets: upstream vertical restraint and downstream equity sharing. Such practices are commonly employed both by state trading agencies and by private firms in nations with lenient antitrust laws. The finding has important implications under new World Trade Organization (WTO) rules intended to reduce government intervention in international transactions. Recent reforms in the WTO favor nations that sanction highly refined vertical linkages between firms, while nations with stringent antitrust legislation {{have an incentive to}} negotiate for greater harmonization of international laws...|$|E
40|$|While neomercantilist policy measures, in {{the form}} of both import {{protection}} and <b>export</b> <b>subsidization,</b> are still gathering momentum and are just entering their second decade with evidently high growth rates, the dynamic post-war growth of world trade itself has at least temporarily come to a halt: trade fell in volume in 1981 by just under 1 % and, in 1982, by about 2 %. A new round of multilateral trade negotiations is in prospect for 1985, during which further tariff reductions will be on the agenda, but the main item for discussion will be questions surrounding a reform of GATT which emerged from the Tokyo Round. The following article seeks to establish the true significance of the GATT principles today, investigates the causes of the erosion of discipline within GATT, and deals with important aspects of present efforts to introduce reforms...|$|E
40|$|In {{thinking}} about policy, academic economists alternate between theoretical models in which governments can design finely-tuned optimal interventions and practical considerations which usually assume {{the government to}} be incompetent and hostage to special interests. I argue in this paper that neither of these caricatures is accurate, {{and that there is}} much to be learned by undertaking systematic, analytical studies of state capabilities [...] how they are generated and why they differ across countries and issue areas. Case studies of <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> in Korea, Brazil, Turkey, India, Kenya, and Bolivia are presented to confront usual presumptions against actual experience. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the successful cases (Korea and Brazil) turn out to be ones in which the government exercised discretion and selectivity, while the most uniform and non-discretionary cases (Kenya and Bolivia) were clear failures. The paradox is explained in terms of state autonomy and policy coherence. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade or so, the role of export {{subsidies}} has attracted renewed interest in the current policy debate and in the literature on strategic trade policy. While the theoretical literature is very stimulating, little is known about and scarce attention is paid to the facts about <b>export</b> <b>subsidization.</b> Simplifying, in most theoretical models governments grant production subsidies to domestic firms of an industry exporting to one specific market. In practice, several official agencies rn?y he invnlved in providing export credits and export insurance subsidies to many domestic sectors exporting {{to a wide range of}} export destinations. In spite of the work by Abraham (1990), Abraham et al. (1992), Ford and Suyker (1990), Jepma (1991), and the EC (1990), there is only partial information about the size of the subsidies involved and their sectoral and regional break-up. As a consequence, the subsidy structure resulting from a policy of export promotion remains unclear...|$|E
40|$|Trade {{has played}} a major role in U. S. {{agriculture}} throughout the twentieth cen-tury. The share of annual U. S. wheat production that was exported rose from approximately 25 percent at the beginning of the century to 60 percent by the beginning of the 1980 s. The federal government has supported agricultural production in general, and exports in particular, with several programs. The export programs aim to achieve three basic goals: maintain appropriate surplus levels of agricultural commodities, increase foreign demand for U. S. products, and support humanitarian causes. Export programs have taken four basic forms: export subsidies (in kind or in cash) that have allowed domestic prices to exceed world prices and countered subsidization by U S. competitors; export credit and credit guarantee programs that have assisted countries with foreign exchange difficulties; food aid programs, directed toward countries suffering from hunger; and nonprice promotion programs that have attempted to increase foreign demand for U. S. products. The focus of this paper is on the effects of the most recent <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> program, known as the Export Enhance...|$|E

Among the many new {{achievements}} {{made in the}} Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, the ambitious and wide-ranging Agreement on Agriculture (The Agreement) was {{a significant departure from}} the way agriculture had traditionally been treated in the international trading order. Completely new rules and commitments were established in the areas of market access, export competition and domestic support. While it was generally agreed that the nature of these new WTO provisions for agriculture pointed in an appropriate direction and held promise for the longer run process of reforming the multilateral trading regime for agriculture, it was also clear that the quantitative parameters agreed for the current implementation period of the Agreement were not yet very demanding in most cases. Moreover, right from the start observers and analysts agreed that the actual impact of the new disciplines for agricultural policies and trade agreed at Marrakesh in 1994 would very much depend on {{the way in which they}} were going to be implemented in practice. Would the new commitments countries had accepted require or induce changes in their policies? Was access to markets really going to be improved? Were the new elements of managed trade, resulting from the host of new tariff rate quotas, going to have negative impacts on trading relations? Would the new constraints on <b>export</b> <b>subsidization</b> turn out to be binding? Could the new provisions on domestic support, and in particular existence of the "green box" be expected to influence national decision making on the instrumentation of agricultural policies? Would countries try to find loopholes in the Agreement which might allow them to escape the constraining effects of some of the new disciplines? Did one have to expect that the frequency of trade disputes in agriculture might further increase? And would the new WTO rules for dispute settlement be able to deal with such trade frictions more successfully? Was the newly established WTO Committee on Agriculture going to be a useful forum for settling any disagreements at an early stage, and for making sure that the reform process in agriculture was kept on track? The current six-year implementation period under the Agreement (lasting until the year 2000, with four more years for developing countries to implement their reduction commitments) is now approaching its mid-term. It is still too early for a final assessment of how effective the Agreement has been. However, interesting and important insights can already been gained from the way governments have so far implemented the new rules and commitments. An assessment of the experience made in the first half of the implementation period should be useful for the remainder of the implementation process. Moreover, the time is ripe for a stock-taking as governments begin to prepare for the next round of agricultural negotiations, on the "continuation of the reform process", scheduled under the Agreement to be initiated in 1999. Such a mid-term assessment of how the Agreement is being implemented, and of the resulting issues for the next round of negotiations, is exactly what the present paper tries to achieve. The main part of the paper consists of chapters 2 to 9, looking into the way the Agreement is being implemented by major countries and country groups (USA, European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Japan, Korea, South Asia, Latin America). Chapter 10 provides a brief overview of that country experience and reviews developments in Geneva, in the Committee on Agriculture and in the settlement of agricultural disputes. On the basis of all that analysis, chapter 11 then discusses issues for the next round of agricultural negotiations. Chapter 12, finally, draws conclusions regarding the future of agricultural trade liberalization. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
