25|$|In Germany, the {{government}} tried to reshape private household consumption under the <b>Four-Year</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives.|$|E

50|$|The {{growing number}} of Virginia's senior {{citizens}} and their rapidly increasing need for services prompted Alexander to author legislation in 2008 that required the Department of Aging to develop and submit <b>four-year</b> <b>plans.</b> In 2009, he ushered a proposed constitutional amendment to automatically restore voting rights to former non-violent felons who have served their sentences, through the full House Committee on Privileges and Elections. That same year, he also gained relief for Arthur Lee Whitfield, a Norfolk resident who was wrongly convicted of a violent crime. Alexander followed his successes in restorative justice by serving as patron for legislation that required the automatic issue of a writ of innocence in 2010 for individuals found to have been wrongly convicted.|$|R
25|$|On 24 November 2010 Cowen {{unveiled}} a <b>four-year</b> <b>plan</b> to stabilise {{the economy by}} 2014.

In recognition of the political disaster this would inflict on his government, Cowen indicated that the election would take place in early 2011 after the 2011 budgetary process has been completed, though at the time he would not set a specific date.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{new owner}} High Rock Development - who {{purchased}} {{the building in}} 2008 for $33 Million USD - proposed a plan to convert the building into mostly luxury apartments, involving $80 million in tax credits from the State.

High Rock Development has since offered a <b>four-year</b> <b>plan</b> that would require $40 million in new funding for the rehabilitation of the tower into a mix of uses that include retail, business and 285 residential units. The former and new financing proposals were met with mixed reaction with several individuals noting High Rock Development has $200 million available to put towards the rehab effort but have declined to do so.|$|E

25|$|During Maga's term of office, Dahomey's economy collapsed; {{there was}} little foreign {{investment}} and unemployment rose. In response, he launched a <b>four-year</b> <b>plan</b> in January 1962, the basis of which was to increase agricultural production by forcing the nation's youths {{to work on the}} land. Maga also faced a national crisis of unity, culminating in a failed assassination plot against him in May 1961 led by the main opposition leader, Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin was jailed, and by the time of his release in November 1962, a one-party state had been established and the opposition press had been restricted. In 1963, convicted murderer Christophe Bokhiri was released from prison, prompting riots around the country, but the focus of the rioting soon shifted toward Maga's problems as president. The riots became so serious that the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army, Christophe Soglo, took control of the country in October to prevent a civil war. After forcing Maga to resign, Soglo gave him, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and vice president Sourou Migan Apithy, the titles of Minister of State.|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, Graham {{joined his}} finance {{minister}} Victor Boudreau {{to introduce the}} budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year. [...] The budget included $144 million in personal and corporate tax reductions and a pledge to lower taxes {{by a total of}} over $380 million over four years, and budget deficit of $741 million. [...] It centred around the so-called Plan for a Stronger Economy which included the tax cuts, a <b>four-year</b> <b>plan</b> to return the province to balanced budgets, the $1.2 billion in infrastructure spending previously announced in December, investments in priority areas with cuts in other areas to ensure [...] "responsible management" [...] of government expenditure. [...] Savings were released by instituting a two-year wage freeze for all government employees, the elimination of 700 civil service positions and the elimination of some services, most controversially the elimination of three ferries in the lower Saint John River Valley. Later there was also controversy surrounding some cuts to education services—despite an increase of funding to the education department, and a dispute with the province's physicians over their payment. The province's tax reforms attracted positive national attention, however, with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the National Post newspaper, and the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies all spoke on it favourably.|$|E

2500|$|The Southern Christian Leadership Conference {{suspended}} King {{from the}} presidency in June 2001, concerned that he was letting the organization drift into inaction. The group's national chairman at the time, Claud Young, sent a June 25 letter to King that read, [...] "You have consistently been insubordinate and displayed inappropriate, obstinate behavior in the (negligent) carrying out of your duties as president of SCLC." [...] King was reinstated only one week later after promising {{to take a more}} active role. Young said of the suspension, [...] "I felt we had to use a two-by-four to get his attention. Well, it got his attention all right." [...] After he was reinstated, King prepared a <b>four-year</b> <b>plan</b> outlining a stronger direction for the organization, agreeing to dismiss McMorris and announcing plans to present a strong challenge to the Bush administration in an August convention in Montgomery, Alabama. In a rally on August 5, 2001, in Montgomery, SCLC leaders, including Rev. Joseph Lowery, former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and Rev. Jesse Jackson all pledged their support for King. [...] "I sit beside my successor, to assure him of my love and support," [...] said Rev. Lowery. King said he also planned to concentrate on racial profiling, prisoners' rights and closing the digital divide between whites and blacks.

2500|$|The {{need for}} money {{by the party}} {{organization}} stemmed {{from the fact that}} Franz Xaver Schwarz, the party treasurer, kept the local and regional organizations of the party short of money. In the fall of 1938, the increased pressure on Jewish property nourished the party's ambition, especially since Hjalmar Schacht had been ousted as Reich minister for economics. This, however, was only one aspect of the origin of the November 1938 pogrom. The Polish government threatened to extradite all Jews who were Polish citizens, but would stay in Germany, thus creating a burden of responsibility on the German side. The immediate reaction by the Gestapo was to push the Polish Jews—16,000 persons—over the borderline, but this measure failed due to the stubbornness of the Polish customs officers. The loss of prestige {{as a result of this}} abortive operation called for some sort of compensation. Thus, the overreaction to Herschel Grynszpan's attempt against the diplomat Ernst vom Rath came into being and led to the November pogrom. The background of the pogrom was signified by a sharp cleavage of interests between the different agencies of party and state. While the Nazi party was interested in improving its financial strength on the regional and local level by taking over Jewish property, Hermann Göring, in charge of the <b>Four-Year</b> <b>Plan,</b> hoped to acquire access to foreign currency in order to pay for the import of needed raw material. Heydrich and Himmler were interested in fostering Jewish emigration".|$|E

2500|$|It also, {{with the}} help of USAID, created a massive {{industrial}} infrastructure, communications, and developed the educational system. Several government bodies were created and <b>four-year</b> <b>plans</b> were also enacted. Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The gross national product grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, (like South Korea), and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986. The social gap between {{the rich and the poor}} fell (Gini: 0.558 in 1953, 0.303 in 1980), even lower than some Western European countries, but it grew a little in the 80's.
