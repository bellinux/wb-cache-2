5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek's name is unknown. In the 1700s, {{it was one}} {{of eight}} streams named Buffalo Creek in Pennsylvania, despite the almost total absence of buffalo in the state in that century. Except for legends, there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> evidence that any buffalo ever lived in the Buffalo Creek area. However, some residents of the nearby village of Cowan claim that depressions on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek are buffalo wallows.|$|E
5|$|Tangascootack Creek is {{considered}} to be a cold water fishery. The tributary North Fork Tangascootack Creek has significant trout and macroinvertebrate populations. On the main stem of the creek, there are limited numbers of fish and some aquatic ecosystems, though in the middle and upper parts of the creek, there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> life in the water. Near the headwaters and Bear Swamp, there is some aquatic life, as these locations are upstream of the strip mines and acid mine drainage. The main species of fish in the creek are brook trout, Semotilus atromaculatus, Catostomus commersoni, and Rhinichthys atratulus. Young-of-the-Year trout also live in the creek.|$|E

5|$|Drawloom: The {{earliest}} confirmed drawloom fabrics {{come from}} the State of Chu and date c. 400 BC. Most scholars attribute {{the invention of the}} drawloom to the ancient Chinese, although some speculate an independent invention from ancient Syria since drawloom fabrics found in Dura-Europas are thought to date before 256 AD. Dieter Kuhn states that an analysis of texts and textiles from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) proves that the figured fabrics of that era were also crafted {{with the use of a}} drawloom. The drawloom was certainly known in Persia by the 6th century AD. Eric Broudy asserts there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> evidence of its use in Europe until the 17th century, while the button drawloom was allegedly invented by Jean le Calabrais in the 15th century. Mary Carolyn Beaudry disagrees, stating that it was used in the medieval Italian silk industry.|$|E

25|$|Pictish is the extinct language, or dialect, {{spoken by}} the Picts, {{the people of}} eastern and {{northern}} Scotland from the late Iron Age to the Early Middle Ages. There <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> direct attestation of Pictish, short of {{a limited number of}} geographical and personal names found on monuments and the contemporary records in the area controlled by the Kingdom of the Picts. Such evidence, however, points to the language being closely related to the Brittonic language spoken prior to Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now southern Scotland, England and Wales. A minority view held by a few scholars claims that Pictish was at least partially non-Indo-European or that a non-Indo-European and Brittonic language coexisted.|$|E

25|$|Only some 3% of {{the land}} of Papua New Guinea is in private hands; it is privately held under 99-year state lease, or it is held by the State. There <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> {{freehold}} title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.|$|E
25|$|Sardinia {{has been}} in contact with extra-insular {{communities}} in Corsica, Tuscany, Liguria and Provence since the Stone Age. From the late third millennium BC on, comb-impressed Beaker ware, as well as other Beaker material in Monte Claro contexts, has been found (mostly in burials, suchs as Domus de Janas), demonstrating continuing relationships with the western Mediterranean. Elsewhere, Beaker material has been found stratigraphically above Monte Claro {{and at the end of}} the Chalcolithic period in association with the related Bronze Age Bonnanaro culture (1800–1600 BC), for which C-14 dates calibrate to c. 2250 BC. There <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> evidence in Sardinia of external contacts in the early second millennia, apart from late Beakers and close parallels between Bonnannaro pottery and that of the North Italian Polada culture.|$|E
25|$|Völkermarkt is sited on a cliff {{overlooking}} the river Drau. In 1090 Volko of Rheinfranken {{laid out a}} trading town for Ulrich II, Duke of Carinthia. Then in 1217 a bridge was built over the Drau. Today there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> evidence for the fortifications apart from fragments of wall and a tower on the SE edge of the cliff. However two Merian prints show that the town was fully walled with gate towers on the E and W. On the flatter land to the N the wall was angled {{and there was a}} prominent round tower. On the craggy promontory to the S there was another gate tower with a road leading to the Drau bridge. The town had a large rectangular market place that has been encroached upon by buildings.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of Roman {{religious}} beliefs in York {{have been found}} including altars to Mars, Hercules, Jupiter and Fortune, while phallic amulets are the most commonly found type of good luck charm. In terms of number of reference the most popular deities were the spiritual representation (genius) of York and the Mother Goddess; {{there is also evidence}} of local or regional deities. There was also a Christian community in York although it is not known when it was first formed and there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> archaeological record of it. The first evidence of this community is a document noting the attendance of Bishop Eborius of Eboracum at the Council of Arles in 314, and bishops also attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the Council of Sardica, and the Council of Ariminum.|$|E
25|$|While {{the economy}} is {{dominated}} by the federal government, and service industries that support government workers, Ottawa has had several other important industries. Before becoming the capital, Bytown was a centre of the logging industry. The lumber industry remained prominent in Ottawa until the early twentieth century. The lasting legacy in Ottawa are the mansions and buildings constructed by the lumber barons who made up much of the economic elite of early Ottawa. Most notable was John Rudolphus Booth, who commissioned several prominent structures from architect John W.H. Watts. While the lumber and pulp mills disappeared from Ottawa in the early twentieth century, Hull across the river remained an important industrial centre and its waterfront was largely industrialized. Most of those factories have now disappeared, but a few remain. Including the E. B. Eddy Company plant directly across from the Parliament Buildings. Ottawa itself does today have some industrial areas, mostly clustered around the rail lines in the Cyrville and Tanglewood areas south of the core. There <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> heavy industry, and most of the industrial buildings are warehouses serving as transshipment points for goods made elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|There {{continues}} to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases, including BSE and CJD. They have an incubation period of months to decades, during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> way to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining the brain [...] using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc [...] form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but there are still no fully accepted methods for use in materials such as blood.|$|E
500|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Madagascar, there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> zone of {{transition}} between the earthen houses of the Highlands and the dwellings made of plant materials common to the coastal regions. [...] In the vast and sparsely populated expanses between the Highlands and the western coastal areas, however, inhabitants utilize locally available materials to construct dwellings that bear features of both regions. [...] Most often houses are small – one room and only one story high – constructed of a skeleton of horizontally arranged sticks affixed to the wooden house frame as pictured in the preceding section on wooden construction. [...] But unlike coastal homes where this stick skeleton would serve as a base for affixing plant material to form walls, earthen cob may be packed into the framework instead. [...] The roof is thatched to complete the dwelling. [...] These intermediary houses are also often distinguished by the presence of shortened Highlands-style wooden columns on the western face to support the elongated eave of the peaked roof, much as they support the verandas of the larger homes of Imerina. [...] The floor is typically packed dirt and may be covered with woven mats of grasses or raffia.|$|E
