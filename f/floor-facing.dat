5000|$|Ports {{often are}} placed in the front baffle, and may thus {{transmit}} unwanted midrange frequencies reflected from within the box. If undersized, a port may also generate [...] "wind noise" [...] or [...] "chuffing", due to turbulence around the port openings at high air speeds. Enclosures with a rear-facing port mask these effects to some extent, but they cannot be placed directly against a wall without causing audible problems. They require some free space around the port so they can perform as intended. Some manufacturers incorporate a <b>floor-facing</b> port within the speaker stand or base, offering predictable and repeatable port performance within the design constraints.|$|E
