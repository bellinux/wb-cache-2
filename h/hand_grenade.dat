5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the shoupao, or hand bomb, which {{is analogous to the}} <b>hand</b> <b>grenade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{engaged the}} enemy {{immediately}} after landing with the assault waves. He exposed himself to enemy fire {{in an attempt}} to throw a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> into a pillbox whose fire was pinning down that sector of the beach. He was wounded by enemy gun fire and dropped the grenade. Unable to grasp the <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> firmly enough to hurl it, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than endanger the lives of his men. He cradled the grenade under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life. Obregon was killed in action while using his body to shield a wounded fellow Marine.|$|E

50|$|In the American Civil War, {{both sides}} used <b>hand</b> <b>grenades</b> {{equipped}} with a plunger that detonated the device on impact. The Union relied on experimental Ketchum Grenades, which had a tail {{to ensure that the}} nose would strike the target and start the fuse. The Confederacy used spherical <b>hand</b> <b>grenades</b> that weighed about six pounds, sometimes with a paper fuse. They also used 'Rains' and 'Adams' grenades, which were similar to the Ketchum in appearance and mechanism. Improvised <b>hand</b> <b>grenades</b> were also used to great effect by the Russian defenders of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War.|$|R
5|$|On April 13, 2011, a {{film version}} of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, {{director}} of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a <b>Hand</b> <b>Grenade),</b> Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>grenade,</b> {{explosive}}: Before explosive grenades, incendiary grenades {{were used}} by the Eastern Roman Empire, incorporating Greek fire. Early prototypes to the modern explosive grenade, according to British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham, appear in the military book, Wujing Zongyao ("Compilation of Military Classics"), by 1044. During the Song Dynasty, weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers and thrown at the enemy. Further descriptions and illustrations of early Chinese hand grenades are provided in the Huolongjing.|$|E
5|$|My Body, the <b>Hand</b> <b>Grenade</b> is {{the first}} and only {{compilation}} album to be released by Hole. The liner notes also explain that the compilation was put together to document Hole's progression from the punk-influenced Pretty on the Inside (released in 1991) to their more restrained, alternative rock-based Live Through This (released in 1994). The album was dedicated to former Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff and Kurt Cobain, both of whom died in 1994.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1971, Shakur {{was named}} by the New York City Police Department as one of four {{suspects}} in a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> attack that destroyed a police car and slightly injured two patrolmen in Maspeth, Queens; a 13-state alarm was issued {{three days after the}} attack when a witness identified Shakur and Andrew Jackson from Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) photographs. Law enforcement officials in Atlanta, Georgia said that Shakur and Jackson had lived together in Atlanta for several months in the summer of 1971.|$|E
5|$|Ross Andrew McGinnis (June 14, 1987December 4, 2006) was a United States Army {{soldier who}} was killed in the Iraq War and was posthumously awarded the United States' highest {{decoration}} for bravery, the Medal of Honor. While serving as the gunner in a HMMWV, his convoy was attacked and a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> was thrown into his vehicle. McGinnis was subsequently killed in action when he deliberately threw himself on the grenade, saving the lives of at least four other soldiers in the vehicle. He was the fourth soldier to receive the Medal of Honor during the Iraq War, which was presented to his family following his death.|$|E
5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed and locked on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen {{truck is}} intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing {{the man to}} drop a live <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E
5|$|For two days, the 34th Infantry {{fought the}} {{advancing}} North Koreans in bitter house-to-house fighting. North Korean soldiers continued to infiltrate the city, often disguised as farmers. The remaining {{elements of the}} 24th Infantry Division were pushed back block-by-block. Without radios, and unable {{to communicate with the}} remaining elements of the division, Dean joined the men on the front lines. At one point, he personally attacked a tank with a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade,</b> destroying it. Large columns of North Korean forces began marching on the city from the south roads, reinforcing those that had crossed the river. American forces pulled back after suffering heavy losses, allowing the North Korean 3rd and 4th divisions to move on the city freely from the north, south, and east roads. The 24th Infantry Division repeatedly attempted to establish its defensive lines, and was repeatedly pushed back by the numerically superior North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high above his head, clutching a <b>hand</b> <b>grenade.</b> The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E

5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three days the Ottomans {{continued}} to launch incessant and ultimately unsuccessful counterattacks in an effort to recapture the ground they had lost. In total three regiments were dispatched. The Australians also brought up reinforcements, moving up men from two battalions from the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Brigades—the 7th and 12th Battalions—to hold the 1st Brigade's gains. Throughout 7 August, the fighting devolved into a series of <b>hand</b> <b>grenade</b> duels. To keep up the supply, Australians put about 50 soldiers to work at Anzac Cove manufacturing makeshift grenades out of empty jam tins: over 1,000 were sent up to the 1st Infantry Brigade late on 7 August. The fighting continued throughout the night of 7/8 August as the 47th Regiment, launched a determined counterattack; suffering heavy casualties, including the regimental commander, Tewfik Bey, the attack was unsuccessful in retaking the main front-line trenches, but succeeded in regaining some of the ground in the north and also pushed the Australians back a little way from The Cup.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} the platoon as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated <b>hand</b> <b>grenade,</b> rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale model representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E
