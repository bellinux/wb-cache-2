40|$|The {{regulatory}} protein P(II) {{has been studied}} in great detail in enteric bacteria; however, its function in photosynthetic bacteria has not been clearly established. As {{a number of these}} bacteria have been shown to regulate nitrogenase activity by a metabolic control system, it is of special interest to establish the role of P(II) in these diazotrophs. In this study, we show that P(II) in Rhodospirillum rubrum is modified in response to the N status in the cell and that addition of ammonium or glutamine leads to <b>demodification.</b> We also provide evidence that P(II) is uridylylated. In addition, we show that not only these compounds but also NAD+ promotes <b>demodification</b> of P(II), which is of particular interest as this pyridine nucleotide has been shown to act as a switch-off effector of nitrogenase. <b>Demodification</b> of P(II) by ammonium or NAD+ did not occur in cultures treated with an inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (methionine sulfoximine), whereas treatment with the glutamate synthase inhibitor 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-norleucine led to total <b>demodification</b> of P(II) without any other addition. The results indicate that P(II) probably is not directly involved in darkness switch-off of nitrogenase but that a role in ammonium switch-off cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Formalin-fixed archival {{samples are}} known to be poor {{materials}} for molecular biological applications. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the alterations in RNA in fixed tissue. We found that formalin-fixed tissue was resistant to solubilization by chaotropic agents. However, proteinase K completely solubilized the fixed tissue and enabled the extraction of almost the same amount of RNA as from a fresh sample. The extracted RNA did not show apparent degradation. However, as reported, successful PCR amplification was limited to short targets. The nature of such 'fixed' RNA was analyzed using synthetic homo-oligo RNAs. The heterogeneous increase in molecular weight of the RNAs, measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, showed that all four bases showed addition of mono-methylol (-CH(2) OH) groups at various rates. The modification rate varied from 40 % for adenine to 4 % for uracil. In addition, some adenines underwent dimerization through methylene bridging. The majority of the methylol groups, however, could be removed from bases by simply elevating the temperature in formalin-free buffer. This <b>demodification</b> proved effective in restoring the template activity of RNA from fixed tissue. The improvement in PCR results suggested {{that more than half of}} the modification was removed by this <b>demodification...</b>|$|E
40|$|Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues {{generally}} provide low {{yields of}} extractable RNA that exhibit both covalent modification of nucleic acid bases and strand cleavage. This frustrates efforts to perform retrospective analyses of gene expression using archival tissue specimens. A variety of conditions {{have been reported}} to demodify formaldehyde-fixed RNA in different model systems. We studied the reversal of formaldehyde fixation of RNA using a 50 base RNA oligonucleotide and total cellular RNA. Formaldehyde-adducted, native, and hydrolyzed RNA species were identified by their bioanalyzer electrophoretic migration patterns and RT–quantitative PCR. <b>Demodification</b> conditions included temperature, time, buffer, and pH. The reversal of formaldehyde-fixed RNA to native species without apparent RNA hydrolysis was most successfully performed in dilute Tris, phosphate, or similar buffers (pH 8) at 70 °C for 30 minutes. Amines were not required for efficient formaldehyde <b>demodification.</b> Formaldehyde-fixed RNA was more labile than native RNA to treatment with heat and buffer, suggesting that antigen retrieval methods for proteins may impede RNA hybridization or RNA extraction. Taken together, the data indicate that reliable conditions may be used to remove formaldehyde adducts from RNA {{to improve the quality of}} RNA available for molecular studies...|$|E
40|$|SUMOs {{are small}} ubiquitin-related polypeptides that are {{reversibly}} conjugated to many nuclear proteins. Although {{the number of}} identified substrates has grown rapidly, relatively little is still understood about when, where, and why most proteins are modified by SUMO. Here, we demonstrate that enzymes involved in the SUMO modification and <b>demodification</b> of proteins are components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We show that SENP 2, a SUMO protease that is able to demodify both SUMO- 1 and SUMO- 2 or SUMO- 3 protein conjugates, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC. The unique amino-terminal domain of SENP 2 interacts with the FG repeat domain of Nup 153, indicating that SENP 2 associates with the nucleoplasmic basket of the NPC. We also investigated the localization of the SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc 9. Using immunogold labeling of isolated nuclear envelopes, we found that Ubc 9 localizes to both the cytoplasmic and the nucleoplasmic filaments of the NPC. In vitro binding studies revealed that Ubc 9 and SUMO- 1 -modified RanGAP 1 bind synergistically to form a trimeric complex with {{a component of the}} cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC, Nup 358. Our results indicate that both SUMO modification and <b>demodification</b> of proteins may occur at the NPC and suggest a connection between the SUMO modification pathway and nucleocytoplasmic transport...|$|E
40|$|Covalent {{modification}}/demodification cycles {{are common}} in metabolism. When the modification and <b>demodification</b> steps are carried out by two independent enzymes, the degree of modification can be ultrasensitive to the total concentration of either catalyst. We recently showed {{that the degree of}} modification of a target molecule cannot exhibit ultrasensitivity to the free concentrations of effectors that decide whether a bifunctional enzyme acts as modifier or demodifier. However, here we can now demonstrate that the degree of modification of a target molecule can display ultrasensitivity to the total, rather than free, concentrations of such effectors. Our results clarify some general aspects of ultrasensitive responses to effectors, including competitive inhibitors, in mono-cyclic cascades...|$|E
40|$|A cell has {{the ability}} to convert an {{environmental}} change into the expression of genetic information through a chain of intracellular signal transduction reactions. Here, we aimed to develop a method for quantifying this signal transduction. We showed that the channel capacities of individual steps in a given general model cascade were equivalent in an independent manner, and were given by the entropy production rate. Signal transduction was transmitted by fluctuation of the entropy production rate and quantified transduction was estimated by the work done in individual steps. If the individual step representing the modification to <b>demodification</b> of the signal molecules {{is considered to be a}} Szilard engine, the maximal work done is equivalent to the chemical potential change of the messenger that is consumed during the modification reaction. Our method was applicable to calculate the channel capacity of the MAPK cascade. In conclusion, our method is suitable for quantitative analyses of signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} monocyclic cascade models {{shows that the}} steady-state fraction of covalently modified interconvertible enzyme {{is a function of}} 10 different cascade parameters. Because each parameter can be varied independently, or several can be varied simultaneously, by single or multiple allosteric interactions of ligands with {{one or more of the}} cascade enzymes, interconvertible enzymes are exquisitely designed for the rigorous control of key metabolic steps. Compared with other reglatory enzymes, they can respond to a greater number of allosteric stimuli, they exhibit greater flexibility in overall control patterns, and they can generate a greatly amplified response to primary allosteric interactions of effectors with the converter enzymes. Contrary to earlier views, the decomposition of ATP associated with cyclic coupling of the covalent modification and <b>demodification</b> reactions is not a futile process. ATP decomposition supplies the energy needed to maintain concentrations of modified enzyme at steady-state levels that are in excess of those obtainable at true thermodynamic equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|PII {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown to be key players in the regulation of nitrogen fixation and ammonia assimilation in bacteria. The mode by which these proteins act as signals is by being in either a form modified by UMP or the unmodified form. The modification, as well as <b>demodification,</b> is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme encoded by the glnD gene. The regulation of this enzyme is thus of central importance. In Rhodospirillum rubrum, three PII paralogs have been identified. In this study, we have used purified GlnD and PII proteins from R. rubrum, and we show that for the uridylylation activity of R. rubrum GlnD, α-ketoglutarate is the main signal, whereas glutamine has no effect. This is in contrast to, e. g., the Escherichia coli system. Furthermore, we show that all three PII proteins are uridylylated, although the efficiency is dependent on the cation present. This difference may be of importance in understanding the effects of the PII proteins on the different target enzymes. Furthermore, we show that the deuridylylation reaction is greatly stimulated by glutamine and that Mn 2 + is required...|$|E
40|$|The ubiquitin-like SUMO system {{functions}} by a cyclic {{process of}} modification and <b>demodification,</b> and recent {{data suggest that}} the nucleolus is a site of sumoylation–desumoylation cycles. For example, the tumour suppressor ARF stimulates sumoylation of nucleolar proteins. Here, we show that the nucleolar SUMO-specific protease SENP 3 is associated with nucleophosmin (NPM 1), a crucial factor in ribosome biogenesis. SENP 3 catalyses desumoylation of NPM 1 –SUMO 2 conjugates in vitro and counteracts ARF-induced modification of NPM 1 by SUMO 2 in vivo. Intriguingly, depletion of SENP 3 by short interfering RNA interferes with nucleolar ribosomal RNA processing and inhibits the conversion of the 32 S rRNA species to the 28 S form, thus phenocopying the processing defect observed on depletion of NPM 1. Moreover, mimicking constitutive modification of NPM 1 by SUMO 2 interferes with 28 S rRNA maturation. These results define SENP 3 as an essential factor for ribosome biogenesis and suggest that deconjugation of SUMO 2 from NPM 1 by SENP 3 is critically involved in 28 S rRNA maturation...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for the immunoprecipitation of Fe protein from cell extracts {{was developed and}} used to monitor the modification of Fe protein in vivo. The subunit pattern of the isolated Fe protein after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was assayed by Coomassie brilliant blue protein staining and autoradiographic 32 P detection of the modifying group. Whole-cell nitrogenase activity was also monitored during Fe protein modification. The addition of ammonia, darkness, oxygen, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and phenazine methosulfate each resulted {{in a loss of}} whole-cell nitrogenase activity and the in vivo modification of Fe protein. For ammonia and darkness, the rate of loss of nitrogenase activity was similar to that for Fe protein modification. The reillumination of a culture incubated in the dark brought about a rapid recovery of nitrogenase activity and the <b>demodification</b> of Fe protein. Cyclic dark-light treatments resulted in matching cycles of nitrogenase activity and Fe protein modification. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and phenazine methosulfate treatments caused an immediate loss of nitrogenase activity, whereas Fe protein modification occurred at a slower rate. Oxygen treatment resulted in a rapid loss of activity but only an incomplete modification of the Fe protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of grain refinement - {{with the addition}} of 6 mass% Al- 5 Ti-B and 10 mass% Al- 3 Ti-B master alloys - on the temperature-based parameters of a commercial ADC 12 die-casting alloy, modified with 0. 04 mass% Sr, was investigated using computer-aided cooling curve thermal analysis. Results show that the addition of grain refiners caused the reaction area of the aluminium dendrite to shift up. With the addition of refiner reagents, the nucleation temperature and growth temperature for the evolution of the primary Al dendrite increased, while the recalescence temperature decreased. The dendrite coherency temperature (T DCP), time (t DCP), temperature (T N-T DCP), and time (t N-t DCP) interval for dendrite coherency and solid fraction at coherency point increased {{with the addition of}} Al- 3 Ti-B and Al- 5 Ti-B grain refiners. Nevertheless, the growth temperature of the eutectic aluminium-silicon phase remained at the modified range (563. 5 - 565 °C) even after the addition of grain refiners. A grain-refined and modified structure was obtained after the addition of refiners, but no obvious mutual effect was found in terms of the coarsening of grain size or silicon <b>demodification</b> in the range of concentrations used in this stud...|$|E
40|$|DraT/DraG-mediated posttranslational {{regulation}} of the nitrogenase Fe protein by ADP-ribosylation has been described for a few diazotrophic bacteria belonging to the class Alphaproteobacteria. Here we present {{for the first time}} the DraT/DraG system of a betaproteobacterium, Azoarcus sp. strain BH 72, a diazotrophic grass endophyte. Its genome harbors one draT ortholog and two physically unlinked genes coding for ADP-ribosylhydrolases. Northern blot analysis revealed cotranscription of draT with two genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Furthermore, draT and draG 2 were expressed under all studied conditions, whereas draG 1 expression was nitrogen regulated. By using Western blot analysis of deletion mutants and nitrogenase assays in vivo, we demonstrated that DraT is required for the nitrogenase Fe protein modification but not for the physiological inactivation of nitrogenase activity. A second mechanism responsible for nitrogenase inactivation must operate in this bacterium, which is independent of DraT. Fe protein <b>demodification</b> was dependent mainly on DraG 1, corroborating the assumption from phylogenetic analysis that DraG 2 might be mostly involved in processes other than the posttranslational {{regulation of}} nitrogenase. Nitrogenase in vivo reactivation was impaired in a draG 1 mutant and a mutant lacking both draG alleles after anaerobiosis shifts and subsequent adjustment to microaerobic conditions, suggesting that modified dinitrogenase reductase was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the DraT/DraG system, despite some differences, is functionally conserved in diazotrophic proteobacteria...|$|E
40|$|In the heterocystous {{cyanobacterium}} Anabaena variabilis, {{a change}} in nitrogenase activity and concomitant modification of dinitrogenase reductase (the Fe protein of nitrogenase) was induced either by NH 4 Cl at pH 10 (S. Reich and P. Böger, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 58 : 81 - 86, 1989) or by cessation of C supply resulting from darkness, CO 2 limitation, or inhibition of photosystem II activity. Modification induced by both C limitation and NH 4 Cl was efficiently prevented by anaerobic conditions. Under air, endogenously stored glycogen and added fructose protected against modification triggered by C limitation but not by NH 4 Cl. With stored glycogen present, dark modification took place after inhibition of respiration by KCN. Reactivation of inactivated nitrogenase and concomitant <b>demodification</b> of dinitrogenase reductase occurred after restoration of diazotrophic growth conditions. In previously C-limited cultures, reactivation was also observed in the dark after addition of fructose (heterotrophic growth) and under anaerobiosis upon reillumination {{in the presence of}} a photosynthesis inhibitor. The results indicate that modification of dinitrogenase reductase develops as a result of decreased carbohydrate-supported reductant supply of the heterocysts caused by C limitation or by increased diversion of carbohydrates towards ammonia assimilation. Apparently, a product of N assimilation such as glutamine is not necessary for modification. The increase of oxygen concentration in the heterocysts is a plausible consequence of all treatments causing Fe protein modification...|$|E
40|$|The present {{work was}} {{performed}} on A 413. 1 alloy containing 0. 2 – 1. 5 [*]wt% rare earth metals (lanthanum or cerium), 0. 05 – 0. 15 % Ti, and 0 – 0. 02 [*]wt% Sr. These elements were either added individually or combined. Thermal analysis, image analysis, and electron probe microanalysis were the main techniques employed in the present study. The {{results show that the}} use of the depression in the eutectic temperature as a function of alloy modification cannot be applied in the case when the alloy is treated with rare earth metals. Increasing the concentration of RE increases the solidification zone especially in Sr-modified alloys leading to poor feeding ability. This observation is more prominent in the case of Ce addition. Depending upon the amount of added Ti, two RE based intermetallics can be formed: (i) a white phase, mainly platelet-like (approximately 2. 5 [*]μm thick), that is rich in RE, Si, Cu, and Al and (ii) a second phase made up of mainly grey sludge particles (star-like) branching in different directions. The grey phase is rich in Ti with some RE (almost 20 % of that in the white phase) with traces of Si and Cu. There is a strong interaction between RE and Sr leading to a reduction in the efficiency of Sr as a eutectic Si modifier causing particle <b>demodification...</b>|$|E
40|$|We used a {{model system}} of {{purified}} components {{to explore the}} effects of a downstream target on the signaling properties of a covalent modification cycle, an example of retroactivity. In the experimental system used, a bifunctional enzyme catalyzed the modification and <b>demodification</b> of its substrate protein, with both activities regulated by a small molecule stimulus. Here we examined how a downstream target for one or both forms of the substrate of the covalent modification cycle affected the steady-state output of the system, the sensitivity of the response to the stimulus, and the concentration of the stimulus required to provide the half-maximal response (S 50). When both the modified and unmodified forms of the substrate protein were sequestered by the downstream target, the sensitivity of the response was dramatically decreased, but the S 50 was only modestly affected. Conversely, when the downstream target only sequestered the unmodified form of the substrate protein, significant effects were observed on both system sensitivity and S 50. Behaviors of the experimental systems were well approximated both by simple models allowing analytical solutions and by a detailed model based on the known interactions and enzymatic activities. Modeling and experimentation indicated that retroactivity may result in subsensitive responses, even if the covalent modification cycle displays significant ultrasensitivity in the absence of retroactivity. Thus, we provide examples of how a downstream target can alter the signaling properties of an upstream signal transduction covalent modification cycle...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} several unusual {{relationships between the}} 2 -methylthio-N 6 -(delta 2 -isopentenyl) adenosine- 37 (ms 2 i 6 A- 37) tRNA modification and spontaneous mutagenesis in Escherichia coli K- 12 (D. M. Connolly and M. E. Winkler, J. Bacteriol. 171 : 3233 - 3246, 1989). To confirm and extend these observations, we determined the structure of miaA, which mediates {{the first step of}} ms 2 i 6 A- 37 synthesis, and characterized the miaA mutator phenotype. The most likely translation start of miaA overlaps the last two codons of mutL, which encodes a protein required for methyl-directed mismatch repair. This structural arrangement confirms that miaA and mutL are in the same complex operon. The miaA gene product, delta 2 -isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase, shows extensive homology with the yeast MOD 5 gene product, and both enzymes contain a substrate binding site found in farnysyl pyrophosphate synthetase and a conserved putative ATP/GTP binding site. Insertions in miaA cause exclusively GC [...] TA transversions, which contrasts with the GC [...] AT and AT [...] GC transitions observed in mutL mutants. To correlate the absence of the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification directly with the mutator phenotype, we isolated a unique suppressor of a leaky miaA(ochre) mutation. The miaD suppressor mapped to 99. 75 min, restored the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification to miaA(ochre) mutants, and abolished the miaA mutator phenotype. We speculate that miaD causes a decrease in ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA <b>demodification</b> or an increase in miaA gene expression but not at the level of operon transcription. Together, these observations support the idea that the ms 2 i 6 A- 37 tRNA modification acts as a physiological switch that modulates spontaneous mutation frequency and other metabolic functions...|$|E

40|$|P(II) -type signal {{transduction}} proteins {{play a central}} role in nitrogen regulation in many bacteria. In response to the intracellular nitrogen status, these proteins are rendered in their function and interaction with other proteins by modification/demodification events, e. g. by phosphorylation or uridylylation. In this study, we show that GlnK, the only P(II) -type protein in Corynebacterium glutamicum, is adenylylated in response to nitrogen starvation and deadenylylated when the nitrogen supply improves again. Both processes depend on the GlnD protein. As shown by mutant analyses, the modifying activity of this enzyme is located in the N-terminal part of the enzyme, while <b>demodification</b> depends on its C-terminal domain. Besides its modification status, the GlnK protein changes its intracellular localization in response to changes of the cellular nitrogen supply. While it is present in the cytoplasm during nitrogen starvation, the GlnK protein is sequestered to the cytoplasmic membrane in response to an ammonium pulse following a nitrogen starvation period. About 2 - 5 % of the GlnK pool is located at the cytoplasmic membrane after ammonium addition. GlnK binding to the cytoplasmic membrane depends on the ammonium transporter AmtB, which is encoded in the same transcriptional unit as GlnK and GlnD, the amtB-glnK-glnD operon. In contrast, the structurally related methylammonium/ammonium permease AmtA does not bind GlnK. The membrane-bound GlnK protein is stable, most likely to inactivate AmtB-dependent ammonium transport in order to prevent a detrimental futile cycle under post-starvation ammonium-rich conditions, while the majority of GlnK is degraded within 2 - 4 min. Proteolysis in the transition period from nitrogen starvation to nitrogen-rich growth seems to be specific for GlnK; other proteins of the nitrogen metabolism, such as glutamine synthetase, or proteins unrelated to ammonium assimilation, such as enolase and ATP synthase subunit F(1) beta, are stable under these conditions. Our analyses of different mutant strains have shown that at least three different proteases influence the degradation of GlnK, namely FtsH, the ClpCP and the ClpXP protease complex...|$|E
