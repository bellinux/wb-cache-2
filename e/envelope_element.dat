40|$|Abstract. Buildings {{account for}} {{approximately}} 40 % {{of the global}} energy consumption and 36 % of total carbon dioxide emissions. At present many efforts are underway to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint of buildings by optimizing their performance. Building <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> {{have a major impact}} on the performance of buildings. However, the best combination of the building <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> for optimizing the performance of buildings is difficult to determine and is not known. Building performance analysis is mostly done through energy modelling by using a whole building simulation tool. However, this is a slow and a tedious process, and generally only a few cases are evaluated in a large range of possible scenarios. By combining a generic optimization scheme with energy modelling, the best combination of building <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> can be determined and, thereby, it is possible to optimize the performance of buildings successfully subject to predefined constraints. This paper describes how the performance of an office building located in the suburbs of Colombo, Sri Lanka is optimized in terms of building <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> through combined energy modelling and generic optimization. The optimized envelope design with its efficient utilization of daylight, not only reduces the annual energy consumption substantially, but also leads to better thermal comfort for the occupants...|$|R

Current building energy simulation tools only include models for established responsive technologies, and the controls of either the HVAC system or active technologies is still based on rule based control.

According to that the energy demands in household as well as energy conservation potential are very important parts of the management and development of energy sector. Energy demand and also efficiency in housing sector generally depends on various circumstances: social sphere and state or municipal regulations, infrastructure of living area and energy supply, building envelope conditions, population’s consumption habits, thinking manner (ownership) and climate conditions. Heat energy saving arrangements is the main for the refurbishment of prefabricated housing because thermal insulation is paramount to both heat energy savings and to repairing facade damage. The advantages of heat energy saving measures, {{particularly with respect to}} prefabricated housing, are undeniably evident: •Reducing heat energy consumption by 40 to 50 % is easily attained.

Methods Refurbishment projects focused on the large stock of apartment buildings built before 1990. The standardized buildings comprise 65 % of the building stock. District heating is widespread in Latvia. For the whole building sector estimated saving potential of 30 - 50 % resulting in 15 PJ. For the public buildings estimated saving potential 20 - 60 % resulting in 2. 052 PJ.

The problem of acoustic radiation from a turbofan engine inlet is difficult to model numerically because of the large domain and high frequencies involved. A numerical model with conventional finite elements in the near field and wave <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> in the far field has been constructed. By employing an irrotational mean flow assumption, both the mean flow and the acoustic perturbation problem have been posed in an axisymmetric formulation in terms of the velocity potential; thereby minimizing computer storage and time requirements.

The sound source at the fan face has been modeled as a combination of positive and negative propagating duct eigenfunctions. Therefore, a finite element duct eigenvalue problem has been solved on the fan face and the resulting modal matrix has been used to implement a source boundary condition on the fan face in the acoustic radiation problem. In the post processing of the solution, the acoustic pressure has been evaluated at Gauss points inside the elements and the nodal pressure values have been interpolated from them.

40|$|AbstractAirtightness plays a {{significant}} role in buildings energy efficiency. This paper describes validation of the new model for predicting airtightness values of residential units. This model utilizes a neural network in prediction of airtightness and is obtained based on in situ measurements at 58 units in the local Osijek area (Croatia) carried out during 2013. The model presents new approach to airtightness estimations by using 4 corrective factors associated with building <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> and their airtightness properties. The model was validated in local field conditions, but independent validation of the model in this paper was made on 5 residential buildings in the Republic of Serbia in order to determine its applicability on new data set outside local area of Osijek. The proposed model requires reduced amount of data for predicting airtightness values of residential units and therefore is faster and more economical than the actual field measurements. The proposed model could also be used for predicting airtightness values at the initial design phase already, as well as for planning systematic energy refurbishment of residential buildings in order to achieve adequate energy efficiency and appropriate thermal comfort in accordance with EU recommendations in this field...|$|R
