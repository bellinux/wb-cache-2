40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare in a prospective randomized study the outcome of painful, traumatic knee injuries when treated with either the modified Robert Jones (MRJB) or <b>elastic</b> <b>support</b> <b>bandage</b> (ESB). Patients with moderate or severe unilateral knee injury presenting to our department within 24 h were randomized into two treatment groups receiving either the MRJB or an ESB. The main outcome parameters of the study were the amount of pain relief required, the speed of recovery, mobility and patient preference. The results of our study of 40 patients indicate that the two treatments were equally effective in treating knee sprains, and patients preferred the ESB in the early post-injury period. Therefore, we see no reason to continue using the MRJB for the treatment of sprained knees in the accident and emergency (A&E) setting when a more patient acceptable, time and cost-effective treatment is available...|$|E

The treatment variation observed for the acutely injured lateral ankle ligament complex suggests {{a lack of}} evidence-based management strategies for this problem. Subjects and methods: The study included fourty patients, age ranged from 18 to 25 year and divided into two groups. The first group with mean age 21. 4 ± 2. 65 years followed a physical therapy program of exercises {{in the form of}} strengthening exercises for dorsiflexors, planterflexors, evertors, and invertors muscles, stretching exercise of planterflexors, using of ankle <b>support</b> (<b>elastic</b> <b>bandage),</b> and partial weight bearing, three sessions per week for 3 weeks. The second group with mean age 22. 1 ± 3. 21 years, submitted to a physical therapy program of exercises in the form of strengthening exercises for dorsiflexors, planterflexors, evertors, and invertors muscles, stretching exercise of planterflexors, using of ankle <b>support</b> (<b>elastic</b> <b>bandage),</b> and complete weight bearing, three sessions per week for 3 weeks. Outcome measures were rating score system of the japanese orthopaedic association for measuring daily living activities (walking), universal goniometer to detect range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion and planterflexion, and visual analogue scale to measure the pain severity. Results: There was {{a significant difference in the}} first group (t of pain= 0. 0007, t of ROM of dorsiflexion= 0. 009, t of ROM of planterflexion= 0. 007, t of ADL (walking) = 0. 035) than in the second group, there was a significant difference (t of pain= 0. 0009, t of ROM of dorsiflexion= 0. 007, t of ROM of planterflexion= 0. 0008, t of ADL (walking) = 0. 025).

This paper investigates the in-plane nonlinear elastic behaviour {{and stability of}} elastically supported shallow circular arches that are subjected to a radial load uniformly distributed around the arch axis. Analytical solutions for the nonlinear behaviour and for the nonlinear buckling load are obtained for shallow arches with equal or unequal <b>elastic</b> <b>supports.</b> It is found that {{the flexibility of the}} <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> and the shallowness of the arch play important roles in the nonlinear structural response of the arch.

An arch with equal <b>elastic</b> radial <b>supports</b> whose flexibility is larger than the critical value becomes an elastically supported beam curved in elevation, while an arch with one rigid and one <b>elastic</b> radial <b>support</b> whose flexibility is larger than the critical value still behaves as an arch when its shallowness is higher than a limiting shallowness.

For estimating the im-portant {{problems in the}} railway tracks such as the effects of rail joints, rail supports, rail modeling in the nearness of bridge and other problems, the models of the axially beam model on the elastic foundation can be utilized. For study-ing the effects of axially beam on the elastic foundation, partial differential equations which represent the independent variables should be utilized because of the beams have infinite degrees of freedom.

The beam model includes visco – elastic foundation and <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> conditions. For considering the beam element, axial force has been considered beside of shear and moment forces.
