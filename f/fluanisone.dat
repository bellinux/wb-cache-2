40|$|Near-physiologic hemodynamic {{conditions}} {{for several hours}} were needed to study cardiovascular physiology in a murine model. We compared two commonly used anesthetic treatments, urethane alpha-chloralose (U-alphaCh; 968 mg U and 65 mg alphaCh/kg) and 2, 2, 2 -tribromoethanol (TBE; 435 mg/kg) and fentanyl <b>fluanisone</b> midazolam (FFM; 3. 313 mg fentanyl, 104. 8 mg <b>fluanisone,</b> and 52. 42 mg midazolam/kg) with respect to mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) for 100 min at similar levels of surgical anesthesia. Assessed every 10 to 15 min, the U-alphaCh+TBE group maintained a significantly (P < 0. 001) lower mean MAP (49 4 mmHg) than did the FFM group (78 5 mmHg). Mean HR in the U-alphaCh+TBE group significantly (P < 0. 001) increased from 308 34 bpm at the beginning to 477 43 bpm {{at the end of}} the experiment. In comparison, the FFM group showed a stable HR of 431 37 bpm. The MAP and HR of the U-alphaCh+TBE group were extremely unstable, with sudden and unpredictable changes in MAP when examined at 1 -min intervals. The results of our study show that U-alphaCh+TBE anesthesia should not be used in murine models in which stable, near-physiologic hemodynamics are needed for cardiovascular studie...|$|E
30|$|Twenty Wistar [13] rats {{weighing}} 250 – 300  g were used. The rats were anesthetized with an {{intramuscular injection}} of 0.3  ml Hypnorm (<b>fluanisone</b> and phentanylcitrate). The abdominal cavity was opened through a 4 -cm midline incision using a clean operative, but not strictly aseptic, technique. Using a steel spatula, we everted the abdominal wall, exposing {{the right side}} of the peritoneum.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} suitability of fentanyl/fluanisone (‘Hypnorm’, VetaPharma; 0. 315 mg/mL of fentanyl citrate and 10 mg/mL of <b>fluanisone)</b> alone or combined with midazolam in rhesus macaques. Fifteen rhesus macaques requiring sedation for veterinary procedures received an intramuscular (IM) dose range of Hypnorm from 0. 01 mL/kg to 0. 3 mL/kg either alone or combined with 0. 5 mg/kg of mid- azolam. To reverse the sedation, flumazenil in combination with either naloxone, buprenorphine or butor- phanol was administered intravenously (IV) or IM. Rhesus macaques were successfully sedated with 0. 1 mL/kg of Hypnorm and 0. 5 mg/kg of midazolam, and sedation was partially reversed by the administration of flumazenil and either naloxone or buprenorphine. However the primates remained slightly sedated and were only released into their home cage several hours post recovery. Butorphanol failed to induce recovery and caused marked respiratory depression. The neuroleptanalgesic combination, Hypnorm and midazolam, effectively immobilized rhesus macaques and was reversible {{with a combination of}} flumazenil and either naloxone or buprenorphine.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of forward genetic screens in the mouse asks for techniques that make rapid screening of visual function possible. Transcranial imaging of intrinsic signal {{is suitable for}} this purpose and could detect the effects of retinal degeneration, and the increased predominance of the contralateral eye in albino animals. We quantified visual response properties of the cortex by introducing a normalization method to reduce the impact of biological noise. In addition, the presentation of a ‘reset’-stimulus shortly after the probing stimulus at a different visual location could reduce the interstimulus time necessary for the decay of the response. Applying these novel methods, we found that acuity of C 57 Bl ⁄ 6 J mice rises from 0. 35 cycles per degree (cpd) at postnatal day 25 to 0. 56 cpd in adults. Temporal resolution was lower in adults than in juvenile animals. There was no patchy organization of spatial or temporal frequency preference at the intrinsic signal resolution. Monocular deprivation, a model for amblyopia and critical period plasticity, led to a loss in acuity and a shift towards the nondeprived eye in juvenile animals. Short deprivation {{did not lead to}} increased acuity of the nondeprived eye. In adults, a small ocular dominance shift was detectable with urethane anaesthesia. This was not observed when the combination of the opiate fentanyl, <b>fluanisone</b> with a benzodiazepine was used, adding evidence to the hypothesis that enhancing GABAA-receptor function masks an adult shift. Together, these novel applications confirm that noninvasive screening of many functional properties of the visual cortex is possible...|$|E
40|$|An {{advantage}} {{of the use of}} hyperthermia in the treatment of malignant disease when external heating sources are used is {{that there may be a}} degree of preferential heating of a tumour over surrounding normal tissues. This can be as a result of differences between the tumour vasculature and that of normal tissues (Field & Bleehen, 1979). The general asumption that tumours are less well perfused than normal tissues is by no means always the case (Beaney et al., 1984), but as a result of several interrelated factors tumour vasculature may differ in its response to that of surrounding tissues. Reports indicate that even with initially well prefused tumours, following hyperthermia it is likely that the tumour vasculature has a limited capacity to dilate. Complete collapse and coagulation probably occurs in these vessels at lower temperatures and following a shorter exposure to heat than normal vessels. This leads to a relatively poorly perfused and therefore preferentially heated tumour area (Song, 1981). The end point of these various vascular effects is a reduction in perfusion of the tumour. We have investigated one aspect of this by studying the effects of the rate of perfusion on heating using perfused isolated rabbit lungs which can be implanted into anaesthetised animals to simulate a perfused tumour. We feel that this model simulates the effect of perfusion more closely than previously described dynamic phantoms (Cetas, 1981). New Zealand white rabbits of between 2 kg and 2. 5 kg were premedicated with fentanyl 0. 2 mg and <b>fluanisone</b> 10 mg (Hypnorm), and 2, 000 iu of heparin injected IV via an ear vein just prior to the administration of a lethal dose of 200 mg of pentobarbitone (Euthatal) IV. Following sacrifice of the animals the chest was opened, the thymus removed and a ligature placed around the pulmonary trunk and the aorta. A catheter was inserted into the pulmonary trunk through an incision in the right ventricle and the ligature tied...|$|E
40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effect of both a flap and corticotomy procedure on orthodontic tooth movement in rats and to compare the bone changes against a control group. Furthermore, the study aimed to introduce a new design for an appliance, which would allow buccal tooth movement in a rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 36) aged 6 - 8 weeks were obtained from Laboratory Animal Services (Adelaide University) with ethics approval from The University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (Project number: M- 2009 - 172). There were 3 control groups, each with 6 rats: nil intervention; flap surgery; corticotomy procedure. These formed the baseline comparison to the experimental groups: tooth movement only; flap surgery and tooth movement; and corticotomy with tooth movement; 4 rats were excluded due to anaesthetic death or appliance failure but were replaced with ethics approval from The University of Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee (Project number: M- 2009 - 172 B) such that 6 rats remained in each group. [table omitted] The timeline for the experiment was 7 days with a Calcein bone label injection at 3 days prior to appliance insertion, an Alizarin Red bone label injection at 5 days after appliance insertion, and sacrifice at 7 days after appliance insertion. Throughout the experimental period, Buprenorphine (0. 05 mg/kg. Tradename: Temgesic and comes as 324 µg Buprenorphine Hydrochloride which was then diluted) I. P. was given twice daily for pain relief, in all tooth movement groups. Sacrifice was with Lethabarb Euthanasia Injection (60 mg/mL with 1 mL/Kg of a barbiturate derivative made by Virbac (Australia)). Following this period, the rat maxillae was dissected out and prepared for resin embedding and micro- CT scanning. Micro-CT scanning was performed in a Skyscan 1174 at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (IMVS) with hydroxyapatite standards (250 mg HA/cm³ and 750 mg HA/cm³) to allow for quantitative analysis and comparison between the samples produced. Software for reconstruction was NRecon (v 1. 4. 4, Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) and for measuring gray levels was CT Analyser (v 1. 8. 05, Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium). Resin embedding (Appendix 1) allows for histological analysis and observation of the bone labels and calculation of the bone mineralisation rates. Impressions using Honigum heavy body (DMG-dental, Gunz Dental, Australia) were taken at appliance insert and again at sacrifice. Honigum is an A-silicone and was used in the automix-cartridge form. These impressions and the dissected rat maxillae were photographed using an Olympus stereomicroscope (SZX 2 -ILLT, Tokyo, Japan) and captured with Analysis Software (v 5. 1 (Build 1276), Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, GMBH) and measurements from the resultant pictures were performed, using image J (1. 43 u, National Institute of Health, USA). For those rats which required insertion of an appliance, an additional impression was taken at the time of calcein bone label injection so that an individual appliance could be fabricated for each rat. This appliance was inserted 3 days later under deep anaesthesia using Hypnorm/Hypnovel/Water in a 1 : 1 : 2 mix. Hypnorm (0. 315 mg/mL Fentanyl with 10 mg/mL <b>Fluanisone)</b> and Hypnovel (5 mg/mL Midazolam) are mixed separately with sterile water in a 1 : 1 ratio. Once mixed, the resulting solutions are mixed together, on a 1 : 1 basis. All rats were monitored closely until recovery. Following the 7 day experiment and matching each experimental group with its correlated control group; Group 4 (appliance, nil surgery) rats displayed 0. 08 mm greater movement than Group 1 rats, Group 5 (appliance, flap surgery) rats 0. 29 mm greater movement than Group 2 rats, Group 6 (appliance, corticotomy) rats 0. 38 mm greater movement than Group 3. Overall, Group 6 was statistically significant compared to all control rat groups (1, 2 and 3), whilst Group 5 was statistically significant only to Group 2 rats and Group 4 rats were not statistically significant to any other group. However, Group 6 tooth movement was not statistically different to Groups 4 and 5. With regards to bone changes there was no statistically significant difference between the groups and as such, we could not show that a surgical intervention (either flap or corticotomy) could produce significant osteopenia when combined with orthodontic tooth movement over 7 days. There was increased osteopenia when comparing either surgical intervention with nil surgery, but this did not reach statistical significance. This was measured using micro-CT scans with hydroxyapatite standards. As with all experiments, especially those involving biological research, many factors could have affected the outcome. Casual observation of the micro-CT scans would indicate noticeable changes between groups in the osteopenic response by the bone. This would agree with other reports in the literature but our results were not statistically significant. Postexperimental analysis revealed that approximately 66 rats may have given a significant interaction but, in addition, there were issues with appliance failures, lack of pre-treatment micro-CT and other methodological considerations. In conclusion, although greater than average distance changes and demineralisation changes were seen in the corticotomy and flap groups, these did not reach statistical significance. Although we could not prove this definitively, it is likely that this induced osteopenia is the reason for the increase in tooth movement. Further research is required, to provide longer observation periods and to elucidate if the other benefits of a corticotomy procedure, for example, decreased root resorption, are supported with evidence.
