5|$|American actress Lauren Bacall (1924–2014) had an {{extensive}} career in films, television shows, and plays. She {{was one of}} the leading ladies during the Golden Age of Hollywood along with actresses such as Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth. Bacall started her career as a teenage fashion model when she appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar and was discovered by Howard Hawks' wife Nancy. As she naturally had a high-pitched and nasal voice, she received lessons to help deepen it and was required to shout verses by Shakespeare for hours <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> part of her training.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff are}} {{preparing}} to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers {{that he will be}} sitting in the writers' room <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision.|$|E

5|$|Graham is a skiing {{coach for}} Paralympic athletes whose focus is {{coaching}} on sitting, standing and vision impaired skiers. His coaching philosophy involves athletes training hard <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> {{if the next}} day they would be competing in an event. He mentored and coached Michael Milton, Australia's first Winter Paralympics medallist. Milton gave one of the gold medals he earned at the 2002 Winter Paralympics to Graham. Graham also coached Jessica Gallagher, Australia's first female Winter Paralympic medallist, and Cameron Rahles Rahbula. He helped the Australian ski team finish sixth at the IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in Korea in 2009, where two athletes that he coached individually, Cameron Rahles‐Rahbula and Shannon Dallas, finished in first place. Other athletes he has coached include Mitchell Gourley, who finished first in the giant slalom event at Australian National Skiing Championships.|$|E

25|$|Just after Didi and Gogo {{have been}} {{particularly}} selfish and callous, the boy comes to say that Godot is not coming. The boy (or pair of boys) may be seen to represent meekness and hope before compassion is consciously excluded by an evolving personality and character, and in which case may be the youthful Pozzo and Lucky. Thus Godot is compassion and fails to arrive <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>as</b> he says he will. No-one is concerned that a boy is beaten. In this interpretation, there is the irony that only by changing their hearts to be compassionate can the characters fixed to the tree move on and cease {{to have to wait}} for Godot.|$|E
25|$|After the 1985 season, the White Sox {{came close}} to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for {{designated}} hitter Don Baylor. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> he wanted (despite being the team's regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players {{would have to agree}} to the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when they were unable to reach an agreement. The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees traded Baylor to the Boston Red Sox for designated hitter Mike Easler.|$|E

25|$|The Dual Contracts {{resulted}} in the expansion of New York City; people moved to the newly built homes along the newly built subway lines. These homes were affordable, about the same cost as the houses in Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Dual Contracts were the key to dispersion of the city’s congested areas. They helped lower high population areas and probably helped saves lives as people were no longer living in heavily diseased areas. The population in Manhattan below 59th Street decreased between the years of 1910 and 1920. People were allowed to move to better parts the same cost and could have a better and more comfortable life in the suburbs. They could still commute to work <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> most of the better off city workers {{who moved to the}} outer boroughs did.|$|E
25|$|When the {{inclination}} of the moon's orbit to the Earth's equator {{is at its}} minimum of 18°20′, {{the centre of the}} moon's disk will be above the horizon <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> far north and as far south as 90°−18°20' or 71°40' latitude, whereas when {{the inclination}} is at its maximum of 28°36' the centre of the moon's disk will only be above the horizon every day for latitudes less than 90°−28°36' or 61°24'. At higher latitudes there will be a period of at least a day each month when the moon does not rise, but there will also be a period of at least a day each month during which the moon does not set. This is similar to the behaviour of the sun, but with a period of 27.3 days instead of 365 days. Note that a point on the moon can actually be visible when it is below the horizon by about 34 arc minutes, due to refraction (see Sunrise).|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{federal and}} {{regional}} transportation planners proposed an Inner Loop Expressway composed of three circumferential beltways for the District of Columbia. The middle beltway would have begun at the proposed Barney Circle Freeway near Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, until it terminated near 37th Street NW {{at the north}} end of Georgetown. Two decades of protest led to the cancellation of all but the I-395 and I-695 portions of the plan, and the unbuilt portions of the project were finally cancelled in 1977. The failure to complete the Inner Loop left the Sousa Bridge's approaches incomplete and confusing. Unmarked Interstate 695 delivered three lanes of traffic to a one-lane on-ramp to the bridge, and traffic backed up for miles <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> a traffic light allowed only a few cars onto the bridge's southbound lanes during rush hour. An off-ramp delivered most northbound bridge traffic around the incomplete Barney Circle and under the bridge onto Interstate 695 westbound.|$|E

25|$|Fr. Giovanni Zucca from Murialdo, who {{was then}} the {{chaplain}} at Murialdo when Dominic was five years old, notes in a statement to John Bosco that he came to notice Dominic due to his regular church attendance with his mother, and his habit of kneeling down outside the church to pray (even in the mud or snow) if he happened to come to Church before it had been unlocked in the morning. The chaplain also notes that Savio made good progress at the village school not merely due to his cleverness, but also by working hard. He would not join the other boys in doing something that he believed to be morally wrong and would explain why he thought a particular deed was wrong. At the age of five, he learned to serve Mass, and would try to participate at Mass <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> well as go regularly to Confession. Having been permitted to make his First Communion at an early age, he had much reverence for the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|Ambre had sung Carmen in the Netherlands {{early in}} her career and during the 1879–1880 Mapleson tour, {{but she had never}} sung it in France. The opera had not been seen in Paris since its world premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1875, {{although}} it had several subsequent stagings in the French provinces. Keen to perform it in Paris, she asked Manet to write his friend Antonin Proust and urge him to pressure the Opéra-Comique to revive it for her. A Paris revival with Ambre never happened, but she did sing the role again on her 1880–1881 American tour. Scholars differ as to whether the portrait was done at Ambre's request or as a thank-you gesture from Manet for having organized the exhibition of The Execution of Emperor Maximilian the previous year. During the late summer of 1880 Manet wrote to Eva Gonzalès that he would be working on the painting <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> Ambre was leaving for America that October. However, the portrait remained in the artist's possession. It was in the inventory of works inherited by Manet's widow Suzanne on his death in 1883.|$|E
