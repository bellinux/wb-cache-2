40|$|The {{objectives}} are {{to demonstrate the}} change in mechanical properties of a thermoplastic polymer when the polymer is heated above the glass transition temperature. The instructor or student can perform this demonstration. In preparation for the demonstration, <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> or beaker 3 / 4 full with water and bring the water to a boil. First observe the initial stiffness of the toothbrush by slightly flexing it. Note that it is fairly stiff and retains its initial shape when the forces are removed. If you were to apply enough force, the toothbrush would break in a somewhat brittle fashion. Now place the toothbrush in the boiling water for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes are up, remove the toothbrush from the boiling water with the washcloth. At this time, {{you will be able}} to bend the toothbrush easily. When it cools it will retain this bent shape. You've just demonstrated heating the polymer above the glass transition temperature, demonstrating thermoplastic softening.

40|$|Two men {{broke into}} a wizard’s {{workshop}} and stole a crystal decanter filled with 8 ounces of powerful magic potion. In their hideout they want to split the prize, but they can locate only two other containers: a flask that holds 5 ounces and a vase that holds 3 ounces. Can they split the potion equally using only those containers? This is a classic measuring problem. To model it mathematically we should consider only the key information, ignoring the rest. There are three containers: a decanter, a flask, and a vase, with capacities 8, 5, and 3 ounces. Starting with 8 ounces in the decanter, the men pour the liquid back and forth, trying to end up somehow with 4 ounces {{in one of the}} containers. Here’s one way they could start: First they <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask,</b> so the flask has 5 ounces of potion while 3 ounces remain in the decanter. For their second move they fill the vase by pouring from the flask. At that point there are 3 ounces in the vase, 2 ounces in the flask, with 3 ounces remaining in the decanter. Explaining the steps with English words soon becomes confusing. To keep track of the moves let’s write the symbol (x, y, z) to mean that there are x ounces in the decanter, y ounces in the flask, and z ounces in the vase. The story begins at (8, 0, 0). The first move above leads to (3, 5, 0) and after the second move they have (3, 2, 3). From there they could move to (0, 5, 3), or to (6, 2, 0), or back to (3, 5, 0). Are there other possibilities? There seem to be several ways to move after each step. The problem is to find a sequence of moves that ends with a 4 appearing somewhere. Take a minute now to see if you can discover the moves they need. 1 A position (x, y, z) in this game involves numbers x, y, z whose values are somewhat restricted. For instance, x represents the number of ounces in the decanter so it must be between 0 and 8. In symbols we write that as: 0 ≤ x ≤ 8. Similarly there are y ounces in the flask, so y must lie between 0 and 5. That is: 0 ≤ y ≤ 5. For the vase we find 0 ≤ z ≤ 3. Finally since no spills are allowed (the potion is too valuable) there must be a total of 8 ounces at all times. In symbols: x + y + z = 8...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} carry out the {{saponification}} of the carotenoids contained in the oleoresin, we first extracted the pigments from 50  mg of the oleoresin using 30  mL of HEAT solution (hexane, ethanol, acetone, toluene; 10 / 7 / 6 / 7; v/v/v/v) in a 100  mL volumetric flask. Subsequently, we added 2  mL of methanolic potassium hydroxide, stirred for 1  min and heated to 56  °C for 20  min. The neck of <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> was connected to a condenser to prevent evaporation and loss of solvent. After the heating time had passed, <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> was left to cool and kept in the dark for 1  h. We then added 30  mL of hexane, stirred <b>the</b> mix, and <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> to <b>the</b> calibration mark with a solution of Na 2 SO 4 (10 %). Before performing any analysis, we allowed the mix to stand in the dark for 1  h. To assess the effect of saponification on pigments, we performed a thin layer chromatography. For this, we used silica gel plates (60 F 254; 5  ×  10  cm) for analytical chromatography. After drawing the reference line at 0.5  cm from the bottom, we placed 20  μL of each sample solution in the plates. The concentration of the unsaponified oleoresin solution was 0.5  mg/mL, while the concentration of the saponified solution was 1  mg/mL. The sample was eluted with increasing proportions of a mixture of hexane and acetone (80 / 20, v/v) within a closed chamber. Before the stains migrated to the upper end, the plate was removed and dried with nitrogen flow.|$|R
60|$|At {{three in}} the afternoon, on a warm day in September, when the torrent had reached its average maximum {{strength}} for <b>the</b> day, I <b>filled</b> an ordinary Bordeaux wine-flask with the water where it was least turbid. From this quart of water I obtained twenty-four grains of sand and sediment, more or less fine. I cannot estimate the quantity {{of water in the}} stream; but the runlet of it at which I <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> was giving about two hundred bottles a minute, or rather more, carrying down therefore about three quarters of a pound of powdered granite every minute. This would be forty-five pounds an hour; but allowing for the inferior power of the stream in the cooler periods of the day, and taking into consideration, on the other side, its increased power in rain, we may, I think, estimate its average hour's work at twenty-eight or thirty pounds, or a hundred weight every four hours. By this insignificant runlet, therefore, some four inches wide and four inches deep, rather more than two tons of the substance of the Mont Blanc are displaced, and carried down a certain distance every week; and as it is only for three or four months that the flow of the stream is checked by frost, we may certainly allow eighty tons for the mass which it annually moves.|$|R
40|$|In early 2006 we {{designed}} and built low energy consumption, pump-operated system, for dosing of the liquid nutrient in the summer 2006 season. This operated successfully, and the system was used again during the 2007 and 2008 seasons for dosing. During the early winter period, 2008, laboratory tests were made of the liquid nutrient pump system, and {{it was noted that}} small amounts of air were being entrained on the suction side of the pump, during conditions when the inlet pressure was low. It was believed that this was the cause of diurnal fluctuations in the flow supplied, characteristic of the 2007 year flow data. Replacement of ' 0 ' rings on the inlet side of the pumps was the solution to this problem, and when tested in the field during the summer season, the flow supplied was found to be stable. A decision was made by the IKERT committee at the meeting of 20 th to 21 st May 2008 (held in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho) to use an injection flow rate of liquid fertilizer (polyammonium phosphate 10 - 34 - 0) to achieve a target phosphorus concentration of 3. 0 {micro}g/L, after complete mixing in the river. This target concentration was the same as that used in 2006 and 2007. The proposed starting date was as early as possible in June 2008. Plans were made to measure the dosing flow in three ways. Two of the three methods of flow measurement (1 and 2 below) are inter-dependent. These were: (1) Direct measurement of flow rate by diverting dosing flow into a 1000 mL volume standard flask. The flow rate was computed by dividing the flask volume by the time required to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask.</b> This was done a few times only during the summer period. (2) Adjusting the flow rate reading of the Gamma dosing pump using the 'calibration' function to achieve agreement with the flow rate computed by method 1 above. (3) Direct measurement by electrical signal from conductive fluid passing through a magnetic field (Seametrics meter, as used in previous years). Values were recorded every 4 minutes by a data-logger. This instrument {{has been shown to be}} reliable, and in agreement with method 1 to within the expected uncertainty (within 2 %). Liquid nutrients were delivered to the site in late May, and system testing was done the same day. High concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column, as indicated by shallow Secchi depth readings, were present in the river in the last part of May, into June. A plan was made to delay the start up of nutrient addition to a date later than 1 st June, because the aquatic productivity was almost certainly to be compromised by insufficient light availability. Daily monitoring of Secchi depths was done, showing declining turbidity in early June. A decision was made to start the system on 15 th June, by which time conditions were good...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section F of this method.

50|$|If {{the angle}} {{standard}} taper fittings make with glassware is not perfectly set, {{the glass is}} extremely rigid and brittle, presenting a fracture risk on some setups. A ball and socket joining method allows some flexibility in the mating angles of the pieces being joined, which can be particularly important with heavy flasks or long pieces of glassware {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to support and potentially snap under bending loads. A common example of this is <b>the</b> collection <b>flask</b> on a rotary evaporator, whose weight increases significantly as it fills. A ball and socket allows <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> to plumb itself without placing a bending load on the joint. Such a socket might also be used on a larger, but more typical, distillation setup at the head and before the condenser. This allows the long span of the condenser, the non-perfect angle of the receiving bend and <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> <b>flask</b> to be supported more easily as their angle with the still head has a few degrees of positioning freedom.|$|R

50|$|Typically, before solvent or {{reagents}} {{are introduced}} into a Schlenk <b>flask,</b> <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> is dried {{and the atmosphere}} of <b>the</b> <b>flask</b> is exchanged with an inert gas.

30|$|The sample {{preparation}} was conducted as previously described (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). In short, {{the sample was}} temperated in a water bath at 20  °C.

Subsequently the tube was clamped in the distillation device. After placing a graduated flask filled with 3  mL of distilled water under the distillate outlet tubing, the program was started, and the distillation was automatically performed while occasionally shaking <b>the</b> receiver <b>flask.</b> After termination, <b>the</b> receiver and the tube were replaced and the hoses were rinsed with distilled water to be ready for the next sample. <b>The</b> graduated <b>flask</b> with <b>the</b> distillate was shaken, temperated in a water bath at 20  °C and <b>filled</b> up to <b>the</b> calibration mark with water (20  °C) and again shaken.
