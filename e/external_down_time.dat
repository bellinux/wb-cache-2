40|$|In general, {{there are}} three {{components}} making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductor is likely {{to reduce the risk}} of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade profile (aerofoil) used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductors of 1 mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m/s and 5 ˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductor arrangement could be considered...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} pillars of the new Basel-II {{regulatory}} framework {{is the concept of}} risk-based capital requirements. In this regard, under the internal-rating-based (IRB) approach, the amount of capital that a bank will have to hold against a given exposure will be a function of the estimated credit risk of that exposure. One important concern is that the new regulatory capital requirement (CAR) will exacerbate business-cycle fluctuations. In this regard, in a downturn, when a bank's capital base is likely to be eroded by loan losses, the existing (non-defaulted) borrowers will be downgraded by the relevant credit-risk models, forcing the bank to hold more capital against its current loan portfolio. As a result, it would be quite costly for banks to raise fresh <b>external</b> capital in <b>down</b> <b>times.</b> Banks would be forced to cut back on lending activity (bank lending channel), thereby contributing to a worsening of the initial downturn. Based on the empirical studies for several SEACEN countries, we find that there is no strong evidence that there is pro-cyclicality impact of Basel II implementation. Nonetheless, SEACEN countries must give serious consideration to their economic situations, especially in case of unfavourable developments, when implementing Basel II for their banking sectors. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} of a lightning protection system for wind turbine blades has been adapted from other industries (i. e. building, aircraft) where a lightning down conductor is installed internally so as to preserve the aerodynamic performance of the blade. Having the down conductor internally within the blades would indeed preserve their aerodynamic performance. However the blades are, as a consequence, vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. Owing to that, the authors believe that by having the down conductor on the external surface of the blade, the incidence of blade damage would be reduced. The authors have not found any literature {{in the public domain}} that quantifies the effect of having an <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductor on the aerodynamic property. Hence, this aspect is being undertaken. Previous studies conducted by the authors were on two different arrangements. In one arrangement, a single 1 mm thick conductor was placed at 1 m from the leading edge on the upper and lower parts of the blade. In the other arrangement, multiple conductors were placed at 1 m intervals. The results from previous studies indicated that <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductors affect the aerodynamic performance significantly but the first conductor (as encountered by the wind flow) appear to have the maximum influence. Hence, this paper addresses the question whether a single <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductor could be deployed in an optimal position for least effect on the aerodynamic performance. The results show that the degradation on aerodynamic property is least at the trailing edge or {{the leading edge of the}} blade and these indicate that the {{installation of}} <b>external</b> <b>down</b> conductors may be viable in that region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of resistance exercise strengthening the hip flexor and extensor muscles on functional gait of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients were randomized into two groups. Both groups performed conventional physical therapy for six weeks. The experi-mental group also performed isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for the hip flexor and extensor muscles. The hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time(timed up and go test), and 10 m gait velocity were mea-sured at the baseline, and after 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of treatment. [Results] The experimental showed significant improvements compared to the baseline in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. After 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, there were gains in hip muscle strength and 10 m gait velocity. The control group showed no significant increase in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time or 10 m gait velocity. [Conclusion] We consider that conventional physical therapy contributes to the improvement of functional gait of stroke patients. However, it is more desirable to perform isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for hip flexor and extensor muscles combined with conventional physical therapy for the im-provement of hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity...|$|R
