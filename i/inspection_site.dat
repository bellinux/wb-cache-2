500|$|Norfolk was {{incorporated}} in 1705. In 1730, a tobacco <b>inspection</b> <b>site</b> was located here. According to the Tobacco Inspection Act, the inspection was [...] "At Norfolk Town, upon the fort land, in the County of Norfolk; and Kemp's Landing, in Princess Anne, under one inspection."In 1736 George II granted it a royal charter as a borough. By 1775, Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued {{was the most}} prosperous city in Virginia. It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond. In part because of its merchants' numerous trading ties with {{other parts of the}} British Empire, Norfolk served as a strong base of Loyalist support during {{the early part of the}} American Revolution. After fleeing the colonial capital of Williamsburg, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was forced into exile by the American rebels, commanded by Colonel Woodford. His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia.|$|E

50|$|Deferred {{inspection}} is {{a procedure}} in immigration enforcement in the United States for Arriving Aliens. Here, {{the final decision}} on whether to admit the Arriving Alien, instead of being conducted at the port of entry where the alien arrived, is deferred to be carried out later at a deferred <b>inspection</b> <b>site,</b> while the alien is paroled into the United States. The guidelines followed at the deferred <b>inspection</b> <b>site</b> are largely the same as those followed by the officers at the port of entry, and are described in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Inspector's Field Manual. Aliens do not accrue unlawful presence between the time of arrival and the date of deferred inspection, but they do begin to accrue unlawful presence after their parole ends, if they are not successfully admitted at the deferred <b>inspection</b> <b>site</b> by then. Note that the officers at both the port of entry and the deferred <b>inspection</b> <b>site</b> are part of the CBP Office of Field Operations.|$|E

The Closure Report (CR) was submitted to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) on April 24, 2001. No issues with the post-closure monitoring plan, Section 5. O, were raised. However, other concerns raised by stakeholders required that the CR be revised. Revision 1 of CR was issued in December of 2001 and was approved by NDEP on January 7, 2002. Section 5. 2 of the NDEP-approved CR calls for <b>site</b> <b>inspections</b> to be conducted within {{the first six months}} following completion of cover construction. Following the first six months, <b>site</b> <b>inspection</b> are to be conducted twice yearly for the next two years.

(2) Verification that the site is secure and condition of the fence and posted warning signs. (3) Notice of any subsidence, erosion, unauthorized excavation, etc., deficiencies that may compromise the integrity of the unit. (4) Remedy of any deficiencies within 90 days of discovery. (5) Preparation and submittal of an annual report. To meet the fiscal year 2002 post-closure inspection schedule, the first post-closure <b>site</b> <b>inspection</b> was conducted on November 6, 2001.
