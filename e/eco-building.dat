40|$|After {{decades of}} belief in the {{principles}} that man has absolute dominion over nature, and thus, in the separation of natural and anthropic processes, humanity is {{at the beginning of}} a new era characterized by the search for a renewed pact between man and the environment. This search has yielded new terminology to indicate sustainable ways of transforming the anthropic environment: zero-energy development, bioclimatic architecture, <b>eco-buildings</b> and low carbon footprint. Apparently, this new linguistic phenomenon is symptomatic of two trends: firstly, of a sort of amnesia, in the sense that traditional architecture was already sustainable, not out of choice, but out of survival needs (via its ties to local climate and materials); and secondly, of an identity crisis among designers caused by the difficulty in finding specific boundaries for the discipline of architecture and urban design. Reflecting on these aspects and through the description of two recent projects, this article addresses the renewed interest in re-establishing an inseparable relationship between natural and anthropic processes.

40|$|<b>Eco-building</b> is a male domain {{where men}} are {{presumed to be}} better {{builders}} and designers, {{more men than women}} build and women find their design ideas and contributions to <b>eco-building</b> are belittled. This article suggests that a focus on bodies, embodiment and the ‘doing’ of building is a potentially productive way to move beyond current gender discrimination. This article makes three key interventions using empirical material from eight case studies of eco-communities in Britain, Thailand, Spain, the USA and Argentina. First, it uses a focus on eco-communities to illustrate the enduring persistence of gender divisions in architecture and building. Second, by using multi-site examples of eco-communities from diverse countries this article finds more commonalities than differences in gender discrimination across cultures and nationalities. Third, it outlines three spaces of opportunity through which more gender-neutral approaches are being developed in eco-building: (1) in challenging the need for ‘strong’ bodies, (2) by practising more embodied ways of building and (3) by making visible women's bodies in building.

He is right, 'the last thing we want is all the <b>eco-buildings</b> to be the same'—writes Keith Hall, Green Building editor. BedZED is a proof that eco-architecture {{is not going to}} be boring. An interesting shape of oval roofs, intimate streets with bridges, intriguing steps leading to the roof houses create a friendly atmosphere.

However, this is the strategic sense of this venture — its proves that eco-architecture can be ordinary or regular and at the same time 'luxurious' and — what's important — it can be densely developed, which is a significant requirement contemporary urban planners need to face. Naturally, more and more eco-architecture appears in the world. The uniqueness of Dunster's project lies in the fact that his project proves eco-construction doesn't have to be an exception, but an economically viable standard, provided we put some effort into it.

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} upon a {{wide range}} of strategies focused on increasing sustainability of urban design beyond and within the scope of individual buildings. By examining the case study of the Australian city of Newcastle, the paper provides a context for a general debate about the urban design of a sustainable city centre, and discusses how urban design is affected (and can be expected to be even more affected in the future) by the new paradigms of ecology. In this context, the author presents the case study of 'SolarCity', which is based on a vision for the revitalisation of Newcastle's city centre. It is an in-progress research and demonstration project, involving Australian and German architects, engineers and industry partners. It deals with cross-cutting issues in architecture and urban design and addresses the question: How to best cohesively integrate all aspects of energy systems, transport systems, waste and water management, climatisation, etc., into contemporary urban design and the environmental performance of <b>eco-buildings?</b> The 'SolarCity' project encapsulates a vision {{based on the belief that}} urban revitalisation can be achieved and facilitated through the use of sustainable urban design principles. Consequently, this paper addresses the fundamentals of urban sustainability, such as orientation to the sun, and general strategies for more compact communities.

40|$|The {{research}} was undertaken {{as part of}} a Knowledge Transfer Partnership, value £ 100 k between Lincoln School of Architecture and Hill Holt Wood, a Social Enterprise. It was initiated to develop a range of innovative “off-grid” autonomous <b>eco-buildings,</b> starting with a Woodland Community Hall to contribute towards the process of educating the UK’s design and construction sectors in sustainable building practices. The design developed in conjunction with architects Simons Design, involved extensive research into material performance properties, use of materials in terms of their availability and buildability and the best combination of sustainable design principles against embodied and process energies. The carbon footprint is minimised by maximising the use of locally resourced materials and the building aspires to achieve the Association of Environmentally Conscious Builders (AECB) gold standard. Due to the originality and innovative nature of the design, additional external funding of £ 257. 5 k (£ 157. 5 k from Waste Resources Environmental Network (WREN) and £ 100 k from Lincolnshire Enterprise) was secured towards the construction of the building. Simons Design won the “Business in the Community East Midlands Region Prohelp Award 2007 ” for their pro bono work through the Prohelp scheme for a number of projects, the most significant of which was the Woodland Community Hall. The practice now uses the design as a case study for incorporation of the innovative ideas and technology in much larger projects, nationally.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{needs of}} a {{building}} owner and occupants change over the building whole life cycle (WLC); consequently, building must be designed to cope with these changes. In <b>eco-building</b> design (EBD) approach a set of strategies are adopted {{in order to enhance}} the compatibility of building to adapt with both its inner and outer systems over its WLC. In EBD application of design strategies and adding value are based on sustainable building design eco-concepts.

The implication of eco-concept application in building design could create building assets which present higher level of reliability based on their compatibility in a system. In addition to providing higher level of health, comfort and efficiency for their users such buildings will last for longer period of time.

This paper proposes an emergy (spelled with an "m") analysis-based methodology for EE evaluation of building manufacturing, where the building space (in cubic size) and the emergy amount of building manufacturing are selected as the indicators of product value and the environmental influence, respectively. Six residential buildings that include multi-storeys, moderate high-rises and high rises are selected averagely from two Chinese famous cities, namely Beijing and Shanghai.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Architecture as {{a process}} of change, {{converts}} a set of in-puts into out-puts. This process creates building through dealing with four aspects of social, economical, environmental and design related issues. In this process technology and conceptual framework are two pivotal factors balancing the aspects needed for the design context equilibrium. Application of technology and specific strategies in design concept as well as prudent selection of materials and energy resources can decrease the rate of environmental impacts. Hence, the process management in general and the out-put management in particular are addressed in design stage. There are many lessons, thoughts and philosophies in precedent works in architecture long term education, which could be engaged in current projects experience. Here, Persian precedents architecture, principles and characteristics are investigated in order to extract some lost values, found in this heritage. Then the paper points out how these values might be used in establishing a scope in sustainable architecture through eco-concepts in <b>eco-building</b> design approach.
