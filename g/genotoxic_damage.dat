5000|$|The {{purpose of}} {{in vitro testing}} is to {{determine}} whether a substrate, product, or environmental factor induces genetic damage. One technique entails cytogenetic assays using different mammalian cells. [...] The types of aberrations detected in cells affected by a genotoxic substance are chromatid and chromosome gaps, chromosome breaks, chromatid deletions, fragmentation, translocation, complex rearrangements, and many more. The clastogenic or aneugenic effects from the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> will cause an increase in frequency of structural or numerical aberrations of the genetic material. [...] This is similar to the micronucleus test and chromosome aberration assay, which detect structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of mucositis can {{be divided}} into its 5 stages; including an initiation phase, a message generation phase, a signaling and amplification phase, an ulceration phase, and a healing phase. Different cytokines are responsible for the various stages. The initiation phase is caused by the production of free radicals caused by the chemo- or radio- therapy, which damages cell DNA. This causes the production of cell transcription factors such as NF-κB, which upregulates inflammatory cytokines, marking the beginning of the ulceration phase. Main inflammatory cytokines involved are IL-1b and TNF-alpha. In addition, bacteria-mediated innate immune signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ambiguously shapes chemotherapy-induced <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> in the gastrointestinal tract. [...] During the restitution phase, epithelial cells migrate and begin re-epithelialization of the ulcers.|$|E
5000|$|Genotoxic effects such as deletions, breaks and/or rearrangements {{can lead}} to cancer if the damage does not {{immediately}} lead to cell death. Regions sensitive to breakage, called fragile sites, may result from genotoxic agents (such as pesticides). Some chemicals {{have the ability to}} induce fragile sites in regions of the chromosome where oncogenes are present, which could lead to carcinogenic effects. In keeping with this finding, occupational exposure to some mixtures of pesticides are positively correlated with increased <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> in the exposed individuals. DNA damage is not uniform in its severity across populations because Individuals vary in their ability to activate or detoxify genotoxic substances, which leads to variability in the incidence of cancer among individuals. The difference in ability to detoxify certain compounds is due to individuals’ inherited polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism of the chemical. Differences may also be attributed to individual variation in efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the toxic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> produced by a helium plasma needle upon HeLa and E. coli (OG 100 and PQ 30) cell cultures. For HeLa cells survival (MTT) and microelectrophoresis comet) assays were performed; meanwhile in E. coli, viable count and genotoxicity by the chromotest were evaluated. The outcomes indicate that the plasma exposures on HeLa cells undergo more toxicity and genotoxicity as treatment time increases. With respect to E. coli, plasma exposure generated toxicity, but no genotoxicity could be detected with this system. In the strain OG 100, defective in a protection mechanism to oxidizing agents, there was a reduction in the survival of one order of magnitude compared to the wild type strain PQ 30. It suggests that such reduction is due to the plasma by means of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) generated during atmospheric air interaction. </p...|$|R
40|$|High level {{activation}} of p 53 -dependent transcription occurs following cellular exposure to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damaging</b> agents such as UV-C, while ionizing radiation damage does not induce a similarly potent induction of p 53 -dependent gene expression. Reasoning {{that one of}} the major differences between UV-C and ionizing radiation damage is that the latter does not inhibit general transcription, we attempted to reconstitute p 53 -dependent gene expression in ionizing irradiated cells by co-treatment with selected transcription inhibitors that alone do not activate p 53. p 53 -dependent transcription can be dramatically enhanced by the treatment of ionizing irradiated cells with low doses of DRB, which on its own does not induce p 53 activity. The mechanism of ionizing radiation-dependent {{activation of}} p 53 -dependent transcription using DRB is more likely due to inhibition of gene transcription rather than prolonged DNA damage, as the non-genotoxic and general transcription inhibitor Roscovitine also synergistically activates p 53 function in ionizing irradiated cells. These results identify two distinct signal transduction pathways that cooperate to fully activate p 53 -dependent gene expression: one responding to lesions induced by ionizing radiation and the second being a kinase pathway that regulates general RNA Polymerase II activity...|$|R

Whether they protect against deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage in individuals exposed to environmental stresses and chemical carcinogens is unknown. In the study, we investigated the association between Hsp 70 levels (the most abundant mammalian Hsp) and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> in lymphocytes of workers exposed to coke-oven emission using Western dot blot and 2 DNA damage assays, the comet assay and the micronucleus test. The data show that there is a significant increase in Hsp 70 levels, DNA damage score, and micronucleus rates in lymphocytes of workers exposed to coke-oven emission as compared with the control subjects. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation of Hsp 70 levels with DNA damage scores in the comet assay (r = − 0. 663, P 0. 05). Our results show that individuals who had high Hsp 70 levels generally showed lower <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> than others.

Animals were divided into the following groups: (i) injected with vehicle; (ii) treated with green tea polyphenols (30 [*]mg/kg) via gavage; (iii) injected with CrO 3 (20 [*]mg/kg) intraperitoneally; (iv) treated with green tea polyphenols in addition to CrO 3. <b>Genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> was evaluated by examining micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCEs) obtained from peripheral blood at 0, 24, 48, and 72 [*]h after treatment. Induction of apoptosis and cell viability were assessed by differential acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining. Treatment of green tea polyphenols led to no significant changes in the MN-PCEs. However, CrO 3 treatment significantly increased MN-PCEs at 24 and 48 [*]h after injection. Green tea polyphenols treatment prior to CrO 3 injection led to a decrease in MN-PCEs compared to the group treated with CrO 3 only. The average of apoptotic cells was increased at 48 [*]h after treatment compared to control mice, suggesting that apoptosis could contribute to eliminate the DNA damaged cells induced by Cr (VI).

This research aimed to evaluate the antimutagenic and antigenotoxic activity of &# 946;-glucan. We set up 8 experimental groups: control (Group 1), cyclophosphamide (Group 2), Groups 3 - 5 to assess the effect of &# 946;-glucan administration, and Groups 6 - 8 to evaluate the association between cyclophosphamide and &# 946;-glucan. The intraperitonial concentrations of &# 946;-glucan used were 100, 150 and 200 mg/kg. Micronucleus and comet assays showed that within the first week of treatment &# 946;-glucan presented a damage reduction rate between 100 - 62. 04 % and 94. 34 - 59. 52 % for mutagenic and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages,</b> respectively.

Therefore, we investigated the MCT-induced cytotoxicity, morphological changes, and oxidative and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> to glial cells, using the human glioblastoma cell line GL- 15 as a model. The comet test showed that 24 h exposure to 1 – 500 μM MCT and 500 μM dehydromonocrotaline (DHMC) caused significant increases in cell DNA damage index, which reached 42 – 64 % and 53 %, respectively. Cells exposed to 100 – 500 μM MCT also featured a contracted cytoplasm presenting thin cellular processes and vimentin destabilisation. Conversely, exposure of GL- 15 cells to low concentrations of MCT (1 – 10 μM) clearly induced megalocytosis. Moreover, MCT also induced down regulation of MAPs, especially at the lower concentrations adopted (1 – 10 μM). Apoptosis was also evidenced in cells treated with 100 – 500 μM MCT, and a later cytotoxicity was only observed after 6 days of exposure to 500 μM MCT. The data obtained provide support for heterogenic and multipotential effects of MCT on GL- 15 cells, either interfering on cell growth and cytoskeletal protein expression, or inducing DNA damage and apoptosis and suggest that the response of glial cells to this alkaloid {{might be related to}} the neurological signs observed after Crotalaria intoxication...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to clarify whether Saccaromyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) {{can be used as}} a model for Mytilus edulis (blue mussel) in {{association}} with investigation of DNA damage. S. cerevisiae was exposed to the herbicide 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) in order to examine this. For the purpose of measuring the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> the Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) method was used, also known as comet assay. The results were compared with results from a similar experiment that was carried out with M. edulis. The method was modified by adding the enzyme glucolase (contains ß-Glucuronidase and ß-Glucuronide Sulfatase) in order to break down the cell wall of S. cerevisiae. This was done because the cell wall prevents the S. cerevisiae DNA from migrating in the electric field during electrophoresis. The experimental results were reviewed with the software Comet assay III by Perspective Instruments. The following units describe the severity of the DNA damage: Tail Moment, Tail Length and Tail Intensity. The results did not show any significant comet tails. It is reasonable to conclude that this was due to glucolase which was not capable of disintegrating the cell wall. That is why damage on the DNA could not be observed as comet tails. A clearly defined clarification, if yeast can serve as a model for the blue mussel, has therefore not been possible...|$|R

Sediments were collected upstream of the city of Milan and downstream at the closure of the drainage basin of the River Lambro. Chemical analyses revealed the presence of a complex mixture of bioavailable endocrine-active chemicals, with higher exposure levels in the downstream section of the tributary. Mainly characterized by brominated flame retardants, alkylphenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, and minor co-occurring personal care products and natural hormones, the sediment contamination induced reproductive disorders, as well as other forms of endocrine disruption and toxicity. In particular, exposed male barbel exhibited higher biliary PAH-like metabolites, overexpression of the cyp 1 a gene, vitellogenin production in all specimens, the presence of oocytes (up to 22 % intersex), degenerative alterations in their testis, liver fat vacuolization, a marked depression of total thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) plasma levels, and <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> determined as hepatic DNA adducts. These results clearly demonstrate that Lambro sediments alone are responsible for recognizable changes in the structure and function of the reproductive and, in general, the endocrine system {{of a native}} fish species. In the real environment, exposure to waterborne and food-web sources of chemicals are responsible for additional toxic loads, and the present findings thus provide evidence for a causal role of this tributary in the severe decline observed in barbel in recent decades and raise concern that the fish community of the River Po is exposed to endocrine-mediated health effects along tens of kilometres of its course...|$|R

We have previously shown that resistance of MSC is associated with an induction of p 53 and proliferation arrest upon <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage.</b> Hypoxia may also contribute to resistance in MSC due to the low oxygen tension in the niche. In this study we characterized the role of p 53 and contribution of hypoxia in resistance of MSC to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage.</b> MSC exhibited increased resistance to cisplatin induced DNA-damage. This resistance {{was associated with a}} temporary G 2 /M cell cycle arrest, induction of p 53 - and p 21 -expression and reduced cyclin B / cdk 1 -levels upon subapoptotic damage. Resistance of MSC to cisplatin was increased at hypoxic conditions i. e. oxygen < 0. 5 %. However, upon hypoxia the cisplatin-induced cell cycle arrest and expression of p 53 and p 21 were abrogated. MSC with shRNA-mediated p 53 knock-down showed a reduced cell cycle arrest and increased cyclin B / cdk 1 expression. However, this functional p 53 knock down did not alter the resistance to cisplatin. In contrast to cisplatin, functional p 53 -knock-down increased the resistance of MSC to etoposide. We conclude that resistance of MSC to <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> is influenced by oxygen tension but is not generally dependent on p 53. Thus, p 53 -dependent and p 53 -independent mechanisms of resistance are likely to contribute to the life-long functional activity of MSC in vivo.

40|$|Introduction: Euphorbia tirucalli Lineu, {{commonly}} known as Aveloz, is a very common plant found in tropical regions [1]. The ingestion or contact with its latex causes symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, pallor, skin irritation, hepatotoxicity as well as carcinogenesis [2]. Moreover, the Aveloz latex is also responsible for a few important activities against some infectious and neoplastic diseases. Aveloz latex phytochemical composition may vary according to seasonal aspects and geographic location [3], and it is used either orally or topically in traditional medicine. Popularly known as an antitumoral agent (breast, prostate, lung, kidney), it is used not only in Brazil, but in several other countries. According to the literature, the latex could have a dual behaviour, activating or inhibiting tumoral events [3 - 6]. However, there are few reports discussing these mechanisms. Besides, the mutagenic and genotoxic potentials of phytochemical and homeopathic Aveloz {{have not yet been}} described. Several experimental methods have been used to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects, such as Inductest, the Ames test and the chromotest. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of Aveloz latex and Aveloz phytotherapic and homeopathic solutions. Methodology: In this study, Aveloz 5 and 30 cH are prepared according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [7], from Aveloz latex collected in the Center for Natural Products Research (NPPN) at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro [8]. The Aveloz phytochemical solution was prepared following the doses used in folk medicine: 2 drops diluted in 250 ml of water and 2 drops diluted in 25 ml of water. All test solutions were submitted to the following methodologies: (a) Inductest: assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a response to DNA damage in lysogenic bacteria; (b) The Ames test: uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, which are sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation; (c) Chromotest: evaluates the genotoxicity of chemicals through the induction of the bacterial SOS system. Results: In the Inductest there was no decrease in bacterial survival fraction and no increase in lysogenic cycle. As measured by The Ames test and the chromotest no mutagenic or genotoxic potentials were detected. Discussion: The homeopathic and the phytochemical Aveloz solutions were unable to produce lysogenic induction or mutagenesis in bacterial cells and they were also unable to produce genotoxic effects, as measured by chromotest. Conclusion: Our results showed that no mutagenic or <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damages</b> were induced by all Aveloz preparations studied, thus we are led to believe that patients using Aveloz as a complementary therapy present no side effects in relation to mutagenesis and genotoxicity...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{impossible}} to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers. [...] In a few cases, only one cause exists; for example, the virus HHV-8 causes all Kaposi's sarcomas. [...] However, {{with the help of}} cancer epidemiology techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations. [...] For example, lung cancer has several causes, including tobacco use and radon gas. [...] Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco, so the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause. [...] These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic.

Similarly, after the second cycle, the same parameters were increased (P< 0. 05) when compared with baseline levels. Increase in catalase activity was detected only after the fourth cycle and reduced glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activity were decreased in all cycles when compared with healthy women, as well as after the second and fourth chemotherapy cycles compared to baseline (P< 0. 05). Patients with breast cancer presented an indicative of oxidative stress before, during, and after chemotherapy, as well as increased <b>genotoxic</b> <b>damage</b> in all stages of treatment, demonstrating the clinical applicability of this investigation...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH) and DNA damage were analyzed in coke oven (n = 37), refractory (n = 96), graphite electrode (n = 26), and converter workers (n = 12), whereas construction workers (n = 48) served as referents. PAH exposure was assessed by personal air sampling during shift and biological monitoring in urine post shift (1 -hydroxypyrene, 1 -OHP and 1 -, 2 + 9 -, 3 -, 4 -hydroxyphenanthrenes, SigmaOHPHE). DNA damage was measured by 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodGuo) and DNA strand breaks in blood post shift. Median 1 -OHP and SigmaOHPHE were highest in converter workers (13. 5 and 37. 2 microg/g crea). The industrial setting contributed to the metabolite concentrations rather than the air-borne concentration alone. Other routes of uptake, probably dermal, influenced associations between air-borne concentrations and levels of PAH metabolites in urine making biomonitoring results preferred parameters to assess exposure to PAH. DNA damage in terms of 8 -oxo-dGuo and DNA strand breaks was higher in exposed workers compared to referents ranking highest for graphite-electrode production. The type of industry contributed to <b>genotoxic</b> DNA <b>damage</b> and DNA damage was not unequivocally associated to PAH on the individual level most likely due to potential contributions of co-exposures...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of factors}} {{contributed to the}} {{development}} of hereditary breast and ovary cancers lead to the discovery of Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA 1). The protein product of this tumor suppressor gene is nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in DNA repair and it is required for genome integrity control. The BRCA 1 protein is the key component for correct assembly of reparation complexes formed in sites of DNA double strand breaks. Furthermore, BRCA 1 protein is implicated in regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and it is also involved in regulation of gene expression in response to DNA damage. These activities suggest that BRCA 1 protein plays a crucial role in orchestration of intracellular response to <b>genotoxic</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> Loss of BRCA 1 functions leads to the DNA-damage repair mechanisms failure resulting in genomic instability and a tolerance of genomic alterations in affected cells. The genomic instability is the initial step toward early malignant transformation of cells lacking BRCA 1 proteins. The aim of this work is to summarize the information about structure, functions known and the importance of BRCA 1 protein with respect to the current discoveries enabling elucidation of versatile BRCA 1 -containing multiprotein complexes in which BRCA 1 protein acts as the multiplatform interacting [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{impossible}} to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers. In a few cases, only one cause exists; for example, the virus HHV-8 causes all Kaposi's sarcomas. However, {{with the help of}} cancer epidemiology techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations. For example, lung cancer has several causes, including tobacco use and radon gas. Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco, so the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause. [...] These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke causes increased exogenous DNA damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. Among the more than 5,000 compounds in tobacco smoke, the <b>genotoxic</b> DNA <b>damaging</b> agents that occur both at the highest concentrations and which have the strongest mutagenic effects are acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.|$|R
