40|$|We find {{clusters}} and superclusters of galaxies using the Data Release 1 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Density fields with smoothing lengthst of 10 and 0. 8 Mpc/h are calculated. We found that galaxies and clusters in a high-density environment have luminosities that are {{five to ten}} times higher than in a low-density environment. Numerical simulations show that in underdense regions most particles form a rarefied population of pregalactic matter whereas in overdense regions most particles form a clustered population in rich clusters. Simulations show also that very massive superclusters are <b>great</b> <b>attractors</b> and have small bulk motions.

40|$|There {{is hardly}} any human society or human {{settlement}} {{system that can}} function efficiently and effectively without adequate, reliable, safe and affordable transport systems management (TSM). The most fundamental reason for this being the catalytic effect of transport development on socio-economic growth and development. Transport can also {{play a significant role}} in territorial administration, political development, the defence of territories as well as in promoting regional cooperation. In Lagos State, there is a complex mix of landuses and all the major broad groupings of person movements in urban areas are made between them. Thus, while trips are made for a variety of purposes they are made to and from various landuses. Within any specified geographical area, certain landuses are <b>greater</b> <b>attractors</b> or generators of trips than others.

40|$|Onset weight {{effects in}} stress/accent systems exhibiting {{variation}} A traditional and often-repeated observation concerning syllable weight {{is that it}} can be determined only by properties of the rime, while onsets are universally ignored (e. g. Hyman 1985, Hayes 1989, Goedemans 1998, Morén 2001). While onset-sensitive weight criteria have received renewed attention in recent years (e. g. Gordon 2005, Topintzi 2010), such cases remain uncommon. This talk presents new evidence for onset-sensitivity in syllable weight through the examination not of categorical weight criteria in deterministic systems, as in most previous work, but of stress and accent systems exhibiting gradient variation. In both English and Russian, for instance, onset size (whether reckoned in terms of complexity or duration) is a significant predictor of stress placement in roots, with longer onsets being <b>greater</b> <b>attractors</b> of stress than shorter ones, even while controlling for potential confounds such as rime structure, word size, position in the word, and part of speech using logistic models. In both English and Russian, this correlation is significant not only in the aggregate, but consistently so across various independent subsets of the lexicon, includin...|$|R

Stronger contribution to touristic development could be ensured by Kopački rit Nature Park as potentially <b>great</b> tourist <b>attractor.</b> Its flora and fauna attract people for educational and tourist reasons. Tourism in nature parks has certain limitations due to primary goals which are protection and preservation of nature together with sustainable management of nature resources and ensuring an undisturbed course of natural processes.

Through application of marketing techniques and especially nonprofit marketing, primary goals related to nature protection can be harmonized with development of self-financing through tourism activities.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the advantages of}} feedforward loops using a Boolean network, {{which is one of}} the discrete dynamical models for transcriptional regulatory networks. After comparing the dynamical behaviors of network embedded feedback and feedforward loops, we found that feedforward loops can provide higher temporal order (coherence) with lower entropy (randomness) in a temporal program of gene expression. In addition, complexity of the state space that increases with longer length of <b>attractors</b> and <b>greater</b> number of <b>attractors</b> is also reduced for networks with more feedforward loops. Feedback loops show opposite effects on dynamics of the networks. These results suggest that feedforward loops are one of the favorable local structures in biomolecular and neuronal networks.

40|$|Kopački rit as {{a nature}} park is a <b>great</b> tourist <b>attractor</b> in northeastern Croatia. Its {{flora and fauna}} used to attract people for {{economic}} reasons, whereas today people mostly visit it for educational and tourism purposes. Visitor loyalty is increasingly important in tourism development today. One-time visitors cannot {{be the basis of}} tourist demand. Such guests often visit a particular destination motivated by global political trends, and not by the need to visit the destination itself. For example, the increased number of guests in Croatia {{in the past few years}} is a result of political events in Greece and North Africa. Once the political situation in their primary choice is stabilised, such guests will be lost. Therefore, among many guests of Kopački rit one must recognise those, for whom it was their primary destination, and establish a relationship with them. To achieve a targeted tourist offer, the Nature Park must implement relationship marketing by means of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). The aim of this research is to explore and define an optimum model of the CRM system that would offer a long-term solution to the problem of customer relationship development with visitors to Kopački rit. The research will be carried out deductively, and the methods used to realize the research aim are to be systematic analysis, causal reasoning, descriptive modelling, and logical experiment. The result is a framework model of a marketing database and a descriptive conceptual model of the CRM system for Kopački rit, both of which will use the potentials of mobile and information and communication technologies.

40|$|Individuals with Parkinson's {{disease and}} the aged have a high {{prevalence}} of falls. Since {{an increase in the}} number of falls is associated with physical and psychological harm, it is prudent that biomechanical metrics be established that will accurately assess an individual's walking balance. In this investigation, we initially used a simple bipedal walking computer model to theoretically establish the relationship between attractor divergence and walking balance. The Lyapunov exponent was used to quantify the amount of divergence present in the walking attractor. Simulations from our model indicated that attractors that have a greater amount of divergence are more susceptible to falls from external perturbations. Based on the results of our simulations, we conducted an initial experiment to explore if the young, aged and individuals with Parkinson's disease have different degrees of attractor divergence. Our results indicate that individuals with Parkinson's disease and aged have walking patterns with a <b>greater</b> amount of <b>attractor</b> divergence. Based on the results of our simulations, we infer that these participants may have a higher probability of losing their balance...|$|R
