40|$|Abstract only. The {{motivation}} {{of this paper}} is to detail the application of Markov chains in simulating fleet dynamics in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). The Markov chains are enhanced through the use of the multinomial logit (MNL) and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) models to explain transition probabilities. The terms MNL Markov and SUR Markov are coined, therefore. The MNL Markov and the SUR Markov are novel, as they describe, capture and forecast time-variant (time-inhomogeneous) and time-invariant (time-homogeneous) fleet dynamics within any defined spatial <b>fishery</b> <b>structure.</b> The models yield reliable forecasts, when applied to data-rich fisheries and have a potential of yielding similar forecasts when customised for use in data-poor fisheries. In the paper, the theoretical structure of the MNL Markov and SUR Markov is shown. Results using data from the NPF are provided, and forecasts of reliability are presented. These forecasts can form the pillar of any fishery management strategy evaluation. The two models are novel, and offer a lot of possibilities for answering marine resource use questions with respect to the allocation of fisheries resources. The models represent a unique, simple, effective and novel approach to fishery management, and particularly for understanding the key drivers of effort allocation in <b>fisheries.</b> The original <b>structure</b> of these models is described in detail in Ngwenya (1997), and in an unpublished PhD thesis (Ngwenya, 2001). The MNL Markov and SUR Markov provide a practical way of integrating multiple fisheries objectives, and using economic drivers of fleet dynamics to manage outcomes of a commercial fishery...|$|R

Bagnara Calabra, in the Costa Viola area, {{plays an important role}} in terms of consistency of <b>fisheries</b> <b>structures</b> and professionals involved, with particular reference to catch swordfish. The aim of this study is the definition of an integrated development plan (idp) for the fishing sector of the area conducted through an interdisciplinary research. The idp, through specific analysis and with the involvement of local stakeholders, identifies possible lines of action in view of public funding sources provided at the regional level, particularly those related to eu Structural Funds. The idp includes different measures and interventions for structures and services, promoting a first integration process of the territorial interests and creating a synergy between public and private actors. The study promotes the development and diversification of the fishery activities in the area, and considers the possibility of establishing a fish production district in the Costa Viola area. Furthermore, the methodology outlines a process of territorial animation and sensibilization that could integrate the analysis already done and facilitate the definition of a broader Local Development Plan for the area carried out by a specific Coastal Action Group (cag), the public/private socio-economic partnerships introduced in the Fourth Axis of the European Fund for Fisheries in order to extend the Leader Initiative in fisheries and coastal management. ...|$|R

Weathervane {{scallops}} (Patinopecten caurinus [Gould, 1850]) off Alaska are commercially {{harvested in}} areas that contain commercially important groundfish and crabs. Using observer bycatch data collected during 1996 - 2012, we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns in community composition on weathervane scallop beds and explored whether observed patterns related to environmental variables (sediment, depth, bottom water temperature, and freshwater discharge) and anthropogenic variables (trawling and dredging effort). Significant (P< 0. 05) differences in community structure were observed at the scale of state fishery registration districts, as well as among individual scallop beds. Spatial differences were most strongly correlated with sediment, depth, and dredging effort. Sequential changes over time were also detected, as was a split between 1996 - 1999 and 2000 - 2012. Temporal changes were weakly yet significantly correlated with freshwater discharge and dredging effort. We also conducted a socioeconomic assessment of the commercial weathervane scallop <b>fishery,</b> <b>structured</b> {{within the framework of}} a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Specifically, we focused on five categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and regulatory. Whereas the data-poor status of the stock appears to be the fishery's biggest weakness, the largest strengths are conservative management, industry self-regulation, and the fishery's small footprint. Impending threats include stock declines, effects of dredging, and changes in the <b>structure</b> of the <b>fishery.</b> These analyses provide a baseline of benthic community composition on weathervane scallop beds, as well as socioeconomic information to contribute to the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of the Alaska scallop fishery...|$|R

This approach compares the numbers of marked and un-marked fish at age captured in each year of sampling with predictions based on estimated vulnerabilities and abundance in a likelihood function.

Structures tend to lock a stream channel in place whereas vegetation allows incremental changes in channel characteristics as flow and sediment loads vary. Healthy riparian vegetation can replace itself in perpetuity, providing a resiliency which keeps banks adjusted to channels — even shifting ones. Improved management of streamside vegetation, not structural additions to channels, offers the most promise for developing valuable and productive riparian systems.

From history view of recreational fisheries development in Chinese cities, the process of the industry has developed from small to large and from disorder to order.

They focused on the overall planning of recreational fisheries as well as constructing management system and standardizing the market of recreational fisheries.

In the near future, urban recreational fisheries will take on an air of prosperity.

Analysis of TED introductions into shrimp trawl fisheries of the United States provided major insights into why conflicts occurred between shrimpers, conservationists, and government agencies. A conflict over the introduction and subsequent regulation of TEDs occurred because the problem and the solution were perceived differently by the various stakeholders. Attempts to negotiate and mediate the conflict broke down, resulting in litigation against the U. S. government by conservationists and shrimpers. Litigation was not an efficient resolution to the sea turtle-TED-trawl conflict but it appears that litigation was the only remaining path of resolution once the issue became polarized.

40|$|Abstract only. Fisheries {{exploitation}} at a {{large scale}} in the South Atlantic is recent. Fisheries have experienced an extraordinary growth in the last 15 years. In Argentina the growth of fisheries exploitation took place at unprecedented rates, {{and this has been}} one of Argentina's most dynamic economic sectors in recent times. It has been categorized as the world's fastest growing fishery. Value added grew steadily and exports, for example, grew nearly 500 percent in a decade. Nevertheless, this growth did not take place with adequate acknowledgment of implicit nor explicit adequate management instruments and resulting in near collapse of some species as well as social conflict. When the costs and benefits are analyzed, it is evident that rapid unmanaged growth in fisheries exploitation in Argentina has ended in a crisis situation and near collapse for some species. Conjunctions of factors, mainly associated to international trade patterns changes and management capacity deficiencies, have brought about this situation.
