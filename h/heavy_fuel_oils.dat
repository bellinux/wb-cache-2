50|$|Water {{continuous}} (oil-in-water) emulsified fuels are {{exemplified by}} the Orimulsion system and bitumen emulsions.

Water continuous emulsions of very heavy crudes, bitumen are easier to pump than the original fuel, which would require considerable heating and / or dilution with a distilled product (kerosene or light crude) in order to make them easy to handle. Water continuous emulsions of residual fuel, <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> etc. which have a calorific value and are used in industrial applications can also be converted to emulsified fuels, thus reducing the need to use cutter fluids and improving the combustion emissions associated with the inferior fuels.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{refinery}} began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a [...] residuum stripper was constructed to convert heavy residual fuel oil into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> to remove sulfur and convert low-value fuel oils into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing [...] daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the plant's gasoline output by 40%. A solvent de-asphalting plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.|$|E
5000|$|Natural gas {{consists}} {{mainly of}} methane and does have climate challenges, ref: Global warming potential. For example, {{there is an}} issue called methane slip. Methane slip is when gas leaks unburned through the engine. Methane has a GWP(20) (20-year global warming potential), which is 86x higher than CO2. If the methane slip is not controlled, environmental benefits to using natural gas are reduced or even more than cancels out the advantages over diesel or bunker fuel due to the high greenhouse effect of the methane. Another challenge is hazards associated with the LNG being stored at very low temperatures. Insulation of the tank is critical, and there’s possibilities of structural brittleness and personnel frostbite injuries. [...] Essentially, since it is established that LNG for ship propulsion reduces CO2 and other pollutants compared to common <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> LNG implementation depends on these key factors: Gas availability, demand for ships, emission limits (emission controlled areas), LNG tank installation, and safety requirements. Challenges related {{to the use of}} LNG should be taken into consideration. Challenges such as the lack of infrastructure in the majority of commercial ports, crew’s limited experience running engines with gas fuels, the future price of gas, and the required safety measures all are critical points to be considered. [...] U.S.-based TOTE, Inc., one of America’s largest shipping companies, announced recently that its two Washington-to-Alaska Orca-class vessels are going to be outfitted with new LNG-capable engines. For companies like TOTE, installation costs of gas propulsion systems are taken into account. It can be estimated that initial investment in these systems cost more than traditional diesel solutions. However, taking into account fuel costs, economic costs, maintenance costs, and installation costs, it is possible to create cost analysis figures for the life span of the ship and an initial investment payback period.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the droplet quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to the measurement of viscosity for industrial oils is reported.

It is also demonstrated that lubricating oils aged in engine tests exhibit an enhanced QCM viscosity response than accepted viscosity measurements would otherwise indicate. The locus at which the viscosity response saturates due to violation of the small loading approximation (extreme viscosities) is identified and found to be qualitatively consistent with established equivalent circuit models. The identification of commercial lubricating oils is observed to be unreliable {{on the basis of}} viscosity response alone...|$|E
