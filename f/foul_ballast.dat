In this study, GPR {{studies were carried out}} on model and actual railway tracks using three ground coupled antennas and considering three fouling materials. Three ground coupled antennas viz., 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 800 MHz antennas were used for the initial survey and {{it was found that the}} 800 MHz ground coupled antenna is an optimum one to get quality results. Three major fouling materials viz., screened/broken ballast, coal and iron ore were used to construct prototype model sections, which were 1 / 2 of the actual Indian broad-gauge railway track. A separate model section has been created for each degree and type of fouling and GPR surveys were carried out. GPR study shows that increasing the fouling content results in a decrease in the Electromagnetic Wave (EMW) velocity and an increase in the dielectric constant. EMW velocity of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouled</b> with screened <b>ballast</b> was found to be more than coal <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> and iron ore <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> at any degree of fouling and EMW velocity of iron ore <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> was found to be less than coal and screen <b>ballast</b> <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> Dielectric constant of iron ore <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> was found to be higher than coal and screen <b>ballast</b> <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> for all degrees of fouling.

40|$|Ballast {{consisting}} of large sized aggregate particles with uniform size distribution {{is an essential}} component of the track substructure, to facilitate load distribution and drainage. As freight tonnage accumulates with traffic, ballast will accumulate an increasing percentage of fines due to either aggregate breakdown or outside contamination such as subgrade soil intrusion and coal dust collection. According to the classical text by Selig and Waters [1], ballast degradation from traffic involves up to 76 % of all fouling cases; voids will be occupied by fines from the bottom of ballast layer gradually causing ballast clogging and losing its drainage ability. When moisture is trapped within <b>ballast,</b> especially <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast,</b> ballast layer stability is compromised. In the recent studies at the University of Illinois, the focus has been to evaluate behavior of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> due to aggregate degradation using large scale triaxial testing.

This paper presents characterization of rail track subsurface to identify <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> and subsurface layers shear wave velocity using seismic survey. Seismic surface wave method of multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) {{has been carried out}} in the model track and field track for finding out shear wave velocity of the clean and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> and track subsurface. The shear wave velocity (SWV) of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> increases with increase in fouling percentage, and reaches a maximum value and then decreases. This character is similar to typical compaction curve of soil, which is used to define optimum and critical fouling percentage (OFP and CFP). Critical fouling percentage of 15 % is noticed for Coal <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> and 25 % is noticed for clayey sand <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> Coal <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> reaches the OFP and CFP before clayey sand <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> <b>Fouling</b> of <b>ballast</b> reduces voids in ballast and there by decreases the drainage. Combined plot of permeability and SWV with percentage of fouling shows that after critical fouling point drainage condition of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> goes below acceptable limit. Shear wave velocities are measured in the selected location in the Wollongong field track by carrying out similar seismic survey. In-situ samples were collected and degrees of fouling were measured. Field SWV values are more than that of the model track SWV values for the same degree of fouling, which might be due to sleeper’s confinement. This article also highlights the ballast gradation widely followed in different countries and presents the comparison of Indian ballast gradation with international gradation standards. Indian ballast contains a coarser particle size when compared to other countries. The upper limit of Indian gradation curve matches with lower limit of ballast gradation curves of America and Australia.

40|$|For {{several hundred}} years, {{the design of}} railway tracks has {{practically}} remained unchanged. Traditionally, rail tracks are placed on a ballast layer due to several reasons, including economy, rapid drainage, and high load bearing capacity. The primary function of ballast is to distributing dynamic track loads to sub-ballast and subgrade layers, while also providing lateral resistance and allowing for rapid drainage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of laboratory investigations into the deformation of coal <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> stabilized with geogrid at various degrees of fouling. A novel track process simulation apparatus was used to simulate realistic rail track conditions subjected to cyclic loading, and the void contamination index (VCI) was used to evaluate the level of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling.</b> The experimental results show that coal fines act as a lubricant, causing grains of ballast to displace and rotate, and as a result, accelerate its deformation. However, coal fines also reduce ballast breakage because of a cushioning effect, that is, by reducing interparticle attrition. The inclusion of geogrid at the interface between the layer of ballast and subballast provides additional internal confinement and particle interlocking via geogrid apertures, which reduces deformation. A threshold value of VCI 540 % is proposed to assist practitioners for conducting track maintenance.

Monotonically loaded and drained triaxial tests were carried out on ballast with levels of clay fouling that varied from 10 to 50 % void contamination index (VCI) subjected to three confining pressures of 10, 30, and 60 kPa. The results showed that an increase in the level of fouling decreased the mobilized friction angle and increased the ballast dilation.

40|$|The {{railway track}} network plays an {{essential}} role of the transportation infrastructure worldwide. During operations, the ballast becomes contaminated or fouled due to the infiltration of fines from the surface, mud pumping up from the subgrade, and ballast degradation under repeated train loading. In Queensland and New South Wales, Australia, ballast degradation and infiltration of fine particles such as coal and soft subgrade fills the voids in the ballast layer, which restricts drainage, and results in uneven track settlement and high maintenance costs to clean the ballast. Geosynthetics have been increasingly used in railroads to provide reinforcement and confinement pressure to the layer of ballast. However, the interaction mechanism and behaviour of the geosynthetics and ballast at their interface are not well understood, particularly when the <b>ballast</b> is severely <b>fouled.</b> This {{is due to the}} steady accumulation of fine particles that clog the apertures of the geosynthetics, which dramatically reduces its beneficial effects and also causes track instability associated with substantial deformation. This research aims to study how the interface between ballast and geogrid copes with fouling by coal fines. The shear stress-displacement behaviour of fresh and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast,</b> and ballast reinforced with geogrids was investigated through a series of large-scale direct shear tests where the levels of fouling ranged from 0 % to 95 % Void Contamination Index (VCI), and at relatively low normal stresses varying from 15 kPa to 75 kPa. The results indicated that inclusion of geogrids increases the shear strength and apparent angle of shearing resistance, while only slightly reducing the vertical displacement of the composite geogrid-ballast system. However, when the <b>ballast</b> was <b>fouled</b> by coal fines, the benefits of geogrid reinforcement decreased in proportion to the increasing level of fouling. A conceptual normalised shear strength model was proposed to predict this decrease in the peak shear stress and peak angle of shearing resistance caused by coal fines at a given normal stress. A novel Track Process Simulation Apparatus (TPSA) was used to simulate realistic rail track conditions subjected to cyclic loading and the Void Contamination Index (VCI) was used to evaluate the level of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling.</b> The inclusion of geogrid at the interface between the layer of ballast and sub-ballast provides additional internal confinement and particle interlocking via the geogrid apertures, which reduces deformation. A threshold value of VCI= 40 % has been proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance. If the level of fouling exceeds this threshold the geogrid reinforcement significantly decreases its effectiveness, and the <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> exhibits pronounced dilation.

40|$|Abstract. Railroad ballast is the uniformly-graded {{aggregate}} {{between and}} underneath railroad ties. The purpose of ballast {{is to provide}} support for the heavy loading applied by trains. New ballast contains significant void space between the aggregate. As ballast ages it is progressively fouled by fine-grained material that fills the void space. The structural integrity of seriously <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> can be compromised leading to track instability and ultimately, train derailments. For this reason {{it is very important}} to be able to detect <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been used over the past 25 years for ballast evaluation and has yielded mixed results. Traditionally, GPR data have been interpreted with strategies focusing on reflections from layer interfaces. This can be a severe handicap when obtaining data on a ballast structure which contains gradational fouling. GSSI developed a 2 GHz horn antenna in 2003 which was initially tested on ballast at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. in Pueblo, CO in 2005 and subsequently on Amtrak Rails near Boston, MA in 2006. It was noted that the antenna is much more focused compared to the commonly used 1 GHz horn antenna and provides data that contain significant scattering energy from the void space in clean ballast. The data from <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> contained minimal scattering from the remaining void space. Comparison of the data obtained using the 2 GHz antenna with available ground truth supports this interpretation. This GPR methodology shows potential for routine inspection of working railroads and is especially suited to assess the <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> condition near the bottom of railroad ties...|$|R

However, the ballast becomes contaminated due to intrusion of pumped subgrade material (e. g. clay and silt). This {{is one of the}} primary reasons for rapid track deterioration. In severe circumstances, <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> needs to be cleaned or replaced to maintain the desired track resiliency, load bearing capacity and the track alignment, all of which influence the level of safety. In Australia, massive amount of funds have been invested in track maintenance. By employing an effective maintenance program, both cost and the ballast quarrying can be reduced with significant favourable environmental implications and improved productivity. In order to identify the risk associated with fouling, it is important to accurately assess the amount of fouling. In this paper, the current methods commonly used for evaluating the degree of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> were critically examined and a new parameter, Void Contaminant Index (VCI) was proposed to capture the role of different fouling materials in terms of volume based air-voids reduction.

Ballast layer is designed as a load bearing layer for rail tracks and to be free draining, but when the ballast voids are wholly or partially impeded due to the intrusion of fine particles, the ballast can be considered to be fouled. Fouling causes a reduction in the drainage capacity of ballast, thereby reducing the track resiliency and triggering high maintenance costs. Geosynthetics are commonly used in railway construction for reinforcement and stabilization purposes. When railway <b>ballast</b> becomes <b>fouled</b> the beneficial effect of the geosynthetics could decrease significantly.

40|$|<b>Ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> {{is created}} by the {{breakdown}} of aggregates or outside contamination by coal dust from coal trains, or from soil intrusion beneath rail track. Due to <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling,</b> the conditions of rail track can be deteriorated considerably {{depending on the type}} of fouling material and the degree of fouling. So far there is no comprehensive guideline available to identify the critical degree of fouling for different types of fouling materials. This paper presents the identification of degree of fouling and types of fouling using non-destructive testing, namely seismic surface-wave and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. To understand this, a model rail track with different degree of fouling has been constructed in Civil engineering laboratory, University of Wollongong, Australia. Shear wave velocity obtained from seismic survey has been employed to identify the degree of fouling and types of fouling material. It is found that shear wave velocity of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> increases initially, reaches optimum fouling point (OFP), and decreases when the fouling increases. The degree of fouling corresponding after which the shear wave velocity of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> will be smaller than that of clean ballast is called the critical fouling point (CFP). Ground penetrating radar with four different ground coupled antennas (500 MHz, 800 MHz, 1. 6 GHz and 2. 3 GHz) was also used to identify the <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> condition. It is found that the 800 MHz ground coupled antenna gives a better signal in assessing the <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> condition. Seismic survey is relatively slow when compared to GPR survey however it gives quantifiable results. In contrast, GPR survey is faster and better in estimating the depth of fouling.

40|$|Repeated train loads produce {{settlements}} in railway tracks, particularly in ballasted trail tracks. When the settlement reaches the allowable limit, a maintenance method {{should be applied}} to bring the railway tracks into the original position. Settlements in railway tracks are hugely influenced by degree of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> (i. e., a <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> index) in addition to train loads themselves (i. e., from large number of train passes). Sources of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> vary from <b>ballast</b> layer itself to underneath layers. Fouling materials coming from underneath layers {{is also an important}} source of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> in addition to particle crushing. Tamping method, stoneblowing and cleaning/replacement are the maintenance methods in practice currently. While replacement method is rarely applied due to huge costs and interruption to regular traffic, tamping method is applied throughout the world. However, tamping application induces particle crushing due to tamping tools in addition to loosening of top ballasts (i. e., thereby reducing original compaction level). Effect of tamping method on settlement characteristics haven’t been studied before. In this research, effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> were studied conducting scaleddown model tests. <b>Fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> was simulated by gap-graded gradation curves with gravel (i. e., 1 / 5 size of actual ballast) and medium sand (D 50 = 1. 54 mm). In model tests, 100 loading cycles (no. of loading cycles were limited to 100 as this is a manual-controlled process) were applied to simulate cyclic behaviour with the designed vertical stress. After 100 loading cycles were applied, tamping method was simulated as in field conditions using a simple tool. After tamping application, again 100 loading cycles were applied with the same vertical stress. Continuous images were captured during each loading cycle to obtain strain distribution in ballast layer. The results revealed that settlement characteristics are influenced by degree of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouling</b> in addition to tamping application. As anticipated, the results suggested that settlement reduce after tamping application, mainly due to densification of specimen from previous 100 loading cycles. The results further revealed that the largest reduction in settlement occurs at 30 - 50 % of fouling index (FIP,m). Relationship of settlement ? no. of loading cycles was fitted as two processes; initial and residual settlement processes. The results suggested that initial settlement rate (?) becomes smaller after tamping application beyond 15 % of FIP,m. The results also suggested that residual settlement rate increases after taming application beyond 30 % of FIP,m. If results are interpreted in terms of practical application, {{it can be said that}} tamping application is effective only up to 30 % of FIP,m (which is equal to percentage of fouling materials for gadgraded sand-gravel specimens tested in this research). More detailed analysis on effects of tamping application on settlement characteristics were studied using strain distribution evaluated using the images captured during loading cycles in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) software (i. e., Flow-PIV). The PIV results confirmed that tamping application loosens top ballasts, particularly, at the sides of sleeper, where tamping tools are inserted. In next step, void ratio characteristics of sand-gravel specimens (simulating <b>fouled</b> <b>ballasts)</b> were evaluated in YADE (a DEM approach). In YADE, a method was proposed to produce gap-graded gradation curves. Verification of YADE simulations were done by the results of laboratory density tests. The comparison of results showed differences in void ratios (i. e., maximum and minimum void ratios). As laboratory materials consist of irregular particles and DEM simulations were conducted with spheres, the difference in void ratios is assumed to be due to different shapes of particles. Therefore, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced using the results of image analysis (i. e., in ImageJ) on shape characteristics of medium sand and gravel particles. Introduction of clump particles led to have similar results as those of laboratory void ratio characteristics. The results further revealed that variation of void ratios with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics with some accuracy. In next analysis, strength and deformation characteristics of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> were studied from triaxial compression tests. Triaxial compression tests were conducted in two series; dense and loose specimens simulated by 80 and 50 % of relative density, Dr respectively. The results from laboratory tests suggested that strength properties, represented by peak deviator stress, qf, and failure friction angle, ??f, change with FIP,m with some similarities with variation of ??with FIP,m. In next part, triaxial compression tests were conducted in DEM simulations with spheres. However, as comparison of DEM results with those of laboratory tests is influenced by particle shape, in next analysis, a clump particle was introduced in DEM simulations. The results suggested that clump shape can simulate stressstrain behaviours same as laboratory triaxial compression tests. As different gradation curves can be simulated in YADE simulations, the method used can be extended to different type of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballasts</b> through different gradation curves. Also, it is also clear that variation of qf and ?f with FIP,m can be used to interpret settlement characteristics (particularly, variation of ??) of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballasts</b> with FIP,m with some accuracy. In a simultaneous work, an in-situ method was proposed to evaluate particle size distribution of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> using image analysis techniques. ImageJ software was used to conduct image analysis. Particles (i. e., both gravel and medium sand) were simulated by different shapes in ImageJ and found the best available shape as ellipse shape to simulate laboratory particles. Gradation curves were evaluated as area-, number of particle- and volume-based gradation curves. Area-based gradation curve was possible to produce the gradation curve evaluated by sieve analysis test with some image analysis techniques. However, number of particles-based gradation curve underestimates that of sieve analysis. However, given both area- and number of particle-based gradation curves are not based on volume of particles (which is the case with sieve analysis test), a method was proposed to evaluate thickness of particles using 2 D images (hence, evaluation of volume of particle is possible). It was also discussed how definition of grain size should be used in image analysis results to compare with those of sieve analysis test. Finally, a simple method was proposed to evaluate volume-based gradation curve of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> using 2 D images using a size correction factor on grain size...|$|R

The geogrid was modelled by bonding {{a large number of}} small spheres together to form the desired grid geometry and apertures. <b>Fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> with 40 % Void Contaminant Index (VCI) was modelled by injecting a predetermined number of miniature spheres into the voids of fresh ballast. A series of direct shear tests for fresh and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> reinforced by the geogrid subjected to normal shear stresses varying from 15 kPa to 75 kPa were then simulated in the DEM. The numerical results showed a good agreement the laboratory data, indicating that the DEM model is able to capture the behaviour of both fresh and coal-fouled ballast reinforced by the geogrid. The advantages of the proposed DEM model in terms of capturing the correct stress-displacement and volumetric behaviour of ballast, as well as the contact forces and strains developed in the geogrids are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Instability of low-lying {{saturated}} subgrade soil contributes to 2 ̆ 7 clay-pumping 2 ̆ 7 {{that is responsible}} for contaminating the overlying track materials. The clay pumping occurs under the action of cyclic loading (train loading) due to the build-up of excess pore water pressure. The work contained in the paper is focused on monotonic loading response of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> and is a crucial first step towards a more complete analysis of the clay pumping effect. In this paper, a bounding surface plasticity model is presented for clay-fouled ballast within the framework of critical state soil mechanics, adopting isotropic hardening and a non-associated flow rule. The role of the constitutive parameters and their dependence on various levels of fouling is discussed. The size and shape of the bounding surface is influenced by the extent of fouling. The model is calibrated against the results of consolidated drained triaxial tests conducted using a large scale cylindrical apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong. The model was successfully validated against triaxial testing on <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> for an array of confining pressures, and the model predictions were found to be in good agreement with the laboratory data...|$|R
40|$|Geogrids {{are widely}} used in {{ballasted}} rail tracks for reinforcement and stabilisation. During train operation, ballast becomes contaminated or fouled due to infiltration of fines from the surface, mud pumping from the subgrade, and degradation, which decreases {{the performance of the}} geogrids. This paper presents the results of a laboratory and numerical simulation to study the effect that coal fines have on the interface between ballast and geogrid. The stress-strain behaviour of fresh and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> reinforced by geogrid was investigated via a series of large scale direct shear tests in the laboratory and numerical simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The geogrid was modelled by bonding a large number of small spheres together to form the desired geometry and apertures. Irregular particle shapes were simulated in DEM by connecting many spheres together in appropriate sizes and positions. <b>Fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> was modelled by adding a predetermined amount of miniature spheres into the voids of the fresh ballast. The DEM results were then compared qualitatively with the laboratory data, and the effects of fines on the resulting shear stress-strain of ballast and the contact forces developed in the geogrids are discussed...|$|R

The light penetrometer test is able to give information about a cone resistance useful {{in the field of}} geotechnics and recently validated as a parameter for the case of coarse granular materials. In order to characterize directly the railway ballast on track and sublayers of ballast, a huge test campaign has been carried out for more than 5 years in order to build up a database composed of 19, 000 penetration tests including endoscopic video record on the French railway network. The main objective of this work is to give a first statistical analysis of cone resistance in the coarse granular layer which represents a major component of railway track: the ballast. The results show that the cone resistance (qd) increases with depth and presents strong variations corresponding to layers of different natures identified using the endoscopic records. In the first zone corresponding to the top 30 cm, (qd) increases linearly with a slope of around 1 MPa/cm for fresh <b>ballast</b> and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> In the second zone below 30 cm deep, (qd) increases more slowly with a slope of around 0, 3 MPa/cm and decreases below 50 cm. These results show that there is no clear difference between fresh and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> Hence, the (qd) sensitivity is important and increases with depth. The (qd) distribution for a set of tests does not follow a normal distribution. In the upper 30 cm layer of ballast of track, data statistical treatment shows that train load and speed do not have any significant impact on the (qd) distribution for clean ballast; they increase by 50 % the average value of (qd) for <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> and increase the thickness as well. Below the 30 cm upper layer, train load and speed have a clear impact on the (qd) distribution...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the track}} {{substructure}} of ancient railways in France, a <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> layer {{has often been}} created with time. The mechanical behaviour of this coarse soil was studied in the laboratory using a large-scale triaxial cell. The soil taken from the <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> layer of an ancient railway was re-compacted to a dry density of 2. 01 Mg/m 3 at three water contents (4, 6, and 12 %) corresponding to three values of the initial degree of saturation (32, 48, and 100 % respectively).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of coal-fouled ballast reinforced with geogrid, at various degrees of fouling and subjected to cyclic loading. A novel Track Process Simulation Testing Apparatus was used to realistically simulate fouled rail track conditions. The laboratory results demonstrated that coal fines acted as a lubricant, causing ballast aggregates to displace and rotate and, as a result, increase the deformation of ballast. However, coal fines also reduced ballast breakage somewhat because they fill the voids between the ballast particles and coat surface of ballast aggregates which reduce the inter-particle attrition. The placement of a geogrid at the interface between the ballast and sub-ballast layers provides extra internal confinement and interlocks the grains of ballast in its apertures, which also reduces ballast deformation. Based on laboratory results, a threshold value of VCI= 40 % is proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance as fouling beyond this threshold significantly reduces the reinforcement effect of geogrid so that <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> experiences premature dilation leading to track instability. A novel equation incorporating the Void Contaminant Index and number of load cycles is also introduced to predict the deformation of <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast,</b> improve the design of rail tracks and help make the correct decisions with regards to track maintenance...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a first time attempt has beenmade tomeasure the lowstrain shearmodulus of clean and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> using a seismic survey ofMulti-channel Analysis of SurfaceWave (MASW). Amodel rail track was built with nine sub-sections, each having {{different}} fouling characteristics.

The shearmodulus of <b>ballast</b> <b>fouled</b> by pulverized rock, clayey sand and coal was calculated by using shear wave velocities and densities of each section and presented. The optimum and critical fouling points are defined considering the shear stiffness and drainage criteria for <b>ballast</b> <b>fouled</b> by clayey sand and coal. In both cases the shear stiffness increased to amaximumand then decreased as the percentage of fouling increased. The degree of fouling corresponding to themaximumshearwave velocity is defined as the optimum fouling point. After a particular degree of fouling the shear stiffness decreased less than clean ballast and the corresponding drainage condition become unacceptable. This point is defined as the critical fouling point. The results obtained from the model track were compared with the field data...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{analysis}} of downhole acceleration data {{is used to}} identify changes in elastic properties of track substructure. The spectral analysis {{is based on the}} power spectral density (PSD) as an indicator of frequency content. This method was developed and tested at the Transportation Technology Center, Inc., in Pueblo, Colorado. The system provides an efficient means for monitoring track bed to predict settlement and deformation conditions that would require maintenance. The method relies on a triaxial piezoelectric accelerometer inserted into a permanently installed inclinometer casing installed into the subgrade. Periodic measurement of the dynamic ground response allows for the identification of changes in the small strain elastic properties of the substructure layers. The methodology uses conventional downhole seismic shear wave velocity testing. For the purpose of comparison, test sections were constructed with clean and <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> Shear wave velocities indicated the differences in material properties. PSDs of the signals were analyzed to determine variation resulting from differences in soil conditions. PSDs were calculated at different intervals of loading. With increased loading, settlement of the subtrack soils occurs. The densification can be seen as an increase in the predominant frequency of the PSD. The PSD from the section with the clean ballast had a higher predominant frequency than the PSD from the section with the <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast.</b> A decrease in predominant frequency over time would indicate the decrease in stiffness and the potential of increased <b>fouling</b> of the <b>ballast</b> with fines.

40|$|The United State Federal Railway Administration (FRA, 2010) {{estimates}} that the demand for rail freight transportation (tonnage) will increase 88 % by 2035. North American railroads spend about $ 3. 4 billion every year on track substructure maintenance and renewal due to track-component degradation (Li et al. 2004). These increases in traffic density and weight will cause more deformation and, consequently, more maintenance of the ballast layer. An alternative method in order to decrease maintenance cost is desirable. One such method is injection of polyurethane resin at critical locations in the ballast. This method is effective on clean ballast as a preventive measure (Keene at al. 2012). This study is aimed at evaluating its effectiveness in remediating <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> through polyurethane injection clean ballast was mixed with various types of fouling at different amounts, water contents, and sealed in rectangular (76 mm x 76 mm x 290 mm) and cylindrical (254 mm x 508 mm) molds. The polyurethane was injected into the molds and the specimens were cure for 24 hours. Testing protocol was developed to quantify plastic deformation, flexural strength, and unconfined compressive strength of the <b>fouling</b> <b>ballast</b> stabilized by polyurethane. Average flexural strength of PSB (938 kPa) is about 35 % greater than the average flexural strength of PSFB (611 kPa). The average UCS strength of the PSB specimens (3200 kPa) is {{greater than that of}} the PSFB specimens (2713 kPa). However, PSFB has a greater strength (about 74 %) than unstabilized clean ballast. The PSFB cylindrical specimen with different FI and WC under cyclic loading with deviator stress, ?d of 350 kPa, the plastic strains vary between 0. 9 % - 1. 02 %, which are under the FRA limit for maintenance (2. 5 % - 3 %) (Hesse, 2013, Keene et al. 2012). The results show that the injection of polyurethane into <b>fouled</b> <b>ballast</b> significantly reduces plastic strain and increases strength. Increasing amounts of fouling material and water content reduces strength and increases plastic strain. Results of this study are then compared with a previous study on clean ballast injected with polyurethane.
