40|$|The lack of {{consensus}} on the denotation of "rural " in educational and social work research makes generalizability of findings problematic. This paper reviews definitional problems related to occupational, sociocultural, ecological and multi-dimensional conceptions of rurality. Multi-dimensional typologies developed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture's <b>Economic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> and the Maine State Planning Office are described and recommended. From a sociological perspective, an overview of recent-ly published research on education in rural areas suggests {{the need for more}} precise conceptualization of what is meant by "rural. " The articles published in the inaugural issue of Research in Rural Education reflect several dif-ferent uses of the concept. Mathews and Winkle (19] and Holder [13] use the term in an undefined general sense.

40|$|The {{rapid rise}} in the {{incidence}} of obesity has {{emerged as one of the}} most pressing global public health issues in recent years. The underlying etiological causes of obesity, whether behavioral, environmental, genetic, or a combination of several of them, have not been completely elucidated. The obesity epidemic has been attributed to the ready availability, abundance, and overconsumption of high-energy content food. We determined here by Pearson’s correlation the relationship between food type consumption and rising obesity using the loss-adjusted food availability data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) <b>Economic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> (ERS) as well as the obesity prevalence data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our analysis showed that total calorie intake and consumption of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) did not correlate with rising obesity trends. Intake of other major food types, including chicken, dairy fats, salad and cooking oils, and cheese also did not correlate with obesity trends. However, our results surprisingly revealed that consumption of corn products correlated with rising obesity and was independent of gender and race/ethnicity among population dynamics in the U. S. Therefore, we were able to demonstrate a novel link between the consumption of corn products and rising obesity trends that has not been previously attributed to the obesity epidemic. This correlation coincides with the introduction of bioengineered corns into the human food chain, thus raising a new hypothesis that should be tested in molecular and animal models of obesity...|$|E
40|$|This study links three {{streams of}} {{literature}} {{to explore the}} relationship between county-level European ancestry, civic structure and health outcomes. Research has shown that areas with high civic structure have better health outcomes compared to those areas low in civic structure. Studies {{also point out that}} some communities with higher population densities of certain ancestries have more civic structure than others. Researchers have also found some evidence that ethnic density is related to better mental or physical health. These mechanisms are tested on structural measures, such as county-level civic structure and ancestry (not race or ethnicity) to determine if they are associated with self-reported good health, obesity and diabetes diagnoses. Data was extracted from several publically available sources such as the U. S. Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2 ̆ 7 s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the University of Wisconsin 2 ̆ 7 s County Health Rankings, Rupasingha and Goetz index, and the <b>Economic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> 2 ̆ 7 Environmental Food Atlas. The data were compared across two different periods in time; early and late 2000 s. This study finds that counties high in civic structure have higher self-reported good health, but it does not consistently show lower obesity and diabetes diagnoses. Further, civic structure added very little or in some cases no explained variance to the models. Norwegian and German ancestries were associated with higher civic structure, but they were not consistently related to better health outcomes. Ethnic density is associated with better health outcomes, but the results are not consistent. Further work should investigate the cultural activities of ancestries, such as food, holidays or celebrations and its potentially related health implications...|$|E

40|$|M. B. A. The {{debate over}} plant {{biotechnology}} and genetic engineering (GE) is surrounded with controversy. On {{the one side}} of the debate, phrases such as `Frankenfood' and `terminator seed' have been used to describe food and seed resulting from plant biotechnology. On the other hand, Agricultural Scientists see biotechnology and genetic engineering as a solution to keep feeding and clothing the increasing world population with static or reducing world resources. Many farmers in developing countries eke out a living based on the production techniques that are becoming increasingly unaffordable because of increasing inputs cost and are no longer producing enough output to provide adequate access to food. Plant biotechnology holds the potential for increasing the productivity of agriculture in developing countries. New crop varieties are developed which are resistant to insects and are tolerant to certain non-selective herbicides. All these plant biotechnology developments are said to help reduce the cost of inputs, protects yields and reduce environmental contamination with toxic insect sprays. For many commercial farmers, cotton production is the only possibility they have to produce a cash crop but spraying to control insect pests is required several times during the season resulting in high input costs. An alternative to spraying is to introduce a built-in defense into the plant itself to combat insect damage. The introduction of the insecticidal gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into the cotton plant trough biotechnology, has secured a built-in defense against the most common insect family in cotton namely the lepidopteran caterpillar. Cotton engineered with such genes was introduced into commercial production {{for the first time in}} 1996 with over 1. 8 million acres planted with transgenic cotton in the US. Following early trials, Bt-cotton has since the 1998 / 99 growing season been commercialized in South Africa. Since the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) crops, US farmers have rapidly adopted most of them. Analyses by USDA's <b>Economic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Services</b> (ERS) and others indicate economic benefits to many farmers adopting first-generation GE crops. This research study was carried out to determine to what extend the South African cotton growers embraced this kind of technology through usage thereof and if they benefited as much as other cotton farmers world-wide. The specific research objectives for this study were as follows: An evaluation of the adoption rates and benefits derived from plant biotechnology on a worldwide base through literature. An evaluation of the acceptance and penetration of Bt-cotton amongst the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine the benefits of Bt-cotton to the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine to what extend the South African cotton growers benefited economically through the use of the Bt-cotton trait. To identify segmental differences in the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait amongst commercial cotton growers in South Africa. The main findings of this research indicate that almost three quarters of the cotton hectares surveyed were planted with the Bt-cotton trait and that almost ninety percent of cotton growers surveyed, adopted the Bt-cotton trait in the 2001 / 2002 season. Comparing the benefits derived from Bt-cotton in South Africa to those in other countries, it can be concluded that the South African commercial cotton growers had equal results. Most of the cotton growers in South Africa experienced yield increases with a substantial reduction in the use of insecticides. This resulted in higher gross margins from Bt-cotton compared to the non-Bt cotton or commercial cotton varieties. The South African commercial cotton grower has benefited agronomically, economically and environmentally through the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait. Future introductions of plant biotechnology traits such as herbicide tolerance will further enhance the production potential of cotton...|$|E
