Referees are given considerable latitude {{in determining what}} exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants. Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a <b>face-shield.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the incidence of accidental exposures to blood and body fluids among surgeons during operations and to describe their dynamics. A probabilistic model was also used to predict the cumulative 30 -year risk to the surgeon of contracting hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and estimate the effect of preventive strategies in reducing this risk A multicentric prospective survey, based on self-administered questionnaires, was conducted during a period of 6 months in 39 Italian hospitals. An accidental exposure to blood or body fluids occurred in 9. 2 % of 15, 375 operations. In about 2 % of procedures a parenteral-type injury, such as actual skin puncture or eye contamination, was suffered by the operating surgeon. A needle-stick injury was the commonest accident, and its occurrence was found to vary with the phase of the procedure and its length. The current lifetime risk of acquiring HBV, HCV, and HIV infection in our regions was estimated to be as high as 42. 7 %, 34. 8 %, and 0. 54 %, respectively. The adoption of preventive strategies is expected to reduce this risk to 21 % for HBV, 16. 6 % for HCV, and 0. 23 % for HIV infection. Active immunization of surgeons against HBV is strongly recommended. The case is also made far the use of a <b>face-shield</b> combined with a permanent change in our surgical practice capable of reducing the current high rate of parenteral injuries...|$|E
