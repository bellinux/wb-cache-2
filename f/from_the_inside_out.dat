25|$|The main predators {{of fishing}} spiders are birds and snakes. Dragonflies {{have also been}} {{observed}} catching young spiders. Species parasitic on the spiders include a wasp of the Pompilidae family that stings the spider to paralyse it before carrying it off and laying an egg in its abdomen. The larvae of the wasp hatch and proceed to eat the spider <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> One escape technique the spiders use is to disappear beneath the surface tension of the water. However, some wasps counter the disappearing trick by going into the water to sting the spider and drag {{it out of the}} water.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very quickly. If the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out.</b> Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E

Construction started in the early 2000s, and progressed at an incredible pace. The new terminal was literally constructed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> <b>out,</b> with the old terminal slowly being chipped away and replaced by new sections of the new terminal. The new terminal complex was finally opened on Monday, the 16th of January 2006 by the Chief Minister of Sarawak Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud and the then Malaysian Minister of Transport Dato' Sri Chan Kong Choy. The full work on the terminal, however, was only completed in April 2006. The new terminal consists of 12 aircraft parking bays (5 bays for widebody aircraft such as Airbus A330, Airbus A350, Airbus A380-800, Boeing 747 and Boeing 777), 4 remote parking bays (for turboprop aircraft such as Fokker 50, DHC-6-300/400 Twin Otter and ATR 72-500/600), plus 3 new aircraft parking bays located at the general aviation section.|$|E

5000|$|... 9. Slide {{resistance}} balance - A piston {{slides in}} a cylinder with friction. A ball {{in a ball}} bearing also slides as the diameter of inner and outer races are different and the distance of circumference differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>inside</b> and <b>out.</b> When a ball bearing is used as the main bearing on a crankshaft (which rarely is the case), eccentricity of the cage (race) normally creates a phase imbalance in slide friction. Friction forces for plain/shell bearings (the {{most common type of}} bearings) are dependent upon diameter and width, which determine bearing surface area. This needs to be balanced for the pressure and the rotational speed of the load. Different main bearing sizes on a crankshaft create plane imbalance in slide friction.|$|R
