60|$|But to {{show how}} far the wicked spirit of envy, malice and resentment can hurry some men, my nameless old persecutor had {{provided}} me a monument at the stone-cutter's and would have erected it in the parish-church; and this piece of notorious and expensive villany had actually succeeded, had <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> my utmost interest with the vestry, where it was carried at last but by two voices, that I am still alive. That stratagem failing, out comes a long sable elegy, bedeck'd with hour-glasses, mattocks, sculls, spades, and skeletons, with an epitaph as confidently written to abuse me, and my profession, as if I had been under ground these twenty years.|$|E

Had <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> the p-word, they might KavelouncnFea^ier to attend to my argument rather than to lob broadsides at positivism, a philosophical view that has long been interred, and one I have no interest in resurrecting. Let me immediately say that I used the term left-uring simply to identify a stance, not to disparage it. The fact is that a number of scholars criticize "positivist research " for what they claim is its implicit political stance. I'm not sure how to label these critics; I'd welcome suggestions. 1 My apologies to anyone who found the term offensive. To all three critics, let me also say that my article is not a brief for ineJh^doJo^cjl_m^nism. I concur with the...|$|E

40|$|Each {{template}} {{for the full}} situations specified a sequence of six sentences: three primary sentences (P i) also used in the related core situation, and three secondary sentences (S <b>i)</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the core situation that provided additional relevant detail. The two sentences in each core situation were created by using P 1 as the first sentence and a conjunction of P 2 A and P 2 C as the second sentence (see Table 1 for examples). For the physical situations, the template specified the following six sentences in order: P 1 described a setting and activity performed by the immersed participant in the setting, along with relevant personal attributes; S 1 provided visual detail about the setting; P 2 A described an action (A) of the immersed participant; P 2 C described the consequence (C) of that action; S 2 described the participant’s action {{in response to the}} consequence; S 3 described the participant’s resulting external somatosensory experience (on the body surface). The templates for the social situations were similar, except that S 1 provided auditory detail about the setting (instead of visual detail), S 2 described another person’s action in response to the consequence (not action by the immersed participant), and S 3 described the participant’s resulting internal bodily experience (not on the body surface). Different secondary sentences were used for the physical and social threat situations to assess issues addressed in another paper on activations during the situations. A broad range of real-world situations served as the content of the experimental situations. The physical situations were drawn from situations that involved vehicles, pedestrians, water, eating, wildlife, fire, power tools, and theft. The social situations were drawn from situations that involve...|$|E
