5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's <b>draft</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases {{from both of}} these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
