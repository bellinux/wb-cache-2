5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the <b>fingertip</b> and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{clues to}} the {{function}} of the cerebellum have come from examining the consequences of damage to it. Animals and humans with cerebellar dysfunction show, above all, problems with motor control, {{on the same side of}} the body as the damaged part of the cerebellum. They continue to be able to generate motor activity but lose precision, producing erratic, uncoordinated, or incorrectly timed movements. A standard test of cerebellar function is to reach with the tip of the finger for a target at arm's length: A healthy person will move the <b>fingertip</b> in a rapid straight trajectory, whereas a person with cerebellar damage will reach slowly and erratically, with many mid-course corrections. Deficits in non-motor functions are more difficult to detect. Thus, the general conclusion reached decades ago is that the basic function of the cerebellum is to calibrate the detailed form of a movement, not to initiate movements or to decide which movements to execute.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fingertips</b> {{of human}} hand play an {{important}} role in hand-based interaction with computers. Therefore, identification of <b>fingertips</b> 2 ̆ 7 positions on hand image is vital for developing a human computer interaction system. All most all of the research works for <b>fingertips</b> detection, initially isolate hand image from the background image. Most of these techniques develop color based segmentation methods because human skin color possess an exceptional characterises that can be used to isolate hand from the rest of the image quite easily. Sometimes color image segmentation becomes difficult due to illumination and background variations. To make it simple and reliable, this paper proposes a robust method for detecting <b>fingertips</b> of a hand image based on the combination of color segmentation and circle detection. Due to the characteristics of circularity of <b>fingertips</b> regions of hand boundary, any existing circle detection algorithms can be applied to detect circles at <b>fingertips</b> region. It is difficult to detect <b>fingertips</b> solely based on the circle detection method. For this reason, initially the proposed method detects all the circular regions on the image applying Circle Hough Transformation (CHT) then the <b>fingertips</b> are selected based on the color characteristics of the <b>fingertips</b> regions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising...|$|R

Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to <b>fingertip</b> contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Hand gesture {{recognition}} {{is an important}} area {{of research in the}} field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The geometric attributes of the hand {{play an important role in}} hand shape reconstruction and gesture recognition. That said, <b>fingertips</b> are one of the important attributes for the detection of hand gestures and can provide valuable information from hand images. Many methods are available in scientific literature for <b>fingertips</b> detection with an open hand but very poor results are available for <b>fingertips</b> detection when the hand is closed. This paper presents a new method for the detection of <b>fingertips</b> in a closed hand using the corner detection method and an advanced edge detection algorithm. It is important to note that the skin color segmentation methodology did not work for <b>fingertips</b> detection in a closed hand. Thus the proposed method applied Gabor filter techniques for the detection of edges and then applied the corner detection algorithm for the detection of <b>fingertips</b> through the edges. To check the accuracy of the method, this method was tested on a vast number of images taken with a webcam. The method resulted in a higher accuracy rate of detections from the images. The method was further implemented on video for testing its validity on real time image capturing. These closed hand <b>fingertips</b> detection would help in controlling an electro-mechanical robotic hand via hand gesture in a natural way...|$|R
