25|$|Silicones may be {{considered}} analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the isoelectronic O− of the silicates. They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant {{over long periods of}} time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally can be even used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me3Si)2O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of molybdenum and tungsten oxyhalides, converting a tungsten hexachloride suspension in <b>dichloroethane</b> solution quantitatively to WOCl4 in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO2Cl2 at 100°C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.|$|E

The trans and gauche conformations are about equally favored at room temperature in solvents of low dielectric constant while the equilibrium is essentially the statistical proportions of one-third trans and two-thirds gauche in water with a high dielectric constant. The coupling assignments were confirmed with the aid of stereospecific deuterium-labeled (R,R or S,S) - 1, 2 -dideuteriobutanedinitrile. The calculations support the observed trends.

40|$|Ion {{chemistry}} at {{atmospheric pressure}} is of major relevance to novel methods for the abatement of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) that employ non-thermal plasmas. For this reason, positive and negative APCI (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization) mass spectra of all six di-, tri- and tetrachloroethanes diluted in air (500 - 1500 ppm) at atmospheric pressure were investigated at 30 °C and at 300 °C. Spectral changes due to collisional activation of the ions achieved by increasing δV, the potential difference between sampling and skimmer cones, are informative of structures and ion-molecule reactions. Positive ion chemistry of the chloroethanes (M) can, in general, be ascribed to C-C and C-Cl cleavages of the molecular ion, M+•, never detected but likely formed via exothermic charge exchange from primary ions of the APCI plasma. Exceptions to this characteristic pattern were observed for 1, 1 -dichloroethane and 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, which give [M - H]+ and [M - HCl]+• species, respectively. It is suggested that both such species are due to ionization via hydride transfer. Upon increasing δV, the [M - HCl]+• ion formed from 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane undergoes the same fragmentation and ion-molecule reactions previously reported for trichloroethene. A nucleophilic reaction of water within the [C 2 H 4 Cl+](H 2 O) n ionic complexes to displace HCl is postulated {{to account for the}} [C 2 H 5 O+](H 2 O) m species observed in the positive APCI spectra of the <b>dichloroethanes.</b> Negative ion spectra are, for all investigated chloroethanes, dominated by Cl- and its ion-neutral complexes with one, two and, in some cases, three molecules of the neutral precursor and/or water. Another common feature is the formation of species (X-) (M) n where X- is a background ion of the APCI plasma, namely O 2 -,O 3 - and, in some cases, (NO) 2 -. Peculiar to 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane are species attributed to Cl- complexes with phosgene, (Cl-) (Cl 2 C=O) n(n = 1, 2). Such complexes, which were not observed for either the isomeric 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane or for the tetrachloroethanes, are of interest as oxidation intermediates in the corona-induced decomposition process. No conclusions can be drawn {{in the case of the}} <b>dichloroethanes,</b> since, for these compounds, the ions (Cl-) (Cl 2 C=O) n and (Cl-) (M) n happen to be isobaric...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} and persistence of volatile, chlorinated priority pollutants {{has been documented}} at sites across the country. Examples of commonly used solvents include 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene and methylene chloride. At some facilities, other volatile chlorinated compounds, which were never handled or disposed at these same facilities, have been detected in significant concentrations. These other compounds include <b>dichloroethanes,</b> dichloroethenes, chloroethane and vinyl chloride. Recent research shows that these less commonly used solvents can be present {{as a result of}} anaerobic degradation of major contaminants (commonly used solvents) within the groundwater system. This paper presents data to help clarify the conditions under which one may anticipate finding degradation products and discusses their distribution trends. Data are presented from studies conducted at solvent recovery facilities, solid/hazardous waste landfills and solvent contamination near an industrial facility. When degrada-tion occurs, the parent solvent compounds are at highest concentrations near the source. With distance from the source, increasing proportions of degradation products are present. Degradation products are most frequently found near a source containing high concentrations of other biodegradable organic compounds. Standard analytical protocols for measurement of volatile organic priority pollutants by GC/MS do not distinguish between trans- 1, 2 -dichlorethene, a highly-toxic priority pollutant, and the cis isomer which is a significantly less hazardous non-priority pollutant degrada-tion product and is the dominant degradation contaminant present at these sites.

50|$|The {{modified}} Danheiser benzannulation {{allows the}} synthesis of polycyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic systems. This also includes napthalenes, benzofurans and indoles. This second generation aromatic annulation is achieved by irradiation of a solution of acetylene and a vinyl or aryl α-diazo ketone in <b>dichloroethane.</b> This reaction utilizes the photochemical Wolff rearrangement of a diazoketone to generate an aryl or vinylketene. These ketene intermediates cannot be isolated due to their high reactivity to form diketenes.

When ketenes are formed in the presence of alkynes they proceed through pericyclic reactions to generate a substituted aromatic ring (Scheme 2).

Models of intoxications with ethanol, <b>dichloroethane,</b> carbofos, armine, or sodium nitrite in the doses causing 30 — 50 % death were employed.

Quantitative histochemistry was used to determine the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, NAD-diaphorase, and Na+, K+-ATPase. The number of chemical reactions was measured and estimated on a MT- 9 TV analyzer microscope. Experimental findings were analyzed by different variation statistical methods using Student’s test. Results. The paper reports the results of comprehensive experimental studies of the efficiency of correction of prooxidative-antioxidative imbalance after severe acute intoxication with chemical prooxidants and some lipophilic xenobiotics.
