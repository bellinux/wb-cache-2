It {{turns out that}} many of the simplest questions are very difficult to solve, but researchers have made considerable progress over the last twenty years. In this project, a robust control of power system stabilizer (PSS) for single machine <b>infinite</b> <b>bus</b> using LMI optimization approach is considered. In practical, power system stabilizers (PSS) are added to excitation systems to enhance the damping during low frequency oscillations. The main objective of this project is to design robust controller for PSS using Hoo technique based on LMI optimization approach. The nonlinear model of a machine is linearized at different operating points using Power System Dynamic simulation software. A robust controller is obtained using linear matrix inequalities approach.

A single machine <b>infinite</b> <b>bus</b> system is applied to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the approach. The results obtained from simulations validate the improvement in damping of overall power oscillations in the system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 In recent years, {{considerable}} {{attention has been}} focused on the application of orthogonal expansions to system analysis, parameter identification, model reduction and control system design. However, little research has been done in applying their useful properties to Power System analysis and control. This research attempts to make some inroads in applying the so called " orthogonal expansion approach " to analysis and control of Power systems, especially the latter. A set of orthogonal functions commonly called Walsh functions in system science after it's discoverer J. L. Walsh [1923] have been successfully used for parameter identification in the presence of severe nonlinearities. The classical optimal control problem is applied to a synchronous machine <b>infinite</b> <b>bus</b> system via the orthogonal expansion approach and a convenient method outlined for designing PID controllers which can achieve prespecified closed loop response characteristics.
