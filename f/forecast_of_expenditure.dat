40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{research}} is the impact of the macroeconomic factors on food spending residents of St. Petersburg. The problem of the study is the ambiguity of the food sanctions impact on the consumer spending on food. The aim of the work are the trend analyze in the level of food spending in St. Petersburg since the first quarter of 2007 to the third quarter 2015, and the identifying of factors influencing these food waste. St. Petersburg was chosen because it is a city with a large population, which is located in the European part of Russia, it means that its inhabitants often bought European food products before the embargo. During the research the following tasks were performed: the description of the embargo’s chronology from 2014 to 2016; the definition of the basic mechanisms of behavior of contractors doing business in the food sector; Econometric analysis of the food spending dependency on the embargo, the GDP change, the cost of Brent crude oil and the Consumer Price Index. The following results were obtained: the availability of food embargo and the oil prices rising increase food waste. The GDP growth, in contrast, reduces the spending level. Influence of the Consumer Price Index reflects on food spending in different ways, depending on the product category. In addition, the <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food in the III quarter of 2016 was created by the main research model. Thus, the study clearly showed that the embargo significantly increases consumer spending on food, despite the fact that its purpose is the import substitution.

40|$|In current Ukrainian {{forecasting}} practice budget {{expenditures are}} often planned according to achieved results, {{taking into account}} the inflation rate. But this principle does not allow defining medium- and long-term trends, which provides evidence of lack <b>of</b> adequate <b>forecasting</b> <b>of</b> local budget <b>expenditures.</b> Now the scientifically-based approach toforecast local budget expenditures is required; the latest is impossible without using of mathematical and economic models. Given paper is aimed to develop scientifically based methods and models in order to forecast local budget expenditures and to make a medium-term <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> local budget <b>expenditures</b> for Donetsk region. In order to choice an appropriate forecasting model, based on existing theoretical issues, we distinguished three classes <b>of</b> <b>forecasting</b> models: microsimulation models, component-based models, regional-level models. This analysis allowed us to determine the forecasting technique which is the mixed variant of deterministic and econometric models. It based on using of correlatable factors, which influence directly on benchmark parameter - budget expenditures. Such technique provides the medium-term <b>forecasting</b> <b>of</b> budget <b>expenditures</b> in Donetsk region for 2014 - 2016. Input model data includes official statistical data for all considering indexes and also for benchmark parameter, covering period 2006 - 2013, by half-year. After preliminary estimates we’ve chosen two <b>forecasting</b> models <b>of</b> multivariate regression type: additive and multiplicative (logarithmic) models. Modeling results showed that ratio between budget expenditures in Donets region and Ukraine’s GDP is sufficiently stable, it changes continuously according to political and economical government decisions; the saccadic changes can be naturally explained by hypothesis of external pulse effects (as it was {{in the second half of}} 2008). The chosen models allowed us to make a medium-term <b>forecast</b> <b>of</b> local budget <b>expenditures</b> <b>of</b> Donetsk region.

40|$|Background: Drug plan {{decision}} makers need accurate financial impact projections before {{the implementation of}} new drug policy initiatives. Tools for such projections need to have small margins of error and be based on methodology that is easy to communicate to stakeholders. Ad hoc methods typically used for financial impact projections by health plans are inadequate. Objective: To present a flexible tool for projecting the financial impact of drug policy changes based on historical dispensing data and simulation, and explore its validity using a recent example of a complex drug policy change in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: A policy simulator (SAS(R) program using a Web browser interface) was used to produce 3 -year <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (for the drug plan and for individual families) along {{with the number of}} patients who would pay more or less for their drugs (stratified by age and income level) for various proposed drug policies starting in 2003. Drug expenditure under each policy was simulated based on projections from prescription claim records of the British Columbia PharmaNet database of community pharmacy prescriptions from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001. The simulator selected a random 1 % sample of British Columbia families (175 _ 000 families) in the database. Once the new drug policy was selected and implemented, the accuracy of the predictions were tested by comparing the actual PharmaCare expenditure for the period 1 May 2003 to 31 March 2004 after implementation of the new drug policy with the final simulation made for this policy in February 2003, 2 months before the policy was implemented.

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{contribution}} of consumer confidence indexes in forecasting consumption expenditures is analysed. In the first part equations explaining the consumer confidence index (CCI) in four major European countries (Germany, Italy, United Kingdom and France) are estimated by a few exogenous variables (oil prices, interest rates, exchange rates and the U. S. stock market index) are estimated. In the next section these equations are used to forecast the CCI for 1986. We then present equations explaining private consumption by using the CCI. In the final section a comparison is made between <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> consumption <b>expenditures</b> for 1986 obtained by using the observed and the predicted CCI. The forecasts obtained by using the predicted CCI tend to overestimate the positive impact of the recent drop in oil prices on consumption expenditures.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to use time series {{analysis}} methods to examine the impact on cases of ambulatory care, claims of ambulatory care and the grand total of medical claims when co-payment and regressive physician payment policies were implemented. Methods: Based on the data from the NHI from Mar. 1995 to Dec. 2001, time series models were used to formulate the time series. Results: By selecting the appropriate time series models, the R squares of these models were over 90 percent except for the model of ambulatory care cases.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} {{the findings from}} ex ante and ex post economic impact appraisals of six major sports events. The ultimate aim of the paper is to identify the factors that cause differences between <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>expenditure</b> and figures based on primary research. Design/methodology/approach - A direct expenditure forecast for each event was derived based on analysis of event documentation and informed assumptions applied from previous studies. Subsequently, a comprehensive study was undertaken involving primary data collection and associated desk research. Findings - <b>Of</b> the <b>forecasts,</b> three were inflated and three were conservative relative to the ex post figures. Two potential sources of variance are examined – visitor spending and organisational expenditure. The former {{was found to be}} more unpredictable when compiling a pre-event forecast. The group for which direct expenditure is most difficult to predict is spectators, with the most exaggerated forecasts associated with free-to-view events. Research limitations/implications - Neither input-output nor computable general equilibrium models were used to analyse secondary, indirect or induced impacts. Nonetheless, direct expenditure is the basis for modelling wider impacts and is therefore worthy of consideration in its own right. Practical implications - The findings of this study should enable public sector agencies to better understand the reliability of projected figures presented to them by organisers in exchange for securing financial support for their events. Originality/value - Economic impact forecasts are rarely subjected to post-event scrutiny. This research bridges the gap between ex ante and ex post figures and identifies areas where forecast accuracy can be improved. </p...|$|R

As pension reforms are intrinsically {{difficult to define}} and pinpoint, we introduce an alternative measure of pension reforms by comparing long-term <b>forecasts</b> <b>of</b> pension <b>expenditures</b> for seventeen European countries. The larger the decrease in expected spending on public pensions in 2050 between two base years, the more successful a pension reform the country achieved (after controlling for other factors, such as demography).

Indeed, only three countries in the EU managed to reduce their expected spending on pensions in both reference periods. In {{the second part of}} the paper, we analyze factors that may facilitate or hamper pension reform – quality of fiscal institutions, public debt, trade unions’ influence, and also demographic factors. Only the measure of trade union power proves to be significant in explaining pension reforms. Other factors, such as quality of fiscal institutions, size of the existing funded pillar, public debt or recent demographic developments, do not seem to play a significant role. However, specific pension system factors – most significantly the lagged change in pension expenditures – are significant and suggest that European governments do reform their pension systems when faced with the threat <b>of</b> escalating pension <b>expenditures.</b> In conclusion, we propose a hypothesis of “bounded” economic rationale of European governments, as they seem to react to expectations of an increase in pension spending, but they seem to be content with the current spending levels.
