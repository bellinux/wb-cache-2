6000|$|When in {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century the {{far-reaching}} similarity was revealed which subsists between the properties of light and those of <b>elastic</b> <b>waves</b> in ponderable bodies, the ether hypothesis found fresh support. It appeared beyond question that light must be interpreted as a vibratory process in an elastic, inert medium filling up universal space. It also seemed to be a necessary consequence of the fact that light is capable of polarisation that this medium, the ether, must be of the nature of a solid body, because transverse waves are not possible in a fluid, but only in a solid. Thus the physicists were bound to arrive at the theory of the [...] "quasi-rigid" [...] luminiferous ether, the parts of which can carry out no movements relatively to one another except the small movements of deformation which correspond to light-waves.|$|E

50|$|Elastic {{energy of}} or within a {{substance}} is static energy of configuration. It corresponds to energy stored principally {{by changing the}} inter-atomic distances between nuclei. Thermal energy is the randomized distribution of kinetic energy within the material, resulting in statistical fluctuations of the material about the equilibrium configuration. There is some interaction, however. For example, for some solid objects, twisting, bending, and other distortions may generate thermal energy, causing the material's temperature to rise. Thermal energy in solids is often carried by internal <b>elastic</b> <b>waves,</b> called phonons. <b>Elastic</b> <b>waves</b> that are large {{on the scale of}} an isolated object usually produce macroscopic vibrations sufficiently lacking in randomization that their oscillations are merely the repetitive exchange between (elastic) potential energy within the object and the kinetic energy of motion of the object as a whole.|$|E

50|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) is {{the phenomenon}} of radiation of acoustic (<b>elastic)</b> <b>waves</b> in solids that occurs when a material undergoes irreversible changes in its internal structure, for example {{as a result of}} crack formation or plastic deformation due to aging, temperature gradients or external mechanical forces. In particular, AE is occurring during the processes of mechanical loading of materials and structures accompanied by structural changes that generate local sources of <b>elastic</b> <b>waves.</b> This results in small surface displacements of a material produced by elastic or stress waves generated when the accumulated elastic energy in a material or on its surface is released rapidly. The waves generated by sources of AE are of practical interest in structural health monitoring (SHM), quality control, system feedback, process monitoring and other fields. In SHM applications, AE is typically used to detect, locate and characterise damage.|$|E
