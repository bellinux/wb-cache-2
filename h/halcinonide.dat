50|$|<b>Halcinonide</b> {{is a high}} potency corticosteroid, {{in group}} II (second most potent group) under US classification. It is used topically (in a 0.05% cream {{provided}} as Halog) {{in the treatment of}} certain skin conditions.|$|E
40|$|When {{treating}} {{patients with}} extensive dermatitis, total {{body surface area}} affected must be considered when prescribing topical medication. <b>Halcinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream, a class 2 topical corticosteroid, is now available in a 216 g jar. This large size is convenient and cost effective for patients with large-area dermatoses. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy and patient acceptance of <b>halcinonide</b> in 216 g jars for the treatment of large-area dermatoses. Design: This study was an open-label, noncomparator trial evaluating the clinical outcomes and acceptability of <b>halcinonide</b> in 216 g jars. <b>Halcinonide</b> was prescribed twice daily for up to 28 days. Measurement: Severity of dermatoses was based on investigator observations at the baseline visit and again after 28 days. Patient satisfaction was evaluated based on a questionnaire completed {{at the conclusion of the}} study. Results: Total enrollment was 40 patients. Dermatoses affected an average of 12 percent body surface area. At baseline, all patients exhibited dermatoses rated as severe or moderate. Nearly half of patients were completely cleared or almost cleared by 28 days, with all patients noting at least some improvement. Most patients agreed that they liked the way the product spread on the skin (94. 7 %), and more than 80 percent found that it was neither sticky nor greasy. In more than 90 percent of cases, the investigator reported that <b>halcinonide</b> provided a shorter duration of therapy versus triamcinolone one-pound jars. Conclusion: <b>Halcinonide</b> 0. 1 % cream in 216 g jars is effective and convenient for patients with large-area dermatoses...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Halcinonide</b> is a high-potency topical {{glucocorticoid}} {{used for}} skin inflammation treatments that presents toxic systemic effects. A simple and quick analytical method {{to quantify the}} amount of <b>halcinonide</b> encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles, such as polymeric lipid-core nanoparticles and solid lipid nanoparticles, was developed and validated regarding the drug's encapsulation efficiency and in vitro permeation. The development and validation of the analytical method were carried out using the high performance liquid chromatography with the UV detection at 239 nm. The validation parameters were specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy, limits of detection and quantitation, and robustness. The method presented an isocratic flow rate of 1. 0 mL. min- 1, a mobile phase methanol:water (85 : 15 v/v), and a retention time of 4. 21 min. The method was validated according to international and national regulations. The <b>halcinonide</b> encapsulation efficiency in nanoparticles was greater than 99 % and the in vitro drug permeation study showed that less than 9 % of the drug permeated through the membrane, indicating a nanoparticle reservoir effect, which can reduce the halcinonide's toxic systemic effects. These studies demonstrated {{the applicability of the}} developed and validated analytical method to quantify <b>halcinonide</b> in lipid nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|Four different, {{proprietary}} preparations of topical cortico-steroids in cream base {{were evaluated}} for their relative efficacy on forty adult human volunteers using {{a modification of}} the method described by Reddy and Singh. Fluocinolone acetonide 0. 025 % (Flucort) was rated {{to be the most}} efficacious, followed by <b>halcinonide</b> 0. 1 %, (<b>Halcinonide),</b> beclomethasone dipropionate 0. 025 % (Beciate) and betamethasone [...] valerate 0. 12 % (Betnovate). However, the differences between these four topical corticosteroids did. not reach the level of statistical significance...|$|E
40|$|Formulations of {{a number}} of steroids were {{evaluated}} after topical application in a reversed passive Arthus test (RPA) in rabbits. Four 21 -chlorosteroids in the same cream base were investigated. The preparations of SQ 18. 566 (<b>halcinonide)</b> and SQ 20, 811 showed anti-edema activity, but those of SQ 15, 361 and SQ 20, 589 were less active. Ointment formulations of <b>halcinonide</b> also reduced edema in the RPA. These results, coupled with previously reported clinical data, suggest that the RPA might be utilized to distinguish good from poor formulations of anti-inflammatory steroids prior to screening tests or clinical trials in humans...|$|E
40|$|Regenerative {{medicine}} {{holds the}} promise of replacing damaged tissues largely by stem cell activation. Hedgehog signaling through the plasma membrane receptor Smoothened (Smo) is an important process for regulating stem cell proliferation. The development of Hedgehog-related therapies has been impeded {{by a lack of}} US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved Smo agonists. Using a high-content screen with cells expressing Smo receptors and a β-arrestin 2 -GFP reporter, we identified four FDA-approved drugs, <b>halcinonide,</b> fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide, as Smo agonists that activate Hedgehog signaling. These drugs demonstrated an ability to bind Smo, promote Smo internalization, activate Gli, and stimulate the proliferation of primary neuronal precursor cells alone and synergistically in the presence of Sonic Hedgehog protein. <b>Halcinonide,</b> fluticasone, clobetasol, and fluocinonide provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop unique clinical strategies to treat Hedgehog-dependent illnesses...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the causes}} of {{permanent}} disability in chronic multiple sclerosis patients is the inability of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to terminate their maturation program at lesions. To identify key regulators of myelin gene expression acting at the last stages of OPC maturation we developed a drug repositioning strategy based on the mouse immortalized oligodendrocyte (OL) cell line Oli-neu brought to the premyelination stage by stably expressing a key factor regulating the last stages of OL maturation. The Prestwick Chemical Library of 1, 200 FDA-approved compound(s) was repositioned at three dosages based on the induction of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) expression. Drug hits were further validated using dosage-dependent reproducibility tests and biochemical assays. The glucocorticoid class of compounds was the most highly represented and we found that they can be divided in three groups according to their efficacy on MBP up-regulation. Since target identification is crucial before bringing compounds to the clinic, we searched for common targets of the primary screen hits based on their known chemical-target interactomes, and the pathways predicted by top ranking compounds were validated using specific inhibitors. Two of the top ranking compounds, <b>Halcinonide</b> and Clobetasol, act as Smoothened (Smo) agonists to up-regulate myelin gene expression in the Oli-neuM cell line. Further, RxRγ activation is required for MBP expression upon <b>Halcinonide</b> and Clobetasol treatment. These data indicate Clobetasol and <b>Halcinonide</b> as potential promyelinating drugs and also provide a mechanistic understanding of their mode of action in the pathway leading to myelination in OPCs. Furthermore, our classification of glucocorticoids with respect to MBP expression provides important novel insights into their effects in the CNS and a rational criteria for their choice in combinatorial therapies in de-myelinating diseases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we have {{optimized}} {{the analysis of}} 18 human corticosteroids, some endogenous (tetrahydrocortisol, tetrahydrocortisone, cortisol, and cortisone) and others synthetic (betamethasone, budesonide, cortisone acetate, desonide, dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate, flunisolide, fluocinolone acetonide, <b>halcinonide,</b> methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, triamcinolone, and triamcinolone acetonide). Three analytical techniques were developed: ELISA, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Several sample-preparation methods were optimized for each technique and enabled compounds of interest to be extracted from small urine samples (several mL). The results enabled us to assess the possibilities and the sensitivity of each technique for application to doping tests...|$|E
40|$|Efficacy of ten topical {{corticosteroid}} preparations was evaluated on ten healthy volunteers by wheal suppression technique of Reddy and Singh motified by Singh and Singh. This double bind {{study revealed that}} clobetasol propionate (0. 05 %) and <b>halcinonide</b> (0. 01 %) oinment were the potent steroids i. e. 5 to 6 times more potent than hydrocortisone acetate (1 %).
