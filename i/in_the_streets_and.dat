To capture this sequence, Pfister employed a mix of hand-held camera and steadicam work. Tangier was also used to film an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito's mind.|$|E

5|$|Just {{prior to}} the convention, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race, casting himself as the standard-bearer of the Robert Kennedy legacy. As the 1968 Democratic National Convention started, Humphrey stated that he had more than enough delegates to secure the nomination, but {{commentators}} questioned the campaign's ability {{to hold on to}} the delegates. The Texas delegation announced frustration at the McCarthy campaign's attempts to change procedures, and declared that they might renominate President Johnson as a result. Observers noted that Humphrey's delegates were supporters of Johnson, and could follow suit. Meanwhile, protests and sleep-ins were held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> parks of Chicago, forcing Mayor Richard J. Daley to order federal troops into the city. Eventually, 6,000 federal troops and 18,000 Illinois National Guardsmen were outside the convention, defending the premises. A televised debate was held featuring Humphrey, McCarthy and McGovern. Humphrey hoped to unite the party during the debate, affirming his support for peace in Vietnam, but his challengers were received better by the crowd, drawing more applause.|$|E

5|$|Plague doctors traversed {{the streets}} {{diagnosing}} victims, {{although many of}} them had no formal medical training. Several public health efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats. This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed. Tobacco was thought to be a prophylactic and it was later said that no London tobacconist had died from the plague during the epidemic.|$|E
5|$|The Aalborg Symphony Orchestra (Aalborg Symfoniorkester) {{founded in}} 1943 {{presents}} about 150 concerts a year, frequently {{playing in the}} Musikkens Hus. It also plays for the Jutland opera company (Den Jyske Opera, also based in Aalborg), and at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen. It {{is one of the}} main organisers of the 10-day Aalborg Opera Festival held every March. Aalborg has the jazz club Jazzclub Satchmo and an annual jazz and blues festival (Den Blå Festival), also known as the Mini New Orleans Festival. Over four days in mid-August, concerts are performed on squares, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> in cafés and restaurants. Since 2012, the Egholm Festival, a small music festival on the island of Egholm near Aalborg has been organized in the first weekend of August. It features relatively unknown upcoming pop, rock and hip-hop artists. The festival has two stage areas and was organized by the Musical Association Aalborg (MUSAM) and Aalborg Events.|$|E

25|$|It was not {{uncommon}} until the factory's closure for children to be seen playing in the dust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> the local school's playground, making 'snowballs' which were thrown in ignorance of the danger they posed.

25|$|This {{coalition}} against radicalism lasted until 1868, when insurmountable financial difficulties, turmoil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> Parliament, and {{a succession of}} incompetent governments once again forced Saldanha to impose his will.

25|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1848, Booth was unemployed {{and spent a}} year looking in vain for work. In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he again found work with a pawnbroker. Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but {{the small amount of}} preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air evangelising <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> on Kennington Common.|$|E

Dead bodies were piled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> starving Lebanese civilians were reported to be eating street animals while some even resorted to cannibalism.|$|E

25|$|Hague rose {{through the}} Democratic {{machinery}} of Hudson County, which drew much of its strength by providing newly arrived immigrants with the rudimentary social services. Hague {{took a job as}} a collector for a local brewery, leaving him with time to spend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> the local taverns which were hubs of political activity. He also spent his time cleaning up the loose ends of the Second Ward's south-end Democratic Club to consolidate his power.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1980 he {{received}} permission {{to travel to the}} United States. Shortly after arriving, he decided to settle permanently in New York, a decision officially certified by the December 1981 declaration of Martial law in Poland. During the 1980s and 1990s, Walek Dzedzej could be seen on an almost daily basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> subways of Manhattan, as well as in Polish clubs, performing his original protest songs together with the familiar Solidarność (Solidarity) anthems.

25|$|The next day, {{a series}} of {{meetings}} and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike. By , virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-collar workers and teachers joined the workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> at public meetings.|$|E

25|$|The {{state in}} which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held {{the better part of}} Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill. They camped nearly at the gates of Rome. The city was packed with {{refugees}} from all walks of life, who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> had few of the necessities of life. The seat of government was far from Rome in Constantinople, which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao's supporters, {{his death}} symbolized {{the loss of}} the revolutionary {{foundation}} of Communist China. When his death was announced on the afternoon of September 9, in a press release entitled “A Notice from the Central Committee, the NPC, State Council, and the CMC to the whole Party, the whole Army and to the people of all nationalities throughout the country”, the nation descended into grief and mourning, with people weeping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> public institutions closing for over a week.

25|$|For {{the poor}} of Paris, life was very different. They were crowded into tall, narrow, five- or six-story high {{buildings}} {{that lined the}} winding streets on the Île de la Cité and other medieval quarters of the city. Crime in the dark streets was a serious problem. Metal lanterns were hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>and</b> Colbert increased to four hundred the number of archers who acted as night watchmen. Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie was appointed the first lieutenant-general of police of Paris in 1667, a position he held for thirty years; his successors reported directly to the king.|$|E
