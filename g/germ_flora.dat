This led to an intensive production simultaneous with {{a growing number of}} agricultural farms. In this context, germ contamination may be influenced by several technological factors during the slaughtering process. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of some poultry slaughtering stages such as bleeding, depluming, evisceration, washing, cooling, packing –on the carcasses <b>germ</b> <b>flora.</b> The experiment took place in a slaughtering house situated in Iasi County, Romania. The evaluation was accomplished by the following microbiological parameters: total number of germs (TNG), Coliformi fecali, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli. The samples were gathered for five months from a total number of 180 “Ross 308 ” poultry carcasses, which were randomly chosen during the slaughtering. The biological material comes from the poultry growing specialized farms. As for the evolutional point of view, the largest germ charge on the carcasses surface was noticed just after the deplumation and evisceration. These are the stages when the microorganism contamination occurs intensively. The highest mean values for every parameter we studied are: TNG– 7. 12 ± 0. 13 log 10 ufc/g; Coliformi fecali– 5. 48 ± 0. 14 log 10 ufc/g, Enterobacteriaceae– 5. 59 ± 0. 09 log 1...|$|E

Symptoms from the lower urinary tract include incontinence, urethritis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Atrophic changes within the bladder neck and urethra could be corrected by estrogen administration even at doses so low that endometrial proliferation is avoided. Hence such estrogens could be given without progestogen comedication. Control of micturition is a complex process of which estrogen deficiency {{is only one of}} several factors. The aging process with subsequent changes in membrane permeability, neuromuscular function, and collagen synthesis contributes to the local problems of control of micturition. In addition, the central control may also be affected by degenerative changes of the nervous system. Vaginal symptoms comprise dryness of vagina, dyspareunia, and recurrent vaginitis often followed by a foul odor and discharge. The microflora with lactobacilli and low pH as seen in fertile women is gradually replaced by a mixed <b>germ</b> <b>flora</b> including several of the pathogenic organisms common in urinary tract infections. Vaginal pH increases from around 4 to between 6 and 7. It is a puzzling fact that the urogenital tissues seem to be more "sensitive" to estrogens than other tissues. Conformational changes of the estrogen receptor(s) brought about by the local cytokine milieu is one possibility to explain the situation. The systemic absorption of low-dose estrogen preparations is dependent on the status of the vaginal mucosa. Absorption is high when the vaginal mucosa is atrophic and gradually decreases (but not to zero) as the vaginal mucosa matures under estrogen influence...|$|E

The {{molecular}} detection {{by means of}} the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represents a much more sensitive, specific and fast detection method of Pasteurella and confirms the infection. Although the isolation and identification of the pathogenic agent represent the most reliable method of demonstration of its existence, the results of the bacteriologic examination are frequently false negative, owing to the fact that P. multodica is either rather easily destroyed during the transportation or eliminated from the culture medium by the bacteriological suprainfection <b>germs</b> (nasal <b>flora</b> or contaminants). Pasteurellae were identified both in clinically healthy cats and in ill cats. These dates suggest that the contaminated cats, regardless of their clinical state, may transmit de bacteria to humans by bite or scratch. In this work, cats kept as pets from Bucharest were studied with suspect to their contamination with Pasteurella. Of 44 samples taken from the oral cavity of cats, 22 Pasteurella spp. strains could be isolated, 18 of which belonged to the Pasteurella multocida...|$|R
