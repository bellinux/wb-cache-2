A primeira parte, composta pelos dois primeiros capítulos, discute as duas maiores heranças que Marx recebeu - Hegel e o pensamento monetário inglês do século XIX -, para aí evidenciarmos tanto suas potencialidades quanto suas inevitáveis limitações. Quando passamos à segunda parte, constituída pelos dois últimos capítulos, o foco recai sobre a tentativa de fazer as categorias marxistas se adequarem ao nosso hodierno sistema financeiro e monetário; com um ponto claro: mostrar a ligação necessária entre o dinheiro inconversível e a atual formação de capital fictício. Momento no qual os derivativos financeiros se revelarão objetos contraditórios e, mais do que instrumentos, produtores de suas próprias pressuposições - em especial, o risco abstrato. Dessa forma estaremos aptos a analisar em toda sua profundidade o ciclo do moderno capital fictício - da mercadoria-capital, do capital que retorna como capital ao seu predicado lógico inicial. O resultado deste movimento será o engendramento de um novo capital abstrato, para o qual os swaps são seu veículo. Departing {{from the}} logical {{introduction}} of the <b>inconvertible</b> <b>money</b> form this dissertation investigates the scientific adequateness of the monetary and financial Marxist theories to the new post- 1971 reality. The first part, constituted by the first two chapters, discusses the two main heritages that Marx received - Hegel and the English monetary thought from the 19 th century - to then make evident both its potentialities and its inevitable limitations. Moreover, with the clear objective of disclosing the necessary connection between <b>inconvertible</b> <b>money</b> and the present formation of fictitious capital, the second part, composed by the last two chapters, {{will focus on the}} attempt to adequate Marxist categories to our hodiern financial and monetary system. Moment to which financial derivatives will reveal themselves as contradictory objects and, more than just hedge devices, as producers of their own presuppositions - in special, abstract risk. In this way, we will be capable to analyze in all its profoundness the circuit of the modern fictitious capital - capital-commodity, capital that returned as capital to its first logical predicate. The outcome of this movement is the yield of an abstract capital, to which swaps are its vehicle...|$|E
40|$|If we adopt a dialectical (Hegelian) {{reading of}} Marx’s theory of money, {{we can see}} that money {{contains}} within it the contradiction of commodity itself (between use-value and value) and in so doing, it contains different strata of contradiction that logically and historically have come to the fore. In this process, the truly social forms (for example money – as opposed to commodity, means of circulation – as opposed to measure of value, <b>inconvertible</b> <b>money</b> – as opposed to commodity money, and so on) seem to be stronger than their counterparts (social forms) and, because of this, there is a movement towards an autonomization of these forms. In this sense, value becomes autonomous from use-value; as medium of circulation, the abstract that money represents becomes autonomous from the concrete that the measure of value requires; as medium of payment, money becomes autonomous from the commodity circulation that has produced it, and so on. This paper aims to show that these movements may be behind some of the contemporary phenomena we are currently observing in the sphere of capital circulation (for example, the inconvertible US dollar acting as universal money, the “financialisation” of the valorization process, the spilling over of monetary crisis, bubbles and crashes, etc). Recent literature dealing with some of these themes, such as, Moseley (2004, 2005); Foley (2005); Harvey (2006, 1982); Chesnais (2005, 2008), will also be discussed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{relationship}} between love and money in the context of the American Dream in F. Scott. Fitzgeraldʼs The Great Gatsby. In general, those who try to buy or sell love tend to be punished in the end in American novels, such as Kate Croy in The Wings of the Dove, Lily Bart in The House of Mirth and Carrie Meeber in Sister Carrie. However, love and money in The Great Gatsby are closely related with each other in terms of the concept of the self-made man who pursues success in both love and money. By employing the concepts used in the money system as metaphors such as convertible paper <b>money,</b> <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money</b> and trust, I examine how Gatsbyʼs love for Daisy is harmonized with his money-making and how the process of his money-making equals that of making his “self. ” In the end, Gatsby is killed and his American dream seems to fail. However, this is neither his failure nor a punishment for Gatsby as the system of the American Dream requires some kind of difference to maintain itself: we gain profit from difference but difference vanishes through gaining profit; therefore, to retain profit, we have to keep difference. In his narrative, Nick Carraway tries to underline the gap between Daisy in the present and Daisy in the past to avoid the restoration of the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy, which, as a result, prolongs our expectation for the fulfillment of the American Dream. 論文Article...|$|R

He went to England in June 1892 on a borrowing mission, not only as the representative of New South Wales but also of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and carried out his negotiations successfully. During the banking crisis of May 1893 he showed himself to be a firm leader, saving the situation at Sydney by giving the banks power to issue <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money</b> for a period, although most of them failed to take advantage and went bankrupt. In 1893, his electoral reform removed rural over-representation. He was elected as the member for Tamworth in 1894.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} the theoretical foundation on which we can understand the difference between the standard monetary system and the fiat money system, by focusing the accessibility to the medium of exchange. We analyzed the economic cost and economic distance to travel from the initial point (=before conducting the exchange) to the desired situation (=after the exchange). We concluded that the standard-goods should not be selected from the goods with high intrinsic value because they help improve the real economic activities. This clarifies the reason for the transition of the money from ancient times to modern ages. However, when one of real goods is selected as a monetary standard, opportunity cost of the monetary-use is inevitable, even if its intrinsic value is small. This determines the upper limit of efficiency of standard money system. On the other hand, an <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money,</b> purely nominal, doesn't generate such an opportunity cost, because it is not based on any real goods. In this sense, there is a difference between fiat and standard money...|$|R
40|$|The {{conduct of}} {{monetary}} policy, a most controversial subject in eco-nomics, {{is as yet}} unsettled. The rules-versus-discretion debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960 s, and between new classicals and new Keynesians nowadays, is but the latest instance of an academic argument {{that goes back to}} the Currency-versus-Banking School contro-versy and beyond. At the center of this discussion are the main features of the model analyzing the transmission and effects of variations in the money stock on output and the price level. In an early dispute on this issue Thomas Attwood opposed John Stu-art Mill. In several papers and pamphlets, as well as in parliamentary speeches and testimony, Attwood argued for the pursuit of full employ-ment through the active management of an <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money.</b> Mill strongly criticized this approach on various grounds and rejected the possibility of stimulating output through monetary impulses. This controversy is well known, yet it is worth revisiting for several reasons. First, economists are divided on their assessment of Mill’s view, which indeed poses a puzzle since, while in the early essay “Of the Influence of Consumption upon Production ” (1844; but written around 1830) he admits the effectiveness of money supply changes, he does not in the Principles (1848). Second, a closer look at Mill’s arguments clarifies the different approaches to money within the classical school. Third, thi...|$|R
40|$|Rigorous {{application}} of experimental methodology to the interdisciplinary research of economic {{decision making is}} {{the main purpose of}} our work. In this paper, we introduce the main decisionmaking theories and outline economic rationality. We explain why we find it useful to discriminate between the “irrational” and “non-rational” components of decision making. We offer an oriented interdisciplinary point of view on economic rationality. In the applied section, we describe the main features of the Ultimatum game and summarize the up-to-date theories explaining the non-rational course of the game. We discuss in detail the reported relations between the nominal value of the stakes and the distribution of the offers and responses. We introduce the blinded, randomized Ultimatum game experiment that we conducted in our laboratory. We stress the importance of anonymity of the study subjects and the difference in salience of a factual reward against a  hypothetical reward. We present the results of our study, showing that a  duly chosen non-monetary reward, directly <b>inconvertible</b> into <b>money,</b> leads to a different offer distribution in the Ultimatum game without the necessity to invest excessive sums of money in the rewards. We compare our results to research published by other authors. According to our theory, the rational, non-rational and irrational components contribute to the decision making in Ultimatum differently depending on the different reward stakes...|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} of fictitious capital is, for Marx, {{linked to the}} wider contradiction between the financial system in capitalism and its monetary basis. Marx writes: [...] "With the development of interest-bearing capital and the credit system, all capital seems to double itself, and sometimes treble itself, by the various modes in which the same capital, or perhaps even the same claim on a debt, appears in different forms in different hands. The greater portion of this 'money-capital' is purely fictitious. All the deposits, {{with the exception of}} the reserve fund, are merely claims on the banker, which, however, never exist as deposits." [...] The expansion of the credit system can, in periods of capitalist expansion, be beneficial for the system; but in periods of economic crisis and uncertainty, capitalists tend, Marx argues, to look to the security of the [...] "money-commodity" [...] (gold) as the ultimate measure of value. Marx tends to assume the convertibility of paper money into gold. However, the modern system of <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money,</b> backed by the authority of states, poses greater problems. Here, in periods of crisis, [...] "the capitalist class appears to have a choice between devaluing money or commodities, between inflation or depression. In the event that monetary policy is dedicated to avoiding both, it will merely end up incurring both".|$|R
40|$|Marx's {{contributions}} to monetary theory {{have generally been}} somewhat neglected and, if they were paid any attention at all, they have been rather severely criticized, even by Marxist economists. It should be emphasized, however, that they are central to Marx's view of the functioning of commodity producing (i. e., market) economies and are inextricably bound up with his theory of value. From Marx's analysis of the functions of money and credit and his reflections on the rate of interest it is concluded that his adherence to the labour theory of value could not but result in his embracing the Banking School ideas, and that his theory of money shows all the weaknesses of the Banking School, plus some that are peculiar to the labour theory of value. E. g. his proposition that causality runs from prices to quantity of money in a system with full-blooded coins, but {{the other way round}} in a system with <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money,</b> cannot be given any satisfying micro-economic justification; nor does his theory admit of any influence of monetary policy on aggregate spending. Moreover, the labour theory of value leaves Marx without a theory of the rate of interest. His analysis of money as the "universal equivalent" makes one wonder why he did not consider the consequences of the tansformation problem for the money commodity. To his credit, Marx very clearly saw why Say's law of markets in the form of Say's identity is not valid in a monetary economy. Marx's theory of money {{turns out to be a}} weak construction, because it cannot be made consistent with any acceptable assumptions about microeconomic decision making. Blaug's dismissal of it as a mere repetition of the views of Ricarclo and Mill does not, however, do justice to Marx...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Marx assumed in Capital that money is a {{produced}} commodity, such as gold. However, the question remains open: was this assumption an essential part of Marx’s theory or just a historical contingency, which Marx assumed because he was trying to explain the actual capitalist economy in the 19 th century. Some critics have argued that money must be a commodity in Marx’s theory as a theoretical necessity (e. g. Lavoie 1986), and argue that the fact that money is no longer a commodity in today’s economy contradicts Marx’s theory. These critics conclude that Marx’s theory of money is invalid, or is no longer applicable to modern capitalism with non-commodity money. In considering this criticism, it is important to distinguish between the different functions of money (which is not always done), and especially between the functions of measure of value and means of circulation. It is clear that money as means of circulation {{does not have to be}} a commodity in Marx’s theory, as Marx himself emphasized (Marx 1867, pp. 221 - 27, and Marx 1859, pp. 107 - 22). The only question is whether money must be a commodity in Marx’s theory in its function as measure of value. I argued in Moseley (2005 a) that money does not have to be a commodity in Marx’s theory, even in its function of measure of value. The measure of value does not itself have to possess value. <b>Inconvertible</b> paper <b>money</b> (not backed by gold in any way) can also function as the measure of value. In order to function as the measure of value, a particular thing must be accepted by commodity-owners as the general equivalent, i. e. as directly exchangeable with all other commodities. Until the 1930 s, capitalists required that the general equivalent (and hence the measure of value) had to be a commodity, or at least convertible into a commodity at legally defined rates. However, in the Great Depression it became impossible to maintain the convertibility of paper money into commodity money. Convertibility required tight monetary policy, which was making the depression worse. In order to escape this “cross of gold”...|$|R
6000|$|The {{experience}} of the colonies before our Revolution is rich in [...] warning examples of the over-issue of <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money.</b> [...] Those of Rhode Island(250) and the Province of Massachusetts(251) [...] are the most conspicuous, perhaps, because we have better [...] knowledge of them, but other colonies suffered in as great a [...] degree. The {{experience of}} the latter illustrates as well as any, [...] perhaps, not only {{the general theory of}} inconvertible paper, but [...] the device of supporting the paper by paying interest upon the [...] notes. Although the issues since 1690 had depreciated, in 1702 [...] £10,000 more notes were issued, because, as it was said, there was [...] a scarcity of money. It is always noticeable that the more issues [...] of paper money there are made, the more there is a cry of [...] scarcity, much like the thirst of a hard drinker after the first [...] exhilaration has passed off. On the new issues five per cent [...] interest was paid, and even excises and imposts were set aside as [...] security for their payment. The year 1709 saw a new expedition to [...] Canada, and saw also the broken promises of the province, when [...] £20,000 more notes were put out; the collection of the taxes with [...] which to pay the notes was deferred in 1707 for two years; in 1709 [...] deferred for four years; in 1710 for five years; in 1711 for six [...] years. By 1712 they had depreciated thirty per cent, when the [...] charm of legal tender was thrown around them, but to no purpose. [...] The idea of value was not associated with them in people’s minds, [...] and they put no faith in promises. The usual result took place. [...] People divided politically on the money question, and parties [...] began to agitate for banks which should issue notes based on real [...] estate, or for loans from the state to private persons at interest [...] to be paid annually. Such facts show the train of evils following [...] the first innocent departure from the maintenance of a currency [...] equivalent to coin. The people forgot, or did not know, the nature [...] of money, or the offices it performed. They did not understand [...] that creating paper money did not create wealth. This experiment [...] closed only in 1750 (March 31st), when the province had courage [...] enough to resume specie payments. The effect was to transfer the [...] West India trade from paper-issuing colonies to Massachusetts, and [...] to produce a steady prosperity in her business interests.|$|R
30|$|From around 1880 {{until the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, the gold standard served as role model for the international currency system. During this era of the classical gold standard, the definition of the currency value in terms of gold—the so-called mint-par—gave rise to officially fixed exchange rates. Nevertheless, the rates on the foreign exchange markets did move to some degree. One reason was that international gold shipments, which enforced the mint-par, were costly, wherefore the market exchange rate could fluctuate within a band of gold-arbitrage inactivity (see e.g. Clare 1895, ch. 7). An ongoing debate is still trying to determine the width of this band, which was delimited by the so-called gold-points. There are several reasons why this {{has turned out to be}} challenging including the numerous, time-varying cost components to transport gold across countries (Clare 1902, pp. 78 – 79; Canjels et al. 2004, p. 869), or the complications arising when triangular gold arbitrage is possible (Coleman 2007). 1 To nevertheless provide some rough values, for the French and the Belgian franc, contemporaneous sources set the upper and lower gold-points at, respectively, 25.12 Fcs/£ and 25.32 Fcs/£ (Clare 1895, p. 126; Tate 1908, p. 51), for the Dutch guilder at 12.05 Fl/£ and 12.15 Fl/£ (Tate, 1908, p. 328), and for the German mark at 20.32 M/£ and 20.53 M./£ (Clare 1895, p. 131) reflecting deviations of between 0.2 and 0.7 per cent from the mint-pars of, respectively, 25.22 Fcs/£, 12.07 Fl/£, and 20.43 M/£. Furthermore, even in its heyday, the gold standard was not a homogeneous system. In Europe, Britain and Germany came closest to the theoretical ideal of a freely convertible monometallic currency backed by gold, followed by Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, where the conversion of the local currency into gold was subject to some restrictions (see Eichengreen 2008, pp. 20 ff.). Still, for decades, these relatively wealthy and financially advanced European nation states managed to anchor the exchange rate to the mint-par, which arguably implied that the remaining, small fluctuations on the foreign exchange market were primarily a reaction to international differences in interest (discount) rates (Clare 1902, p. 94). Conversely, the currency systems of other European countries were at most incompletely associated with the gold standard. For example, aside from a short period in the 1880 s, the Italian mint-par of 25.22 lire/£ was never officially instituted (Eichengreen 2008, p. 17). In Spain, Portugal, or Russia, substantial parts of the currency consisted of <b>inconvertible</b> paper <b>money</b> (Clare 1895, pp. 157 – 160). Austria-Hungary had essentially a freely floating currency until the end of the 1880 s, and undertook several monetary reforms during the 1890 s to gradually stabilise the exchange rate against gold around the year 1900 (see Von Mises 1909; Flandreau and Komlos 2006). The exchange rates of all these countries were relatively instable (Einzig 1962, 198 – 199) and reacted to fluctuations in international trade, or changes in foreign indebtedness (Clare 1902, p. 94).|$|R
