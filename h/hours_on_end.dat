25|$|The {{treatment}} for tuberculosis {{during this time}} was isolation (hence the sanatoria) and artificial pneumothorax or lung compression. In December 1944 Madonna Swan {{was taken to the}} Sioux Sanatorium in Rapid City, SD. During her many years at the San, as it was referred to, Madonna was treated for her TB by the placement of bean bags on her chest while lying flat on the back for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> This was the way that pneumothorax or lung compression was accomplished. The thought being that the collapsing of the lung would kill the mycobacterium tuberculosis by eliminating the air which the bacterium needed to grow, an idea supported by observations by the Italian physician Carlo Forlanini. This treatment did not however provide a cure for Madonna Swan.|$|E
25|$|The empress {{developed}} extremely {{rigorous and}} disciplined exercise habits. Every castle {{she lived in}} was equipped with a gymnasium, the Knights' Hall of the Hofburg was converted into one, mats and balance beams were installed in her bedchamber {{so that she could}} practise on them each morning, and the imperial villa at Ischl was fitted with gigantic mirrors so that she could correct every movement and position. She took up fencing in her 50s with equal discipline. A fervent horsewoman, she rode every day for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> becoming probably the world's best, as well as best-known, female equestrian at the time. When, due to sciatica, she could no longer endure long hours in the saddle, she substituted walking, subjecting her attendants to interminable marches and hiking tours in all weather.|$|E
25|$|Conditions in {{the factory}} were not agreeable, however. The main problem was that several foremen and {{departmental}} heads regarded workers as still being in the army – which they were, but only in theory, since most had been officially ‘discharged’ as unfit for active service at the front. These bosses ruled the workshops under the full might of military law. One of the main clauses of that military law insisted the men should wear military uniform at all times. ‘At all times’ meant everywhere except in the home – {{on the streets of}} the village, going out into Birtley itself (with appropriate military pass) and above all at work, even if that necessitated working for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> next to one of the furnaces operating at several hundred degrees.|$|E

A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away {{with a wave of}} his hand when I mentioned it.

25|$|Hippie Hill {{has also}} been part of San Francisco’s history, namely the Summer of Love, which was a large {{counterculture}} movement that partially took part on the hill. During this Summer of Love, people gathered together to {{connect with one another}} in many ways, mainly dropping acid and playing music together. Music has its own history on the hill, with musicians and bands like Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and George Harrison playing music for free to the public. Improvised drum circles still form on the weekends where people come together and fill the park with a constant beat for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> The hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs because the police had employed a policy of looking the other way {{when it came to the}} hill.|$|E

It was also announced that Williams would perform hit singles from his solo career during the tour. The band then played at some of the biggest venues across Europe for the second leg of the tour. The phenomenal demand for tickets across the country led to the web sites of all the major UK ticket suppliers either crashing or considerably slowing for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> The demand and sheer volume of fans also created problems for the UK telephone network. Take That's Progress Live also broke all records for ticket sales selling over 1.1million tickets in one day, smashing the previous box office record set by Take That's Circus tour in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Tendulkar {{played as}} a youngster with his brother, Ajit, for Sahitya Sahawas society’s cricket team at Bandra East. Ajit is {{credited}} by Sachin for playing {{a pivotal role in}} his life. Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin {{on the top of the}} stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions. He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann's {{closest friend}} in the United States was {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam. A later friend of Ulam's, Gian-Carlo Rota, wrote: [...] "They would spend <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> gossiping and giggling, swapping Jewish jokes, and drifting {{in and out of}} mathematical talk." [...] When von Neumann was dying in hospital, every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend. He believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively, and he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved, and know the answer immediately upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more of an aural one.|$|E

In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a [...] "settled and unremovable melancholy", and sat motionless on a cushion for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end.</b> When Robert Cecil {{told her that she}} must go to bed, she snapped [...] "Must is not a word to use to princes, little man".

500|$|Garland {{always had}} a large base of fans in the gay community, which {{includes}} Wainwright, who identifies as gay and came out to his parents {{at the age of}} 14. A connection is frequently drawn between the timing of Garland's death and funeral, in June 1969, and the Stonewall riots, the flashpoint of the modern Gay Liberation movement. Coincidental or not, the proximity of Garland's death to Stonewall has become a part of LGBT history and lore. Wainwright, having been called the [...] "first post-liberation era gay pop star", was obsessed with The Wizard of Oz (1939) as a child and would dress in his mother's gown, [...] "pretend to be either the Wicked Witch – melting for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> – or the Good Witch, depending on his mood".

500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25.

Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end,</b> and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch.

[...] She noted the attorney general's comment that Miranda warnings had not deterred terrorism suspects such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and Faisal Shahzad from talking and providing [...] "valuable intelligence". The positive observation was a reflection upon attempts by Congress to amend Miranda legislatively, that the decision [...] "sends a strong signal" [...] that [...] "the Supreme Court is not shy about curtailing Miranda protections, even without prodding from Congress". She concluded that [...] "hile it might look with hostility on congressional attempts {{to rein in the}} scope of the Miranda rule, the Supreme Court itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that Miranda affords criminal defendants. And it is willing to reach relatively far to do so." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos {{to become}} an {{associate}} professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. [...] In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of encephalitis, which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. [...] During his recuperation, many friends visited, including Nicholas Metropolis from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician Paul Erdős, who remarked: [...] "Stan, you are just like before." [...] This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. [...] Another friend, Gian-Carlo Rota, asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam's personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and biology; Rota also cites Ulam's former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation.

Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to “dance around like a gorilla, and we’d all knock our heads together.” As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group, and was invited to sing a speciality number called [...] "Peppermint Twist" [...] (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.

6000|$|The scrambling, inconsequential, {{unsatisfactory}} action which ensued is {{as difficult}} to describe as {{it must have been}} to direct. The Boer front covered some seven or eight miles, with kopjes, like chains of fortresses, between. They formed a huge semicircle of which our advance was the chord, and they were able from this position to pour in a converging artillery fire which grew steadily hotter as the day advanced. In {{the early part of the}} day our forty-two guns, working furiously, though with a want of accuracy which may be due to those errors of refraction which are said to be common in the limpid air of the veld, preserved their superiority. There appears to have been a want of concentration about our fire, and at some periods of the action each particular battery was firing at some different point of the Boer half-circle. Sometimes for an <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>end</b> the Boer reply would die away altogether, only to break out with augmented violence, and with an accuracy which increased our respect for their training. Huge shells--the largest that ever burst upon a battlefield--hurled from distances which were unattainable by our fifteen-pounders, enveloped our batteries in smoke and flame. One enormous Creusot gun on Pepworth Hill threw a 96-pound shell a distance of four miles, and several 40-pound howitzers outweighted our field guns. And on the same day on which we were so roughly taught how large the guns were which labour and good will could haul on to the field of battle, we learned also that our enemy--to the disgrace of our Board of Ordnance be it recorded--was more in touch with modern invention than we were, and could show us not only the largest, but also the smallest, shell which had yet been used.
