500|$|Cresswell was not {{buried at}} Knockholt and was {{possibly}} interred in the Bridewell graveyard. Several accounts claim {{that in her}} will she left £10 for a sermon to be read that said nothing ill of her. After a long search, a young clergyman prepared to perform the funeral rites was found. Following a lengthy sermon on social morality, he intoned: [...] "By {{the will of the}} deceased it is expected that I should mention <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> nothing but what was well of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this– she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born with the name of Cresswell, lived at Clerkenwell, and died in Bridewell." ...|$|E
2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys look at <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} {{that came out of}} my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E

6000|$|Richard Talbot, however, {{had seen}} the packet which his wife was holding, and her anxious, perplexed countenance, and the perilous {{atmosphere}} of suspicion around him made it incumbent on him to turn to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "What means this, mother?

60|$|She {{went into}} her room, {{and closed the door}} on us. I could bear it no longer. I got up, with the firm {{resolution}} in me to follow <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> the words which he had failed to say for himself.

60|$|Never {{again will}} Shelton breathe the perfume of melons and pineapples without a strange emotion.
