An investigation was conducted to determine engine pegormance under high b. m. e. p. conditions and this paper presents results of the experimental part of the research programme. Test work was carried out on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with an <b>independent</b> <b>pressure-charging</b> facility. Boost pressure ratios up to 6. 2 : 1 were used with the geometric compression ratio reduced, in stages, to 8 : 1, to limit peak cylinder pressure. Power levels up to 35. 4 bar b. m. e. p. were produced. NOTATION extend the range, acceptance of higher firing pressures AFR BDC b. m. e. p. b. s. a. c. b. s. f. c...|$|E
