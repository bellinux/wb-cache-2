The case study is completed for the satisfaction of the electricity consumption of global system for mobile communication base station (GSM) at Izmir Institute of Technology Campus Area, Urla, Izmir, Turkey.

40|$|The present article {{analyses}} {{the potential}} contribution of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> in a scenario {{with a high}} deployment of wind farms. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> consists of a small/mediumsized nuclear reactor (SMR), a biomass processing plant and an optional hydrogen production plant. The SMR operates at full power constantly {{and is able to}} switch its thermal output to supply steam for electricity generation or to supply the biomass production plant for heat processes. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> management is electricity load following, so the sum of the electricity generated by both the <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> and the aggregated wind farm tends to meet electricity demand. The hydrogen production plant is considered as an electricity consumer and operates during times of wind power surplus. Wind farm capacities of 100 - 2000 MW were investigated. For these, the optimal SMR size in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> varies from 200 to 300 MWe. The increase in SMR size is limited due to the maximum heat demand for the biomass processing plant, which is 1033 GWhth annually (expected heat for biomass processing within a radius of 80 km). For a 1000 MW wind farm, the (standard) deviations between wind farm output and demand are reduced by 32 percentage points with the aid of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> without the hydrogen production plant.

Lack of electrical grid access to rural and remote areas cause the companies to expend high operational cost for operation of telecommunication base stations full time on diesel generators, which causes considerable economical disadvantage and adverse effects to the environment due to heavy emission of green house gasses. Hybrid energy systems using renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass and micro-hydro are recognized and recently widely accepted as a viable alternative to grid supply to provide electricity to remote areas, where grid extension is not feasible or economical, as the new hybrid systems are becoming more economical than the standalone renewable energy generating methods.
