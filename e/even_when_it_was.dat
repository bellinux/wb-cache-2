25|$|On 9 January 1904 Wales again faced England {{during the}} Home Nations Championship. The referee for that match was a Mr. Findlay of the Scottish Rugby Union, whose {{interpretation}} of the rules was so confusing the Welsh players gave away eleven penalties, seven within goal range, before the first half. Owen decided that rather than give any further dubious penalties away, he allowed his English counterpart to put the ball into scrums <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a Welsh put-in.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 {{the ballet}} was {{widely seen as}} having choreography and décor in harmony with each other but {{fighting}} with the music; now it's the choreography and the music which seem to speak the same language, while the sets look not only backward but to the north. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> revived in 1988, it was hailed neither as a disaster nor as a lost masterpiece. Henze's modern music is also perceived {{as a reason for}} the few performances of this ballet before its revival in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Lehi prisoners {{captured}} by the British generally refused to present a defence when brought to trial. They would only read out statements in which they declared that the court, representing an occupying force, had no jurisdiction over them and therefore was illegal. For the same reason, Lehi prisoners refused to plead for amnesty, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear that this would have spared them the death penalty. In one case Moshe Barazani, a Lehi member, and Meir Feinstein, an Irgun member, committed suicide in prison with a grenade smuggled inside an orange so the British could not hang them.|$|E

25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{supposed to work}} with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The {{reason for this is}} that the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E
25|$|The {{fine point}} of what {{constitutes}} an asterism {{may be seen in}} two examples. Theta Orionis (θ Ori) is embedded in, and illuminates, the Orion Nebula (M42). Looked at telescopically, it resolved into four stars arranged in a trapezoid, and they were nicknamed the Trapezium. The asterism retained this name <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> discovered that there were yet more stars in the group. However, it has since been determined that the Orion Nebula is a stellar nursery and that the Trapezium is actually an Open Cluster. Thus it is no longer an asterism. On the other hand, M73 in Aquarius, which was thought to be an Open Cluster, turns out to be composed of unrelated stars, and may now be considered to be an asterism.|$|E

He was involved in several issues: consolidating the Party's authority and creating and developing the Kataeb Regulatory Forces {{in an atmosphere of}} discipline. William Hawi’s responsibilities increased and became diversified. He was appointed Head of the Second and Fourth Districts, President of the Recruitment Bureau in 1942, Head of the 'Department of Security, Sport and Mobilization' on May 29, 1952, and member of the Political Bureau on July 12, 1952. On June 16, 1958, {{he was in charge of}} organizing and leading the activists during the Lebanese events; this constituted the hub of the Party's Regulatory Forces, of which he became the leader on February 6, 1961.|$|E

25|$|It {{was later}} {{realised}} that the spiral-scan did provide angle-off information, through simple geometry and timing. Since the radar beam had a finite width, about five degrees, it would see some return {{even when the}} target was not centred in the beam. A target far from the centreline would only be illuminated when the dish was pointed in that direction while rotating rapidly away from it. The result as a short arc on the display about 10 degrees long. A target closer to the centre, say five degrees to port, would be illuminated strongly when the dish was pointed to the left, but still receive a small signal <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pointed to the right. That meant it produced a varying return almost through the entire rotation, creating a much longer arc, or a complete circle if the target was dead ahead.|$|E
25|$|From 1971, ADMARC subsidised {{fertilizer}} {{for every}} farmer. Estates benefited most, as tobacco needed more fertilizer than maize did. Estates also {{had access to}} credit and, without this, few smallholders could buy enough fertilizer, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> subsidised. After 1985, declining world tobacco prices and supporting the estates made ADMARC insolvent. The Malawi government agreed to partially privatise it to obtain World Bank loans. It also lost the power to invest in new development projects, but remained {{under the influence of}} the government.The World Bank required a phased elimination of fertilizer subsidies, which decreased from 30.5% in 1983/84 to 19.8% in 1987/88. A complete withdrawal of these subsidies prevented 75% of smallholders buying fertilizer in 1988/89: a 25% subsidy was restored for 1989/90 and 1990/91 but removed in 1991/92. A temporary 11% subsidy was provided from 1992/93 to 1994/95 only.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s rule {{changes were}} {{introduced}} to try and limit the effect the loose forwards were having on back play. There was no obligation to bind to a scrum for flankers at this time. The offside line was dictated by {{the position of the}} ball <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the scrum, and so when it emerged {{at the back of the}} scrum the scrum-half would often find the opposition flankers and scrum-half arriving with it. The new offside line became the hindmost foot of the scrum. Only the opposition scrum-half could move forward of that point, and all flankers had to stay bound unless they remained behind the hindmost foot of the scrum. Another rule change introduced allowed the number 8 or the rear-most bound forward to detach from a scrum with the ball, previously it could only be retrieved by the scrum-half.|$|E

Butler focused on a New York–based [...] "Astor House Group", supposedly led by political boss and editor Thurlow Weed. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler {{went so far as to}} imprison Woolley in the Capitol building [...] when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.|$|E
500|$|Operationally, {{the battle}} proved to the Australian high command how {{effective}} armour could be {{when used in}} close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication. The use of machine gun carriers {{to carry out the}} wounded had also been quite effective. While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result. Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity.|$|E
500|$|Joanna Bullivant, {{writing in}} Music and Letters, {{maintains}} {{that in his}} music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism.

[...] The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> entirely out of fashion, he [...] "attempt to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future". [...] Hall describes Bush as [...] "a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics." ...|$|E

500|$|Adopting {{the color}} of their {{favorite}} charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty to that particular racer or faction. Many of the young men in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, [...] "Hunnic" [...] hair-styles, and [...] "Persian" [...] facial hair. There is evidence that these young men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans didn't change their allegiance to their color.|$|E
500|$|The newly {{organized}} CL initially {{operated a}} main line from Court Street in Cincinnati to Dayton, leasing the track from Dodds to Lebanon Junction from the Cincinnati Division trustees, and trackage rights over the Dayton and Ironton Railroad (the old [...] narrow gauge D line) into Dayton. But {{the latter was}} converted to [...] in April 1887, and CL service was cut back to Dodds, since the operations north of there were unprofitable <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> able to reach Dayton. (The line from Lebanon to Dodds was leased in 1892 to the company organized to operate north of Dodds.) Avondale Branch operations were discontinued in August 1889, due to competition from the cheaper Mt. Auburn Cable Railway. Under Hafer's leadership, new passenger and freight depots opened {{on the north side}} of Court Street in December 1885. In preparation for conversion to standard gauge, the CL relaid rail and replaced bridges, including a straight trestle in the Deer Creek Valley, completed in January 1889, in place of a curving old narrow gauge structure. The first standard gauge rails were laid by August 1889 as part of a dual gauge setup south of Idlewild, when the Ohio and North Western Railroad (O, successor to the C), which had converted its line to standard gauge, moved its trains from the Little Miami Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad system) back to the CL Several months later, a third rail was laid north to East Norwood, allowing the O to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad (successor to the M). After undertaking more improvements to the alignment, the company completed the conversion of the main line to Lebanon to standard gauge on September 16, 1894, although, until it acquired a full set of standard gauge equipment, much of the commuter service to Blue Ash continued to use the narrow gauge tracks.|$|E
