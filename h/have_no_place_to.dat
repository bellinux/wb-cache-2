25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
500|$|Discussing public {{response}} to his character, Criss stated that he particularly enjoyed comments from [...] "people from {{parts of the world}} who are maybe not as exposed to certain ideologies", but had reconsidered their stance on relationships and human rights {{as a result of the}} Blaine–Kurt storyline. He called this response [...] "phenomenal", and said: [...] "I was a straight kid growing up in a very gay community and it's something that I've had to watch so many friends have to struggle with and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go to identify in kind of a grander media culture. To be a small piece of that machine is incredibly wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|At the party, Leslie discovers Andy and April plan to {{surprise}} everyone by getting married that night. Leslie {{spends most of}} the party trying to dissuade them, since they have been dating {{less than a month}} and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live. However, Ron believes it is not Leslie's place to interfere with their decision. Tom (Aziz Ansari) is thrilled when Andy makes him his best man, but his excitement lessens when Andy also asks Ron, Chris, and several others to be his [...] "best men". Tom tries to throw an impromptu bachelor party and give a speech to make himself the [...] "best" [...] best man, but fails each time.|$|E

500|$|The {{centre of}} {{assembly}} houses a black granite cube– a symbolic altar with engraving from Book of Job16:18 [...] "Earth, don't cover my blood. Let my cry <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> rest." [...] in Latvian, Russian, German, and Hebrew languages. The immediate area {{is surrounded by}} 4,000 granite stones arranged in a grid of forty-five [...] squares, and resembles a traditional Jewish cemetery. The unique rough-hewn [...] high granite stones of black, gray, and reddish colors come from Zhytomyr region in Ukraine. The stones are carved with European city names representing the home towns of the victims. The entrances to the memorial and other grave sites in the forest are marked with concrete pillars with symbols representing various groups of the fallen– Star of David representing Jews, Crown of Thorns representing war prisoners, and Christian cross representing civilians. Historians from the New Synagogue Berlin– Centrum Judaicum, educational establishment House of the Wannsee Conference, and historians from the member cities have documented the names of over 31,000 victims, published in Book of Remembrance: The German, Austrian and Czechoslovakian Jews deported to the Baltic States (2003).|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season, {{there was talk}} about {{creating}} a new series based on the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen character. Hartley refused {{to talk about the}} possibility of a spin-off during the filming of the sixth season out of respect for his role on Smallville. The actor felt he should respect what Smallville had accomplished in five seasons, and not [...] "steal the spotlight" [...] by thinking he was better than he was just because there was [...] "talk" [...] of a spin-off after only two appearances on the show. According to Hartley, [...] "talking" [...] was as far as the spin-off ever got. According to Gough, the Green Arrow spin-off would have introduced the idea of Oliver acting in more of a [...] "Professor X" [...] role, where he takes in people with superpowers who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go and trains them. The series would have used characters that would be more easily cleared by the film division at Warner Bros. As DeKnight clarified, the series would have featured the introduction of new characters—some from the Teen Titans and others from the DC Comics Universe—as well as going into more depth for the background story of its primary characters, like Bart, Victor, and Arthur. As with the other potential series, this one never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{homeless}} people keep all their possessions {{with them because}} they have no access to storage. There was also the reality of the [...] "bag" [...] people, the shopping cart people, and the soda can collectors (known as binners or dumpster divers) who sort through garbage to find items to sell, trade and eat. These people carry around all of their possessions with them all the time because they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store them. If they had no access to or capability to get to a shelter and possible bathing, or access to toilets and laundry facilities, their hygiene was lacking. This again creates social tensions in public places.|$|E
50|$|After the Public Dance Halls Act 1936, that outlawed the {{traditional}} country house dances, most musicians suddenly <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> gather and play. The band was a community-based band {{in a rural}} tradition.|$|R

2500|$|The UN {{described}} {{the situation as}} a [...] "critical protection crisis". The entire civilian population in the Gaza strip remains vulnerable, the UN reported, with no safe haven, no bomb shelters and with closed borders, {{making it one of}} the rare conflicts where civilians <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> flee. There is a sense of [...] "panic, fear and distress" [...] throughout the whole strip. Civilians have implemented a self-imposed curfew since no public warning systems or effective shelters exist. People have been evacuating their homes and staying in streets for long hours exposed to further danger, or staying with relatives. Civilians face insecurities while re-stocking basic food items, water and cooking gas. Children, 56% of the population, have no outlets and they remain [...] "dangerously exposed" [...] to the fighting around them.|$|E
2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path. If asked where she lived, she reflected, must not she {{be able to answer}} with Christ, [...] "The foxes have their lairs, the birds of heaven their nests, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> rest my head." [...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E

[...] The WRA gave each person $25 ($ today), one-way train or bus fare, and meals to those who had less than $600 ($ today). [...] While many left the camp voluntarily, a significant number refused to leave because they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go after <b>having</b> lost everything when they were forcibly uprooted and removed from their homes.
