50|$|The crash {{occurred}} on the motorway <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> connecting the westbound M4 motorway to the northbound (clockwise) M25 motorway, at approximately {{the point where the}} <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> merges with the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the eastbound M4. At this point the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> is on a downhill gradient with a right turn with decreasing radius, necessitating a posted advisory speed limit of 40 mph.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} project has brought fresh {{knowledge of the}} efficiency and traffic quality of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> at multilevel junctions. The results were obtained from observations of the traffic flow at <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to urban expressways (Class B). Various types were studied: single-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane and three-lane main roads (type E 1 /E 2) and two-lane <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> to two-lane main roads (type E 4 /E 5). Speeds were always restricted to 80 km/h or 100 km/h at the measuring points observed.

5|$|Strensham {{services}} are located {{slightly to the}} north of M5 junction 8, the exit <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the southbound area merges into the <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> from the M5 to junction 8, so traffic must negotiate junction 8 to rejoin the M5. Northbound the service area is about a mile north of the junction.|$|R
25|$|The {{northbound}} entry <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> at Lancaster (junction 34) {{was unusually}} short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune {{at this point}} and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer <b>slip</b> <b>road.</b> This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.|$|R

40|$|The Purpose of this Bachelor thesis was to {{find out}} the traffic {{accidents}} occurrence on the road R 10. This road was renamed as Highway D 10 since the 1 st January 2016. Highway R 10 begins in Prague and its finish is in Turnov. I focused the traffic accidents, which are related to <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits in year 2013. For the research I used the geographic information system ArcGIS, where I exactly drew the accidents on the highway. Information about the accidents I received from the sources from Police of the Czech Republic. I selected only the accidents, which are related to the highway´s <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits. Based on the analyses I found out, how the length of <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exists is to the number of the traffic accidents in these highway sections. Discovered facts could be helpful for projecting of the new <b>slip</b> <b>roads</b> and exits or for adjustments of the existing sections as well...|$|R

Before the completion of Junction 2, southbound traffic left the motorway via a <b>slip</b> <b>road</b> which passed {{around the back of}} the now disused homebase and under the A41/A1 Mill Hill Bypass and looped round to join it at Fiveways Interchange.
