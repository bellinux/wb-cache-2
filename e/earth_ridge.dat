The effect would have been similar to that seen in <b>Earth's</b> oceanic <b>ridges.</b> These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal flexing exerted by Jupiter. Because Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, and therefore always maintains the same approximate orientation towards Jupiter, the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa's fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa's surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on Europa's outer ice crust. Comparisons of Voyager and Galileo spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage. [...] The full revolution of the outer rigid shell relative to the interior of Europa occurs over a minimum of 12,000 years. Studies of Voyager and Galileo images have revealed evidence of subduction on Europa's surface, suggesting that, just as the cracks are analogous to ocean ridges, so plates of icy crust analogous to tectonic plates on Earth are recycled into the molten interior.

These are biased estimates. Based on unbiased statistics, many of the so-called high^(- 3) He hotspot regions have isotopic ratios well within the MORB range, and all have absolute ^ 3 He concentrations much less than MORB. The high variance of some oceanic-island data compared to MORB reflects, in part, the difference between a small sample and a large sample, and magma-chamber processes. Values of 11 to 15 Ra are commonly attributed to deep mantle plumes and “indicative of lower mantle involvement,” but these values are within 2 σ of the mean and are not exceptional. Much higher values combined with low absolute helium concentrations are commonly associated with the onset of rifting, or volcanism, and may reflect a shallow, or lithospheric, low^(- 238) U/^ 3 He (LONU) source. The temporal progression to average MORB-like values suggests that the bulk of the magmas at spreading ridges and large oceanic constructs comes from below the LONU level.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} illustrate the problems posed by such an approach. We present a de-tailed study of the MOC narrow angle image E 01 - 01773, taken at 83. 5 oN/ 241. 4 oW in the upper part of a 300 km-long depression situated at the edge of the northern polar ice cap. On Mars, every depression resembling a valley is a “chas-ma”, and as this one has no official name, we suggest to call it “West Olympia Chasma ” (WOC). By analyzing the satel-lite image, we have been able to highlight some unusual features of martian glacial geomorphology and to compare them with topographies and sediments known in terrestrial glacial environments. In particular: – the scarp cutting the edge of the ice cap above the chasma is formed of thin alternations of ice and aerosols and is bordered by numerous small and dissymetrical ridges that run parallel to it.

40|$|Repeated shifts, or jumps, of {{mid-ocean ridge}} {{segments}} toward nearby hot spots can produce large, long-term {{changes to the}} geometry and location of the tectonic plate boundaries. Ridge jumps associated with hot spot–ridge interaction are likely caused by several processes including shear {{on the base of}} the plate due to expanding plume material as well as reheating of lithosphere as magma passes through it to feed off-axis volcanism. To study how these processes influence ridge jumps, we use numerical models to simulate 2 -D (in cross section) viscous flow of the mantle, viscoplastic deformation of the lithosphere, and melt migration upward from the asthenospheric melting zone, laterally along the base of the lithosphere, and vertically through the lithosphere. The locations and rates that magma penetrates and heats the lithosphere are controlled by the time-varying accumulation of melt beneath the plate and the depth-averaged lithospheric porosity. We examine the effect of four key parameters: magmatic heating rate of the lithosphere, plate spreading rate, age of the seafloor overlying the plume, and the plume-ridge migration rate. Results indicate that the minimum value of the magmatic heating rate needed to initiate a ridge jump increases with plate age and spreading rate. The time required to complete a ridge jump decreases with larger values of magmatic heating rate, younger plate age, and faster spreading rate. For cases with migrating ridges, models predict a range of behaviors including repeating ridge jumps, much like those exhibited on <b>Earth.</b> Repeating <b>ridge</b> jumps occur at moderate magmatic heating rates and are the result of changes in the hot spot magma flux in response to magma migration along the base of an evolving lithosphere. The tendency of slow spreading to promote ridge jumps could help explain the observed clustering of hot spots near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Model results also suggest that magmatic heating may significantly thin the lithosphere, as has been suggested at Hawaii and other hot spots...|$|R

40|$|Marine {{scientific}} research (MSR), involving {{the study of}} hydrothermal vent systems and their associated biological communities, is {{of some of the}} most exciting scientific work currently being undertaken. It is generally recognised that the discovery of chemosynthetic-based ecosystems at hydrothermal vents on the deep seabed was one of the most important findings in biological science in the latter half of the 20 th century. Hydrothermal vents [...] underwater water circulatory systems driven by sub-surface volcanic activity [...] are primarily concentrated along the <b>earth's</b> Mid-oceanic <b>Ridge,</b> a 60, 000 kilometre seam of geological activity. Their warm, chemical-laden, waters support some of the planet's most productive and densely populated marine biological communities, despite extreme conditions of high pressure, toxicity and darkness. Though deep sea hydrothermal vents are typically low in biodiversity at the macro-organism level, they tend to exhibit high endemism at taxonomic levels higher than species. In contrast, they host one of the highest levels of microbial diversity on the planet. It is thought that hundreds if not thousands of hydrothermal vent sites may exist along the Mid-oceanic Ridge. But they are extremely hard to find and only approximately 100 sites have been documented by researchers to date. Of these, perhaps only about 12 sites [...] located within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction in the International Seabed Area (the Area) [...] are regularly visited for MSR purposes, primarily because of their proximity to land-based facilities and their relative ease of accessibility. Despite the appearance of physical isolation and their apparent inaccessibility under thousands of metres of water, the more accessible deep sites are potentially threatened by human activities. The activities most likely to involve hydrothermal vents and their biological communities are seabed mining for associated polymetallic sulphide deposits, submarine-based tourism and MSR. Of these, ironically, MSR poses the most immediate threat to the most visited hydrothermal vent systems and their associated biological communities. As a natural resource-based activity MSR needs to be placed on a sustainable footing in order to conserve biodiversity and maintain the scientific value of the most accessible sites. This article will focus on the tools available to place MSR on a more sustainable footing at hydrothermal vents located within and beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.

40|$|Earth’s {{sea floor}} is created along great {{volcanic}} ridges that spread at rates {{of a few}} centimeters per year beneath every ocean basin. The volcanic and tectonic processes at these mid-ocean ridges ultimately determine {{the characteristics of the}} sea floor and the oceanic crust beneath it. These processes occur beneath several kilometers of rock and seawater, seemingly far removed from climatic variations above sea level. Thus, it is surprising that both Crowley et al. (1), in this week’s Science Express, and Tolstoy (2) found ice age periodicity in hilly topography on the flanks of ridges submerged beneath the Southern and Pacific Oceans. After its creation at the mid-ocean <b>ridges,</b> <b>Earth’s</b> sea floor forms the abyssal hills (see the figure). If we could view this terrain without its cover of water, it would appear as gentle rolling hills hundreds of meters high and spaced kilometers apart. The abyssal hills are oriented roughly par-allel to the ridges where they are formed and are carried across the ocean basins by seafloor spreading. Over the course of tens of millions of years, the abyssal hills become buried by sediments, but they are nevertheless observable in bathymetric surveys across vast expanses of sea floor (3). This coverage makes the abyssal hills the most extensive geological feature on Earth, but their remoteness means that they remain largely unexplored and poorly un-derstood. Detailed bathymetric surveys, obtained using so-nar that images a swath of sea floor beneath a ship, have only been obtained for {{a small portion of the}} sea floor. Close examination of these images informs our understanding of how the abyssal hills are created. In particular, extensional faults associated with mid-ocean ridge rifting are thought to be important (4). Such faults are observable in bathymetric surveys of newly created abyssal hills near ridge crests and are prevalent in computer models of rifting (5). Comprehensive bathymetry of the Australian-Antarctic ridge south of Tasmania, observed from a South Korean ice-breaker, allowed Crowley et al. to examine an unusually long record of abyssal hill fabric.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the controls on organic, inorganic, and volatile species distributions in hydrothermal fluids venting at Von Damm and Piccard, two recently discovered vent fields at the ultra slow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise, <b>Earth's</b> deepest mid-ocean <b>ridge.</b> A {{wide variety of}} possible temperatures and substrates for fluid/rock reaction exist at ultraslow spreading ridges. The flux of chemicals delivered to the ocean by circulating vent fluids exerts a major control on mass transfer {{into and out of}} the oceanic crust and supports chemosynthetic ecosystems. In Chapter 2, abiotic organic synthesis is shown to occur via two distinct mechanisms in the serpentinizing Von Damm system. Longstanding questions concerning the spatial, temporal, and mechanistic nature of carbon transformations in deep-sea hot springs are addressed. In contrast with the current paradigm, CH 4 is not actively forming during circulation of H 2 -rich vent fluids, but instead is derived from fluid inclusions in the host rocks. Chapters 3 and 4 present in-depth studies of the chemical and isotopic compositions of aqueous species in vent fluids at Von Damm and Piccard to elucidate the role of reaction temperature, pressure, substrate composition, and water/rock mass ratios during the chemical evolution of hydrothermal fluids at oceanic spreading centers. At Von Damm, sequential reaction of gabbroic and peridotite substrates at intermediate temperatures can explain generation of the observed fluids. Geochemical modeling shows that talc-quartz assemblage is expected to precipitate during fluid mixing with seawater at the seafloor. At Piccard, extremely high temperature subsurface water/rock reaction results in high temperature fluids that are richer in dissolved H 2 than any previously observed fluids worldwide. At both locations, high-H 2 conditions promote the abiotic reduction of [Epsilon]CO 2 to formate species, which may fuel a subsurface biosphere. In Chapter 5, multiple sulfur isotopes were measured on metal sulfide deposits, So, and fluid H 2 S to constrain sulfur sources and the isotopic systematics of precipitation in a wide variety of seafloor hydrothermal vents. Areas studied include the eastern Manus Basin and Lau Basin back-arc spreading centers, the unsedimented basalt-hosted Southern East Pacific Rise, and the sediment-hosted Guaymas Basin mid-ocean ridge spreading centers. Limited isotope fractionation between fluid H 2 S and precipitating chalcopyrite implies that sulfur isotopes in a chimney lining may record past hydrothermal activity. by Jill Marie McDermott.
