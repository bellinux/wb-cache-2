40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} effects of audit {{guidance}} and estimation uncertainty on auditors’ confirmation bias and professional skepticism when evaluating fair value estimates. Fair value estimation is becoming more prevalent in financial reporting frameworks, and regulators warn that fair value estimation presents higher risk of material misstatement when greater judgment in estimation is involved. In addition recent evidence from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) indicates that some auditors may not be exercising sufficient professional skepticism when performing audit procedures in higher risk areas of the audit. Martin et al. (2006) suggest that it may be the audit standards themselves that orient auditors toward biased evaluation of management’s estimates, suggesting that such <b>directional</b> audit <b>guidance</b> leads to confirmation bias. Further, it is possible that because of auditors’ intolerance for ambiguity, that a greater degree of estimation uncertainty exacerbates the bias. Thus, I examine whether <b>directional</b> audit <b>guidance</b> (e. g., support management’s estimate, and oppose management’s estimate) versus non-directional audit guidance (e. g., develop own estimate) affects auditors’ confirmation bias differentially under varying degrees of uncertainty (e. g., low vs. high), {{and the extent to which}} this bias increases or decreases professional skepticism. The results show that auditors exhibit the greatest confirmation bias when they are directed to oppose versus support management’s estimate or generate their own estimate, and that this bias increases the degree of professional skepticism exercised by auditors. Further, the greatest extent of confirmation bias resulted when auditors were directed to oppose management’s estimate and estimation uncertainty was high. This study sheds light on the effects of directional versus non-directional audit guidance in the presence of uncertainty and should be informative to standard setters and practitioners as they press forward in issuing new audit guidance related to the evaluation of fair value estimates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This work {{presents}} a new, non-invasive method for the discrete detection of combustion zone propagation in high energy materials – pyrotechnic compositions – {{by means of}} thermocouples bonded to the external, side surface of a pyrolytic graphite (pyrographite) tube filled with the pyrotechnic composition and ignited at the one end by a CO 2 laser. The thermocouples were positioned in a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pyrographite tube, which {{was used as a}} directional heat guide (thermal management) and a thermoresistant structure, enabling detection of the propagation of the combustion zone as a heat zone generated by the combustion, traveling on the outside surface of the pyrographite tube along its axis. Such a <b>directional</b> heat <b>guidance</b> was caused by the unique thermal conductivity anisotropy of pyrographite resulting in low thermal conductivity of the pyrographite tube along its axis and high thermal conductivity across the tube radius. The thermocouples detected passages of the outside heat zone that were equally time delayed in relation to the combustion zone inside the tube. Dividing the distance between the thermocouples by the time between their thermoelectric response to the same (corresponding) isotherm of the heat zone, gave the average burning rate of the high energy composition being tested over the distance between the thermocouples. The proposed procedure for burning rate determination was verified by numerical simulations...|$|R

This technology requires precise separation between the production well and the injection well to ensure the efficient drainage of the reservoir. By studying {{the attitude of the}} downhole probe tube and the production well trajectory, an algorithm is proposed for eliminating ferromagnetic interference while drilling injection wells. A high accuracy filter circuit has been designed to correct the detected magnetic signals, which are ultra-weak, frequency-instable, and narrow-band. The <b>directional</b> drilling magnetic <b>guidance</b> system (DD-MGS) has been developed by integrating these advanced techniques. It contains a sub-system for the ranging calculation software, a magnetic source, a downhole probe tube and a sub-system for collecting & processing the detected signals. The DD-MGS has succeeded in oilfield applications. It can guide the directional drilling trajectory not only in the horizontal section but also in the build section of horizontal injection wells. This new technology has broad potential applications.|$|R

40|$|Growth cones, the {{terminal}} structures of elongating neurites, use extracellular guidance information {{in order to}} navigate to appropriate target cells. The <b>directional</b> information of <b>guidance</b> cues is transduced to a cytoplasmic gradient of messenger molecules across the growth cone leading to rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. One messenger molecule regulating growth cone turning is cAMP, which is also known to be sufficient to direct growth cone attraction. Cytoplasmic cAMP gradients have been generated {{in the present study}} by photolysing caged cAMP with UV light focused on one side of growth cones of chick sensory neurons. Using this method we show that only specific time patterns of pulsed cAMP release are capable of inducing growth cone turning whereas others, which release the same amount of cAMP, are ineffective. Theoretical calculations show that diverse time patterns produce different intracellular gradients, which were visualized directly in HeLa cells expressing cAMP-sensitive ion channels as a reporter system. Together these data indicate that the spatiotemporal properties of the intracellular gradient are crucial for growth cone turning. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Type I {{lissencephaly}} is a cortical malformation disorder character-ized by disorganized cortical {{layers and}} gyral abnormalities and associated with severe cognitive impairment and epilepsy. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the epilepsy and mental retardation {{in this and}} related disorders remain unknown. Two genes, LIS 1 and doublecortin, have both {{been shown to be}} mutated in a large proportion of cases of type I lissencephaly and a milder allelic disorder, subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH). Studying the protein products of these genes and the biochemical pathways in which they belong is likely to yield important information concerning both normal and abnormal cortical development. The relationships between the LIS 1 and Doublecortin proteins are not yet well defined, but both are believed to {{play a critical role in}} cortical neuronal migration. Lis 1 is expressed from very early development in the mouse and in both proliferating cells and post-mitotic neurons of the cortex. This protein is likely to have multiple functions since it is a subunit of the enzyme platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, which degrades platelet activating factor, and has also been shown to be involved in microtubule dynamics, potentially influencing nuclear migration through its interaction with the dynein motor protein complex. Doublecortin on the other hand is exclusively expressed in post-mitotic neurons and is developmentally regulated. In young developing neurons Doublecortin has a specific subcellular localization at the ends of neuritic and leading processes. This localization, combined with our previous data showing that it is a microtubule-associated protein and that it interacts with adapter complexes involved in vesicle trafficking, suggests a role in the growth of neuronal processes, downstream of <b>directional</b> or <b>guidance</b> signals. The observations summarized here favor the suggestion that whereas LIS 1 may play a role in nuclear migration, Doublecortin is instead restricted to functions at the leading edge of the cell...|$|R
40|$|Hajj {{event is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} Islamic pillars that each Muslim, who could afford its’ expenses and are well bodied, should perform its’ rituals at least once in a lifetime. Therefore, they could travel to Mecca city, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj rituals. This holy city hosts this event annually in the last month of the Arabic calendar, which is Dhul Hijjah, and it lasts for 6 days. In addition, those Muslim visitors or pilgrims are obligated to be accommodated at Hajj ritual places, which are Arafat, Mina and Muzdalifah. However, in the last ten years, it was noticed that the Hajj events are crowded every year. Therefore, Hajj crowd management is being a complex task, due to the huge number of the pilgrims as they are crowded at the Hajj ritual places. This huge number is causing many problems, and Hajj authorities are facing difficulties in managing those crowded pilgrims. As a result, this research focuses on three main problems that occur at Hajj events. First, difficulties in organizing the crowds’ movements of the pilgrims, as Hajj events host enormous number of pilgrims in limited geographical spaces at the ritual places. This problem leads to overcrowdings, congestions and stampedes. Second, the pilgrims could get lost at Hajj ritual places, especially when they are moving between these places. Third, lack of <b>directional</b> information and <b>guidance</b> for those lost pilgrims. This problem leads to difficulties in finding their groups at the ritual sites, because the huge number of the pilgrims. Thus, this research proposes to deploy a technology, such as a Mobile Augmented Reality application. This application would assist the Hajj authorities (staff and operators) in managing the pilgrims’ movements between the ritual places, and to provide directions to the lost pilgrims. In addition, it would help those lost pilgrims by alerting, and sending their location information to their group guide. On the other hand, the research literature review covers previous studies about the Hajj crowd management, as it is divided into two perspectives. The theoretical perspective, which explains the crowd management steps that should be followed and applied, as these steps would help the Hajj authorities to succeed in crowd management at Hajj events. The practical perspective presents some studies that are related to the Hajj events. Those studies offered some solutions to manage crowded pilgrims, to avoid overcrowdings and stampedes, and to identify, locate and guide lost pilgrims. The solutions were Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) deceives and monitoring cameras. In addition, this research conducted and distributed questionnaires on 104 respondents. They were selected as they are related to Hajj events. The results of this research method confirmed that the Hajj events face problems. For example, overcrowdings, congestions and stampedes that occur at the ritual places, due to lack of pilgrims organization in limited spaces at these places. In addition, foreign pilgrims face difficulties in guidance, due to lack of directional information, and they could get lost from their groups at the Hajj events. In addition, the respondents suggested using technology to assist Hajj authorities in Hajj crowd management. Therefore, deploying MAR application is suggested, as a solution to solve or at least reduce the Hajj problems. The proposed application could help the Hajj authorities to manage the crowded pilgrims at the Hajj ritual places as this research illustrates two scenarios in Hajj crowd management. In conclusion, this application is beneficial and significant in crowd management at Hajj events, as it could provide instant information using high-speed process in sending and receiving information. In addition, the information about the pilgrims’ movements could be gathered, presented on smart devices and shared between applications’ users. Those users will be the Hajj staff on the ground and the Hajj operators in the control room of Hajj operations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{individuals}} evacuating, many multi-exit environments do {{not allow}} visibility of all the exits due to lineof-sight constraint. In addition, the environment can be dark or smoky, not allowing visibility to even a single exit. In such a situation, given that each individual in the crowd is accompanied with a helping device globally connected with a central server, a 'directional guidance ' towards an optimal exit is a real possibility. In this context, the 'occupant density' around exits (within a static ‘exit area’) {{has been used in}} conjunction with the corresponding distances to devise a probabilistic strategy for optimal exit suggestion [1]. In this paper, we related the exit area with the level of visibility of the environment (the more the visibility, the more the exit area and vice versa). In this way, a more realistic human-behavioral model is implemented in which an individual viewing (seeing) an exit would always direct towards that exit, irrespective of the <b>directional</b> <b>guidance</b> provided. When an individual is not at any of the exit areas (not viewing even a single exit), a <b>directional</b> <b>guidance</b> is provided assuming that the individual is adhering to it. Additionally we used the measure of 'effective throughput ' instead of occupant density, in conjunction with the corresponding distances. Through simulation results, we found a marked improvement in the evacuation time, when effective throughput was modeled instead of occupant density.

We provide definitive evidence for transcellular (i. e., through individual endothelial cells) diapedesis in vitro and demonstrate that virtually all, both para- and transcellular, diapedesis {{occurs in the}} context of a novel “cuplike” transmigratory structure. This endothelial structure was comprised of highly intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 – and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 –enriched vertical microvilli-like projections that surrounded transmigrating leukocytes and drove redistribution of their integrins into linear tracks oriented parallel to the direction of diapedesis.

A TAN is a topological structure containing many nodes, whose positions must be optimized while a predefined topology needs to be maintained.

40|$|The {{migration}} of border cells during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis {{is a simple}} and powerful system for studying invasive cell migration in vivo. Border cells are somatic cells that delaminate from the follicular epithelium of an egg chamber and invade the germ line cluster. They migrate between the nurse cells to reach the oocyte, using DE-cadherin for adhesion to the substratum. Border cells take approximately 6 h to migrate a distance of 100 microm. The migration is guided by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and PVR (platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) /vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor). Here, we show that a single long cellular extension (LCE), several cell diameters in length, is formed at the initiation of migration. The LCE may function as a 'pathfinder' in response to guidance cues. LCE growth requires <b>directional</b> <b>guidance</b> signals and specific adhesion to the substratum.
