5|$|A D-21 {{mounted on}} an M-21 began captive flight-testing on 22 December 1964. Aerodynamic covers were {{initially}} {{placed over the}} D-21's intake and exhaust to reduce drag, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> {{after the first few}} tests, as no way of discarding them at Mach 3 without damaging the drone or carrier plane could be devised.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{preparation}} problems surfaced {{before the start}} of the World Cup. Some of the venues were not complete by the opening ceremony on March 11, 2007. At Sabina Park, seats <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> at the newly constructed north-stand due to safety concerns. At Trelawny Stadium in Jamaica, ground staff were unable to gain admission to the ground during the warm-up matches due to accreditation problems.|$|E
5|$|By February 1916, all of {{the lower}} casemates for her six-inch guns had been plated over and six {{of them had been}} remounted on the upper deck so they could be used in heavy weather.

5|$|In Virginia, the Marcellus ore {{occasionally}} contained zinc, {{which produced}} a characteristic green flame in the furnace {{as it was}} consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia, which built up over time {{near the top of}} the flue, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> periodically to keep it unobstructed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1997, Paramount's Carowinds began {{consultations}} with roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard about {{adding a new}} ride to their park. During 18 months of discussions, several designs and themes for the ride were developed, including theming it to the Godzilla franchise. In July 1998, the park announced the addition of Top Gun: The Jet Coaster for the 1999 season. At a cost of $10.5 million, {{it would be the}} single biggest investment in the park's history. The announcement followed Paramount Parks adding Top Gun-themed inverted and suspended roller coasters to several of their parks throughout the 1990s, including Paramount's Great America, Paramount Canada's Wonderland, and Paramount's Kings Island. To construct the attraction at Carowinds, the park's Bayern Kurve ride, Wild Bull, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed.</b> The park intended to keep the ride in storage for a potential relocation elsewhere within the park. The removal of Wild Bull shortened construction time because no trees or buildings <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed.</b> Construction began in late July 1998, with the first track arriving in August. Testing was completed in January 1999.|$|E
5|$|Intended for express {{passenger}} trains on the Edinburgh–Glasgow, Edinburgh–Carlisle, and Burntisland–Dundee routes, they handled these well. When trains from London to Edinburgh {{began to be}} forwarded via Carlisle over the NBR in mid-1876, these heavier trains were beyond the locomotives' capabilities, and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from front-line service on the Carlisle line. Rebuilt between 1885 and 1897, they remained in service until 1914–19.|$|E

5|$|Adjacent to {{the stadium}} was the Empire Pool, which hosted the Olympic aquatic events and was the first-ever indoor Olympic pool. The pool was longer than the Olympic {{standard}} of , so a wooden platform had to be built to reduce the overall length. Due to lack of space, the pool was covered over so that boxing events could take place. The blackout paint which covered all of the venue windows – still remaining from the Second World War – <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> before the Games. The Olympics were the last event {{to make use of}} this pool, before it was concreted over.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E

For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E

5|$|The film {{generated}} more controversy {{through the}} 30-second rape scene, with threats made against the child actors, who originated from Afghanistan. Zakria Ebrahimi, the 12-year-old actor who portrayed Amir, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from school after his Hazara classmates {{threatened to kill}} him, and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan's Ministry of Culture banned the film from distribution in cinemas or DVD stores, citing {{the possibility that the}} movie's ethnically charged rape scene could incite racial violence within Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court {{that he had seen}} the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{converted}} into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun {{was replaced by}} a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and stowage was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> to compensate for the weight. A Type 271 target-indication radar replaced the director. It is likely that the Vickers guns were replaced by the Oerlikons from the quarterdeck at this time.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It {{was unable to}} carry the {{increasing}} volume of traffic caused by the growth of London and the increasing popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 the gilded finials on the towers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting {{the preservation of the}} old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from his post.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on}} the rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E

5|$|Kalinin {{was one of}} the Project 26bis2 cruisers, {{the third}} pair of the s. She was larger and had a more {{powerful}} anti-aircraft armament than her half-sisters. She was assembled at the newly constructed Shipyard 199, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, from components built at the Shipyard 198 (Marti South) in Nikolayev. She was laid down on 12 August 1938, launched from drydock on 8 May 1942 and was completed on 31 December 1942 after being towed down the Amur River to Vladivostok. Her construction was prolonged by late deliveries from western factories. For example, her propellers had to be shipped from Leningrad after it had been surrounded by the Germans and her propeller shafts <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the Barrikada factory in Stalingrad in 1942 before it was destroyed by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1907, a gas {{explosion}} aboard the ship injured several crewmen. During political unrest in April 1913, {{part of the}} crew of Vasco da Gama <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> from the ship, {{as they had been}} involved in a planned ultra-Radical coup d'état against the First Portuguese Republic. On 14 May 1915, the crew again participated in unrest; they mutinied and killed the ship's captain and bombarded Lisbon, killing around one hundred people. Vasco da Gama remained the flagship of the Portuguese Navy at least as late as 1914, as the Portuguese naval budget was insufficient to fund a suitable replacement vessel. Thoroughly obsolete, she remained in the Portuguese fleet until 1935, when she was sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied white men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed.</b>|$|E
