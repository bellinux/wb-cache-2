We attempt to construct solid historical sources to trace the development of tourism for 200 years and to obtain a cartographic view of the phenomenon. In this article, we propose a methodology in order to construct a data set on the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> tourism. To achieve this, we rely on tourist guidebooks published since 1800, which are exploited from the perspective of the mentioned tourist places. It is a geo-historical approach insofar as the chosen entry concerns tourist places for which a date is necessary in order to understand the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> tourism...|$|R

It tries to explain both the much lower degree <b>of</b> <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> German as compared to British companies in 1990, {{as well as their}} catching up {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century. The paper suggests that the lesser degree <b>of</b> <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> German firms during most of the 1990 s partly explains their slide in competitiveness during this period. The conclusion examines prospects for the future of firms in both economies. The paper draws on detailed industry data, as well as case studies of the major firms in the two national industries. globalisation, pharmaceutical industry, performance, British-German comparison...|$|R

40|$|Towards an economic-geographical {{approach}} to the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> the hotel industry In the field of economic geography the hotel industry is largely under-researched. Meanwhile, its worldwide development has reached the level whereby {{it can no longer}} be neglected by economic geographers if the tourism production system and, more generally, the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> services, are to be understood. The argument of this paper is two-fold. First, it is contended that an economic-geographical {{approach to}} the hotel industry can significantly enhance our understanding of this important sub-sector of tourism. Although the paper recognises the useful insights into the internationalisation/globalisation of the hotel industry elaborated within management and business studies, it argues that they fall short <b>of</b> exploring the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> the hotel sector in three important respects: the multi-actor nature of the hotel industry, the territorial embeddedness of hotel groups in host markets and the influence of expanding hotel groups on economic development. Given that these gaps are geographical in nature, the paper argues the case for the global production networks (GPN) approach as an effective theoretical platform from which they can be addressed. Second, it is argued that the hotel industry can serve as a good sectoral case through which our understanding <b>of</b> the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> services can be advanced. Enhanced attention to business models of hotel groups is argued to be key to both of these advancements.

40|$|<b>Globalisation</b> <b>of</b> {{markets is}} a {{phenomenon}} that receives much attention and is extensively debated both at general societal/institutional/cultural levels and at market and business levels. In any globalization process, distribution {{of goods and services}} between and within local industrial and consumer markets is obviously <b>of</b> crucial importance. <b>Globalisation</b> <b>of</b> markets and reorganization of distribution are mutually dependent processes and involve changes in market structures. Contemporary examples of this are the emergence of global supply chains, internationalization of wholesale, retail and transportation firms and the development of sales via the internet. These dynamic aspects of distribution imply reorganisation of firms and relationships between firms (including strategic alliances and mergers) involved in distribution activities. This paper will discuss the nature of the interdependence between <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> markets and the reorganisation of distribution applying a network view of markets and with reference to cultural dimensions. Some broad issues for further research aimed at understanding globalisation, will be addressed from the network perspective...|$|R
