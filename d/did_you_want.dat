500|$|In 1970 and 1971, Winston {{sought to}} revamp its image and chose {{to respond to}} many grammarians' qualms with the slogan, [...] "What do you want, good grammar or good taste?" [...] Mad {{magazine}} published a parody of this on the back cover of its January 1971 issue; set in a cemetery, it featured four tombstones with epitaphs written {{in the past tense}} ("Winston tasted good like a cigarette should've" [...] "You mean as a cigarette should've'" [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> good grammar or good taste?" [...] "I wanted to live a lot longer than this!"). With the new slogan in wide use, [...] "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should" [...] was retired permanently in 1972.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{shoots the}} {{entirety}} of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
2500|$|Mallory is famously {{quoted as}} having replied to the {{question}} [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to climb Mount Everest?" [...] with the retort [...] "Because it's there", which has been called [...] "the most famous three words in mountaineering". There have been questions over {{the authenticity of the}} quote, and whether Mallory actually said it. Some have suggested that it was a paraphrase by a newspaper reporter, but scrutiny of the original report in The New York Times leaves this unresolved. The phrase was certainly consistent with the direct quotes cited in The New York Times report, so it appears not to misrepresent Mallory's attitude.|$|E
