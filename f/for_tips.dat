5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band would back them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery <b>for</b> <b>tips.</b> They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E

The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with directions for future research...|$|R

25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play <b>for</b> <b>tips</b> on street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E

2500|$|A club {{might also}} hire or {{broadcast}} forms of entertainment other than striptease (such as pay-per-view events), {{for which it}} earns revenue via premium fees. [...] Some clubs have also moved into providing chat and broadcast services via the internet, including live video feeds. Beyond this more passive entertainment, some clubs' dancers offer additional services, such as lap dances or trips to the champagne room, for a set fee rather than <b>for</b> <b>tips.</b> [...] This fee will typically include a set fee for the room, for a fixed amount of time. Lap dances may also be offered during lingerie modeling sessions. [...] During a lap dance, the dancer rubs against the customer's crotch while he or she remains clothed, {{in an attempt to}} arouse or bring the recipient to climax. Touching of strippers is not permitted in many localities, however, some dancers and clubs allow touching of dancers during private dances. In some parts of the U.S., there are laws forbidding the exposure of female nipples, and thus dancers must cover their nipples with pasties to comply with those laws. Such clubs are known as pastie clubs.|$|E

[...] Due to the odd nature of this work, though, this type of employment is usually only sought by divorcees, young unmarried Japanese women, or married women in need of quick cash.
