5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E

25|$|Although {{the use of}} earplugs when {{swimming}} and shampooing hair may help prevent external otitis, there are important details {{in the use of}} plugs. Hard and poorly fitting <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> can scratch the ear canal skin and set off an episode. When earplugs are used during an acute episode, either disposable plugs are recommended, or used plugs must be cleaned and dried properly to avoid contaminating the healing ear canal with infected discharge.|$|E
25|$|Otitis externa may be acute (lasting {{less than}} six weeks) or chronic (lasting more than three months). Acute cases are {{typically}} due to bacterial infection, and chronic cases are often due to allergies and autoimmune disorders. Risk factors for acute cases include swimming, minor trauma from cleaning, using hearing aids and <b>ear</b> <b>plugs,</b> and other skin problems, such as psoriasis and dermatitis. People with diabetes {{are at risk of}} a severe form of malignant otitis externa. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. Culturing the ear canal may be useful in chronic or severe cases.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2016, {{the blind}} Norwegian player Stein Bjørnsen {{was accused of}} {{cheating}} after playing games that showed a very high correlation with computer analysis.

In April 2016 he received a two-year ban on domestic competition from the Central Board of the Norwegian Chess Federation (NSF). Bjørnsen's appeal to the federation's rules committee was turned down in September 2016.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{following}} study is to evaluate immediate protective effect of <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> from noise morphologically and functionally. An 1 -month aged 29 male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Subjects were divided into four groups as normal control(G 1), bilaterally plugged group (G 2), unilaterally plugged group (G 3) and noise control group (G 4) and later 3 groups were exposed to 110 sound pressure level white noise for 60 min. Immediately after noise exposure, audiologic tests were performed and cochlear morphology and expression levels of a-synuclein in the cochlea were investigated. There were no functional changes in G 2 and <b>plugged</b> <b>ears</b> of G 3 after noise exposure, whereas unplugged ears of G 3 and G 4 showed significant hearing loss. In morphological study, there were a significant degeneration of the organ of Corti and mean number and diameter of efferent buttons, in unplugged ears of G 3 and G 4. <b>Plugged</b> <b>ears</b> of G 3 also showed mild changes in morphological study. Reduction of a-synuclein was observed at the efferent terminals or cochlear extracts after noise exposure. The protective effect of <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> on noise exposure was proven morphologically and functionally in the animal model of noise-induced hearing loss. Further study on cellular or ultrastructural level with <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> {{will be needed to}} reveal more precise mechanism...|$|R

500|$|On 7 March 2016, {{the band}} {{announced}} that the final ten dates of the Rock or Bust World Tour would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed [...] "likely with a guest vocalist" [...] later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain. Johnson himself later stated on The Howard Stern Show that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put <b>ear</b> <b>plugs</b> in during one race {{left him with a}} ruptured ear drum in his left ear.|$|E

40|$|Conductive {{hearing loss}} {{produced}} by middle ear disease (MED) is very {{prevalent in the}} first 5 years of childhood. Both MED in children and prolonged <b>ear</b> <b>plugging</b> in animals lead to a binaural hearing impairment that persists beyond {{the duration of the}} peripheral impairment. However, after cessation of the MED, or removal of the <b>ear</b> <b>plug,</b> binaural hearing gradually improves. We suggest here that this improvement is a passive form of auditory learning. We also show that active auditory learning, through repetition of discrimination tasks, can accelerate performance increments, both after hearing loss and in unimpaired individuals. A more detailed understanding of auditory learning holds out the prospect of improving rehabilitation strategies for the language- and hearing-impaired...|$|R

2500|$|The Hopewell {{created some}} of the finest craftwork and artwork of the Americas. Most of their works had some {{religious}} significance, and their graves were filled with necklaces, ornate carvings made from bone or wood, decorated ceremonial pottery, <b>ear</b> <b>plugs,</b> and pendants. Some graves were lined with woven mats, mica (a mineral consisting of thin glassy sheets), or stones. The Hopewell produced artwork in a greater variety and with more exotic materials than their predecessors the Adena. Grizzly bear teeth, fresh water pearls, sea shells, sharks' teeth, copper and even small quantities of silver were turned into beautifully crafted pieces. The Hopewell artisans were expert carvers of pipestone, and many of the mortuary mounds are full of exquisitely carved statues and pipes. The Mound of Pipes at Mound City produced over 200 stone smoking pipes depicting animals and birds in well-realized three-dimensional form, and the Tremper Site in Scioto County produced over 130. Some artwork went beyond the ordinary exotic, as Hopewell artists were expert carvers of human bone. A rare mask from Mound City was created using a human skull as a face plate.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether lateralization judgements show adaptation during a period of unilateral <b>ear</b> <b>plugging.</b> Six normally hearing young adults were tested repeatedly using pure tone stimuli of 500 and 4000 Hz to determine (i) the threshold in each ear, (ii) the interaural sensation level difference (ISLD) at which sounds presented alternately to the two ears were of equal loudness, and (iii) the ISLD at which sounds presented simultaneously to the two ears produced a centered internal sound image. Subjects were tested 9 – 14 times over one week before an <b>ear</b> <b>plug,</b> producing a nominal attenuation of 21 dB (at both frequencies), was placed in one ear. Subjects wore the plug continuously for a further week, and were tested daily during this period, with the plug in place. After unplugging, subjects were tested less frequently for one final week. Net changes in binaural hearing were measured by subtracting the equal loudness ISLD from the centering ISLD. Four subjects showed no net change, either during or after plugging, but a small (< 3 dB) adaptation occurred during plugging in two subjects...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, our <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> results {{argue against}} hearing loss {{as the major}} {{contributor}} to frequency-specific gap detection deficits in sound exposed animals. Our unilaterally exposed mice showed similar gap detection deficits when either both ears, or more importantly, just the unexposed ear, were tested. Since unexposed ears did not display any sign of ABR threshold increase after exposure, cochlear damage cannot be a reasonable explanation of the gap detection deficits. Although not completely definitive, this new finding further validates the gap detection methodology for tinnitus assessment. Alternatively, GPIAS might detect plastic changes along the auditory neuraxis caused by sound exposure, while not being capable of detecting tinnitus (Kaltenbach et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2006; Noreña and Eggermont 2003).|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a wider normative sample base for the Auditory Comprehension Test (ACT) (Green and Krammer, 1983) ? The ACT is effective in differentiating between individuals who have a binaural deficit in speech comprehension {{and those who do}} not. One hundred and three first year University students were tested on the ACT (seventy- three females and thirty males). Three out of this number (2, 91 %) were found to have binaural deficits. No significant differences were found to exist between males and females on Left, Right, and Both ear scores of the ACT. Significant differences were found to exist between performance on each ear condition for this current study in comparison with an earlier study (Green & Kramer, 1984) with a smaller sample. This indicates a need for more exhaustive methods of standardising the administration and scoring of the ACT, as well as testing with larger and more varied population groups. <b>Ear</b> <b>plug</b> testing with one of the three subjects found to have binaural deficits indicated a 27 point improvement (21, 78 %) when the <b>ear</b> <b>plug</b> was fitted in V the weaker ear as compared to the open field binaural no~ear plug condition. An interview conducted with the same subject revealed a preference for visual or audio-visual modes of assimilating environmental stimuli in comparison to auditory inputs alone. This subject showed extreme elevations on the Hypomania scale of the MMPI, The Emotional Perception Test (Green & Severson, 1986) did not reveal any differences in the same subject?s ability to discriminate emotions in comparison to the test norms, although there was a relatively more frequent overestimation of the sadness emotion by this subject in comparison to the normative sample. The promise of the ACT both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool is emphasized. The need for a comprehensive scoring manual is emphatically indicated...|$|R
