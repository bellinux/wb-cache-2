5000|$|The <b>huchen</b> ( [...] ) or Danube salmon (Hucho hucho) {{is a large}} {{species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the salmon family of order Salmoniformes. It is the type species of its genus. [...] The <b>huchen</b> is endemic to the Danube basin in Europe where the remaining population is threatened by overfishing and habitat loss. Beyond the Danube basin it also occurs today in the Drava and lower Gail rivers (in Carinthia), Drina, Mur (in Styria) and Pielach rivers. Along the Inn, around the 30km-long rebuilt and renaturalized area around the Bavarian town of Mühldorf, the <b>huchen</b> has returned in recent years. It has been introduced elsewhere on the continent and in Morocco, {{but most of these}} populations are not self-sustaining. In historic times the <b>huchen</b> has also been found in the Dniestr basin. Sometimes it lives in big dam reservoirs on mountain rivers such as Lake Czorsztyn in Poland.|$|E

50|$|The Danube {{was once}} a long-standing {{frontier}} of the Roman Empire, and today flows through 10 countries, {{more than any other}} river in the world. Originating in Germany, the Danube flows southeast for 2,860 km, passing through or touching the border of Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine before emptying into the Black Sea. Its drainage basin extends into nine more countries. The Danube river basin is the most biodiverse region in Europe, and is home to hundreds of fish species, such as pike, zander, <b>huchen,</b> wels catfish, burbot and tench. It is also home to a large diversity of carp, sturgeon, as well as salmon and trout. A few species of Euryhaline fish, such as European seabass, mullet, and eel, inhabit the Danube delta and the lower portion of the river.|$|E

It is found in the Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk regions of eastern Russia, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands and Hokkaido, Japan and inhabits lakes and large rivers. The {{population}} has been in general decline for a century at least. Contributory factors include degradation of the environment by logging, oil exploration and change of land use to agriculture. The fish is caught by commercial fishing as bycatch, by recreational anglers and illegally by poaching, and present populations are estimated to be less than 5% of their historic levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the fish as being critically endangered. Although initially placed in the genus Hucho, genetics and other evidence has shown that it belongs in its own monotypic genus Parahucho.|$|E

However, at first the grayling, after <b>huchen</b> too, and now brown trout will gradually fade away. Grayling is completely missing in the 1970s, and the survival of trout endanger numerous natural and anthropogenic factors. It is especially extreme flooding during 2000th. There are the irrational fishing and pollution with sludge and secondary by-products of exploitation of forest resources.

In Mongolia, the taimen is found in both the Arctic and Pacific drainages, specifically the Yenisei/Selenga, the Lena, and the Amur River Basins. The taimen lives in flowing water and is only occasionally found in lakes, usually {{near the mouth of}} a tributary. The taimen is not anadromous, but does show increased movement rates during the spawning season.

40|$|Purpose. To analyse the {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} salmonids Y chromosome {{and to determine}} the fragment for specific primers selection and also to develop the PCR based method for sex determination in <b>huchen</b> H. hucho. Methodology. Using the ClustalW algorithm in MEGA 5. 2, the nucleotide sequences of salmonids Y chromosome were analysed. For developing of method for rapid diagnostic of <b>huchen</b> sex the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used. Tne nucleotide sequences of amplified products were investigated by sequencing. Findings. Using PCR assay the method of sex determination in <b>huchen</b> H. hucho was developed. It was shown that specific PCR products in size of 450 nucleotides were visible in <b>huchen</b> males only. In addition we showed that selected primers {{can be used in}} sex determination of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and this fact is proved the high rate of sdY locus similarity and its wide destribution in salmonids. Originality. The nucleotide sequences of salmonids Y chromosome were analysed and highly conservative region of sdY locus for specific primers selection, which covers sex-linked marker, was identified. Practical Value. Rapid sex determination in <b>huchen</b> by the developed method will allow to identify reversal males in process of gormonal sex reversion. At the stage of reversal males screening, this method will allow to identify the genotypic males (XY) in experimental group and discard them because only phenotypic males with XX genotype (reversal males) must be used in the crosses with native femelas for getting of 100...|$|E
40|$|The Danube salmon or <b>huchen</b> (Hucho hucho, Linnaeus, 1758) is an {{endemic species}} in the Danube basin, being almost extinct in {{particular}} because of anthropogenic activities.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the hypothesis of}} no geographic structure in the <b>Huchen</b> (Hucho hucho), a large, predatory salmonid endemic to the Danube basin. Forty-seven individuals sampled from throughout the Hauchen 2 ̆ 7 s native range were genetically characterized. Extremely limited sequence diversity across 1, 800 bases of mtDNA (the complete control region and partial NADH- 1 subunit) evidenced by four closely related mtDNA haplotypes was found. Nonetheless, the geographic distribution of mtDNA repeats (5 - 10, 82 -bp long copies per individual) as well as allelic diversity across two microsatellite loci indicated large-scale geographic structure between the north-western (Austria and Slovenia) distribution area and eastern Slovakia nad Ukraine) or southern (Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro) sample sites.

40|$|Using {{two species}} of teleost fish, Japanese <b>huchen</b> (Hucho perryi) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio), we {{investigated}} whether sex steroids are involved in early oogenesis in vitro. Ovarian fragments were cultured {{to examine the effects}} of a progestin, 17 alpha, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (DHP), and an estrogen, estradiol- 17 beta (E 2). DHP and E 2 significantly promoted DNA synthesis in ovarian germ cells, as judged by 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into these cells. Furthermore, to detect the initiation of the first meiotic division of early oogenesis, we assessed ultrastructurally the occurrence of synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and analyzed by immunohis-tochemistry the expression of a meiosis-specific marker, Spo 11. In <b>huchen,</b> a higher percentage of oocytes with SC was seen in DHP-treated ovarian fragments than in control or E 2 -treated ovarian fragments. Spo 11 was expressed in germ cells after DHP treatment of carp ovarian explants. These data suggest that the progression of germ cells through early oogenesis involves two sex steroids: E 2, which acts directly on oogonial proliferation, and DHP, which acts directly on the initiation of the first meiotic division of oogenesis. 17 a, 20 b-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one, estradiol, estradiol- 17 b, first meiotic division, gametogenesis, in vitro culture, meiosis, ovary...|$|E
