30|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of rhodium at {{the surface}} of top PtRh layer forms oxygen diffusion barriers, which isolates ITO layer from the external oxygen environment.

50|$|Alloying of {{the solid}} metal alters its LME. Some {{alloying}} elements may increase the severity while others may prevent LME. The action of the alloying element {{is known to be}} segregation to <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> the solid metal and alteration <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> properties. Accordingly, maximum LME is seen in cases where alloy additions elements have saturated the <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>of</b> the solid metal. The hardness and deformation behaviour {{of the solid}} metal affect its susceptibility to LME. Generally, harder metals are more severely embrittled. Grain size greatly influences LME. Solids with larger grains are more severely embrittled and the fracture stress varies inversely with the square root of grain diameter. Also the brittle to ductile transition temperature is increased by increasing grain size.|$|R
30|$|LTE of {{polycrystalline}} metal {{materials can}} be described by two-component system, the crystallite component and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> component [23]. It is well-known that the thermal expansion of coarse-grained polycrystalline materials comes from crystallite and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary,</b> and that <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> has less contribution to the thermal expansion because of their very little fraction volume {{in the view of}} materials science. Many authors thought that LTE of many bulk NC materials were higher those of their conventional coarse polycrystalline counterparts due to the higher volume fraction <b>of</b> NC materials <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> and concentration <b>of</b> defects at <b>grain</b> <b>boundaries</b> [10 – 17]. It is normally considered that the thermal expansion <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> was enhanced in comparison with that of crystallite due to their excess volume for bulk NC materials [15, 23]. However, the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> BNII did less contribution to thermal expansion because LTE of BNII at six measurement directions were less than those of CPII from liquid nitrogen to 300 K according to Fig. 2. It was suggested that the relatively large changes of the thermal expansion previously reported may be due to porosity rather than the small grain size [23]. The thermal expansion of porosity is larger than that of atom in crystallite and <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> during the increment of temperature, which can cause enhanced thermal expansion for many bulk NC materials. The pressure of porosity increases with the decrement of grain sizes and increment <b>of</b> temperature. The <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> BNII can not exist porosity because BNII maintained bulk state all the time during severe rolling process, it is impossible that porosity could be introduced during severe rolling processes, and the <b>grain</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>of</b> BNII can not be polluted by porosity or other atoms.|$|R
