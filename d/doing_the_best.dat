During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Shwaas {{has been}} applauded for scenes which depict the {{difficulty}} {{faced by the}} doctors to explain to grandfather and Parshya that nothing can be done {{and the truth is}} but inevitable. It shows the medical fraternity in a very positive light, with the doctors and nurses being extremely supportive and <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> they can, and helping the village with the best facilities. The last shot where Parshya returns home wearing dark glasses, waving to his family and friends from the boat was widely appreciated by film critics.|$|E
25|$|There were {{criticisms of}} his leadership, too, {{some of which}} he {{eventually}} acknowledged. Many Indo-Fijians criticised him for not doing more to thwart the 1987 coups which removed an Indo-Fijian dominated administration from office, and for giving his consent to a new constitution, drafted in 1990, which guaranteed indigenous Fijian supremacy and was widely regarded as racist, even drawing comparisons from some quarters with South Africa's apartheid system. Mara defended {{his role in the}} post-coup era of 1987 to 1992, arguing that he was <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he could in circumstances that he could not fully control, and that it had seemed better at the time to connive in the writing of a discriminatory constitution than to risk civil war at the hands of ethnic Fijian extremists. In 1996, he publicly apologised to the Indo-Fijian community {{for his role in the}} drafting of the 1990 Constitution. Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Indo-Fijian community who in 1999 became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, said that he did not agree with, but understood, Mara's reasons for acting as he did, and accepted his apology for having done so. Other opponents, both Indo-Fijian and ethnic Fijian, were less forgiving, however.|$|E

500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with {{the sense that he}} felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted to feel this guy was <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing this out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> he could under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I have got {{to tear down the}} character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I am not going to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E

500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> they could to keep the faith alive in their congregation. The priests were smart men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately trying to fit into the American life and be as American as possible, going to a church where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began going to churches and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|E
500|$|On the [...] "EC" [...] set {{the next}} morning a {{reluctant}} Wendy joins a gray side-burned Cartman who promises he will stick to school-related questions and go easy on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into his new film, Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> I can!" ...|$|E
500|$|Dangerously in Love {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 16 reviews. Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone viewed that it presents Beyoncé in two styles, one [...] "far more flattering" [...] than the other, {{and found the}} ballad-oriented songs on the album least flattering, commenting that Beyoncé has [...] "plenty of time" [...] to develop the style maturely that would [...] " [...] sense for her". Entertainment Weeklys Neil Drumming commented that the album validates Beyoncé's [...] "taste in innovation". He also viewed that Beyoncé's collaboration with various record producers explores new directions in contemporary music, doing more reinventing than revisiting. Like DeCurtis' review, however, Drumming pointed out that [...] "most of the disc's missteps" [...] are in its latter part. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that [...] " [...] is allowed more room to experiment vocally as a solo artist, exploring softer registers and lathering on the coquettish persona that was only hinted at on Destiny's Child tracks like 'Bootylicious.'". Steve Jones of USA Today stated, [...] "Beyoncé succeeds by showing greater depth as a songwriter and broader range as a singer". Blenders Ben Ratliff complimented Beyoncé's performance and stated, [...] "She's playing the cool-hunter but covering the bases with seraphic arrangements of multiple voices. Her reach is remarkable". Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it an [...] "artistic leap" [...] and wrote that it [...] "finds Ms. B {{in the midst of}} a fully flowering womanhood and <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> singing of her career".|$|E

2500|$|Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was {{director}} of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against {{what he saw as}} Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that [...] "they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is about getting the best product – not petty grudge bearing." [...] Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legislature}} met {{in joint}} session as a constitutional convention on February 11, and after {{six hours of}} debate rejected two amendments, one proposed by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and the other by Senate President Robert E. Travaglini. Both banned same-sex marriage, one made civil unions possible and the other established civil unions. Finneran commented: [...] "We are as divided as the nation on this. We are <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> we can. We are human beings. We struggle. Sometimes we come up short." [...] The convention met again {{the next day and}} defeated an amendment that defined marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman and disavowed any position on civil unions on a 103-94 vote that showed divisions in each party and Catholic legislators evenly divided. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute blamed Finneran's misreading of his own caucus for the failure of his own proposed language, a defeat in the convention's opening moments from which Crews found it impossible to recover.|$|E
