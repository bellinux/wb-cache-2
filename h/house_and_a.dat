Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> theater that hosted regular performances.|$|E
