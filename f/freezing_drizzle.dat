25|$|Fog {{commonly}} produces precipitation in {{the form}} of drizzle or very light snow. Drizzle occurs when the humidity of fog attains 100% and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets. This can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently, or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air. Drizzle becomes <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.|$|E
500|$|Freezing rain {{is common}} in Newfoundland where it is known as [...] "silver thaw". <b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> or {{freezing}} rain occurs on average of 150 hours each winter, most commonly in March. One such storm struck St. John's on April 11, 1984 and lasted three days. Ice almost 15centimetres (5.9in) thick disrupted electrical power to 200,000 people on the Avalon Peninsula for days.|$|E

5000|$|Freezing Rain - Issued when {{hazardous}} {{walking and}} driving conditions are expected from <b>freezing</b> rain or <b>drizzle.</b> A warning may be issued if ice is over 2 mm thick {{and has the}} potential to cause damage to trees and overhead electricity and telecommunications wires.|$|R
50|$|Both rime {{types are}} less dense than clear ice and cling less tenaciously, {{therefore}} damage due to rime is generally minor compared to clear ice.Glaze ice {{is similar in}} appearance to clear ice {{but it is the}} result of a completely different process, occurring during <b>freezing</b> rain or <b>drizzle.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Winter Weather Advisory – Hazardous {{winter weather}} {{conditions}} are occurring, imminent, or likely.

The generic term, winter weather advisory (which replaced the previously used [...] "travelers advisory"), is used for a combination of two {{or more of the following}} events; snow, freezing rain or <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle,</b> sleet, and blowing snow. The National Weather Service has deprecated the Snow Advisory and Blowing Snow Advisory products in favor of issuing a Winter Weather Advisory for Snow or a Winter Weather Advisory for Snow and Blowing Snow, respectively.|$|E

50|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>Drizzle</b> Advisory - Drizzle causing light accumulations of ice is {{imminent}} or occurring. A trace to 1/4 inch (1-6 mm) of expected <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> {{is needed in}} any county warning area to prompt a freezing rain advisory.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} surface low {{pressure}} systems passed in this atmospheric circulation between January 5 and January 10, 1998. For more than 80 hours, steady <b>freezing</b> rain and <b>drizzle</b> fell over {{an area of}} several thousand square miles of Eastern Ontario, including Ottawa and Kingston, an extensive area in southern Quebec, northern New York, and northern New England (including parts of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine).|$|R
50|$|Glaze or glaze ice, {{also called}} glazed frost, is a smooth, {{transparent}} and homogeneous ice coating occurring when <b>freezing</b> rain or <b>drizzle</b> hits a surface. It {{is similar in}} appearance to clear ice, which forms from supercooled water droplets. It is a relatively common occurrence in temperate climates in the winter when precipitation forms in warm air aloft and falls into below-freezing temperature at the surface.|$|R
60|$|A {{farm in the}} valley! Over the {{mountains}} swept jagged, gray, angry, sprawling clouds, sending a <b>freezing,</b> thin <b>drizzle</b> of rain, as they passed, upon a man following a plow. The horses had a sullen and weary look, and their manes and tails streamed sidewise in the blast. The plowman clad in a ragged gray coat, with uncouth, muddy boots upon his feet, walked with his head inclined t~ ward the sleet, to shield his face from the cold and sting of it. The soil rolled away, black and sticky and with a dull sheen upon it. Nearby, a boy with tears on his cheeks was watching cattle, a dog seated near, {{his back to the}} gale.|$|R
50|$|When <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> accumulates on land {{it creates}} an icy layer of glaze. <b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> {{alone does not}} {{generally}} result in significant ice accumulations due to its light, low-intensity nature. However, even thin layers of slick ice deposited on roads as black ice can cause extremely hazardous conditions resulting in vehicle crashes.|$|E
50|$|While most drizzle {{has only}} a minor {{immediate}} impact upon humans, <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> can lead to treacherous conditions. <b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> occurs when supercooled drizzle drops land on a surface whose temperature is below freezing. These drops immediately freeze upon impact, leading to the buildup of sheet ice (sometimes called black ice) {{on the surface of}} roads.|$|E
50|$|Tule fog {{events are}} often {{accompanied}} by drizzle and <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle.</b> Because {{of the lack of}} sunlight penetrating the fog layer, temperatures may struggle to climb above freezing, and episodes of <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> occasionally accompany tule fog events during winter. Such events can leave an invisible glaze of black ice on roadways, making travel especially treacherous.|$|E

40|$|On 11  July 1897, a Swedish {{expedition}} under Salomon August Andrée {{attempted to}} reach the North Pole from Spitsbergen by balloon. The flight was terminated after only three days, as {{the weight of the}} balloon increased above a critical limit, due to an ice load caused by <b>freezing</b> fog and <b>drizzle.</b> Here the meteorological context of this expedition is discussed, in particular concerning the planning of the flight and in-flight weather conditions. Based on recently released pressure fields for the Arctic region for July 1897, obtained from the twentieth century reanalysis project (20 CR), it can be shown that the Andrée expedition would not have reached the North Pole even with a perfect balloon, due to unfavourable wind conditions in the central Arctic after their departure from Spitsbergen...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> is drizzle that freezes on {{contact with}} the ground or an object {{at or near the}} surface. Its METAR code is FZDZ.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> {{is formed}} in low level stratus type clouds when {{vertical}} motion is weak. It consists of relatively small drops, light in nature. <b>Freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> generally occurs when drizzle forms in an airmass at below freezing temperatures but warmer than -10 °C (14 °F). At such a temperature, the water droplets stay supercooled {{as there are}} few ice nuclei to change them to ice crystals (see freezing rain). In winter arctic conditions it can happen at even lower surface temperatures as the air is even cleaner.|$|E
40|$|In mid-winter {{ice pellets}} were {{observed}} at Inuvik, Canada and Kiruna, Sweden in the Arctic region. The size distribution, morphology and crystalline nature were examined from the photomicrographs. Moreover, meteorological {{conditions in which}} the ice pellets could form were examined from the sounding data at Inuvik. The following results were obtained. (1) The sizes of ice pellets in the Arctic regions were considerably smaller than those in temperate regions. (2) The ice pellets simultaneously fell with the snow crystals with frozen small raindrops. (3) The morphology of ice pellets with a bulge or a spike was qualitatively similar {{to the results of}} laboratory experiments. (4) The rate of shattering was smaller than the results of laboratory experiments. (5) Single crystalline ice pellets were abundant in the size < 200 μm. (6) Ice pellets in the Arctic are formed through the <b>freezing</b> of supercooled <b>drizzle</b> drops, which are formed by condensation-coalescence process below the freezing temperature...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>freezing</b> rain or <b>drizzle</b> {{is light}} and not prolonged, the ice formed is thin. It usually causes only minor damage, {{relieving}} trees of their dead branches etc. When large quantities accumulate however, {{it is one}} of the most dangerous types of winter hazard. When the ice layer exceeds 0.25 in, tree limbs with branches heavily coated in ice can break off under the enormous weight and fall onto power lines. Windy conditions, when present, will exacerbate the damage. Power lines coated with ice become extremely heavy, causing support poles, insulators and lines to break. The ice that forms on roadways makes vehicle travel dangerous. Unlike snow, wet ice provides almost no traction, and vehicles will slide even on gentle slopes. Because it conforms to the shape of the ground, or object such as a tree branch or car it forms on, it is often difficult to notice until it is too late to react.|$|R

50|$|Tule fog is {{characteristically}} confined {{mainly to}} the Great Central Valley due to the mountain ranges surrounding it. Because of {{the density of the}} cold air in the winter, winds are not able to dislodge the fog and the high pressure of the warmer air above the mountaintops presses down on the cold air trapped in the valley, resulting in a dense, immobile fog that can last for days or at times for weeks undisturbed. Tule fog often contains light drizzle or <b>freezing</b> <b>drizzle</b> where temperatures are sufficiently cold.|$|E
