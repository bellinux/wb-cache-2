50|$|A {{knowledge-based}} system (KBS) {{is a computer}} program that reasons and uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems. The term is broad and is {{used to refer to}} many different kinds of systems; the one common theme that unites all knowledge based systems is an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly via tools such as ontologies and rules rather than implicitly via code the way a conventional computer program does. A <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> has three types of sub-systems: a knowledge base, an user interface and an inference engine. The knowledge base represents facts about the world, often in some form of subsumption ontology. The inference engine represents logical assertions and conditions about the world, usually represented via IF-THEN rules.|$|E

40|$|<b>Knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> can be {{designed}} to solve complex medical problems. It incorporates the expert‟s knowledge that has been coded into facts, rules, heuristics and procedures. Incorporation of local languages with the <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> allows endusers communicate with the system in a simpler and easier way. In this study a localized <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> is developed for TB disease diagnosis using Ethiopian national language. To develop the localized <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system,</b> tacit knowledge is acquired from domain experts using interviewing techniques and explicit knowledge is captured from documented sources using relevant documents analysis method. Then the acquired knowledge is modeled using decision tree structure that represents concepts and procedures involved in diagnosis of disease. Production rules are used to represent domain knowledge. The localized <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>system</b> is developed using SWI Prolog version 6. 4. 1 programming language. Prolog supports natural language processing feature to localize the system. As a result, the system is implemented using Amharic language (the national language of Ethiopia) user interface. With Localization, users at remote areas and users who are not good in foreign languages are benefited enormously.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that conceptual modelling is an important activity {{in the development of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems.</b> The availability of an adequate conceptual model is of vital interest notonly for the design and implementation of <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems,</b> but also for their validation, modification, maintenance and enhancement. In {{order to be able to}} develop adequate conceptualmodels a theory about the nature of knowledge is required and, in line with this theory, a methodology to reconstruct the meaning of concepts. Additionally, techniques have to be selected which enable the modelling, representation, validation and simulation of reconstructed concepts. In the development of <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems</b> often techniques are used which are not very wellsuited to the reconstruction and representation of the concepts of an application area. The selection of a technique is not motivated by an explicitly formulated theory, but by the representation formalisms applied within the software used for the implementation of <b>knowledge</b> <b>based</b> <b>systems.</b> This often leads to inadequate conceptual models and consequently poorly functional and hardly maintainable systems, mainly because the representation of concepts is adapted to the limitations of the applied representation formalism.
