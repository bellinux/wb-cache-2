5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

"Bloodline" [...] aired the {{day after}} Fringes fourth season renewal was {{announced}} by Fox Entertainment, which came {{in the wake of}} various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, [...] "I know so often fans think that they need us... but I would be digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So — thank you. Really." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating [...] "That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew this show <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> questionable, but I've always found their music questionable. It is nice enough, and I admit to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin {{presented}} Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the Légion d'honneur, at {{a ceremony}} at the French Embassy in London. [...] De Villepin praised Pinter's poem [...] "American Football" [...] (1991) stating: [...] "With its violence and its cruelty, it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{one of the most}} accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." [...] In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. [...] M. de Villepin concluded: [...] "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." [...] He said that Pinter received the award particularly [...] "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [...] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that [...] "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".|$|E

500|$|At this time, the anarcho-syndicalists {{were still}} {{at the head of}} the labor {{movement}} in Cuba. However, despite the maritime, railway, restaurant and tobacco industries being controlled by organized anarchists, it wasn't until 1925 that a major anarchist federation was successfully organized by workers. Similar to the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo of Spain, non-anarchist members of the Confederación Nacional Obrera Cubana (National Cuban Workers Confederation), eventually formed the Communist Party of Cuba in August 1925. By this time, many anarchists (including Alfredo López and Carlos Baliño) had become swept up in the excitement about the Russian Revolution, and had become party to more authoritarian forms of organizing. Many strikes occurred in the fall of 1925, and the government, once again under the leadership of Machado, was quick to suppress the labor movement. Several labor leaders were shot, and several hundred Spanish anarchists were deported in one month. Machado stated [...] "You are right - I don't know what anarchism is, what socialism is, what communism <b>is.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me</b> they are all the same. All bad patriots." [...] Alfredo López, then secretary-general of the CNOC, was arrested first in October 1925, and encouraged to join the government, followed by a second arrest in July 1926. He was [...] "disappeared" [...] at this point, only to have his body found in 1933, after the fall of the Machado government.|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E
500|$|Ridley Scott {{worked very}} closely with {{composer}} Hans Zimmer, during post-production on Hannibal. Scott believes the music to a film {{is as important as}} dialogue—"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact." [...] Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and [...] "not music". Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a [...] "very odd orchestra...only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range." [...] This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: [...] "Anthony's character <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow." [...] Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a [...] "modern day orchestra". The character Mason Verger had his own [...] "theme", which become more [...] "perverted" [...] as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score. [...] "Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans' full attention...the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience." [...] In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, Hannibal ranked at [...] 59. Strauss's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film.|$|E

[...] According to Einstein, the book only dealt with the concept of a personal god and not the impersonal God of pantheism.
