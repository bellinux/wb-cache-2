Aided by what others described as a magnetic personality, he prospered for a while, living in a luxury building. However the companies were dissolved in 1997 and 1998, and by 1998 Hong Kong courts had declared Hsu once again bankrupt. He would not <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> Hong Kong bankruptcy until 2006.|$|E
5|$|The first beat 'em up was 1984's Kung-Fu Master, with 1986's Renegade {{introducing}} the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw {{a period of}} high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and 1991's Street Fighter II, which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as Streets of Rage, Final Fight and Golden Axe are other classics to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{appointed}} corporate {{head of the}} IBM Design Program in 1989, Tom Hardy, {{initiated a}} strategic design management effort, in collaboration with IBM design consultant Richard Sapper, {{to return to the}} roots of the IBM Design Program first established in 1956 by Eliot Noyes, Paul Rand and Charles Eames. The intent was to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM ThinkPad was the first product to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V.

5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort Grille restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.|$|E

25|$|Bay Area thrash metal: In {{addition}} to being the most commercially successful, San Francisco Bay Area thrash tended {{to be the most}} progressive and technical of the major regional thrash scenes, being strongly NWOBHM influenced.

25|$|Of the {{commercial}} aromatic bitters that would <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period, {{perhaps the most}} well known is Angostura bitters. In spite of its name, the preparation contains no medicinal bark from the angostura tree; instead it is named after the town of Angostura, today's Ciudad Bolívar, in Venezuela. In 1824, German physician Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert compounded a cure for sea sickness and stomach maladies, among other medicinal uses. Dr. Siegert subsequently formed the House of Angostura to sell the bitters to sailors.|$|E

25|$|The Zulu are a {{significant}} case in African military innovation and change. Their system of war transformed large portions of the continent and their methods spanned both the pre-gunpowder and gunpowder eras. Several innovations appeared {{as part of the}} existing indigenous cultural mix, and their adaptation by burgeoning kingdoms and chieftains to shifting opportunities and changes as the 19th century dawned. The best known leader to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> flux was the ruthless chieftain Shaka, who adapted a number of tribal practices that transformed the Zulu from a small, obscure tribe to a major regional power in Southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{morphological}} similarities {{present in}} embryos of different species during development, {{it was once}} assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that human embryos passed through an amphibian then a reptilian stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a reenactment, often called recapitulation theory, is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, {{is that the first}} stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms. At very early stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> basic pattern.|$|E
500|$|The pupae take various forms. In some groups, {{particularly}} the Nematocera, the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form; these pupae {{are described as}} [...] "obtect", having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body. The outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines, respiratory features or locomotory paddles. In other groups, described as [...] "coarctate", the appendages are not visible. In these, the outer surface is a puparium, formed from the last larval skin, and the actual pupa is concealed within. When the adult insect is ready to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> tough, desiccation-resistant capsule, it inflates a balloon-like structure on its head, and forces its way out.|$|E

500|$|While both tone {{poem and}} melodrama would <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> material, {{it is not}} clear which musical form Sibelius {{initially}} used to tackle Rydberg's poem. In the 1930s, the composer claimed he had first composed the melodrama (premiered on 9 March 1895 at a lottery ball benefiting the Finnish Theatre where it was narrated by Axel Ahlberg), only to realize subsequently that [...] "the material would allow a more extensive treatment" [...] as a symphonic poem. Scholars, however, have disputed this chronology, arguing that, given the premiere of the tone poem a mere month later, it is [...] "improbable, if not totally impossible" [...] that Sibelius could have expanded the melodrama so quickly. He probably [...] "compressed" [...] the earlier tone poem, eliminating bridges and repetitions, to produce the streamlined melodrama. The manuscript of the melodrama has far fewer corrections than the manuscript of the tone poem, which supports this view. Sibelius also arranged the conclusion for solo piano.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{spent five}} years {{developing}} his next film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), having been highly impressed with science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's novel Childhood's End, about a superior race of alien beings who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves. After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion {{to work on his}} 1948 short story The Sentinel, about a tetrahedron which is found on the Moon which alerts aliens of mankind. That year, Clarke began writing the novel , and the screenplay was written by Kubrick and Clarke in collaboration. The film's theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two very different times scales. One depicts transitions between various stages of man, from ape to [...] "star child", as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths. In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist Clancy Sigal described as being [...] "far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> far-seeing enterprise".|$|E
500|$|Sega's Space Harrier, a rail shooter {{released}} in 1985, broke new ground graphically and its {{wide variety of}} settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores. 1985 also saw the release of Konami's Gradius, which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry, thus introducing another element of strategy. The game also introduced {{the need for the}} player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success. Gradius, with its iconic protagonist, defined the side-scrolling shoot 'em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels. The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega's forefront series with its game Fantasy Zone. The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist, Opa-Opa, was for a time considered Sega's mascot. The game borrowed Defender's device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier TwinBee (1985), is an early archetype of the [...] "cute 'em up" [...] subgenre. R-Type, an acclaimed side-scrolling shoot 'em up, was {{released in}} 1987 by Irem, employing slower paced scrolling than usual, with difficult levels calling for methodical strategies. 1990's Raiden was the beginning of another acclaimed and enduring series to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> period.|$|E

2500|$|The folk poetry [...] as {{indicated}} above, was {{strongly influenced by}} the Islamic Sunni and Shi'a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still existent ashik ("aşık" [...] or [...] "ozan") tradition, the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkish—which began {{to emerge in the}} 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on 13 May 1277, Karamanoğlu Mehmed Bey declared Turkish the official state language of Anatolia's powerful Karamanid state; subsequently, many of the tradition's greatest poets would continue to <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{victory at}} Kỳ Hòa allowed the French and Spanish {{to move to}} the offensive. [...] In April 1861, Mỹ Tho fell to the French. [...] In early 1862 the French {{captured}} Biên Hòa and Vĩnh Long. [...] These victories forced the Vietnamese to sue for peace in April 1862. [...] By then the French were not in a merciful mood. What had begun as a minor punitive expedition had turned into a long, bitter and costly war. It was unthinkable that France should <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> struggle empty-handed, and Tự Đức was forced to cede the three southernmost provinces of Vietnam (Biên Hòa, Gia Định and Định Tường) to France. Thus, casually, was born the French colony of Cochinchina, with its capital at Saigon.|$|E
