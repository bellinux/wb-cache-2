5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

The two attended USC School of Cinematic Arts together, and worked together on various projects afterwards. Lennertz described Supernatural as [...] "one of those dream situations where you get to work with someone who you admire, but also {{have a relationship with}} already", and noted he and Kripke [...] "were already on the same page without <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> about [...] ".|$|E
500|$|A papal {{election}} {{could bring}} {{a dramatic change}} of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, Prospero Colonna and Francisco de Borja were excommunicated, and Carlo Carafa was executed. The papal conclave, May 1605, {{is one example of}} a conclave where a candidate (Antonmaria Sauli) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for [...] "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy". A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644), <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> about calling a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because [...] "no one else had the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".|$|E

500|$|Abra {{returned}} {{again in}} episode [...] "Prometheus Unbound", when his 'nephew' Kyle {{was brought into}} Holby for a live liver transplant. [...] It was revealed that Abra was actually Kyle's father, and that he and Kyle's mother, Jenny, had brought the child up believing Abra to be his uncle, and his father to be Abra's fictitious brother Harrysupposedly a war hero living abroad with a family of his own. Discussing the storyline, Edmondson commented of his character: [...] "Typically he has been drinking and hasn't warned Ric of his arrival. Abra tells Ric that the surgeon lined up {{to carry out the}} op has pulled out. He wants Ric to do it." [...] Abra proved able to convince Ric {{to go ahead with the}} operation, <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> him into allowing him to perform part of the surgery himself, despite being under the influence of alcohol. As Kyle recovered, Abra came close to admitting his paternity, however lost his nerve at the last minute and departed from the show once more, despite Jenny's confession that she still loved him.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. <b>Even</b> <b>talking</b> with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. Everything was in the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E

2500|$|The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 outlawed the {{issuance}} of injunctions in labor disputes by federal courts. While the Act does not prevent state courts from issuing injunctions, it ended what some observers called [...] "government by injunction", in which the federal courts used injunctions to prevent unions from striking, organizing and, in some cases, <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to workers or entering certain parts of a state. Roughly half the states have enacted {{their own version of}} the Norris-LaGuardia Act.|$|E
2500|$|Bacaloglu herself {{remained}} {{active on}} the margin of Romanian politics, witnessing from the side as Prince Carol retook his throne {{with the help of}} Iuliu Maniu and the National Peasants' Party. She approached the Maniu government and the Foreign Ministry with offers of support and complaints about past persecutions, but these were poorly received. She was eventually allowed to return to Italy in support of the Romanian propaganda effort, protected by the National Peasantist undersecretary, Savel Rădulescu (and, allegedly, by the League of Nations' Nicolae Titulescu), but lost endorsement in a subsequent transfer of power. She continued with her appeals to Rebreanu (who was also being asked to help George Bacaloglu revive Cele Trei Crișuri) and writer-bureaucrat Eugen Filotti. In 1931, she claimed that a conspiracy, headed by diplomat Filip Lahovary and the leaders of the National Liberal Party, wanted to assassinate her [...] "through hunger" [...] and prevented her from <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to people of influence. Bacaloglu also stated that, in exchange for recognition of financial support, she could obtain Mussolini's endorsement for the National Peasantists, who were in the opposition.|$|E

2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline. Wadia told The Sun: [...] "Sam and Jessie were amazing {{and it all}} got taken away from them because people made it out like a real baby had died. It's a soap. It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that any parent who has lost a child will find <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E

60|$|However {{it might}} be for the future, during the ensuing week Dr. May never came in for a meal {{with the rest of}} the family; was too much fagged for {{anything}} but sleep when he came home at night; and on the Sunday morning, when they all had reckoned on going to Cocksmoor together, he was obliged to give it up, and only come into the Minster at the end of the prayers. Every one knew that he was not a good manager of his time, and this made things worse; and he declared that he should make arrangements for being less taken up; but it was sad to see him overburthened, and Tom, as only a casual visitor, could do little to lessen his toil, though that little was done readily and attentively. There were no rubs between the two, and scarcely any conversation. Tom would not discuss his prospects; and it was not clear whether he meant to avail himself of Sir Matthew's patronage; he committed himself to nothing but his wish that it were possible to stay in Paris; and he avoided <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to his sister.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} in the ring of Roderick's voice, as he uttered these words, which sent them home with convincing force. He was not talking for effect, or the mere sensuous pleasure of extravagant and paradoxical utterance, as had often enough been the case ere this; he was not <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> viciously or ill-humoredly. He was talking passionately, desperately, and from an irresistible need to throw off the oppressive burden of his mother's confidence. His cruel eloquence brought the poor lady to her feet, and she stood there with clasped hands, petrified and voiceless. Mary Garland quickly left her place, came straight to Roderick, and laid her hand on his arm, looking at him with all her tormented heart in her eyes. He made no movement to disengage himself; he simply shook his head several times, in dogged negation of her healing powers. Rowland had been living for the past month in such intolerable expectancy of disaster that now that the ice was broken, and the fatal plunge taken, his foremost feeling was almost elation; but in a moment his orderly instincts and his natural love of superficial smoothness overtook it.|$|E

60|$|The hovel seemed greatly deserted {{when the}} two young girls were gone. Patience sorely missed Rusha, her diligent little helper, and latterly her {{companion}} too; {{and the lack of}} Emlyn's merry tongue made all around seem silent and tedious. Steadfast especially missed the girl. Perhaps it was due to the King's gibes that her absence fully opened to him the fact that he knew not how to do without her. After his usual fashion, he kept the discovery to himself, not <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to Patience about it, being very shamefaced at the mere thought, which gave a delicious warmth to his heart, though it made him revolve schemes of saving up till he had a sufficient sum, with which to go to the squire and propose to meet him half-way in rebuilding the old house; not such an expensive matter as it would be in these days. There, in full view of all that passed down Elmwood Lane, Emlyn could not complain of solitude, he thought! But there was this difficulty in the way, that Jephthah had never resigned his claims as eldest son, and might come home at any time, and take possession of all the little farm at which Steadfast had worked for seven years.|$|E
60|$|The {{road was}} still well defined, {{although}} it presently began to wind between ascending ranks of pines and larches {{that marked the}} terraces of hills, so high that she wondered she had not noticed them from the plains. An unmistakable suggestion of some haunting primeval solitude, {{a sense of the}} hushed and mysterious proximity of a nature she had never known before, the strange half-intoxicating breath of unsunned foliage and untrodden grasses and herbs, all combined to exalt her as she cantered forward. Even her horse seemed to have acquired an intelligent liberty, or rather to have established a sympathy with her in his needs and her own longings; instinctively she no longer pulled him with the curb; the reins hung loosely on his self-arched and unfettered neck; secure in this loneliness she found herself <b>even</b> <b>talking</b> to him with barbaric freedom. As she went on, the vague hush of all things animate and inanimate around her seemed to thicken, until she unconsciously halted before a dim and pillared wood, and a vast and heathless opening on whose mute brown lips Nature seemed to have laid the finger of silence. She forgot the party she had left, she forgot the luncheon she was going to; more important still she forgot that she had already left the traveled track far behind her, and, tremulous with anticipation, rode timidly into that arch of shadow.|$|E
