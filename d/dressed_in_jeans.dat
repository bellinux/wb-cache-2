Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt." ...|$|R

50|$|The band {{originally}} played modern rockabilly, {{but found}} {{it tough to}} book shows with Buffalo's teenage music scene being dominated by punk rock.

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is being {{prepared}} for a show.

5000|$|Sexual {{fields are}} {{themselves}} distinguished by distinct [...] "currencies of erotic capital" [...] (Green 2005, 2008), the latter which are quite variable, acquiring dominance {{in relation to}} the collective preferences of players. For example, Green (2005, 2008) argues that the characteristics which confer sexual capital in one field may not in another. Thus, in a gay leather bar, a bearded, stocky white man <b>in</b> his late-thirties <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> Levi's <b>jeans</b> and a leather jacket will possess an optimal form of sexual capital, whereas the same man in a swanky Martini bar catering to a twenty-something, high-fashion, urban gay customer base will face a sexual capital deficit. This variation in power and status occurs because a gay leather bar and a gay Martini bar are physical sites organized by the logic of two distinct sexual fields with contrasting currencies of sexual capital (Green 2005, 2008) - i.e., distinct [...] "hegemonic systems of judgment" [...] (Martin and George 2006).|$|R

5000|$|Eric Wagner's lyrics {{deal with}} {{different}} themes, but the early Trouble albums, {{such as their}} debut Psalm 9, are known for biblical references. Especially because such themes were relatively uncommon in mainstream metal music of the 1980s, Trouble were then often classified as Christian metal.Other songs deal with social issues; [...] "Bastards Will Pay," [...] for instance, criticises politicians as hypocritical.But the psychedelic rock influences don't appear only in form of a tinge of the hippie movement's melancholy and ideologies, with the term [...] "peace and love" [...] appearing on occasion. From Manic Frustration onwards, more lyrical references {{have been made to}} psychedelia, drugs, and hallucinations; [...] "Hello Strawberry Skies" [...] and [...] "Mr. White" [...] stand out as two examples.Also, unlike other metal acts of the 1980s, Trouble's members <b>dress</b> <b>in</b> ripped <b>jeans,</b> tight T-shirts, wear round sunglasses and have fringes and outfit accessories more characteristic of the hippie movement such as bandanas and knee patches.|$|R
