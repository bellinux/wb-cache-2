25|$|In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of France, {{invented a}} process which uses glass as a {{lubricant}} for extruding steel. The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used to make kilogram mass standards. The process starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling it in <b>glass</b> <b>powder.</b> The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5 to 0.75nbsp&mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls {{and allow it to}} act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18nbsp&mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2015, a Mediated Matter team {{developed}} G3DP, {{the first}} 3D printer for optically transparent glass. At the time, sintering 3D printers could print with <b>glass</b> <b>powder,</b> {{but the results}} were brittle and opaque. G3DP was designed in collaboration with MIT's Glass Lab and the Wyss Institute, emulating traditional glass working processes. Molten glass was poured in fine streams and cooled in an annealing chamber, yielding precision suitable for art and consumer products, and glass strength suitable for architectural elements. The process allowed close control of color, transparency, thickness and texture. Changing the height and speed of the nozzle produced uniform loops, turning the printer into a [...] "molden glass sewing machine". A set of glass vessels made with this printer went on exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt and other museums, and a 10-foot tall sculpture of light and printed glass, YET, was designed for the 2017 Milan Design Week.|$|E

An abrasion resistance comparable to common industrial glazes has been obtained with as much as 60 % of glass volume fraction, employing fine <b>glass</b> <b>powders</b> (< 45 mu m).

Bioactive glasses {{not only}} can bond to hard tissues of the body, are also able to release ions that have stimulatory effects on cells and so are {{regarded}} as promising candidate materials for gene activating purposes in tissue engineering applications. In this research the effect of co-substitution of Magnesium and Zinc for Calcium on bioactivity of binary sol-gel derived glass 70 S 30 C (70 mol. % SiO 2, 30 mol. % CaO) was investigated. Calcium phosphates forming ability tests and investigation of glass degradation products in simulated body fluid (SBF) were performed as follows.
