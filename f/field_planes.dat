The half model was tested in cruise configuration (clean wing without flaps) without and with a wing mounted engine simulator. Two types of engine simulators were used: a Through Flow Nacelle (TFN) and a turbo-powered Counter Rotating Ultra-high-bypass Fan (CRUF). All tests have been carried out at wind tunnel speed V 0 = 60 m/s (Mach number M 0 = 0. 18). The flow fields behind the wing and engine simulators (TFN and CRUF) were investigated using a rake equipped with total pressure probes and a rake equipped with directional probes.

40|$|The EM-ANIMATE {{program is}} a {{specialized}} visualization program that displays and animates the near-field and surface-current solutions obtained from an electromagnetics program, in particular, that from MOM 3 D (LAR- 15074). The EM-ANIMATE program is windows based and contains a user-friendly, graphical interface for setting viewing options, case selection, file manipulation, etc. EM-ANIMATE displays the field and surface-current magnitude as smooth shaded color fields (color contours) ranging from a minimum contour value to a maximum contour value for the fields and surface currents. The program can display either the total electric field or the scattered electric field in either time-harmonic animation mode or in the root mean square (RMS) average mode. The default setting is initially set to the minimum and maximum values within the field and surface current data and can be optionally set by the user. The field and surface-current value are animated by calculating and viewing the solution at user selectable radian time increments between 0 and 2 pi. The surface currents can also be displayed in either time-harmonic animation mode or in RMS average mode. In RMS mode, the color contours do not vary with time, but show the constant time averaged field and surface-current magnitude solution. The electric field and surface-current directions can be displayed as scaled vector arrows which have a length proportional to the magnitude at each field grid point or surface node point. These vector properties can be viewed separately or concurrently with the field or surface-current magnitudes. Animation speed is improved by turning off the display of the vector arrows. In RMS modes, the direction vectors are still displayed as varying with time since the time averaged direction vectors would be zero length vectors. Other surface properties can optionally be viewed. These include the surface grid, the resistance value assigned to each element of the grid, and the power dissipation of each element which has an assigned resistance value. The EM-ANIMATE program will accept up to 10 different surface current cases each consisting of up to 20, 000 node points and 10, 000 triangle definitions and will animate one of these cases. The capability is used to compare surface-current distribution due to various initial excitation directions or electric field orientations. The program can accept up to 50 planes of field data consisting of a grid of 100 by 100 field points. These planes of data are user selectable and can be viewed individually or concurrently. With these preset limits, the program requires 55 megabytes of core memory to run. These limits can be changed in the header files to accommodate the available core memory of an individual workstation. An estimate of memory required can be made as follows: approximate memory in bytes equals (number of nodes times number of surfaces times 14 variables times bytes per word, typically 4 bytes per floating point) plus (number of <b>field</b> <b>planes</b> times number of nodes per plane times 21 variables times bytes per word). This gives the approximate memory size required to store the field and surface-current data. The total memory size is approximately 400, 000 bytes plus the data memory size. The animation calculations are performed in real time at any user set time step. For Silicon Graphics Workstations that have multiple processors, {{this program has been}} optimized to perform these calculations on multiple processors to increase animation rates. The optimized program uses the SGI PFA (Power FORTRAN Accelerator) library. On single processor machines, the parallelization directives are seen as comments to the program and will have no effect on compilation or execution. EM-ANIMATE is written in FORTRAN 77 for implementation on SGI IRIS workstations running IRIX 3. 0 or later. A minimum of 55 Mb of RAM is required for execution of this program; however, the code may be modified to accommodate the available memory of an individual workstation.

The Electric Field Integral Equation form of Maxwell's equations is solved using local triangle couple basis and testing functions with a resultant system impedance matrix. The analysis emphasis is not only for routine RCS pattern predictions, but also for phenomenological diagnostics: bistatic imaging, currents, and near scattered/total electric fields. The images, currents, and near fields are output in form suitable for animation. MOM 3 D computes the full backscatter and bistatic radar cross section polarization scattering matrix (amplitude and phase), body currents and near scattered and total fields for plane wave illumination. MOM 3 D also incorporates a new bistatic k space imaging algorithm for computing down range and down/cross range diagnostic images using only one matrix inversion. MOM 3 D has been made memory and cpu time efficient by using symmetric matrices, symmetric geometry, and partitioned fixed and variable geometries suitable for design iteration studies.
