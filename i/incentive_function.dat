40|$|The {{environmental}} effectiveness of fees {{for using the}} environment (“environmental fees”) charged in Poland is demonstrated by their <b>incentive</b> <b>function,</b> which motivates organisations using the environment to behave in the appropriate, environmentally-friendly way. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess how well the fees fulfil this function. The <b>incentive</b> <b>function</b> is evaluated by analysing the quantity of pollution emitted into the air, water and soil, the quantity of waste landfilled and of water taken in within the context of changes to unit fee rates in 2005 - 2011. This study was conducted using data obtained from the Marshall’s Office of the Silesian District (Śląsk) of Poland, which transferred the highest environmental fees over the period of 2008 - 2011 [NFOŚiGW (National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management), Informacja [...] . ]. Substances and processes for which the amount of pollution emitted or water taken in was significant, were chosen for the analysed sample. The assessment of the <b>incentive</b> <b>function</b> based on the figures from one district, (Voivodship), is illustrative in nature and one can only presume that the trends observed in this area, which uses the environment to a large extent, will also be true for data from the entire country and thus significantly impact the national average. However, for the sample to be more representative, it is necessary to carry out the same analyses for subsequent districts and to aggregate the data.

In the context of new legal obligations arisen {{in the period of}} joining the European Union, Romanian public authorities recruited more employees. After 2008, influenced by lower budgets and political changes, this dynamic of human resources was inverted, in some places with very significant personnel fluctuations, leading to major misbalances of public service.

Thus, we consider that the actual recruiting system of public servants in Romania need to be reformed to introduce in public sector well equipped individuals.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of the {{observed}} increased share of delegated capital for trading strategies and equilibrium prices by introducing delegation into a standard Lucas exchange economy. In equilibrium, some investors trade on their own account, but others decide to delegate trading to professional fund managers. Flow-performance <b>incentive</b> <b>functions</b> describe how much capital clients provide to funds at each date as a function of past performance. Convex flow-performance relations imply that the average fund outperforms the market in recessions and underperforms in expansions. When the share of capital that is delegated is low, all funds follow the same strategy. However, when the equilibrium share of delegated capital is high, funds with identical incentives employ heterogeneous trading strategies. A group of managers borrows to take on a levered position on the stock. Thus, fund returns are dispersed in the cross-section and the outstanding amounts of borrowing and lending increase. The relation between the share of delegated capital and the Sharpe ratio typically follows an inverse U-shaped pattern.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} on firms’ “open science” strategies rests on the notion that scientists have a strong preference for publishing and that firms are able to extract a wage discount if they allow scientists to publish. Drawing on a survey of 1, 400 life scientists about to enter the job market, we suggest an alternative view. First, we show significant heterogeneity in the price scientists assign to the opportunity to publish in firms, and those scientists who seek industry careers have particularly low preferences for publishing. Thus, many job applicants are not willing to accept lower wages for jobs that let them publish and firms pursuing open science strategies may instead have to pay publishing incentives that fulfill both sorting and <b>incentive</b> <b>functions.</b> Second, we show that scientists with higher ability have a higher price of publishing but also expect to be paid higher wages regardless of the publishing regime. Thus, they are not cheaper to hire than other scientists if allowed to publish, but they are more expensive if publishing is restricted. Finally, we show that scientists publish not simply for “peer recognition” but also for more specific reasons, including the opportunity to advance science or to move to higher-paying jobs. Different reasons predict what price a scientist assigns to the opportunity to publish and may also have very different implications for the sustainability of competitive advantages derived from open science strategies.
