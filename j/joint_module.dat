40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} an active decentralized fault-tolerant control (ADFTC) strategy based on dynamic output feedback for reconfigurable manipulators with concurrent actuator and sensor failures. Consider each <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> of the reconfigurable manipulator as a subsystem, and treat the fault as the unknown input of the subsystem. Firstly, by virtue of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, the decentralized proportional-integral observer (DPIO) is designed to estimate and compensate the sensor fault online; hereafter, the compensated system model could be derived. Then, the actuator fault is estimated similarly by another DPIO using LMI as well, and the sufficient condition of the existence of H∞ fault-tolerant controller in the dynamic output feedback is presented for the compensated system model. Furthermore, the dynamic output feedback controller is presented based on the estimation of actuator fault to realize active fault-tolerant control. Finally, two 3 -DOF reconfigurable manipulators with different configurations are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in simulation. The main advantages of the proposed scheme lie in that it can handle the concurrent faults act on the actuator and sensor on the same <b>joint</b> <b>module,</b> as well as there is no requirement of fault detection and isolation process; moreover, it is more feasible to the modularity of the reconfigurable manipulator...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed design, calibration, {{and control of}} a modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) system. A MRR system not only includes modular mechanical hardware, but also modular electrical hardware, control algorithms and software. Also, those modular components can be easily constructed into various manipulator configurations to accomplish {{a wider range of}} tasks. MRRs represent the next generation of industrial manipulators that cope with the transition from mass to customer-oriented production. The main contributions of this thesis are: 1) mechanical design and calibration of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) joint modules of MRR, and 2) control design to handle multiple configuration and overcome disturbance due to dynamics uncertainty. From the mechanical design point of view, this thesis presents two main topics: 1) each joint is not only modularly designed, but also has multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) physical connection ports, which contributes to the concept of reconfigurability. Strictly speaking, single-input single-output (SISO) modular joint falls into the category of modular manipulator, and the robot reconfiguration is achieved by integrating different types of modules. For example, with single revolute MIMO <b>joint</b> <b>module,</b> both rotary and pivotal joint can be generated. On the other hand, {{if you would like to}} switch from rotary movement to pivotal movement with a SISO <b>joint</b> <b>module,</b> using another pivotal <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> is the only way to achieve this goal, and 2) for precise automation application, joints and links should be accurately connected and oriented when reconfigured. Our proposed modular joint has four connection ports which can be configured as either a rotary joint or a pivotal joint. In addition, key and keyway connection mechanism provides high accuracy in positioning the link onto the joint. Therefore, this structure reduces or eliminates MRRs system calibration time when reconfigured. Furthermore, zero link offset when used as a pivotal joint increases the robot dexterity, maximizes the reachability, and results in kinematics simplicity. The main challenge in the control of an MRR system with harmonic drives (HD) is the significant uncertainties due to friction, unmodelled dynamics, varying payload, gravitation, dynamic coupling between motions of joints, and the configuration changes. In order to compensate all unpredictable effects, we proposed a decentralized saturation-type robust control scheme based on direct-Lyapunov method and backstepping techniques. To better understand the system dynamics behavior, the HD flexspline compliance and friction calibration and results are also provided. The results are used for controller design. The proposed controller is verified through both computer simulation and experimental analysis...|$|E

40|$|Using {{manipulators}} with a fixed configuration {{for specific}} tasks is appropriate when the task requirements are known beforehand. However, in less predictable situations, {{such as an}} outdoor construction site or aboard a space station, a manipulator system requires {{a wide range of}} capabilities, probably beyond the limitations of a single, fixed-configuration manipulator. To fulfill this need, researchers have been working on a Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System (RMMS). Researchers have designed and are constructing a prototype RMMS. The prototype currently consists of two <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> and four link <b>modules.</b> The <b>joints</b> utilize a conventional harmonic drive and torque motor actuator, with a small servo amplifier included in the assembly. A brushless resolver is used to sense the joint position and velocity. For coupling the modules together, a standard electrical connector and V-band clamps for mechanical connection are used, although more sophisticated designs are under way for future versions. The joint design yields an output torque to 50 ft-lbf at joint speeds up to 1 radian/second. The resolver and associated electronics have resolutions of 0. 0001 radians, and absolute accuracies of plus or minus 0. 001 radians. Manipulators configured from these prototype modules will have maximum reaches in the 0. 5 to 2 meter range. The real-time RMMS controller consists of a Motorola 68020 single-board computer which will perform real time servo control and path planning of the manipulator. This single board computer communicates via shared memory with a SUN 3 workstation, which serves as a software development system and robot programming environment. Researchers have designed a bus communication network to provide multiplexed communication between the <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> and the computer controller.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the human ability to synchronize movements with event sequences containing continuous tempo changes. This capacity is evident, for example, in ensemble musicians who maintain precise interpersonal coordination while modulating the performance tempo for expressive purposes. Here we tested an ADaptation and Anticipation Model (ADAM) that was developed to account for such behavior by combining error correction processes (adaptation) with a predictive temporal extrapolation process (anticipation). While previous computational models of synchronization incorporate error correction, they do not account for prediction during tempo-changing behavior. The fit between behavioral data and computer simulations based on four versions of ADAM was assessed. These versions included a model with adaptation only, one in which adaptation and anticipation act in combination (error correction is applied {{on the basis of}} predicted tempo changes), and two models in which adaptation and anticipation were linked in a <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> that corrects for predicted discrepancies between the outcomes of adaptive and anticipatory processes. The behavioral experiment required participants to tap their finger in time with three auditory pacing sequences containing tempo changes that differed in the rate of change and the number of turning points. Behavioral results indicated that sensorimotor synchronization accuracy and precision, while generally high, decreased with increases in the rate of tempo change and number of turning points. Simulations and model-based parameter estimates showed that adaptation mechanisms alone could not fully explain the observed precision of sensorimotor synchronization. Including anticipation in the model increased the precision of simulated sensorimotor synchronization and improved the fit of model to behavioral data, especially when adaptation and anticipation mechanisms were linked via a <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> based on the notion of joint internal models. Overall results suggest that adaptation and anticipation mechanisms both play an important role during sensorimotor synchronization with tempo-changing sequences...|$|E
