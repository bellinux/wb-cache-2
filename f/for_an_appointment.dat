5|$|The then-General Accounting Office (GAO) {{has issued}} reports since VA started {{gathering}} data in 2000 on veterans' wait {{times to be}} scheduled <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> and these GAO reports have called into question the reliability, and validity, of VA's wait time data.|$|E
5|$|As of August 15, VA {{data showed}} {{that the number of}} {{veterans}} who were waiting more than three months <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> has declined by half since Spring 2014, but the number who wait at least 30 days remains similar. Reported wait times for repeat patients have increased from 3.5 days to nearly 6 days. The VA paid for nearly 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days.|$|E
5|$|About 900 {{vehicles}} {{crossed the}} bridge each day. The bridge collected {{an average of}} $30,000 in monthly tolls and had $22,000 in monthly expenses. The bridge {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship to historic New Harmony, Indiana as well as the bridge's age. The three-member Commission was established by Congress on April 12, 1941, but Congress repealed the statute providing <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> mechanism in 1998. The Commission's general manager, who is 75, speculated that the bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E
5|$|Many {{ethnic groups}} {{have never been}} {{represented}} on the Court. There {{has never been a}} Justice with any Asian, Native American, or Pacific Islander heritage, and no person having such a heritage was publicly considered <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> until the 21st century. Legal scholar Viet D. Dinh, of Vietnamese descent, was named as a potential George W. Bush nominee. During the presidency of Barack Obama, potential nominees have included Harold Hongju Koh, of Korean descent, and former Idaho attorney general Larry Echo Hawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{is passed}} over <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> as United States Secretary of State {{even though he}} had been promised the {{position}} after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker (Michel Gill) as President. Walker's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration. With the aid of Claire, and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution. He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara), whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people in the region to supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Administrators' duties were seasonal, such as {{inspections}} of counties every spring {{to check on}} agriculture and maintain roads, bridges, dikes and other public works. In the fall he sent subordinates into the counties to report whether local criminal lawsuits had been conducted fairly. He was responsible for recommending worthy nominees, known as Filial and Incorrupt, to the capital at the end each year during winter; the nominees would then be considered <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> to a central or local government office. This followed a system of quotas {{for each of the}} commanderies that was first established during Emperor Wu's reign, when two Filial and Incorrupt men from each commandery were sent to the capital. This was changed in 92 AD to one man for every 200,000 households in a commandery. After the Commandants of interior commanderies were abolished, the Administrators assumed their duties, yet they were still not allowed to raise militias, mobilize troops, or send troops outside their commandery without permission from the central government.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of newly {{appointed}} Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer, Tyler cleared out an array of officeholders, replacing them with pro-annexation partisans, in a reversal of his former stand against patronage. He elicited {{the help of}} political organizer Michael Walsh to build a political machine in New York. In exchange <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> as consul to Hawaii, journalist Alexander G. Abell wrote a flattering biography, Life of John Tyler, which was printed in large quantities and given to postmasters to distribute. Seeking to rehabilitate his public image, Tyler embarked on a nationwide tour {{in the spring of}} 1843. The positive reception of the public at these events contrasted with his ostracism back in Washington. The tour centered on the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument in Boston, Massachusetts. Shortly after the dedication, Tyler learned of Legaré's sudden death, which dampened the festivities and caused him to cancel the rest of the tour.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To explore sociodemographic {{and health}} status factors {{associated}} with waiting times both for first outpatient appointment and for total hip replacement surgery (THR). METHODS: A survey of THR in five former English regions was conducted between September 1996 and October 1997. Every patient listed for THR was asked {{to fill out a}} questionnaire preoperatively. This questionnaire included the 12 -item Oxford Hip Score (OHS) questionnaire and two questions on the length of time patients waited <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outpatient <b>appointment</b> and subsequently for their operation. RESULTS: From multiple logistic regression analyses, region, private vs. public sector, housing tenure and preoperative OHS were all independently associated with <b>a</b> waiting time <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outpatient <b>appointment</b> <b>for</b> > 3 months. Region, housing tenure and gender were also independently associated with a wait of >or= 6 months on the surgical waiting list. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients had long waiting times both <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outpatient <b>appointment</b> and while on a surgical waiting list. There were significant differences in waiting time according to social, geographical and health care system factors. Patients with a worse pain and disability at surgery waited longer <b>for</b> <b>an</b> outpatient <b>appointment.</b> The longer patient waited, the worse was their pain and disability, suggesting that patients were not prioritized by these criteria. Benefits of prioritizing should be tested...|$|R

40|$|This {{article will}} focus on {{increasing}} the ability of social workers to provide mental health services to urban, low-income children and their caretakers. <b>A</b> conceptual model <b>for</b> understanding the process of engagement will be presented. Further, <b>a</b> protocol <b>for</b> training social workers to conduct first interview/engagement interviews {{and the results of}} a study evaluating its impact will be highlighted. One hundred seven children and their families were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions: (1) first interviewers trained in specific engagement skills, and (2) other therapists within an urban mental health agency. Of the 33 children assigned to first interviewers, 29 (88 %) came <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first <b>appointment</b> and 97 % (n = 28) of those returned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second <b>appointment.</b> In comparison, of the 74 clients assigned to the routine first interview condition, 47 (64 %) came <b>for</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>appointment</b> and only 83 % (n = 39) returned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second <b>appointment.</b> The average length of treatment during an 18 -week study period for first interview subjects was 7. 1 sessions, as opposed to 5. 4 sessions for the comparison group. The applications of this model for social work education are discussed. It has been estimated that two thirds of all children in need of mental health services never receive them (Kazdin, 1993). Urban, minority children are at greater risk for the development of a wide range of mental health difficulties, but less likely to be met by responsive service providers or relevant interven...|$|R
