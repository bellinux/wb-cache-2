40|$|Various {{techniques}} {{are used for}} tumor staging of bladder carcinoma such as <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography,</b> transurethral echography, and computed tomographic (CT) scan. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> enables easy observation of tumor morphology, but we utilized other approaches to determine {{the presence or absence}} of tumor infiltration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently found widespread use in the staging of tumors. We first employed this approach at our hospital in February 1987. We compared the diagnostic accuracy rate of MRI with that of transurethral echography and CT scan in 10 cases of bladder tumor. The diagnostic accuracy rate of MRI was 70 %, while that of transurethral echography and CT scan was 40 % and 50 %, respectively. We concluded that MRI was very useful in the diagnostic staging of bladder tumor...|$|E
40|$|Our {{experience}} with a new <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> system is reported. The light source (Olympus CLE-F) is connected to both a lamp for observation and one for photography. At the time of photography, the light source is switched to the photography system by {{the movement of the}} mirror. The light supply and the exposure time can be controlled automatically. Of particular interest is the new endoscope which has a 5 -mm rod lens system. The figures obtained on the 35 mm film are about 21 mm in diameter. The pictures obtained are clear and beautiful as is evident from the photos printed herein...|$|E
40|$|Difficulty in <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> in TUR is due t o {{the fact}} that clear vision can not be {{obtained}} without sufficient irrigation of the field which is secured only through wide lumen between the resectoscope sheath and resecting telescope of small caliber {{which in turn is}} able to carry only a small light. This difficulty has b een solved by device of a special light and a synchronizer which enables momentary increase of the light by the authors in cooperation with the Shinko Medical Optical Instrument Co [...] The resectoscop i c camera is presented and several endoscopic features taken with the camera before, during and after TURP are shown...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> {{technique}} coupling a {{high speed}} CCD camera and an intrusive fiber-optic endoscope {{has been extended}} to enable the investigation of particle flow behavior in a 3 D spouted bed 1500 mm in height and 200 mm in diameter. A series of algorithms have been specifically optimized to realize the process of image processing and the calculation of the instantaneous particle velocity data. Then particle phase velocity and granular temperature were obtained respectively by statistical analysis and detailed study of the obtained data. The results showed that instantaneous particle velocities exhibited random complexity in both magnitude and direction. Although little information could be extracted from the raw data directly, the profile of particle phase velocity was able to show the mainstream particle flow patters along bed radius. Also, the computed granular temperature {{could be used to}} characterize the local particle fluctuation intensity. All experimental results could be useful to validate the CFD models for gas-solid flow systems...|$|E
40|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> <b>photography,</b> double {{contrast}} cystography, transurethral echography, X-ray CT scan, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) {{were utilized}} for the staging {{diagnosis of the}} four patients with carcinoma of the bladder. In the first case, a 70 -year-old man, since all of the five imaging procedures suggested a superficial and pedunculated tumor, his bladder cancer was considered T 1. The classification of stage T 3 carcinoma was made for the second 86 -year-old male. Because all of his imaging examinations showed a tumor infiltrating deep muscle and penetrating the bladder wall. The third case was a 36 -year-old male. His clinical stage was diagnosed as T 2 or T 3 a by cystophotography, double contrast cystogram, ultrasonography, and X-ray CT scan. However, MRI showed only thickened bladder wall and the infiltrating tumor could not be distinguished from the hypertrophic wall. The last patient, a 85 -year-old female, had a smaller Ta cancer. Her double contrast cystography revealed the small tumor at the lateral bladder wall. But, the tumor could not be detected by transaxial, sagittal and coronal scans. Multiple imaging procedures combining MRI and staging diagnosis of the bladder carcinoma were discussed...|$|E
40|$|We studied if bladder cancers {{respond to}} HAMLET (human alpha-lactalburnin made lethal to tumor cells) to {{establish}} if intravesical HAMLET application {{might be used}} to selectively remove cancer cells in vivo. Patients with nonmuscle invasive transitional cell carcinomas were included. Nine patients received 5 daily intravesical instillations of HAMLET (25 mg/ml) during the week before scheduled surgery. HAMLET stimulated a rapid increase in the shedding of tumor cells into the urine, daily, during the 5 days of instillation. The effect was specific for HAMLET, as intravesical instillation of NaCl, PBS or native a-lactalbumin did not increase cell shedding. Most of the shed cells were dead and an apoptotic response was detected in 6 of 9 patients, using the TUNEL assay. At surgery, morphological changes in the exophytic tumors were documented by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> and a reduction in tumor size or change in tumor character was detected in 8 of 9 patients. TUNEL staining was positive in biopsies from the remaining tumor in 4 patients but adjacent healthy tissue showed no evidence of apoptosis and no toxic response. The results suggest that HAMLET exerts a direct and selective effect on bladder cancer tissue in vivo and that local HAMLET administration might be of value in the future treatment of bladder cancers.

40|$|O ptical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{an evolving}} imaging modality that combinesinterferometry with low-coherence light to produce high-resolution tissue imaging. Cross-sectional in vivo images were obtained using an OCT device consisting of aMichelson interferometer, 1. 3 -µm broadband light source, and a handheld fiberop-tic imaging probe. Image pixel resolution approached 10 µm. The mucosa {{of the oral}} cavity and oropharynx were examined in 41 patients during operative endoscopy. Optical coherence tomo-graphic imaging was combined with <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> for gross and histologic image cor-relation. Optical coherence tomographic images of the oral cavity and oropharynx provided mi-croanatomical information on the epithelium, basement membrane (BM), and supporting lamina propria (LP) of the mucosa. Normal microstructures identified in these tissues included an over-lying keratin layer, papillae, ducts, glands, and blood vessels. Regions of pathologic features stud-ied included mature scar, granulation tissue, mucous cysts, leukoplakia, and invasive cancer. Op-tical coherence tomographic imaging showed distinct zones of normal, altered, and ablated tissue microstructures for each pathologic process studied. Abnormal findings were directly compared with regions of normal tissue or conventional histopathologic features when tissue for analysis was available. This study provides a composite series of in vivo OCT images of the oral cavity and oropharynx {{in a variety of}} normal regions and pathologic states as well as outline future applica-tionsofOCTtechnology.

40|$|Objectives: Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is an {{imaging modality}} {{that uses a}} broadband light source to produce high-resolution cross-sectional images in liv-ing tissue (8 – 20 !m). A prospective study of normal, benign, and pathologic tissues in the pediatric airwaywas conducted to assess the utility of OCT technology in char-acterizing the microanatomy of the pediatric upper aero-digestive tract in vivo. Study Design: Prospective clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients from 1 to 17 years of age underwent surgical endoscopy and OCT for various airway disorders. OCT imaging was per-formed at a frame rate of 1 Hz using a 1. 3 -!m broadband light source to produce images 1. 6 ! 6 mm in vertical and horizontal dimensions. The epithelium, lamina propria, and unique tissue microstructures were visualized and then measured using digital micrometry. Direct compar-ison of OCT images with <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography</b> was performed. Results: Systematic imaging of the oral cavity, oro-pharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx was performed in all 15 patients. Normal microstructures identified included papillae, ducts, glands, and vessels, whereas pathologic conditions included distinct zones of mature scar, granu-lation tissue, edema, ulceration, and papillomatosis. En-doscopic photographs were well correlated with OCT images. Conclusions: OCT is capable of obtaining high-resolution microanatomy images of pediatric airway in vivo tissue. OCT clearly identifies the epithelium and lamina propria while providing detailed structural infor-mation on normal and diseased tissues. OCT is a promising emerging imaging modality for use in current pediatric patient populations...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Although in {{stapes surgery}} {{successful}} hearing improvement may {{be achieved in}} the majority of patients, unsatisfactory closure of the air-bone gap can be recorded. One of many reasons for unexpected failures of stapes surgery may be the insufficient crimping of a stapes prosthesis onto the incus. The objectives of the study were to assess the amount of sound transmission loss in response to the quality of prosthesis crimping and to identify a required loop attachment pattern to obtain good sound transmission results. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental. METHODS: A temporal bone model was developed to measure the sound transmission properties between incus and prosthesis on 17 fresh human temporal bones. The attachment of a titanium stapes piston was assessed without crimping, followed by loose crimping and tight fixation to the incus, using scanning laser Doppler interferometry, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography,</b> micro grinding technique, and scanning electron microscopy. An algorithm had to be developed to simulate acoustical stimulation using electromechanical stimulation. RESULTS: Optimal tight crimping of the stapes piston revealed consistent good sound transfer function ranging from 0 to 7 dB loss, and loss remained, on average, at 2 dB. The mean transmission losses for conditions of loose crimping and no crimping were surprisingly small (within 10 dB). However, these unusual crimping conditions allowed a wide range of losses up to 28 dB. A close coupling at least at two opposite points was obligatory to obtain consistently good results. CONCLUSIONS: Perfect hearing reconstruction necessitates ideal crimping of a prosthesis to obtain consistently good results. However, the final functional gain depends on many different intraoperative and postoperative factors...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopy is not {{a modern}} {{invention}} but the history of endoscopy goes back to ancient times in Egypt and Greece when speculums were used to inspect the nose cavity, vagina and anorectum. The modern era of endoscopy started in the 19 th century {{with the development of}} straight metallic tubes with primitive light sources, such as Bozzini´s »lichtleiter« and Desormeaux´s »endoscope«. The first gastroscopy was conducted by Kussmaul in 1868 when he attempted to inspect the inside of the stomach by intubating a sword swallower with a 48 cm long straight metallic tube. During this time Bruck placed galvanised wire threads {{at the tip of the}} endoscope which markedly improved illumination (»galvanoscope«). In 1888, Nitze successfully made an endoscope with a miniaturized light bulb at the tip of the instrument. The first practical semi-flexible instrument was developed by Schindler in 1932 allowing deeper intubation into the gastrointestinal tract. Hopkins invention in 1954 of glass fiber bundles transmitting high quality images even if bent made the way for the flexible fiberscope developed by Hirschowitz in 1957. The fiberscope made it possible to use external high intensity light sources »cold light« improving illumination further. In parallel, Uri and Tasaka developed the »gastrocamera« allowing routine <b>endoscopic</b> <b>photography,</b> which remained standard until the incorporation of the CCD camera in the endoscope in 1983. The development of of videoendoscopy in the 1990 s revolutionized endoscopy and made the fiberscopes obsolete. The first capsule endoscopy performed in 1999, which opened up the door to wireless endoscopy. It is interesting that most improvements of endoscopy are the result of an innovative use of inventions from other scientific fields, such as optics, mechanics and photography. How future endoscopy will shape is difficult to guess but, as stated by someone, »the best way to predict the future is to invent it yourself...|$|E
