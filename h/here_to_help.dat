25|$|The Bideford District Association of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as it {{was then}} known) {{introduced}} a lifeboat service in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore. In 1831 the work {{was taken over by}} the Devon Humane Society and they built a new boat house at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. This was large enough for two boats and a second one arrived in December that year but in 1848 was transferred to a second boat house at Braunton Burrows {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary. It was easier to launch from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> ships on that side of the water but crews for lifeboats at Braunton Burrows always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851. This was expanded to house a second boat in 1856 and the old boat house at Watertown eventually lost its boats.|$|E

When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to Bluebeard, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> each other get through this thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E

As his train stopped in Eugene, Oregon, Nixon was met with protestors signs referencing his wife: [...] "Pat, What Are You Going to Do With the Bribe Money?"

2500|$|Iturbide {{returned}} to Mexico on 14 July 1824, [...] {{accompanied by his}} wife, two children, and a chaplain. [...] He landed {{at the port of}} Soto la Marina on the coast of Nuevo Santander (the modern-day state of Tamaulipas). [...] They were initially greeted enthusiastically, but soon they were arrested by General Felipe de la Garza, the local military commander. Felipe de la Garza was notorious in that he had been the head of a short-lived and unpopular revolt during Iturbide's reign. De la Garza gave up without a fight and was presented to Iturbide, who chose to pardon the general and reinstate him in his old post. The roles, as it happened, had not been reversed. Perhaps it was because of this debt that de la Garza wavered in his resolve to detain Iturbide, at first receiving him warmly, then arresting him and, on the way to his trial, de la Garza gave Iturbide command over the military escort that accompanied them, requesting that Iturbide presented himself to the nearby village of Padilla. Iturbide gave his word of honor and did as was bid, surrendering himself to authorities. The local legislature held a trial and sentenced Iturbide to death. [...] When a local priest administered last rites, Iturbide said, [...] "Mexicans! In the very act of my death, I recommend to you the love to the fatherland, and the observance to our religion, for it shall lead you to glory. I die having come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> you, and I die merrily, for I die amongst you. I die with honor, not as a traitor; I do not leave this stain on my children and my legacy. [...] I am not a traitor, no." [...] He was executed by firing squad on 19 July 1824. [...] Three bullets hit him, one of which delivered the fatal blow.|$|E
