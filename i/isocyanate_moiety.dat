The resultant product maintains the functionality of the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety,</b> {{which is used to}} attach poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether onto the copolymeric chain under benign reaction conditions. The resultant pseudo-star copolymers were isolated and their self-assembly in the presence of water studied...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of cultured human {{tumor cells}} with the chloroethylnitrosourea {{antitumor}} drug 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) selectively induces transcription and protein synthesis of {{a subset of}} the human heat shock or stress-induced genes (HSP 90 and HSP 70) with little effect on other stress genes or on expression of the c-fos, c-myc, or beta-actin genes. The active component of BCNU and related compounds appears to be the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety</b> that causes carbamoylation of proteins and nucleic acids. Transcriptional activation of the human HSP 70 gene by BCNU is dependent on the heat shock element and correlates with the level of heat shock transcription factor and its binding to the heat shock element in vivo. Unlike activation by heat or heavy metals, BCNU-mediated activation is strongly dependent upon new protein synthesis. This suggests that BCNU-induced, isocyanate-mediated damage to newly synthesized protein(s) may be responsible for activation of the heat shock transcription factor and increased transcription of the HSP 90 and HSP 70 genes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{grafting}} of polyamide 6 (PA 6) onto polystyrene (PS) {{can rely}} {{on the use of}} a copolymer of styrene (St) and 3 -isopropenyl-α,α-dimethylbenzene isocyanate (TMI), PS-co-TMI, to activate the polymerization of ε-caprolactam (CL) in the presence of sodium ε-caprolactam (NaCL) as an anionic catalyst. This article is aimed at answering the following key questions. First, do all the isocyanate moieties of the PS-co-TMI participate in the activation of the polymerization of CL? Second, what are the composition of the resulting polymer product and the structure of the resulting graft copolymer? The results show that the isocyanate moieties had all participated in the activation of the polymerization, implying that each <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety</b> has {{led to the formation of}} a PA 6 graft. The as-polymerized product was composed of a pure PS-g-PA 6 graft copolymer, homo-PA 6, and unreacted CL. Moreover, when the composition of a PS-co-TMI/CL/NaCL system was fixed, the mass ratio between the PA 6 grafts and PS backbone of the pure PS-g-PA 6 graft copolymer was almost a constant and was almost independent of its molar mass...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{reports on}} a route to synthesizing {{fluorescent}} labeled graft copolymers, on the one hand; and on a concept of tracer-compatibilizer for facile build-up of emulsification curves of polymer blends, on the other hand. For these purposes, blends composed of polystyrene (PS) and polyamide 6 (PA 6) are chosen. The synthesis of the corresponding tracer-compatibilizer consists of three steps: (1) copolymerization of styrene with 3 -isopropenyl-a,a'-dimethybenzyl isocyanate (TMI); (2) conversion of {{a fraction of the}} <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moieties</b> of the resulting copolymer into anthracene ones upon reacting with 9 -(methylamino-methyl) anthracene (MAMA); and (3) polymerization of e-caprolactam (CL) from the remaining <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moieties.</b> The resulting fluorescent labeled graft copolymer, denoted as PS-g-PA 6 -Ant, is used to build up emulsification curves of PS/PA 6 blends in a twin screw extruder (TSE), showing great usefulness of the concept of tracer-compatibilizer...|$|R
40|$|Single-chain {{technology}} (SCT) {{allows the}} transformation of individual polymer chains to folded/collapsed unimolecular soft nanoparticles. In this work we contribute to the enlargement of the SCT toolbox by demonstrating the efficient synthesis of single-chain polymer nanoparticles (SCNPs) via intrachain amide formation. In particular, we exploit cross-linking between active methylene groups and <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moieties</b> as powerful “click” chemistry driving force for SCNP construction. By employing poly(methyl methacrylate) - (PMMA-) based copolymers bearing β-ketoester units distributed randomly along the copolymer chains and bifunctional isocyanate cross-linkers, SCNPs were successfully synthesized at r. t. under appropriate reaction conditions. Characterization of the resulting SCNPs {{was carried out by}} means of a combination of techniques including size exclusion chromatography (SEC), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and elemental analysis (EA) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMucor miehei lipase (Mm-L) covalently bind on a hexagonally ordered silica SBA- 15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous), {{previously}} functionalizecl with <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moieties,</b> {{was examined}} as biocatalyst for transesterification of colza oil wills methanol. The isocyanate-mesoporous silica (NCO-SBA- 15) {{was obtained by}} condensation of silanol with triethoxysilane propyl isocyanate (TPI). The efficiency of the functionalization has been evidenced by infrared, Si- 29 and C- 13 NMR spectroscopies. The substrate provided a moderate hydrophobic microenvironment together with reactive sites for chemical immobilization of the enzyme. The biocatalyst containing 0. 28 g of Mm-L per gram of support afforded {{a high level of}} transesterification activity (yield up to 80 %) while using 1 : 1 molar ratio of methanol/colza oil and small amount of water. The biocatalyst showed higher operational stability than the corresponding physisorbed enzyme since it can be reused 6 times against 2 consecutive runs for the physisorbed enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Glutathione thiocarbamate conjugates of {{isocyanates}} play a {{key role}} in transport and final reactions of isocyanates in the human body by transcarbamoylation. N-acetylcysteine is the simplest model for thiocarbamate reactions. Therefore, transcarbamoylation of Nacetylcysteine adducts of p-tolylisocyanate (pTI-AcCys) and 4, 4 ’-diisocyanatodiphenyl- methane (MDI(AcCys) 2) with N-acetylcysteine methyl ester (thiolysis), morpholine (aminolysis), methoxyethanol (alcoholysis), and water (hydrolysis) has been studied in aqueous phosphate buffer solution and in dimethylacetamide (DMAc). Expected reaction products have been synthesised as reference compounds for HPLC-analysis. Concentrations of adducts and of reaction products were monitored by HPLC. Reaction rates and activation energies were determined for pTI in both media, reactions of MDI(AcCys) 2 were run at one temperature only. Formation of insoluble reaction products and side reactions due to hydrolysis prevented in depth kinetic analysis of the reactions. Two regimes of reaction rate were observed in aqueous buffer, clear second order kinetics resulted in DMAc. In aqueous buffer (pH 7. 4) a reactivity thiolysis > aminolysis > hydrolysis was found, while in DMAc aminolysis was faster than thiolysis. This can be explained by formation of thiolate at pH 7. 4, which is not possible in anhydrous DMAc. Reactions of (MDI(AcCys) 2) are by a factor of 2 to 4 faster than those of pTI-AcCys. p-Toluidine (pTA) was found in the aqueous system due to hydrolysis, while no 4, 4 ’-methylene dianiline (MDA) could be detected. Under physiological conditions hydrolysis should compete with thiolysis under homogeneous conditions while ureas and carbamates should be much more stable against hydrolysis. No free isocyanate groups could be detected in any of the reactions. In conclusion the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety</b> in thiocarbamates is readily transferred to sulfhydryl- and amino groups but not to aliphatic hydroxy groups. Under physiological conditions hydrolysis competes with these transcarbamoylation reactions. Formation of free isocyanate groups in analytical quantities was shown to be highly unlikely...|$|E
40|$|Isocyanates are of {{toxicological}} relevance {{since they}} are considered to cause occupational asthma. The majority of polyurethanes is based on aromatic diisocyanates (e. g., TDI and MDI), they are used for foams, elastomers, adhesives and coatings. Therefore we studied reactions of p-tolylisocyanate (pTI), 2, 4 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 4, 4 - methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (AcCys) with different molar ratios in aqueous buffer solutions of pH 5. 0 - 7. 4. Type and amounts of products formed in these reactions were identified and quantified. Conjugates of AcCys and the aromatic isocyanates have been synthesized and characterized as reference materials. Conjugates and ureas {{were found to be}} the main products. The ratio of these two compounds varied with the ratio of AcCys to isocyanate. Approximately 90 % of pTI conjugate were found for the 10 : 1 ratio, approximately 40 % conjugate for the 10 : 5 and around 15 % for the 10 : 15 ratio. For TDI yields of conjugate were comparable. Ureas, apart from minor amounts of TDA-urea could not be determined quantitatively due to formation of oligomeric ureas with different end groups. Minor amounts of MDI-conjugates were found apart from high amounts of insoluble material, which proved to be unreacted MDI encapsulated by oligomeric ureas. The reaction of the -SH group with the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety</b> is independent of the pH of the solution in the range studied. No diamine, i. e. 2, 4 -TDA or 4, 4 -MDA, could be detected in reactions of the diisocyanates 2, 4 -TDI or 4, 4 -MDI. Small amounts of p-toluidine (pTA) were found in the reaction of the mono isocyanate pTI when it was in excess with respect to AcCys. Reactions of the isocyanates with an aqueous buffer solution of pH 6. 5 in the absence of AcCys gave ureas as main products, while significant amounts of unreacted diisocyanates remained encapsulated in the mixture. No 2, 4 -TDA or 4, 4 -MDA was detected under these conditions. Again small amounts of pTA were formed from the reaction of pTI with water...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and isolation}} of two potassium, one lithium and two calcium complexes of imidazol- 2 -ylidene-N′-phenylureate ligands [ImRNCON(H) Ph] [(R = tBu (1 a); Mes (1 b) and Dipp (1 c); Mes = mesityl, Dipp = 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl] are described. Potassium complexes, [{κ 2 -(ImMesNCONPh) K} 4] (2 b) and [{κ 3 -(ImDippNCONPh) K} 2 {KN(SiMe 3) 2 } 2]n (2 c), were prepared in good yields by {{the reactions of}} 1 b and 1 c, respectively, with potassium bis(trimethyl) silyl amide at ambient temperature in toluene. Lithium complex [{(2, 6 -tBu 2 - 4 -Me-C 6 H 2 O) Li(ImtBuNCON(H) Ph) } 2 {ImtBuNCON(H) Ph}] (3 a) was isolated by a one-pot reaction between 1 a and LiCH 2 SiMe 3, followed {{by the addition of}} 2, 6 -tBu 2 - 4 -Me-C 6 H 2 OH in toluene. Calcium complex [{κ 2 -(ImtBuNCONPh) Ca{N(SiMe 3) 2 }-{KN(SiMe 3) 2 }]n (4 a) was isolated by the one-pot reaction of 1 a with [KN(SiMe 3) 2] and calcium diiodide in THF at ambient temperature. The solid-state structures of ligand 1 a and complexes 2 b, 2 c, 3 a and 4 a were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. It was observed that potassium was coordinated to the oxygen atom of urea group and to the nitrogen atom of the imidazolin- 2 -imine group, in the solid-state structure of 2 b. In complex 4 a, the calcium ion was ligated to the monoanionic imidazol- 2 -ylidene-N′-phenylureate ligand in a bi-dentate (κ 2) fashion through the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the isocyanate building block leaving the imidazolin- 2 -imine fragment uncoordinated. In the solid state of the potassium complex 2 c, tri-dentate (κ 3) coordination from the imidazol- 2 -ylidene-N′-phenylureate ligand was observed through the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the isocyanate building block and of the imidazolin- 2 -imine fragment. In contrast, in the dimeric lithium complex 3 a, the neutral imidazol- 2 -ylidene-N′-phenylureate ligand was bound to the lithium centre in a mono-dentate fashion (κ 1) through an oxygen atom of the <b>isocyanate</b> <b>moiety.</b> It is to be noted that in each complex thus observed, the elongated carbon-nitrogen bond distances indicate substantial electron delocalisation from the imidazole ring to the ureate group present in ligand 1...|$|E
