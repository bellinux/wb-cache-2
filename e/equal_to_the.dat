5|$|According to the 1598 bill of the Sejm, {{regional}} sejmiks for Livonia {{took place}} in Kieś, in some cases also in Ryga. After Swedish conquest of most of Livonia in the 1620s, the sejmiks were moved to Dyneburg. The nobility of the County of Piltyń, formally <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nobility of the Commonwealth, did not elect any envoys to the Sejm.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} {{is where the}} contact angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° occurs when the liquid–solid surface tension is exactly <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
30|$|When {{unbalance}} {{is small}} with 0.05  g·mm, {{there are four}} sub-synchronous frequency components: 0.5 ×, 0.12 ×, 0.3 ×, and 0.37 × from Figure  6 (a) and Figure  7 (a). Note that the whirl speed with sub 0.5 × which mainly caused by inner oil film approximately <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> half of rotor speed, and the predominated 0.12 × response which mainly caused by outer oil film <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> half of the ring speed.

5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} is <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average {{time it takes to}} execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E

5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable.

30|$|In this section, we {{evaluate}} our approach.

Accuracy <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proportion {{of the number of}} web pages that are correctly detected as phishing pages or normal pages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of total sample web pages. Precision <b>equals</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proportion of the number of web pages that are correctly detected as phishing pages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of total detected web pages.

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} greater than or <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered {{to be part of the}} range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E
5|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{finally came}} into force on 1 December 2009, {{granting}} Parliament powers {{over the entire}} EU budget, making Parliament's legislative powers <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the Commission President to Parliament's own elections. Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates beforehand, only the EPP (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.|$|E
