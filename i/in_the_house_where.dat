5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly and kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> {{they were raised}} as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while they were young. European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E
5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>where</b> she is symbolised as an earthenware pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E

The police could not force to enter {{the house and the}} standoff lasted for three days, provoking a tense political standoff. The opposition accused the intelligence service of blocking an investigation. Park and her party accused the opposition of harassing the woman. Park even said the standoff of the self lock-in was a violation against a female right in the presidential candidate debate that took place three days before the election.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged {{by local}} politicians, Carper {{successfully}} ran for Delaware's only {{seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 1982. He served five terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>where</b> he chaired the Subcommittee on Economic Stabilization. In 1992 he arranged a swap with term-limited Governor Michael Castle, and the two were easily elected to each other's seats. Carper governed for two terms as a moderate, business-oriented New Democrat, {{following the lead of}} the two previous Republican governors. He successfully prevented the closing of a General Motors automobile plant and won a bid for the headquarters of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca. He led a tax-reduction campaign and helped improve the state's credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent AAA. He pushed for standards-based education, among other reforms.|$|E

When asking Zach why she cannot stay in his room with him, Kendall concludes that it is because she slept with Ryan and that Zach has not forgiven her, which he confirms. He tells her that he will not forgive anyone anymore, not even Kendall. He does tell her that she is his wife and that he will protect her and his children no matter what.|$|E

500|$|In 1774, Joseph Webb Jr., also a {{successful}} merchant, married Abigail Chester {{and the couple}} remained in the house; they became well-known hosts and their house was nicknamed [...] "Hospitality Hall". The house's fame stems from George Washington's five night stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>where</b> he planned the Siege of Yorktown that led to American Independence with French general Comte de Rochambeau.

500|$|In 1961 and 1962, Aspinall {{had become}} {{good friends with}} Pete Best and {{subsequently}} rented a room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> Best lived with his parents. During one of the extended business trips of Best's father, the 19-year-old Aspinall became romantically involved with Best's mother, Mona Best, who was 17 years his senior. As a result, during this period, Aspinall fathered a child by Mona: Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best.

500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented a room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>where</b> Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's {{got nothing to do}} with you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E
500|$|In February, Marostica was {{the only}} Republican who {{announced}} plans to support legislation to repeal Colorado's Arveschoug-Bird limit, which capped the growth of general fund expenditures at 6 percent per year.
