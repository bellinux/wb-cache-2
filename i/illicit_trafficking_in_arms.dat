50|$|According to the Eurojust Decision, Eurojust may {{act when}} {{two or more}} Member states are {{affected}} crimes in which Europol is entitled to act, including organised crime, terrorism {{and other forms of}} serious crime (unlawful drug trafficking, illegal moneylaundering activities, crime connected with nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trafficking in human beings, motor vehicle crime, murder, grievous bodily injury, illicit trade in human organs and tissue, kidnapping, illegal restraint and hostage taking, racism and xenophobia, organised robbery, illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiquities and works of art, swindling and fraud, racketeering and extortion, counterfeiting and product piracy, forgery of administrative documents and trafficking therein, forgery of money and means of payment, computer crime, corruption, <b>illicit</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms,</b> ammunition and explosives, illicit trafficking in endangered animal species, illicit trafficking in endangered plant species and varieties, environmental crime, illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters). It may also act on other types of crime if they are committed together with one of the above or if it is requested by a member state. In 2010, about 10% of the cases handled by Eurojust fell into this category.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the recent evolution of transnational crime. By focusing on two specific criminal activities, namely the {{trafficking in human beings}} and the <b>illicit</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms,</b> it tries to establish the relationship between conventional criminal organisations and the official economy. It concludes by observing that the illegal services provided by conventional criminals to official economic actors are made increasingly redundant, because the latter tend to set up their own illegal practices which service their activity...|$|E
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the former Soviet Union, there were large stockpiles of <b>arms</b> left <b>in</b> Ukraine. The first prominence of the Ukrainian mafia came through their participation <b>in</b> the <b>illicit</b> international <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> these <b>arms.</b> Between 1992 and 1998, some $32 billion in military material disappeared from military depots in Ukraine and ended up primarily in West Africa and Central Asia. Allegedly, Ukrainian criminal organizations were also behind trafficking weapons to war-torn places such as Afghanistan at the time.|$|R
40|$|Rebel {{movement}} across Africa with {{proliferation of}} small arms and light weapons has created threats to peace, security, stability {{and development in}} the continent. The wide availability, accumulation and illicit flow of such weapons have helped in fuelling conflicts, causing series of havoc, undermined various peace agreements, intensified violence that had led {{to the death of}} many, increased refugees and Internally Displaced Persons, these weapons have left perpetual scars on many people. Thereby hindering the development of social stability, democracy and good governance in many African states. The work provide brief clarification of the key concept and overview of the activities of rebel movements and flow of Small Arms and light weapon into neighboring states in Africa. This work discusses the implications and also recommends that, there should be strong synergy among various government institutions within and outside the Africa continent to minimize the activities of rebel movements and the flow of small arms and light weapons into neighboring states in Africa. It has been estimated that over 100 million small arms and light weapons are circulating in Africa (Salopek, 2001). This proliferation has been facilitated by among other factors, the lengthy, porous and very often poorly policed borders, inefficient border controls, corruption, that make <b>illicit</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> small <b>arms</b> difficult t...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of small arms and light weapons (SALW) [about 700 million in circulation] has been causing deplorable security and other concerns of international law. SALW {{are the primary}} tools of violations/abuses of humanitarian principles by states, rebels, terrorists and criminals many consider them as the real {{weapons of mass destruction}} [พMD] of our time [about half a million deaths annually]. The unrestricted international transfers of SALW by states [99 states and 1000 companies involved in manufacturing and supply] {{is one of the major}} contributory and/or aggravating factor to the crises they are the main source of the <b>illicit</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> small <b>arms,</b> and therefore deserves prime attention. This thesis has dealt with questions of definition, manufacturing, trade/transfers, and some issues of state responsibility. Whilst a wide approach has been adopted to define SALW, the focus of the research has been on conventional small <b>arms,</b> <b>in</b> particular military-style weapons. There seems no substantive restriction upon small arms manufacture, although there are evolving norms to that effect. Issues of definition and manufacturing have been examined as a background to the main issue. The core legal problem tackled in the thesis is whether or not the law of arms control and other relevant norms of international law provide substantive restrictions upon the transfer of small arms by states, as a response to the crisis, with emphasise on supply-side of the issue. Some studies and publicists submitted that there are no rules of international law applicable to these transactions, save Security Council arms embargoes. The thesis will challenge this assertion from the perspective of the application of the norms of international peace and security, non-intervention, humanitarian and human rights laws, and/or evolved relevant customary rules of arms control relating to these norms. It will be argued that the international order has acquired applicable arms control and other existing obligations and restrictions, upon such transactions. Whilst the application of the aforementioned norms of international law to the problem has been fairly examined, the practices of the international community at all levels, including the position of prominent NGOs and publicists on the subject, have been particularly considered in the light of sources of international law and analogous legal regimes. The details of the legal standards are subject to the progressive development of international law; however, their violations may lead to the weapon supplier, recipient or other states’ primary responsibility. Finally, findings and recommendations of the thesis have highlighted the achievements and challenges of the international community and the legal measures that must be taken to arrest the illegal small arms transfer and their atrocious consequences...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{original}} and innovative work that analyses conventional {{crime and the}} crimes committed by powerful individuals and groups. Examines crimes in the street, illicit drugs and drug-related offences, crimes of the elite including corruption and corporate crime. This book examines a range of criminal activities conducted in different European contexts. Offences committed by individuals and groups endowed with different resources and status are examined. Each chapter contains an implicit rejection of generalizations and {{attention is paid to}} variations and differences. Rather than searching for a unified theory of crime, the author highlights the interpretive oscillations, which always occur when we are faced with criminal behaviour. In other words, each time we subscribe to one cause of crime we may realize that also the opposite cause possesses some reasonable validity. The originality of this book consists of the 'causality of contraries' running through the chapters, whereby a tentative aetiology identified in one context finds its complete overturning in anther. The author regards the 'causality of contraries' as a crucial aspect of the anti-criminological tradition to which he claims affiliation. These 'essays in anti-criminology' deal with crimes of both the powerless and the powerful, and seek to demonstrate that both the deficiency and the abundance of legitimate opportunities may lead to crime. In {{the first part of the}} book a conventional criminal activity par excellence is examined, namely activity related to the economy of illicit drugs. In this economy the author notes a shift from a Fordist to a Toyota model of criminal activity, a shift determined by the expansion of demand and the growing variety of supply of illicit drugs. The second part of the book addresses specific cases of elite criminality, including <b>illicit</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> and human beings. The chapters devoted to the analysis of political and administrative corruption in Italy, France, and Britain provide yet other examples of how illegal practices may be imputed to one cause in one context and its opposite in another. Two Intermezzos complete the book, posing more general questions, respectively, around the very concept of illicit 'drugs' and the evasive character of illicit economic behaviour...|$|E
