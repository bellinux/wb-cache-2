It is usually assumed that changes in head–head spacings across the bilayer, as measured from <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> <b>profiles,</b> equal the variations in hydrocarbon thicknesses. One can then determine {{the structure of a}} bilayer by comparison to the known structure of a lipid with the same headgroup.

We compare simulation and experiment in both real and Fourier space to address two main aspects: (i) the measurement of head–head spacings from relative <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> <b>profiles,</b> and (ii) the determination of the absolute scale for these profiles. We find supporting evidence for the experimental procedure, thus explaining the robustness and consistency of experimental structural results derived from <b>electron</b> <b>density</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, we also expose potential pitfalls in the Fourier reconstruction that are due to the limited number of scattering peaks. Volumetric analysis of simulated bilayers allows us to propose an improved, yet simple method for scale determination.
