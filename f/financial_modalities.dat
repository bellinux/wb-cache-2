40|$|Through {{unprecedented}} {{access to}} over 100 court files and sentences {{and interviews with}} police and security personnel in both origin and destination countries, this book provides the most comprehensive exploration to date of human trafficking and migrant smuggling in Eastern Europe and Russia. Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling in Southeast Europe charts the development and organization of the complex criminal networks involved in trafficking and smuggling, paying particular attention to: the entrepreneurship of criminals; social control mechanisms; the 'intermediate' structures, (such as transport modalities, safe houses, and embassies); <b>financial</b> <b>modalities,</b> and; the perspectives and agency of victims. Enriched with many case studies informed by police and judicial information, the book draws on interdisciplinary perspectives and will be {{of great interest to}} both criminologists and anthropologists studying international organized crime. nrpages: 172 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} much {{talk of the}} role of the ‘rising powers’ in Africa, and whether their engagements represent a ‘new paradigm’ in development cooperation. This article introduces this IDS Bulletin and examines Brazilian and Chinese agricultural development cooperation in Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. A wide variety of forms of support are seen, involving different <b>financial</b> <b>modalities,</b> including aid, concessional loans, trade deals and commercial investment. Our focus is on the ‘encounters’ that occur during negotiations and the intersection of wider framing discourses with practices on the ground in particular projects. Brazilian and Chinese domestic political dynamics, competing social imaginaries and histories of agrarian change all shape development cooperation. Meanwhile, African governments are not just passive recipients; they exert agency in negotiations, trading off different players. Outcomes depend on the particular context, and the new aid and investment scene in African agriculture is highly varied, presenting opportunities as well as challenges for the future...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the application of}} the Incremental Cost (IC) principle for the conservation of globally important habitats. It first describes the characteristics of the IC and how it became an important <b>financial</b> <b>modality</b> in multilateral conservation efforts. The application of the IC is then examined taking into account characteristics of successful collaboration efforts for the global environment. The paper finds that as currently applied, the IC fails to be a robust financial mechanism for protection of globally important habitats. It also heavily skews the bulk of conservation costs from developed to developing countries. The paper concludes with a description of suggested changes to make the IC an effective tool in global conservation efforts. ...|$|R

40|$|This article explores some {{effects of}} the British payment for {{performance}} model on general practitioners&# 8217; principles and practice, which may contribute to issues related to <b>financial</b> incentive <b>modalities</b> and quality of primary healthcare services in low and middle-income countries. Aiming to investigate what general practitioners {{have to say about}} the effect of the British payment for performance on their professional ethos we carried out semi-structured interviews with 13 general practitioner educators and leaders working in academic medicine across the UK. The results show a shift towards a more biomedical practice model and fragmented care with nurse practitioners and other health care staff focused more on specific disease conditions. There has also been an increased medicalisation of the patient experience both through labelling and the tendency to prescribe medications rather than non-pharmacological interventions. Thus, the British payment for performance has gradually strengthened a scientific-bureaucratic model of medical practice which has had profound effects on the way family medicine is practiced in the UK...|$|R
