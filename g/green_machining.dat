40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>machining</b> {{of powder}} {{metallurgy}} (P/M) components appears as an interesting procedure {{to solve the}} eternal {{problems associated with the}} poor machining behaviour of porous metallic samples. With the increasing usage of sinter-hardenable powders for high performance applications, <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> is an attractive method to lower production costs and compete against other shaping processes. <b>Green</b> <b>machining</b> is not a straightforward procedure. There is quite more to control in <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> than the cutting parameters. Several variables must be optimized to obtain adequate results in terms of surface finish, geometrical conformance and productivity. Other considerations such as density gradients in green compacts also influence the final outcome of this process. This study presents a new technique, based on cutting force measurements during green turning, to quickly and precisely characterize density gradients in powder metallurgy components. This new technique also allows the characterization of green machinability. Moreover, this study shows that timing sprockets can be produced by <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> of gear blanks. Timing sprockets produced by this process show a surface finish comparable to that of powder metallurgy components machined after sintering. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the high cost of {{finishing}} advanced ceramics, a strategy of near net shape machining in the so-called green state is often pursued before sintering.

Although <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> is used widely in industry, company know-how is based mainly on empirical data. After analyzing the influence of various factors such as machine tools, process parameters, tool geometry and cutting tool materials, this chapter summarizes the results of recent experimental investigations.

40|$|The <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> {{process is}} {{virtually}} a must if the powder metallurgy (PM) industries are {{to solve the}} lower machining performances associated with PM components. This process is known for lowering the rate of tool wear. Recent improvements in binder/lubricant technologies have led to high-green-strength systems that enable <b>green</b> <b>machining.</b> Combined with the optimized cutting parameters determined in Part I of the study, the <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> of PM components {{seems to be a}} viable process for fabricating high performance parts on large scale and complete other shaping processes. This second part of our study presents a comparison between the machining behaviors and the sintered properties of components machined prior to or after sintering. The results show that the radial crush strength measured on rings machined in their green state is equal to that of parts machined after sintering. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|The decisive {{advantage}} of PM manufacturing {{is the cost}} saving potential of producing net shaped parts with tight tolerances. Nevertheless, secondary operations such as machining are a major part in the manufacturing process of {{an increasing number of}} PM parts, since e. g. undercuts or holes perpendicular to the pressing direction cannot be produced by uniaxial pressing. Supplementary machining, mainly turning, drilling, and tapping, leads to noticeably increasing production costs, since machining is more difficult with porous PM parts than with pore-free materials. Especially the machining of high strength PM steels with martensitic or partially martensitic microstructure is often extremely difficult and cost intensive. Consequently, up to now heavy duty PM parts are often produced by double pressing, double sintering technology. With this technique, machining is usually done after the first sintering. From the economical point of view, it would certainly be preferable to save the second pressing and sintering steps and to produce the parts by alternative production routes. One of these alternative routes is the warm compaction technology, which can be combined either with <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> or with machining after sintering as a secondary shaping operation. The investigations presented in this thesis were started to provide for the first time reliable data on both process alternatives. The first part describes the chances and the limitations of <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> for the most important machining processes, drilling, tapping, and turning in interrupted cutting. The criterion for successful <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> is the product quality. The aim of the investigations is the optimisation of the cutting processes by variation of the cutting parameters and the tools. The optimum product quality which can be achieved by <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> is described quantitatively for all machining processes investigated. Additionally, the wear behaviour of different tool materials is tested in a spot check for one of the processes, the green drilling, to get a first impression of the relevance of tool wear for <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> applications. In {{the second part of the}} investigations, the machining behaviour after sintering is investigated for the same machining processes and for the same materials. For a comparison of the machining properties, cost optimum cutting speeds and the minimum cutting costs are established by tool life tests according to the Taylor and to the exponential model. Together with the results of the <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> tests, these data facilitate to decide which of both processes is favourable for a given application...|$|E

40|$|The <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> {{process is}} an {{interesting}} approach for solving the mediocre machining behavior of high-performance powder metallurgy (PM) steels. This process appears as a promising method for extending tool life and reducing machining costs. Recent improvements in binder/lubricant technologies have led to high green strength systems that enable <b>green</b> <b>machining.</b> So far, tool wear has been considered negligible when characterizing the machinability of green PM specimens. This inaccurate assumption {{may lead to the}} selection of suboptimum cutting conditions. The first part of this study involves the optimization of the machining parameters to minimize the effects of tool wear on the machinability in turning of green PM components.

40|$|The {{industrial}} production of ceramic components via the powder route {{often leads to}} severe shape distortions of the sintered parts caused by friction effects during pressing. Computation of the geometry of the part after sintering helps the manufacturer to reduce these by modifying the pressing tools, thus avoiding expensive hard machining of each part. In the present paper, {{the results of a}} finite-element analysis of the process steps uniaxial dry pressing of a cylinder and sintering after <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> are reported. High density gradients after pressing are calculated near the die wall. The sintering simulation predicts a severe deformation of the dense cylinder and reveals the beneficial effect of removing regions of non-uniform density by <b>green</b> <b>machining.</b> The final shapes of simulated and sintered geometries are in good agreement...|$|E

40|$|In the {{production}} of ceramic components machining in the green state bears many advantages according to flexibility and economy. This holds true especially for small lot sizes when compared to forming processes like moulding and pressing. But unfortunately in the ceramic industry, in most cases, the process design in <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> is based only on experience. Therefore, approaches will be presented for an economic and quality consistent <b>green</b> <b>machining</b> process by applying the potentials of modern machine tools and cutting tools like PCD. The situation is different {{in the area of}} fine machining of ceramics where numerous approaches have been presented in recent years towards optimizing the machining processes, which are already applied in industry such as grinding and lapping.
