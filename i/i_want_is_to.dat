500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boros {{preferred}} {{to refer to}} himself an advocate of base running: [...] "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team." [...] Always {{a student of the}} game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986. In an interview that year, Boros said: [...] "The science against stealing has evolved radically in {{the last four or five}} years. That has made it tougher than ever to steal. Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often. Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, she {{approached}} Harry James, offering {{to work for}} him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, [...] "Harry James was wonderful. When I joined him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. The one thing <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put me up for a chorus {{in the middle of an}} instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it." [...] She also told writer George T. Simon, [...] "I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again." [...] In his book, The Big Bands, Simon explained that Harry James constructed [...] "the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star." [...] It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including [...] "I Had the Craziest Dream" [...] in 1942, and 1941's [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You." [...] In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film Springtime in the Rockies, starring Betty Grable.|$|E
