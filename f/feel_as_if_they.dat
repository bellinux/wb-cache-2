Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and {{the ruins of the}} Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E
25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and well, as they have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are central to any group.|$|E

25|$|Vertigo is {{a medical}} {{condition}} where a person <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> or the objects around them are moving when they are not. Often {{it feels like a}} spinning or swaying movement. This may be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, or difficulties walking. It is typically worsened when the head is moved. Vertigo is {{the most common type of}} dizziness.|$|R
50|$|Marginalization {{occurs on}} an {{individual}} level when someone <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) {{as well as with}} dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).|$|R
25|$|In Poetics, Aristotle {{refers to}} {{action as a}} mode, or manner of {{representing}} something. Action is the demonstration of events as they are happening in a story, and may help readers <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were participating in the plot.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{stress is}} stress related to one's job. Occupational stress often stems from {{unexpected}} responsibilities and pressures {{that do not}} align with a person's knowledge, skills, or expectations, inhibiting one's ability to cope. Occupational stress can increase when workers do not feel supported by supervisors or colleagues, or <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have little control over work processes.|$|E

The physical layout of the school can be another obstacle.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo {{can also}} be {{classified}} into objective, subjective, and pseudovertigo. Objective vertigo describes when the person has the sensation that stationary objects in the environment are moving. Subjective vertigo refers to when the person <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are moving. The third type is known as pseudovertigo, an intensive sensation of rotation inside the person's head. While this classification appears in textbooks, it {{has little to do}} with the pathophysiology or treatment of vertigo.|$|R
5000|$|Patients in this {{category}} tend to adopt a joking attitude or to say things like [...] "there’s nothing to it!" [...] Because most pain is not preconceived by the patient, the patients tends to be blame their pain on the hospital staff. In this case, the patient <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have been mistreated. This is because the patient doesn't have the usual mindset that pain is an unavoidable result of an operation.|$|R
5000|$|Museum {{label and}} {{explanatory}} accessories {{are essential to}} a patron’s experience in a museum. Enough information should be provided that the patron <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> understand what they are looking at, but too much can bore or confuse the visitor. Some examples of these accessories are collection guides available for the overall museum experience, larger panels {{at the start of}} each gallery that can explain the intent of the collection, and smaller panels at each object should inform the viewer the object’s use, medium, creator, and dates.|$|R
25|$|An {{automobile}} simulator {{provides an}} opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{are sitting in the}} cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.|$|E
25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} insula stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.|$|E
500|$|The Hollywood Reporter John DeFore {{called the}} film [...] "genuinely moving" [...] and [...] "effortlessly {{balanced}} ... Brett Pawlak's handheld camerawork and Cretton's unsentimental direction have a frankness that acknowledges the dramatic extremes in these lives without needing to parade {{it before the}} audience." [...] Manohla Dargis from The New York Times also praised Cretton's direction, saying he [...] "brings you into this coed group home {{and the lives of}} its inhabitants casually, with images and scenes that, no matter how transparently considered, <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been caught on the fly." ...|$|E

The dialect coaches were assisted {{by him and}} Shippey received a personal mention in the closing credits. He summarized his experiences with the film project as follows: [...] "The funny thing about interviews is you never know which bits they're going to pick. It always <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> sit you down, shine bright lights in your eyes, and ask you questions until you say something really silly, and that's the bit they choose. At least they didn't waterboard me. But it was good fun, and I'd cheerfully do it again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chester Alan Arthur II was {{the second}} son of Ellen Lewis Herndon and Chester A. Arthur. Ellen was the {{daughter}} of explorer William Lewis Herndon. He was born on July 25, 1864 in New York City. His elder brother William Lewis Herndon Arthur, was born in December 1860, named after Ellen's father, and died in July 1863 from convulsions or swelling of the brain. It was particularly difficult for Nell, her husband wrote, [...] "Nell is broken hearted. I fear for her health." [...] <b>Feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had [...] "taxed" [...] William's brain with [...] "intellectual demands", they pampered their second son, who [...] "led a life that closely resembled that of European royalty." [...] He wore nice clothes, learned to sail and ride, and was taught charm and vanity. His parents had somewhat of a laissez-faire attitude about his academics.|$|R
500|$|Barjatya {{later told}} India Abroad, [...] "My attempt {{in this movie}} has been to reexpose the cinema-going public to the quintessential family life ... not {{to make people feel}} that they have come to see a movie, but make them <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have come to visit a big joint family that is {{preparing}} for a wedding". The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time. There were no villains, violence, or battles between good and evil. From conception to finished product, the film took four years. Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of [...] for playing the role of Nisha. Thereafter she became highest paid movie star (Males and Females) that remained till 2002.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim {{told me that the}} Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Shelly Johnson, in {{collaboration}} with director Lurie and the design team, also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers. For example, the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight, in contrast to Winter's office, which is artificially illuminated by lamps. As the film progresses, the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a broken window. The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques. Hand-held cameras were used when filming in the yard to make the audience <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "participants in the action". However, a very precise, sterile camera composition {{was used in the}} warden's office. The prisoners' world gets more precise during the film, while the colonel's world is filmed more loosely.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} is {{partly due to}} the very special climate of the Black Forest. Whilst in the vineyards of the foothill zone, it is almost Mediterranean, visitors to highlands, such <b>as</b> the Hornisgrinde, <b>feel</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are in Scandinavia. But this is compensated for in good weather by splendid views of the Rhine Plain in good weather.|$|R
60|$|On {{one side}} of the church, within an arched recess, are the monuments of Sir Walter Scott and his family,--three {{ponderous}} tombstones of Aberdeen granite, polished, but already dimmed and dulled by the weather. The whole floor of the recess is covered by these monuments, that of Sir Walter being the middle one, with Lady (or, as the inscription calls her, Dame) Scott beyond him, next to the church wall, and some one of his sons or daughters on the hither side. The effect of his being buried here is to make the whole of Dryburgh Abbey his monument. There is another arched recess, twin to the Scott burial-place, and contiguous to it, in which are buried a Pringle family; it being their ancient place of sepulture. The spectator almost inevitably <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were intruders, although their rights here are of far older date than those of Scott.|$|R
5000|$|Ginia Bellafante of The New York Times {{said the}} film [...] "recounts her story {{with none of}} the zeal, passion, terror and chaos that her mission involved" [...] and added, [...] "The {{producers}} strive for a solemnity that cannot be called maudlin [...] [...] [...] and wind up with something that <b>feels</b> lazy, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> believed the project's noble goals were enough to carry it." ...|$|R
500|$|However, {{other analysts}} have {{questioned}} whether the First Circuit's ruling would, in fact, have a widespread impact in the future. For example, {{an article in the}} Harvard Law Review noted that the First Circuit's ruling in Glik was evidence of the court's willingness to protect a [...] "vital First Amendment right", but that [...] "the proliferation of body cameras may make civilians <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> no longer need to record officers in the field". Writing for the Florida Law Review, Caycee Hampton criticized the First Circuit for providing [...] "no guidance [...] for [...] determining [...] what [...] situations [...] constitute a [...] 'public [...] space' [...] in which [...] a [...] citizen’s [...] right [...] to [...] film [...] government [...] officials [...] is [...] safeguarded [...] by the [...] First [...] Amendment", and absent such guidance, [...] "citizens who choose to record law enforcement officials [...] risk [...] inviting [...] the [...] same [...] Fourth [...] Amendment [...] violation [...] confirmed in Glik". Additionally, {{in an article in the}} St. Louis University Law Journal, Justin Welply argued that the right to film the police is not absolute, and that [...] "an individual has a First Amendment right to openly record police conduct in a public park, but does not have an established First Amendment right to openly record officers in the discharge of their duties during a traffic stop" [...] because filming the police during a traffic stop may interfere with their ability to work effectively.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{creating}} Rain World, Joar Jakobsson was a graphic designer in Sweden who taught himself how to animate sprites. He had played few games {{and had little}} industry experience when development began in 2011. He began with a sketch of an elongated cat, which was named [...] "Slugcat" [...] {{by one of his}} YouTube viewers, though the character has no official name. Jakobsson had previous interest in derelict environments, and what they reveal about the humans who previously occupied them. Partly inspired by his feelings of foreignness while living as an exchange student in Seoul, South Korea, a core idea in the game's development was to recreate the life of [...] "the rat in Manhattan". This rat understands how to find food, hide, and live in the subway, but does not understand the subway's structuring purpose or why it was built. Jakobsson and his development partner, James Primate, hoped that players would similarly <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were close to making sense of the game's abstraction of an industrial environment without fully understanding. Jakobsson designed Rain World enemies to live their own lives, in which they hunt for food and struggle to survive, rather than serve as obstacles for the player. Enemy placements are randomly generated, and in final playtests a week prior to release, the developers noted how some players became more or less interested in the game based on the luck of their enemy spawns. The developers expected players to learn to avoid combat and play the game primarily through stealth and flight.|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E
500|$|Deodato filmed Cannibal Holocaust {{using the}} cinéma vérité {{technique}} {{he learned from}} his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called [...] "hyperrealistic." [...] Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality {{is based on the}} direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the [...] "shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception," [...] and that [...] "this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality." [...] David Carter of the cult horror webzine Savage Cinema says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, claiming, [...] "The viewer <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them." [...] Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.|$|R

When Rebecca senses Donald and Bobby acting strangely, she <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are talking about her behind her back. Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thomson), {{inadvertently}} let it slip to Rebecca that Bobby is, Donald's daughter and Bobby's half-sister and cousin {{as a result of}} an affair he had with Rebecca's aunt Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). Rebecca reacts badly to this news, running away, causing locals to think she has committed suicide when her bracelet is found on the beach. Lance and Martin look for her in the water but Rebecca is revealed to be alive and well hiding out in a caravan at the Caravan Park where Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and his family, The Fletchers live. Rebecca then gives Lance and Martin a surprise when she appears in the water where they are searching for her.

500|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{received}} some praise for graphical improvements over its predecessor. Among {{the aspects of}} the game which received positive reactions were the game's environments. Just Adventure called the game environments [...] "head and shoulders above And Then There Were None," [...] describing the train's carriages on the Orient Express as oozing with elegance, and a faithful and accurate recreation of the 1930s. The site criticized the game for suffering graphically in later stages, but praised it overall for improving on the graphics of And Then There Were None. Game Chronicles was less enthusiastic, calling the graphics above average, but standard fare for a current adventure game. Character models were another aspect of Murder on the Orient Express which received positive attention. Quandary described the character modelling as much improved from And Then There Were None, and while still a tinge woody, [...] "all the characters <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> just {{stepped out of the}} book." [...] Adventure Gamers called the characters [...] "some of the best seen in recent adventure games," [...] saying that each character has a unique design and costume perfect for the game's setting. The reviewer also pointed out several small touches added to the characters, such as the main character shivering when she is outside the train in the cold weather, and also brushing lint off her clothing while waiting for the player {{to decide what to do}} next. Adventure Gamers also complimented AWE Productions for lighting effects in the game, and for creating a [...] "very soft glow to the scenes, which give a much more lifelike look to the characters." [...] IGN agreed that the interior of the Orient Express is quite sharp, but complained that character models lack detail and are animated awkwardly. Another complaint from IGN was that the compression used for cutscenes causes the animations to look [...] "washed out and blocky," [...] and that this problem continues as the cutscenes are noticeably pixelated throughout Murder on the Orient Express.|$|E

Architecture {{has the power}} to create an inclusive society where everyone <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> have a voice and responsibility to a sustainable future. With collaboration and dedication, architectural design can have a huge impact on the living conditions of underrepresented communities. Working through the Drachman Design Build Coalition, the scope of the project involves designing and constructing an affordable dwelling for a low-income family in the city of Tucson, Arizona. The overall mission of building affordable housing is to provide under-served families with housing opportunities that would not be otherwise. The house will be designed as a 2 - 3 bedroom dwelling with 2 bathrooms, and indoor living space, outdoor living area, and a carport. Through research and physical observation, potential sites were explored, sustainable strategies were learned, and affordable housing techniques were studied. Many iterations of housing models were developed based on information gained from local books and journals written on traditional southwestern housing designs. The Notch House starts to develop as a sustainable affordable housing project designed in response to underrepresented families in Tucson...|$|R
50|$|The {{future for}} what digital {{promotion}} holds is unclear as is changing dramatically all the time. This {{makes it hard}} for leading marketers around the globe to keep up to date with the development of technology and trends within consumers. The latest development in the digital area is the release of Virtual Reality. An example of one of the first uses of Virtual Reality being used for digital promotion happened in 2015 when the New York Times sent 1.1 Million Google Cardboard headsets out to its print subscribers while alongside releasing content on their website that the users could access and use with these headsets combined with their mobile smartphones. The content created news stories and also brand promotions such as the VR video of test driving the new Volvo XC90 where the user <b>feels</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are driving the car around a race track in the drivers seat. This promotion by The New York Times showed what is possible in Digital Promotion heading into the future with new technologies such as VR.
