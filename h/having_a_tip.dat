The shape functions {{turn out to be}} rational functions which also depend on rotation speed and element position along the beam and account for the centrifugal stiffening effect. These rational functions yield the Hermite cubic when rotation speed becomes zero. The new element is applied for static and dynamic analysis of rotating beams. In the static case, a cantilever beam <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> load is considered, with a radially varying axial force. It is found that this new element gives a very good approximation of the tip deflection to the analytical series solution value, as compared to the classical finite element given by the Hermite cubic shape functions.

40|$|It is now {{accepted}} that atomic force microcopy (AFM) can measure forces between atoms on a probe tip and a surface with true atomic resolution. AFM {{operation in the}} contact regime, where a tip and a surface are in close mechanical contact, is seriously affected by friction and local deformation of the tip and disturbs imaging the surface with atomic resolution. Frequency modulation AFM (FM-AFM) operates in the noncontact regime and thus can image the surface with true atomic resolution [1] without the disturbance. In FM-AFM, a cantilever <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> is driven on its resonant frequency. When the tip comes close to the sample surface, the forces acting on the tip weakly perturb the oscillation of the cantilever, giving rise to a small frequency shift in the resonance frequency. The small shift of the resonance frequency {{is used as a}} feedback parameter to control the tip-sample distance [1]. FM-AFM has been successfully used to investigate atomic detail of surface structure (semiconductor [3 - 5], ionic crystal [6, 7], metal oxide [8], and metal [9, 10] surfaces) in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).

40|$|In {{fatigue design}} of welded joints, the local {{approach}} {{based on the}} notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) assumes that the weld toe profile is a sharp V-notch <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> radius equal to zero, while the root side is a pre-crack in the structure. The ratio between the mode I NSIF and the linear elastic opening peak stress evaluated {{at the point of}} singularity (i. e. the V-notch tip) by the finite element (FE) method depends only on the type and size of the elements adopted in the discretization. The ratio between the mode II SIF and the linear elastic sliding peak stress evaluated at the crack tip has the same property. This useful property of the opening and sliding peak stresses evaluated by the FE method gives rise to the so-called peak stress method (PSM). In the present paper, it is adopted as an engineering, FE oriented application of the NSIF approach to fatigue design of welded joints. Originally applied to 2 D FE models, the peak stress method is combined here with 3 D numerical models to assess the fatigue strength of steel welded joints having complex geometry and characterised by toe as well as root cracking. A properly defined design stress, that is, the equivalent peak stress, is shown to correlate with good approximation all analysed experimental data...|$|E
40|$|We {{have grown}} homoepitaxial GaN nanowall {{networks}} on GaN template using an ultra-high vacuum laser assisted {{molecular beam epitaxy}} system by ablating solid GaN target under a constant r. f. nitrogen plasma ambient. The effect of laser repetition rate {{in the range of}} 10 to 30 Hz on the structural properties of the GaN nanostructures has been studied using high resolution X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The variation of the laser repetition rate affected the tip width and pore size of the nanowall networks. The z-profile Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed the GaN nanowall network retained the same strain present in the GaN template. The optical properties of these GaN nanowall networks have been studied using photoluminescence and ultrafast spectroscopy and an enhancement of optical band gap has been observed for the nanowalls <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> width of 10 - 15 nm due to the quantum carrier confinement effect at the wall edges. The electronic structure of the GaN nanowall networks has been studied using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and it has been compared to the GaN template.

The homoepitaxial growth of porous GaN nanowall networks holds promise for the design of nitride based sensor devices. ...|$|E

An electrical potential {{is applied to}} the anode and cathode to generate an electrical arc in the arc chamber from the cathode to anode.

The constrictor can have a electrically insulative portion disposed between the cathode tip and the nozzle anode, and an electrically-conductive anode extension disposed along the insulative portion so as to define an auxiliary gap with the cathode tip substantially smaller than the gap defined between the cathode and nozzle anode for facilitating startup of arc generation. The constrictor can also include an electrically-conductive electrode with a variable electrical potential to vary the shape of the arc generated in the arc chamber. Also, the cathode is mounted for axial movement such that the gap between its tip and the nozzle anode can be varied to facilitate a generally nonerosive generation of the electrical arc at startup and reliable steady state operation.

40|$|In {{fatigue design}} of welded joints, the local {{approach}} {{based on the}} notch stress intensity factors (NSIFs) assumes that the weld toe profile is a sharp V-notch <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> radius equal to zero, while the root side is a pre-crack in the structure. The peak stress method (PSM) is an engineering, FE-oriented application of the NSIF approach to fatigue design of welded joints, which {{takes advantage of the}} elastic peak stresses from FE analyses carried out by using a given mesh pattern, where the element type is kept constant and the average element size can be chosen arbitrarily within a given range. The meshes required for the PSM application are rather coarse if compared with those necessary to evaluate the NSIFs from the local stress distributions. In this paper, the PSM is extended {{for the first time to}} butt-welded joints in steel as well as in aluminium alloys, by comparing a number of experimental data taken from the literature with the design scatter bands previously calibrated on results relevant only to fillet-welded joints. A major problem in the case of butt-welded joints is to define the weld bead geometry with reasonable accuracy. Only in few cases such geometrical data were available, and this fact made the application of the local approaches more difficult. Provided the local geometry is defined, the PSM can be easily applied: a properly defined design stress, that is, the equivalent peak stress, is shown (i) to single out the crack initiation point in cases where competition between root and toe failure exists and (ii) to correlate with good approximation all analysed experimental data...|$|E
40|$|A {{design tool}} is {{developed}} that will produce an optimum geometry {{for a given}} trade-off between noise and performance. A vortex lattice model {{is used for the}} aerodynamics and a subsonic compact source model for the noise analysis. Optimizing the twist, chord and sweep distributions produced blades with favorable tradeoffs between noise and performance. The techniques used for noise reduction include: an inboard loading shift, diameter reduction, rotational speed reduction, increased blade sweep, and blade number increase. ^ Certain advanced propeller concepts are studied for their benefits. The two blades are (1) propleted, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> bent towards the suction side of the blade and similar to a winglet, and (2) a bi-blade, which is two propleted blades (one bent up and one down) joined at the tip. ^ The trade-offs for the optimized blades show that, for the straight blade, the most effective noise reduction method is to increase the blade number which both increases efficiency and decreases the noise. This is followed by blade sweep, which can decrease the noise up to 3 dBA with no efficiency loss, and rotational speed reduction, which reduces noise by 4 dBA per percent in efficiency loss. ^ More favorable trade-offs can be made in conjunction with the advanced concept propleted and bi-blades. Reducing the rotational speed 10 % with a propleted blade will drop both the noise level 4. 2 dBA and the efficiency 0. 1 % below that of the baseline straight blade. The bi-blade performance is even better: again using rotational speed reduction, the noise can be 14. 8 dBA less at the same efficiency or 1. 5 % more efficient at the same noise level. ^ The results demonstrate that this design tool is not only effective, but useful in the search for more efficient and lower noise propulsion methods. ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{describes}} a methodology {{for the analysis}} and design of turbomachinery components at low-fidelity level. This methodology {{is part of a}} broad, object-oriented environment developed at the Rolls-Royce VUTC. The approach described in this thesis is applicable to any axial turbomachinery configuration, however, main emphasis is made on compressors. The purpose of the research is to provide the opportunity to perform forced response, flutter and other unsteady analysis without the need for the expensive CFD runs. This is particularly demanded {{in the early stages of}} the aero-engine design process or in any other cases when the detailed information of the engine is not yet available, however, a broad unsteady parametric analysis based on the existing information is needed. The model uses a linearized form of the mass, momentum and energy budgets to relate small changes in the state of the gas at several positions in the machine to known disturbances at inlet or outlet, or to known changes in the geometry. The chosen approach allows usage of an arbitrary gas model without the assumption of constant gas properties. It also provides a straightforward way to obtain a steady-state solution in a minimal amount of iterations and to evaluate the exact values of the characteristic slopes. The unsteady solution methodology represents an extended and improved Semi-Actuator Disc model. The major improvements are the real geometry application, ability to handle rotating bladerows, loss models implementation and the cascade impedance model. As the solver is linearized, the harmonic perturbations are assumed to have small amplitude compared to the steady-state data and relatively long wavelength, compared to the blade measurements. Thus contributions of several perturbation sources may be superimposed within the model. The model has a block-wise structure, where every block represents a blade or an empty duct. Non-reflecting boundary conditions are applied to the blocks boundary interfaces together with a thought-through method for the angular frequency scattering. This allows assembling a multi-bladerow domain with both rotating and stationary bladerows for the unsteady analysis. A great deal of effort has been made to connect the system to a modern and general representation of the engine geometry. This data is then used to set up the domain geometry with minimal assumptions, thus considering the changes in areas, radii and the slope of the annulus. The complex blade profile information is accessible at any moment during the computation, thus allowing using a chosen set of loss and deviation models. The model uses the same geometry database as used for the CFD and FE analysis, however, any geometry data may be overridden on demand. The model has been validated on a variety of data, from the previous publications, for forced response and flutter and from alternative solvers for distorted casings. The agreement between the calculated results and the reference data is very satisfactory, with nearly exact match for a series of idealized cases. The improvements introduced in this approach, such as cascade impedance model and the loss and deviation model package extend and complete several statements made in previous publications regarding the effect of total pressure loss and presence of the passage end reflections. The model is also validated against more complex reference cases, such as 3 D CFD simulation of the LP turbine blade flutter, providing a good estimation of the damping curve slope in the low-ND region. <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> clearance loss model, the non-uniform casing simulations have been setup for evaluation of the relationship between the unsteady mass flow and pressure ratio perturbations. A thorough literature survey is made on the previous publications of the similar subject. The survey reviews a series of the modular systems for the axial turbomachinery analysis and then continues with the investigation of semi-empirical closures for the total pressure loss and outlet flow deviation modelling. The latter two play an essential role in this research as their implementation provides more realistic results, comparable to the heavy CFD runs. Greater part of the survey is devoted to the previous publications on various approaches for 1 D and 2 D unsteady turbomachinery modelling. The research completes with a thorough discussion of the features implemented and the results achieved, concluding with several future work proposals for the eventual further extension of the model as well as its applicability as a keystone for possible construction of a higher-fidelity solver. The primary programming object-oriented environment chosen for the model implementation is C++ with some parts written in FORTRAN. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Retinal Vein Occlusion is an eye {{condition}} {{which affects}} an estimated 16, 4 million people worldwide. The disease occurs when clots are formed inside retinal veins and disturb the oxygen delivery throughout the retina. This causes partial or even complete blindness {{in the affected}} eye. Current treatment methods can only slow down vision loss by tempering the side effects. A promising curative treatment method is retinal vein cannulation. In such procedure, the surgeon would insert a needle via a small incision in the eye into the affected veins and subsequently inject an adequate dose of a clot-dissolving drug. A surgical microscope, placed above the patient's eye lens, is used to visualize the instrument while it is being manoeuvred inside the eye. Despite promising pre-clinical studies, high complication rates keep surgeons from practising this treatment. The targeted vessels have a thickness ranging from 30 µm tot 400 µm and are extremely fragile. Unintended motions, such as the surgeon’s hand tremor and rotations of the patient’s eye due to instrument manipulation, make it extremely difficult to precisely insert the needle into the occluded vessel. Further, the surgeon can hardly detect whether the vessel is correctly punctured as puncture forces are mostly below the perceptible level and also visual information is not conclusive. Lastly, even if correctly inserted, the surgeon still needs to keep the needle steady throughout the injection phase which can be as long as 45 minutes. In short, the risk of damaging the vessel or the retina is extremely high. Because of these reasons, retinal vein cannulation remains a controversial therapy and is not performed in clinical practice today. This work reports on the development and evaluation of dedicated robotic technology to enable surgeons to perform retinal vein cannulation in a safe and successful manner. A prototype of a robotic system developed prior to this research is taken as a starting point. The robot offers a solution to immobilize the eye throughout the intervention and is designed to position a needle with µm-level precision. In this work, the system is further developed. An additional robotic platform enables the surgeon to pre-operatively position the system {{with respect to the}} patient in a timely and precise manner. Further, both a comanipulation and a telemanipulation strategy are proposed to control the system. In the case of comanipulation, the surgeon and the robot simultaneously hold the instrument. The surgeon retains full control over the instrument motion. Viscous forces generated by the robot minimize the surgeon's hand tremor such that the needle can be precisely inserted into the targeted vessel. In fact, the surgeon acquires a superhuman positioning precision. In the case of telemanipulation, the surgeon controls the tool indirectly via a joystick. To this end, a novel joystick based on an innovative mechanism is developed. Motion scaling between the joystick and the robot is used to minimize the effect of the surgeon's hand tremor. Another challenge exists in the development of an injection needle which is sufficiently slender to cannulate a wide range of vessels. In this research, the world's thinnest stainless steel injection needle is developed, <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>tip</b> diameter of only 80 µm. Additionally, the needle is equipped with an optic force sensor which is shown to be capable of automatically detecting 98 % of all puncture events. Auditory feedback is used to inform the surgeon on such event. Finally, the robot can lock the needle into position once inserted into the vessel. This enables a prolonged hands-free injection of the drug. The different functionalities of the developed technology are thoroughly validated {{with the aid of a}} number of dedicated test setups that were developed in the course of this research. Further, a junior retinal surgeon was invited to perform retinal vein cannulation on retinal vessels of ennucleated porcine eyes with the aid of the developed technology. The best results were obtained under assistance of the comanipulation system while receiving auditory feedback on the puncture events. The results are extremely encouraging as the technology enabled the surgeon to perform twenty successful cannulations and injections out of twenty attempts. When asked which operation mode he preferred, i. e. comanipulation or telemanipulation, the surgeon indicated to favour the comanipulation system as it closely mimics conventional retinal surgery. He indicated that he found it very intuitive to use and that the system delivers adequate levels of precision to reliably cannulate retinal vessels. Based on the promising research results and the accompanying scientific dissemination, a major step was made in the technology transfer of the presented developments. An IOF leverage project aimed at valorizing the technology was granted and a bilateral project in collaboration with a leading pharmaceutical company was established with the ultimate goal to clinically enable robot-assisted retinal vein cannulation. Further, the current robot design together with promising alternative robot embodiments presented in this PhD are covered in a patent application. Finally, EurEyeCase, a H 2020 European project coordinated by KULeuven, was granted. The project broadens the application of the robotic system to other challenging retinal procedures. The final goal of the project is to conduct a number of human trials with the aid of the developed technology. status: publishe...|$|E
