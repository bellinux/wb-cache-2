5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E

Meanwhile, with Mercer (Ryan Devlin) imprisoned for the campus rapes, Veronica {{tries to find}} the truth. This {{investigation}} leads to an instance in which Veronica is drugged {{and a part of}} <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> removed by a mysterious figure. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) questions the morality of his relationship with Harmony (Laura San Giacomo), leading to their breakup.|$|E
5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above her ear. Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E
50|$|In both incarnations, Spider Girl {{possesses}} prehensile hair. She can use <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> to ensnare or bind her opponents. As Wave, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> bluish; as Spider Girl, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> reddish.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{during the}} {{shooting}} of the music video when the pink slime came out, Lavigne tells that days later <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> still pink and she needed to redye it because during the next days she was scheduled to have a photoshoot with 'Cosmopolitan' and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> looking really messy and all pink.|$|R

5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the various}} rooms, she meets men wearing vest tops with their faces painted white with black eyes {{staring at her}} as she passes down the corridor. Later she meets other people in leather and masks, before being {{surrounded}} by a troop of lace-clad dancers. One shot shows a man in colourful clothes and leopard print Speedos surrounded by bubbles in a bathtub. Another room contains a family of four mannequins in a 1960s-styled kitchen, preparing for a plastic-looking meal. A bare African-American is seen dancing and painting herself with a large brush while being almost naked. She is also seen with her legs spread around a TV screen and Beyoncé is seen on it, singing the song. During one scene, Beyoncé performs a dance choreography on a couch along with several other female dancers. Throughout the video, she is seen wearing a tuxedo with a tie, a white fur jacket and platform heels designed by Saint Laurent. The black-and-white jumpsuit she wears is designed by Russian designer Ulyana Sergeenko. Her look is further complete with dark make-up around the eyes and red lipstick while <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> marcelled and blonde.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

6000|$|... "Miriam was a beauty. I {{had known}} that before, though I think I hardly {{expected}} to see such wonderful loveliness. She was tall and extremely graceful, dark--at least <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> dark, but <b>her</b> skin was wonderfully fair and clear. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>was</b> gathered away from her face, {{and she had a}} high, pure, white forehead, and the straightest, finest, blackest brows. Her face was oval, with very large and dark eyes.|$|R
5|$|Varahi may be two, four, or six-armed. The Matsya Purana, the Purva-karnagama and the Rupamandana {{mention a}} four-armed form. The Rupamandana says she carries a ghanta (bell), a chamara (a yak's tail), a chakra (discus) and a gada (mace). The Matsya Purana omits the ghanta {{and does not}} mention the fourth weapon. The Purva-Karanagama {{mentions}} that she holds the Sharanga (the bow of Vishnu), the hala (plough) and the musula (pestle). The fourth hand is held in the Abhaya ("protection gesture") or the Varada Mudra ("blessing gesture"). The Devi Purana mentions her attributes as being sword, iron club and noose. Another description says <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> adorned with a garland with red flowers. She holds a staff and drinking skull-cup (kapala). The Varahini-nigrahastaka-stotra describes her attributes as a plough, a pestle, a skull-cup and the abhaya mudra. The Vamana Purana describes her seated on Shesha while holding a chakra and a mace. The Agni Purana describes her holding the gada, shankha, sword and ankusha (goad). The Mantramahodadhi mentions she carries a sword, shield, noose and goad. In Vaishnava images, since she is associated with Vishnu, Varahi may be depicted holding all four attributes of Vishnu — Shankha (conch), chakra, Gada and Padma (lotus). The Aparajitapriccha describes her holding a rosary, a khatvanga (a club with a skull), a bell, and a kamandalu (water-pot).|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

25|$|Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes {{involved}} with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, {{under the leadership of}} Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint) and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans (Thom Hoffman). Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son {{and other members of the}} Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander Hauptsturmführer Ludwig Müntze (Sebastian Koch), bleaching all of her hair blonde. Müntze invites her to a party at the local SD headquarters, and there, Ellis recognises Obersturmführer Günther Franken (Waldemar Kobus), Müntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with Müntze, who, in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>is</b> bleached and she is a Jew, but does not care. She also becomes friends with her Dutch colleague Ronnie (Halina Reijn), who collaborates with the Germans, working for them, being sexually available to them (particularly Franken), and accepting stolen gifts from them.|$|E
