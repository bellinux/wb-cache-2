The thickness and morphology of the melting zone in the Ti/NiCr <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> bar are investigated by means of optical microscopy. Results show that {{the distribution of the}} melting zone in the interface of the Ti/NiCr <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> bar is uniform and axisymmetric, and boundaries of the melting zone are circular arcs, whose center points {{to the center of the}} NiCr bar. The bamboo-shaped cracks generate in the melting zone. The thickness of the melting zone decreases with reducing of the stand-off distance and the thickness of the explosive. A physical model of the melting zone in the interface of the <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> bar is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of explosive welding (EXW) {{was used for}} development of metallic multilayer ballistic resistant materials. <b>Explosive</b> <b>cladded</b> two or multilayer materials serve as final product or as semi-finished product for further processing, e. g. rolling. The objective is to create material with sufficient ballistic resistance at relatively small thickness of the resulting multilayer structure. Under retaining the weight of armoured vehicle its ballistic resistance can be increased or, under retaining its existing ballistic resistance the weight can be reduced. Resulting material should be producible of commercially available metallic materials using common technologies, especially the {{technology of}} roll welding (ROW). For the primary tests {{it is possible to}} model the resulting structure by means of EXW and some its properties can be verified in the initial stage of research of the multilayer structure (e. g. tests of heat processing, verification of diffusion processes, behaviour under various types of load, verification of ballistic resistance and other technological tests). Subsequently, production can start of large semi-finished products by means of ROW technology. Effective preparation is possible of the samples of multilayer materials by means of EXW technology in various material combinations- armour steel, tool steel and interlayer based on nickel, nickel alloys etc...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: An {{analysis}} {{of quality of}} bimetallic joint between aluminium and copper layers of billet for extrusion process {{is the subject of}} the work. Design/methodology/approach: For preparing the quality {{analysis of}} particular layer of bimetal, the shearing test were done. During the tests the maximal stress for particular sets of the bimetal was established. For chosen cases the metallographic research of Al-Cu joint were done. Findings: The geometry of the cylindrical set and <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> process parameters which allow to obtain the cylindrical bimetallic billets without cracks and delaminations and also with uniform cladded layer along and across the billet. Research limitations/implications: The analysis is concerning the explosive joint of pure aluminium Al 995 and electrolytic copper M 1 E 99, 97 in cylindrical sets. In the future research the analysis of this kind of joints after direct extrusion process is planning.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> is a non-conventional, {{solid-phase}} bonding {{technique in}} which bonding between two plates {{is produced by}} their high velocity collision induced {{by the use of}} explosives. Attempts were made to explosive clad Titanium-Stainless steel (SS 304 L) plates (3. 5 and 3. 0 mm thick respectively). The experiments were designed to analyze the bonding interface parallel to the detonation direction. The presence of intermetallics, caused by the melting at the interface due to kinetic energy dissipation, was observed in some locations. The process parameters of the explosive welding of Titanium-Stainless steel combination are defined using the microstructural observations, microhardness at the interface, the results of X-ray diffraction study.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to produce {{composite}} plates by <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> process. This is a process in which the controlled energy of explosives is used to create a metallic bond between two similar or dissimilar materials. The welding conditions were tailored through parallel geometry route by using different explosive ratios to produce both wavy and straight interfaces. In this investigation, a two-pronged study was adopted to establish the conditions required for producing successful solid state welding: (a) Analytical calculations to determine the weldability window; (b) Metallurgical investigations of experiments carried out under different conditions. The required parameters in the experiments were selected through numerical simulations. The analytical calculations confirm the experimental results. Optical microscopy studies show that a transition from a smooth to wavy interface occurs with increase in explosive ratio. Scanning electron microscopy studies show the formation of intermetallic layer in the interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aluminum alloy-aluminum-steel {{cladding}} {{plates were}} manufactured by explosive welding. Microstructures of the cladding plates were observed and the interface bonding properties were tested. Aluminum alloy-aluminum-steel transition joints were produced by welding the <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> plates. The bonding interface configuration and property were investigated and tested after welding. The effects of welding technology {{on the interface}} bonding properties were discussed. The results showed that metallurgical behavior has been occurred at the bonding interfaces between aluminum alloy and aluminum and aluminum and steel. Regular sine waves have appeared on the bonding interface between aluminum alloy and aluminum. However, the bonding interfaces between aluminum and steel present line-shape. The shear strength and separate strength of the cladding plates were {{much higher than the}} standard strength. After being welded, the configuration of the bonding interface has no marked change.

40|$|Purpose: Bimetallic bars which possess higher {{corrosion}} resistance and mechanical properties, {{it is the}} newkind of bimetallic bars which are better than standard bars. The bimetallic bars are more often applied in concreteconstruction. There are few methods which ensure a good strength of bimetallic layer bond. Hydrostatic extrusion,rotary rolling and <b>explosive</b> <b>cladding</b> are most often used methods. Design/methodology/approach: The simulations of the bar rolling in a three-high skew mill were carriedout using the Forge 2005 ® commercial program. Findings: The higher value of yield stress of the cladding layer does not produce the effect of “flowing down” ofthis layer over the core surface and it’s folding between the rolls. The use of non-corrosive steel on plating layerassures receipt on a high durability and esthetics bimetallic bars. Practical implications: Bimetallic bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of concreteconstructions, and as working elements in bridge building in aggressive environment. Originality/value: Production of bimetallic bars is very difficult. One from many problems during productionbimetallic bars is assurance good strength of bimetallic layer bond. A theoretical analysis of bimetallic bar rollingin a three-high skew mill {{is presented in the}} paper and the distributions of stress and strain intensities in thebimetallic bar during skew rolling are shown...|$|E
