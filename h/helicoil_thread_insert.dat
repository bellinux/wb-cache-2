5000|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> to ensure a good retention.|$|R

Since that time, applications for helical coil inserts have come into broad usage in aerospace, automotive and industrial equipment. Usage originally included metric spark plus sizes that were delineated in Europe in the 1950s coming into inch using countries in the 1960s. ASME Subcommittee 29 of the B18 Committee put together {{the first version of}} a standard in 1993.

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert,</b> is a {{one-piece}} internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side.

50|$|The {{second type}} of captive nut is a <b>threaded</b> <b>insert.</b> These are either pressed into holes in the {{material}} to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{categories}} of songket weaving equipments; the main weaving equipment made from wooden or bamboo frame; and the supporting equipment which includes thread stretching tool, motif making tool, <b>thread</b> <b>inserting</b> and picking tools. The materials for making songket consist of cotton or silk threads or other fibers as the base fabric and decoration threads made from golden, silver or silk threads. It is believed that in ancient times, real gold threads were used to create songket; the cotton threads were run along heated liquid gold, coating the cotton and creating gold thread. However today because the scarcity and the expensiveness of real gold threads, imitation gold or silver threads are commonly used instead.|$|R
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{panels are}} a popular construction technique {{due to their}} increased construction speed, low cost {{and the ability to}} use the precast concrete elements for structural walls to provide high strength and stiffness when used for structural purposes. Slender precast concrete wall panels are a common construction method for single storey warehouse type buildings. Following the Canterbury earthquake sequence Christchurch from 2010 – 2014, damage was observed in precast concrete wall buildings that resulted in out-of-plane collapse of wall panels.. This project seeks to investigate the behaviour of precast reinforced concrete walls designed for limited ductility under gravity and quasi-static in-plane loading. The main point of interest in this thesis research is to understand the seismic behaviour of the connection as well as the out-of-plane stability of slender panels. To investigate the behaviour of this panel and connection type, three slender precast concrete walls, representing full scale panel geometry were subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. Two common panel to foundation connection types were studied: 1) <b>threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> and 2) traditional starter bars as well as one alternative connection which was developed as a means to improve the out-of-plane response and understand the impact of this design choice on the in-plane behavior of the wall. For all the three units, the dowel connection performed well and the thin wall failed under flexural failure due to loss of strength cause by fracturing of longitudinal rebars after being buckled under the effects of lateral cyclic loading. Significant horizontal cracking occurred on each of the tests at dowel level except unit <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> with 50 mm cover behind the head of the insert (TI 12 -C 50 -IP) which suffered a secondary horizontal crack at 500 mm above the main crack and a diagonal crack {{at the center of the}} wall. Moreover, this unit was able to undergo more deformation due to a secondary crack...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of model Francis runner {{to be used}} in the Waterpower laboratory at NTNU is a length and costly process. Due to the production cost there are years between each time a new Francis model is bought. The Tokke Francis model at Waterpower laboratory, was given from the industry after they had run model tests in the laboratory when design- ing the Tokke prototype. In order to give the students at the Waterpower laboratory an opportunity to design their own turbines and test, the production cost must be significantly reduced. To be able to do that, new designs need to be developed and new production method used. The objective of this thesis is to carry out a new mechanical design of a Francis model runner and evaluate different mechanical designs of guide vanes and stay vanes. The new alternative designs were made with a combination of standard production methods and material, and new plastic materials from rapid prototyping such as selective laser sintering (SLS) and rapid CNC machining. To carry out the new mechanical runner design, the MATLAB design software Khoj was used. From Khoj two sets of streamlines were generated, one set for the sucction side and one for the pressure side. Then the streamlines were imported into the CAD program PTC Creo Parametric and a 3 D-model of the design was made. Two test pieces in a polyamide material was made using selective laser sintering. One of the test pieces was tested for pull-out strength using some self tapping <b>thread</b> <b>inserts,</b> the results showed that the pull-out strength was more than good enough. The <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> could be used to attach the runner vanes to the hub and ring. The main focus of this thesis has been the new mechanical design of a model runner and runner vanes. The model design was not produced and tested in the laboratory due to lack of time and money. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{solid rocket}} booster uses {{hydraulic}} pumps fabricated from cast C 355 aluminum alloy, with 17 - 4 PH stainless steel pump port caps. Corrosion-resistant steel, MS 51830 CA 204 L self-locking screw <b>thread</b> <b>inserts</b> are installed into C 355 pump housings, with A 286 stainless steel fasteners installed into the insert {{to secure the}} pump port cap to the housing. In the past, pump port cap fasteners were installed to a torque of 33 Nm (300 in-lb). However, the structural analyses used a significantly higher nut factor than indicated during tests conducted by Boeing Space Systems. When the torque values were reassessed using Boeing's nut factor, the fastener preload had a factor of safety of less than 1, with potential for overloading the joint. This paper describes how behavior was determined for a preloaded joint with a steel bolt <b>threaded</b> into steel <b>inserts</b> in aluminum parts. Finite element models were compared with test results. For all initial bolt preloads, bolt loads increased as external applied loads increased. For higher initial bolt preloads, less load was transferred into the bolt, due to external applied loading. Lower torque limits were established for pump port cap fasteners and additional limits were placed on insert axial deformation under operating conditions after seating the insert with an initial preload...|$|R
