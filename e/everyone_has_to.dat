5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), and Phyllis Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
25|$|Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) covers {{long-term}} {{nursing and}} care. While Dutch residents are automatically insured {{by the government}} for AWBZ, <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> take out their own basic healthcare insurance (basisverzekering), except those under 18 who are automatically covered under their parents' premium. If you don't take out insurance, you risk a fine. Insurers have to offer a universal package for everyone {{over the age of}} 18 years, regardless of age or state of health – it's illegal to refuse an application or impose special conditions. In contrast to many other European systems, the Dutch government is responsible for the accessibility and quality of the healthcare system in the Netherlands, but not in charge of its management.|$|E

This is a reference to Begley's environmental activism.|$|E
500|$|During the movie's press tour {{she also}} said her {{performance}} as Miranda was inspired by different men she knew, but did not say which ones. In 2016 she disclosed to Variety that she took Miranda's soft speaking style from Clint Eastwood: [...] "He never, ever, ever raises his voice and <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> lean in to listen, and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room." [...] However, she said, Eastwood does not make jokes, so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director Mike Nichols, whose delivery of a cutting remark, she said, made everyone laugh, including the target. [...] "The walk, I’m afraid, is mine,” Streep added.|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> uncover their {{relationship}} to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

500|$|Robson {{was created}} a Knight Bachelor in 2002, was {{inducted}} {{as a member}} of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003, and was the honorary president of Ipswich Town. From 1991 onwards, he suffered recurrent medical problems with cancer, and in March 2008, put his name and efforts into the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, a cancer research charity which has so far collected over £7million (March 2014). In August 2008, his lung cancer was confirmed to be terminal; he said, [...] "My condition is described as static and has not altered since my last bout of chemotherapy... I am going to die sooner rather than later. But then <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go sometime and I have enjoyed every minute." [...] He died just under a year later.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E

500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E
2500|$|After President George W. Bush {{nominated}} White House Counsel Harriet Miers on October 3, 2005, {{for a seat}} on the U.S. Supreme Court, DeWine said [...] "I {{think the}} fact she doesn't have judicial experience will add to the diversity of the Supreme Court.... There is no reason <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have that same [...] background." [...] Opposition from conservative groups unhappy with Miers' resume ultimately sank her nomination.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, Cavafy wrote [...] "Ithaca", {{inspired}} by the Homeric return journey of Odysseus to his home island, as depicted in the Odyssey. The poem's theme is that enjoyment of the journey of life, and the increasing maturity of the soul as that journey continues, are all the traveler can ask for. To Homer, and to the Greeks in general, not the island, {{but the idea of}} Ithaca is important. Life is also a journey, and <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> face difficulties like Odysseus, when he returned from Troy. When you reach Ithaca, you have gained so much experience from the voyage, that it is not very important if you reached your goals (e.g. Odysseus returned all alone). Ithaca cannot give you riches, but she gave you the beautiful journey.|$|E

60|$|Sir Robert Napier {{arrived here}} with his {{personal}} staff the day before yesterday, having been five days en route, spending one day carefully examining each station, inquiring, as is his custom, into every detail, and seeing how each department worked. Never was a commander more careful in this inquiry into every detail than is Sir Robert Napier. Nothing escapes him. He sees everything, hears what <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say, and then decides firmly upon {{what is to be}} done. The army have rightly an unbounded confidence in him. He is essentially the man for an expedition of this sort. His reputation for dash and gallantry is well known, {{but at the same time}} he has a prudence and sagacity which will fit him for the extremely difficult position in which he is placed. If it is possible to make a dash into Central Abyssinia, undoubtedly he will do it; if, on the other hand, it cannot be done without extraordinary risk and difficulty—if it is next to impossible—no amount of outcry at home will drive him to attempt it.|$|E
