5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} challenges {{depending on the}} subject, what the photographer wants to highlight, or how many subjects are in the frame. Therefore, photographing a single person and, for instance, if the photographer wants to highlight {{only half of the}} subject's face, a single light source placed laterally, at a certain distance and angle to the subject, and possibly a blend, will be usually used. Experimenting with different light intensities is performed until the desired effect is achieved. For photographing two people or a static scene, two or even three sources of light (one or two for contour, and a very low-intensity <b>fill</b> <b>light)</b> are usually used.|$|E
500|$|Matte {{paintings}} of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's Treasure Island, which already had appropriate art deco architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating [...] "Berlin Flughafen". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings {{were used for the}} sky and to give the appearance of <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.|$|E

500|$|Hall's {{approach}} {{was to create}} peaceful compositions that evoked classicism, to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events and allow audiences {{to take in the}} action. Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene, but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary. In most cases, Hall first lit the scene's subject by [...] "painting in" [...] the blacks and whites, before adding <b>fill</b> <b>light,</b> which he reflected from beadboard or white card on the ceiling. This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> unobtrusive and the dark areas free of spill. Hall shot American Beauty in a [...] in the Super 35 format, using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 35mm film stock. He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the petal-filled pool in its overhead shot, creating a frame around Angela within. He shot the whole film at the same T-stop (T1.9); given his preference for shooting that wide, Hall favored high-speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects. He used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company's Primo series of prime and zoom lenses. Hall employed Kodak Vision 200T 5274 and EXR 5248 stock for scenes with daylight effects. He had difficulty adjusting to Kodak's newly introduced Vision release print stock, which, combined with his contrast-heavy lighting style, created a look with too much contrast. Hall contacted Kodak, who sent him a batch of 5279 that was 5% lower in contrast. Hall used a 1/8inch Tiffen Black ProMist filter for almost every scene, which he said in retrospect {{may not have been the}} best choice, as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its anamorphic release print led to a slight amount of degradation; therefore, the diffusion from the filter was not required. When he saw the film in a theater, Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter, the diffusion from the Super 35–anamorphic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended.|$|E
500|$|After {{location}} {{shooting was}} completed, shooting {{on the new}} Engineering set began May 3. The set lasted {{less than a day}} in its pristine condition before it was [...] "Borgified". Filming then proceeded to the bridge. During normal operation scenes, Leonetti chose to cast crosslighting on the principals; this required the ceiling of the set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around the sides. These lights were then directed towards the actors' faces at 90-degree angles. The set was lined with window paneling backed by red lights, which would blink intermittently during red-alert status. These lights were supplemented by what Leonetti called [...] "interactive light"; these were off-stage, red-gelled lights that cast flashing rims on the bridge set and heads of the crew. For the Borg intrusion, the lighting originated solely from instrument panels and red-alert displays. The <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> on these scenes was reduced so that the cast would pass through dark spots on the bridge and interiors out of the limited range of these sources. Small 30- and 50-watt lights were used to throw localized shafts of light onto the sets.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Rembrandt lighting" [...] (or [...] "Rembrandtian light") {{is a term}} {{correlated}} {{mostly with}} low-key portrait photography, and uses a light source and a reflector, or two sources of light (a main and a very low intensity <b>fill</b> <b>light).</b> [...] The term was named after the style of lighting the face in most of Rembrandt's self-portraits, but also in other works, such as the Portrait of an Old Man in Red (1652-1654), dominated by Tenebrism.|$|E
50|$|The {{triangle}} {{should be}} no longer than the nose and no wider than the eye. This technique may be achieved subtly or very dramatically by altering the distance between subject and lights and relative strengths of main and <b>fill</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the main and the <b>fill</b> <b>lights,</b> known as light ratio, can be measured using a light meter. The low-key technique has a higher light ratio, for example 8:1, while the high-key technique has a lower ratio, around 1:1.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Thanks to {{its ability}} to improve the realism of computer-generated imagery, the use of global {{illumination}} has recently become widespread among digital lighting artists. It remains unclear, though, what impact it has on the lighting design workflows, especially for novice users. In this paper we present a user study which investigates the use of global illumination, large area <b>lights,</b> and non-physical <b>fill</b> <b>lights</b> in lighting design tasks, where 26 novice subjects design lighting with these tools. The collected data suggest that global illumination is not significantly harder to control for novice users that direct illumination, and when given the possibility, most users opt {{to use it in}} their designs. The use of global illumination together with large area lights leads to simpler lighting setups with fewer non-physical <b>fill</b> <b>lights.</b> Interestingly, global illumination does not supersede fill lights: users still include them into their globally illuminated lighting setups. We believe that our results will find use in the development of lighting design tools for non-expert users...|$|R
2500|$|Garza {{was trained}} by his {{grandfather}} Mario Segura {{as well as}} El Hijo del Gladiador prior to his lucha libre debut on November 8, 2008, using the ring name El Hijo del Ninja ("The Son of the Ninja"), an enmascarado, or masked wrestling character. Initially he worked for Federacion Internacional de Lucha Libre (FILL) as they promoted shows in his native Monterrey, Nuevo León. On August 25, 2009 El Hijo del Ninja won the 2009 Copa Arena Coliseo Monterrey defeating Pee-Wee, Kaientai, Angel Dorada Jr. and Hombre Sin Miedo in succession to win the cup. He followed up his tournament victory by winning the <b>FILL</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship that same year. He would win his first Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", on September 30, 2009 when he defeated Black Morse, forcing him to unmask {{as a result of}} the stipulation. A Lucha de Apuestas win is generally considered a bigger achievement than a championship victory and is an indicator of a promotional [...] "push". He would close out the year in another Lucha de Apuestas match, this time a Relevos Suicida where he teamed up with Silver Star to face the team of Memo Valles and Coco Viper. Since both El Hijo del Ninja and Memo Valles were pinned in the match the two were forced to wrestle each other risking El Hijo del Ninja's mask and Memo Valles hair. With the victory El Hijo del Ninja forced Memo Valles to have all his hair shaved off. In 2010 he won another Lucha de Apuestas, forcing Estrella Dorada Jr. to have all his hair shaved off. In 2011 El Hijo del Ninja won the FILL Rey del Aire ("King of the Air") tournament.|$|E

50|$|Skypans are {{available}} in different densities. Skypans of around 5,000 Watts can provide soft <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> for backdrops and cycloramas (cycs) in television, film and still photography. Skypans of around 10,000 Watts provide soft and even <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> for large backdrops and cycs, while ones rated up to 20,000 Watts would be more suitable for extremely large cycs. Softer <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> can be provided by adding diffusers.

50|$|Using just a {{key light}} {{results in a}} high-contrast scene, {{especially}} if the background is not illuminated. A <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> decreases contrast and adds more details to the dark areas of an image.

5000|$|Low-key {{lighting}} is {{a style of}} lighting for photography, film or television. It is a necessary element in creating a chiaroscuro effect. Traditional photographic lighting, three-point lighting uses a key light, a <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> and a back light for illumination. Low-key lighting often uses only one key light, optionally controlled with a <b>fill</b> <b>light</b> or a simple reflector.|$|E
