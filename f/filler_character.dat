500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} <b>filler</b> <b>character</b> for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so we asked) how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E

5000|$|Of the Ten, Sarutobi Sasuke and Kirigakure Saizō are {{the only}} two that appear {{frequently}} in popular depiction. Outside of works that specifically deal with the Ten Braves, appearance of all ten members is relatively rare, and even then some members are frequently more-or-less generic <b>filler</b> <b>characters.</b>|$|R

500|$|Abbey and Kona, both three-year-old German Shepherd dogs, played Neville's dog Sam. The {{rest of the}} {{supporting}} cast consists of Salli Richardson as Zoe, Robert's wife, and Alice Braga as a survivor named Anna. Willow Smith, Will Smith's daughter, makes her film debut as Marley, Neville's daughter. Emma Thompson has an uncredited role as Dr. Alice Krippin, who appears on television explaining her vaccine for cancer that mutates into the virus. Singer Mike Patton provided the guttural screams of the infected [...] "hemocytes", and Dash Mihok provided the character animation for the infected [...] "alpha male". Several <b>filler</b> <b>characters</b> with uncredited roles were in old news broadcasts and flashbacks, such as the unnamed President's voice (Pat Fraley), and the cast of The Today Show.|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of damage development in elastomeric nanocomposites is of another <b>character.</b> <b>Filler</b> particles promote the appearance and formation of nanostrands in the matrix, which prevent the “germination” of the macroscopic crack. This circumstance {{can serve as}} one of the most plausible explanations of the well-known experimental fact that the strength and ultimate deformation of elastomeric composites can be substantially higher than that of a pure matrix.|$|R
50|$|David {{started as}} a rather cocky typical heel wrestling {{character}} with a phenomenal body but is rather short in stature. Within short time he grew to being an overly flamboyant character {{with a touch of}} being that personal trainer you would never want to hire due to his ridiculously mean comments directed towards the crowd and their physique issues. Flex was mainly used as a <b>filler</b> heel <b>character</b> but got over with the crowd by his outlandish antics and because he included the crowd into the show by having them do certain exercises and then yelling at them to sit back down in their chair and that they will never look like him.|$|R
40|$|Time {{dependance}} {{of electrical}} resistance of polyisoprene-nanostructured carbon composites has been {{examined in the}} work. Experimental {{work has been done}} to investigate tensoresistive effect of composite. Electrical resistivity and stress as function of time for such composites has been shown in the picture. High structure carbon black and multi-wall carbon nanotubes were used as <b>filler.</b> Finally the <b>character</b> of mechano-electrical relaxation for these composites was compared and conclusions were made...|$|R

50|$|It's {{about an}} {{employment}} agency for out-of-work cartoon characters. Some of the comics characters include: Bixby, the former child star {{and now a}} dirty rat; Fritz, a dog and boss of the agency; Hamhock, a pig {{who is trying to}} get his 15 minutes of fame; Captain Victorious, a lazy super hero with too many sidekicks; Ralston, a rabbit who is just looking for a higher group of people, and Tyr, the Norse god of single combat, trying to pull his decent weight around anger management and Valhallan Attitude. There is also Dynaman, the rival of Captain Victorious; Mr. Negato, the enemy of Captain Victorious, and Scrappy Lad, the useless weak sidekick who is more interested in a girl named Moxie Gumption (a more streetwise version of Little Orphan Annie). Jenn Erica is a female <b>filler</b> <b>character</b> who tries repeatedly to get a lead character. Hela is the Norse goddess of the Underworld, with a surprisingly cheerful disposition. She claims to be related to Tyr, but their kinship is rather tenuous. Ms. Amazement gives the impression of being a parody of Wonder Woman, but her background is Celtic rather than Greek.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} use {{sepiolite}} nanofibers as cis-polybutadiene rubber <b>fillers,</b> the hydrophilic <b>character</b> of sepiolite nanofibers should be modified by grafting organic group and controlling {{surface free energy}} for improving compatibility of sepiolite nanofibers in rubber matrix. The relationship between {{the performance of the}} cis-polybutadiene rubber filled with sepiolite and the coupling modification was investigated, and the influence of coupling agent γ-(2, 3 -epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane dosage on mechanical properties of cis-polybutadiene rubber materials was also studied. The results showed that the mechanical properties could be improved obviously after reinforcement by modified sepiolite nanofibers. The optimum dosage of coupling agent γ-(2, 3 -epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane was 7 %, and the tensile strength and tearing strength increased by 108. 3 % and 74. 1 %, respectively. On this basis, the reinforcement mechanism of the composite rubber materials was also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} word {{spotting}} system in text lines for offline Indic scripts such as Bangla (Bengali) and Devanagari. Recently, it was shown that zone-wise recognition method improves the word recognition performance than conventional full word recognition system in Indic scripts. Inspired with this idea we consider the zone segmentation approach and use middle zone information to improve the traditional word spotting performance. To avoid the problem of zone segmentation using heuristic approach, we propose here an HMM based approach to segment {{the upper and lower}} zone components from the text line images. The candidate keywords are searched from a line without segmenting characters or words. Also, we propose a novel feature combining foreground and background information of text line images for keyword-spotting by <b>character</b> <b>filler</b> models. A significant improvement in performance is noted by using both foreground and background information than their individual one. Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG) feature has been used in our word spotting framework. From the experiment, it has been noted that the proposed zone-segmentation based system outperforms traditional approaches of word spotting. Comment: Preprint Submitte...|$|R
40|$|Light weight {{refractory}} materials were developed applying the aerated concrete technology. Kaolinite based suspensions were agitated with Alpowders or Al pastes. Under release of hydrogen gas, foams were formed at pH values from 7 to 9, stabilised, dried and fired at temperatures up to 16000 C. Loading fractions of alumina up to 80 vol. % were demonstrated. The porosity {{varies with the}} amount of the metal precursor Al. A macro porosity of 0. 2 – 1 mm was formed which was characterised by image analysis and X-ray tomography. The working temperature of the produced {{refractory materials}} depends on the prefiring temperature, the <b>filler</b> <b>character</b> and content and the macroscopic structure. Silica free pure porous mullite or mullite-corundum ceramics were obtained. Thermal analysis shows that the porous refractories meet the ASTM requirements for application temperatures up to 15500 C...|$|E
