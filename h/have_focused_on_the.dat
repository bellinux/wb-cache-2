5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological {{explanation for the}} G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E

The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{life has}} also been used {{in a wide variety}} of other media. The {{director}} David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possible sexual {{relationship between the two}} men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E

5|$|Interest in copernicium's {{chemistry}} was {{sparked by}} predictions {{that it would}} have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period7 and group12, and indeed among all 118 known elements. Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration 5f146d107s2 and thus should belong to group12 of the periodic table, according to the Aufbau principle. As such, it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold. Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adsorption of atoms of element112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures, in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy. Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons, copernicium shows radon-like properties. Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes, allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1966, Dalek creator Terry Nation {{pitched a}} {{spin-off}} series The Daleks to the BBC, writing a 30-minute teleplay entitled The Destroyers {{as a possible}} pilot episode for an American co-production.

Lead characters included agents Captain Jack Corey, David Kingdom, his sister Sara Kingdom, and an android named Mark Seven. On 22 November 1966, the BBC informed Nation that {{they were no longer}} interested in the project. It was later adapted by Nicholas Briggs & John Dorney for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca and the later Coipasa lake phase {{is associated with}} the Central Andean Pluvial Event, which occurred from 18,000–14,000 to 13,800–9,700 BP. During this epoch, major environmental changes occurred in the Atacama as precipitation increased between 18° and 25° degrees south. In some areas, oases formed in the desert and human settlement began. During the Coipasa lake cycle, precipitation may <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern Altiplano and been transported there from the Chaco; the main Tauca cycle may have been accompanied by precipitation from the northeast. A glacial advance in the Turbio valley (a feeder of the Elqui River) between 17,000 and 12,000 years ago has been attributed to the Central Andean Pluvial Event. Other indicators point to dry conditions in central Chile during the highstand of Lake Tauca.|$|E

5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer that allows a hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s French sociologists, {{particularly}} {{those interested in}} critical theory, re-examined this historical legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on {{the operation of the}} police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes. Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent. This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille. The Bibliothèque nationale de France held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most studies <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mating-type region in fission yeast, {{which may not be}} representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local methylated histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
