5|$|Damage to the abducens nerve (VI) {{can also}} result in diplopia. This {{is due to}} {{impairment}} in the lateral rectus muscle, which is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the abducens nerve.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus {{and the inner}} ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the facial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} occurs {{later in}} life, from middle age onwards, most often after age 60, {{and is a}} condition typically associated with very strong pain distributed over the area <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the maxillary or mandibular nerve divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V2 and V3).|$|E
50|$|The {{adductor}} brevis is <b>innervated</b> dually <b>by</b> {{the anterior}} and posterior {{branches of the}} obturator nerve.|$|R
50|$|The elbow is <b>innervated</b> {{anteriorly}} <b>by</b> branches {{from the}} musculocutaneous, median, and radial nerve, and posteriorly from the ulnar nerve and {{the branch of}} the radial nerve to anconeus.|$|R
50|$|In {{the cave}} cricket Troglophilus neglectus the subgenual organ is fairly simple and is {{associated}} with an intermediary organ. Both are <b>innervated</b> either <b>by</b> one or two nerves, depending on the individual animal.|$|R
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to {{innervate}} a specific part of the body. The area of skin <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) {{can also cause}} {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The result will be an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} {{used to treat}} disorders, such as chronic hypertension, of the peripheral nervous system, which is <b>innervated</b> only <b>by</b> the sympathetic nervous system. The non-specificity of this treatment led to discontinuing its use.|$|R
50|$|The {{pharyngeal}} plexus, with fibers from CN IX, CN X, and cranial part of CN XI, innervates all {{the muscles}} of the pharynx (except stylopharyngeus, which is <b>innervated</b> directly <b>by</b> a branch of CN IX).|$|R
5000|$|Vascular {{smooth muscle}} is <b>innervated</b> {{primarily}} <b>by</b> the {{sympathetic nervous system}} through adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors). Three types of adrenoceptors are present within vascular smooth muscle cells: , [...] and [...] The main endogenous agonist of these cell receptors is norepinephrine (NE).|$|R
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac plexus, and branches to the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> this nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
30|$|The {{favorable}} results {{observed in}} our study [17] in terms of pelvic pain recurrence {{may be explained by}} the almost complete resection of deep nodular endometriosis, which is <b>innervated</b> abundantly <b>by</b> sensory C chlorogenic and adrenergic nerve fibers, as recently demonstrated by Wang [50].|$|R
40|$|Hemichorea/ballism {{is a rare}} {{neurological}} disorder but the crucial involvement of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in its pathophysiology is appreciated since decades. The idiopathic Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder but the key role of the STN in the pathophysiological origin of the parkinsonian state became only recently evident. The STN was believed to exert an inhibitory, probably – GABA-mediated, effect on its projection nuclei, and this belief {{is one of the}} major reasons to overlook the involvement of the STN in the parkinsonian pathophysiology. It is now firmly established that the STN projection neurons are glutamatergic, excitatory, and heavily <b>innervate</b> <b>by</b> widely branching axons of the substantia nigra (SN), the internal pallidal segment (GPI), followed by the external pallidal segment (GPE) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) ...|$|R

5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no eardrum and no earhole, and the middle ear cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly adipose (fatty) tissue. The stapes comes {{into contact with the}} quadrate (which is immovable), as well as the hyoid and squamosal. The hair cells are unspecialized, <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E

40|$|THE {{majority}} of the muscles in the chelipeds and walking legs of all crustaceans which have been investigated are <b>innervated</b> either <b>by</b> two or by three axons.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used mandibular anesthesia techniques is the Spix technique, which is very useful in clinical practice, but is risky when the patient is a bearer of blood dyscrasias. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} present an alternative to the Spix technique in order to achieve troncular anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve. To this purpose, an infiltrative technique was designed to anesthetize the inferior alveolar nerve via the retromolar triangle. Study Design: This study included 40 patients with an average age of 23. 65 years, 22 males and 18 females, who were previously evaluated with a vitalometer control, then subjected to the designed anesthetic technique. The effectiveness of the technique used to anesthetize the inferior alveolar nerve was evaluated by the results of tests using a vitalometer applied to a molar and a premolar on the anesthetized side after 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Moreover, the anesthesia was evaluated in mucosa <b>innervated</b> regions <b>by</b> the inferior alveolar, lingual and buccal nerves, and by having the patient relate the duration of the induced feeling of numbness. Results: The technique proved to be effective in 72. 5 % of the cases, with a latency of 10 minutes and an average duration of the anesthetic effect for 141. 125 minutes. Moreover, anesthesia was obtained in the mucosa <b>innervated</b> regions <b>by</b> the inferior alveolar nerve in 72. 5 % of the cases, by the buccal nerve in 27. 5 % and in the <b>innervated</b> areas <b>by</b> the lingual nerve in 55 % of the cases. Conclusions: The proposed technique, even when it proved to be less effective than the Spix technique, can be seen as a lower risk alternative for patients carrying blood dyscrasias and being subjected to dental procedures in mandibular teeth...|$|R
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the {{vagus nerve}} and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
40|$|The muscular coat of {{the body}} of the rat bladder is <b>innervated</b> almost {{exclusively}} <b>by</b> cholinergic endings:adrenergic endings are rare. In the inner longitudinal muscle layer of the proximal urethra, 53 % of 310 autonomic nerve endings observed in close relation to the smooth muscle cells were adrenergic and the remaining 47 % cholinergic. The middle circular muscle layer of the proximal urethra was <b>innervated</b> predominantly <b>by</b> adrenergic endings: in this layer 86 % of the total of 335 endings examined wre regarded as adrenergic. A similar predominantly adrenergic innervation was noted in the outer longitudinal layer of the proximal urethra. A number of striated muscle fibres arose from the outermost striated muscle layer of the proximal urethra and intruded deeply into the outer and middle smooth muscle layers. These intruding striated muscle fibres also received direct autonomic (mostly adrenergic) innervation. The significance of these findings in relation to the physiology of the lower urinary tracts is discussed...|$|R
30|$|Variants of the {{innervation}} of the SSC muscle {{are common}} [7]. Classically, the two superior thirds and the inferior {{third of the}} SSC muscle are <b>innervated,</b> respectively, <b>by</b> {{the upper and lower}} subscapularis nerves, which are both branches of the posterior chord of the brachial plexus (Fig.  1). Electromyographic (EMG) studies have shown differences in activity between the upper and lower portion of the SSC muscle, suggesting that they work as two different muscular units during voluntary shoulder movements [8].|$|R
5000|$|For vertebrates, {{however, the}} {{response}} of a muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter can only be excitatory, in other words, contractile. Muscle relaxation and inhibition of muscle contraction in vertebrates is obtained only by inhibition of the motor neuron itself. Muscle innervation may eventually {{play a role in}} the maturation of motor activity. This is how muscle relaxants work by acting on the motor neurons that <b>innervate</b> muscles (<b>by</b> decreasing their electrophysiological activity) or on cholinergic neuromuscular junctions, rather than on the muscles themselves.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{composite}} muscle as the short head of the biceps femoris develops in the flexor compartment of the thigh and is thus <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> common fibular branch of the sciatic nerve (L5, S2), while the long head is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (L5, S2).|$|E
25|$|The deltoid {{muscle is}} usually <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> {{the fifth and}} sixth {{cervical}} nerve roots and is therefore often functional in patients with tetraplegia, though the triceps muscle, which is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the seventh cervical root, is paralysed. Because of the location {{at the back of}} the arm, the posterior part of the deltoid muscle can give strength in the same direction as the triceps muscle and is therefore theoretically a good donor to regain elbow extension.|$|E
25|$|The flexor pollicis brevis (FPB) has two heads. The {{superficial}} head arises on the flexor retinaculum, {{while the}} deep head originates on three carpal bones: the trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. The muscle is inserted onto the radial sesamoid bone of the metacarpophalangeal joint. It acts to flex, adduct, and abduct the thumb, {{and is therefore}} also able to oppose the thumb. The superficial head is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the median nerve, while the deep head is <b>innervated</b> <b>by</b> the ulnar nerve (C8-T1).|$|E
25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules encase bundles of nerve fibers <b>innervated</b> beneath <b>by</b> branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes {{as small as a}} single drop. This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|R
50|$|Axons {{from the}} lateral grey column release {{acetylcholine}} at their synapses. This can excite or inhibit the postsynaptic cell, {{depending on the}} type of acetylcholine receptor in its membrane. Postganglionic cells (that is, nerve cells <b>innervated</b> in ganglia <b>by</b> lateral column neurons) typically release norepinephrine (noradrenaline) on their targets; these synapses can also be either excitatory or inhibitory.|$|R
40|$|Sensory or motor “baby-sitting ” {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a clinical strategy to preserve muscle integrity if motion-specific axons must regenerate over a long distance to reach denervated target muscles.

After motion specific motor axons have reached the target, the baby-sitter nerve is severed and motion-specific axons are directed to the target. Although this strategy minimizes denervation time, the requisite second episode of denervation and reinnervation might be deleterious to muscle contrac-tile function.
