40|$|Experiments on the {{response}} of blood pressure (BP) to speech were critically reviewed.

40|$|Multiple {{components}} of vascular alpha adrenergic responsiveness were investigated in twenty-four men with mild hypertension and eighteen age- and weight-matched normotensive controls. Arterial plasma norepinephrine (paNE), {{an index of}} sympathetic drive, was increased in <b>hypertensives</b> compared to normotensives (mean +/- SE), 199 +/- 24 vs. 134 +/- 11 pg/ml, P less than 0. 02. The effective concentration of intra-arterial (iaNE) increasing forearm vascular resistance (FAVR) 30 % (NE-EC 30, an index of vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity) was similar in normotensives and <b>hypertensives,</b> 9 +/- 1 vs. 13 +/- 3 ng/ 100 ml per min, respectively, P greater than 0. 3. The phentolamine induced reduction in FAVR, an index of vascular alpha-tone, was greater in <b>hypertensives,</b> - 21. 3 +/- 1. 8 vs. normotensives, - 14. 9 +/- 1. 2 U, P less than 0. 02. We interpret these data as evidence for normal vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity to norepinephrine in mild <b>hypertensives.</b> Consequently, the increased sympathetic drive in mild <b>hypertensives</b> explains the elevated vascular alpha-tone. Although vascular alpha-receptor sensitivity to iaNE was normal, the FAVR responses at high doses (reactivity) were greater in <b>hypertensives</b> to regional infusion of both NE and angiotensin II. This "nonspecific" enhancement of vascular reactivity is probably explained by structural vascular changes in <b>hypertensives...</b>|$|R

40|$|The baroreflex {{response}} {{to changes in}} transmural pressure throughout the arterial tree or limited to the carotid sinus was evaluated in ten borderline <b>hypertensives</b> and compared with that observed in ten normal subjects and in ten established <b>hypertensives.</b> Baroreceptor sensitivity was tested by evaluating both heart rate {{response to}} phenylephrine-induced increase in arterial pressure and heart rate and blood pressure changes induced by increased neck tissue pressure {{by means of a}} neck chamber.

As a result of this, the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and efficacy of sublingual nifedipine for <b>hypertensive</b> emergencies in 1995, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor efficacious.

We assessed by B-mode ultrasound the mean intima-media thickness (mean-IMT) and maximum-IMT (M-MAX) of carotid artery (common, bulb, internal) bilaterally. Endothelial function was evaluated by post-occlusion flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Along with traditional risk factors, we studied the impact of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Forty normotensive subjects served as controls. In the <b>hypertensives,</b> the BP levels were well controlled (office BP: 129 / 79 [*]mm[*]Hg, ambulatory BP monitoring: 121 / 75 [*]mm[*]Hg). Compared with controls, higher BP levels and body mass index were present in <b>hypertensives,</b> whereas age and metabolic parameters were similar. In <b>hypertensives,</b> the IMT (mean-IMT 0. 68 [*]mm, M-MAX 0. 81 [*]mm) {{was significantly higher than}} in controls (mean-IMT 0. 60 [*]mm, M-MAX 0. 71 [*]mm).

In multivariate analyses, it turned out that in <b>hypertensives</b> IMT parameters were related to age, hs-CRP and OPG. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was the only factor related to FMD. IMT and FMD had no relationship with BP levels. In conclusion, in <b>hypertensives</b> with well-controlled BP, the pro-atherogenic remodelling (IMT) is mainly dependent on age and the inflammatory cytokines, OPG in particular.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High blood {{pressure}} contributes to organ damage. However, {{during the past}} two decades there have been great advances in the medical treatment of hypertension. Technical progress has also made it easier to visualize organ damage. Hence we found it of interest to examine heart, brain and retina in a group of middle-aged treated <b>hypertensives,</b> comparing the results with those from a group of middle-aged normotensives. METHODS: The subjects were 40 (20 men) treated <b>hypertensives</b> and 40 (20 men) normotensives, who had previously taken part in a study in which ambulatory {{blood pressure}} monitoring had been performed. The heart was examined by echocardiography, the retina by photography and the brain by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Office blood pressure and 24 -h systolic/diastolic blood pressure (S/D) were 141 / 86 (13 / 7) mmHg and 128 / 81 (11 / 6) mmHg in the <b>hypertensives</b> and 125 / 78 (10 / 8) mmHg and 118 / 74 (8 / 5) mmHg in the normotensives, respectively. Left ventricular mass was 101 (27) g/m 2 in the <b>hypertensives</b> and 85 (18) g/m 2 in the normotensives (p = 0. 0025). The corresponding figures for the left atrium were 21. 1 (3. 1) mm/m 2 in the <b>hypertensives</b> and 19. 5 (2. 2) mm/m 2 in the normotensives (p < 0. 001). E/A wave quotient was 1. 09 (0. 26) in the <b>hypertensives</b> and 1. 26 (0. 26) in the normotensives (p = 0. 0045), while left ventricular systolic function did not differ between the groups. Ten <b>hypertensives</b> and one normotensive subject had left ventricular mass above normal range. Narrow retinal arteries were found in 22 <b>hypertensives</b> and 8 normotensives (p < 0. 001). Brain magnetic resonance changes (deep white matter and/or periventricular) were found in 19 <b>hypertensives</b> and 9 normotensives (p = 0. 0431). CONCLUSIONS: The <b>hypertensives</b> differed significantly from the normotensives concerning left ventricular mass, left atrium, left ventricular diastolic function and retinal vessel changes.

METHODS: We investigated the role of ADMA and antioxidants in endothelial dysfunction during methionine-induced homocysteinemia in <b>hypertensives.</b> Thirty-nine <b>hypertensives</b> and forty-nine normotensive controls underwent methionine loading (100 mg methionine/kg BW), after being randomized to receive vitamin C (2 g) and E (800 IU) or placebo. Endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) was evaluated by plethysmography (baseline and 4 -h post-methionine loading (4 -h PML)). RESULTS: <b>Hypertensives</b> had higher homocysteine at baseline (P < 0. 001) and 4 -h PML (P < 0. 05), whereas methionine increased homocysteine in all groups. EDD was decreased in both vitamins and placebo groups in controls (P < 0. 01 for both) and vitamins- and placebo-treated <b>hypertensives</b> (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01, respectively). In controls, ADMA was increased in both vitamin- and placebo groups (P < 0. 01 for both) at 4 -h PML. <b>Hypertensives</b> had higher ADMA at baseline (P < 0. 01 vs. normotensive) and remained unchanged at 4 -h PML (P = NS in placebo and vitamins treated).
