40|$|National {{highways}} in Okinawa prefecture {{were under}} {{control of the}} U. S. Army before the reversion of Okinawa to Japan. However, the materials of the highways were not transfered properly, which yielded the difficulties in evaluating the bridges referring to the present specification. Recently significant deterioration of reinforced concrete bridges has been observed {{and the necessity of}} the evaluation becomes urgent. This research intends to investigate structural <b>and</b> <b>meterial</b> problems involved in the deteriorated reinforced concrete bridges, where four bridges; Igei, Yaka, Kaneku and Ichinichi, were taken as consideration. Static and Dynamic tests were conducted and the results are compared with the theoretical ones calculated by the methods of Guyon-Massonnet and Homberg. This paper investigates mainly the static behaviors where the emphasis is placed on the load capacity of the bridges. Also, the impact coefficients are obtained from the tests, with which problems in dynamic behaviors are investigated...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} clinical and radiographic success of endodontic treatment of infected primary teeth using combination of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, <b>and</b> minocycline. <b>Meterials</b> <b>and</b> Methods: The treatment was performed on selected 60 teeth, which were randomly divided into two groups, viz. Group A and B with 30 teeth in each group. In Group A, only the necrotic coronal pulp was removed, whereas in Group B both necrotic coronal as well as all accessible radicular pulp tissue was extirpated. The orifice of the canal was enlarged in both the groups and was termed as "Medication cavity. " The medication cavity was half-filled with antibacterial mix, sealed with glass-ionomer cement and reinforced with composite resin. Resolution of clinical signs and symptoms was evaluated within a month after the treatment. At every subsequent visit, clinical and radiographic evaluation was done once in 6 months for a period of one year. Results: Both the groups showed considerable clinical and radiographic success, but Group B showed greater clinical and radiographic success than Group A...|$|R

We show that the appearance of Floquet Majorana fermions can be finely controlled in the expanded parameter space of the drive frequency, amplitude, and phase difference across the two dots. While these Majorana fermions are not topologically protected, the highly tunable setup provides a realistic system for observing the exotic physics associated with Majorana fermions {{as well as their}} dynamical generation and manipulation.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine whether the effects of bicycle exercise program applied without energy-restricted diet on body composition and aerobic capacity show any difference in men <b>and</b> women. <b>Meterials</b> <b>and</b> Methods: A total of 35 volunteers (10 + 9 men; 8 + 8 women, for the training and control groups, respectively) were enrolled in this study. The subjects had not participated in any regular exercise programs within the previous year, but all of them were moderately active. Also, the dietary restrictions and/or controls were not recommended for all subjects during the study period. The individuals in the training group performed cycling exercise 60 min/day, 4 days/week for 8 weeks at an intensity of 50 - 70 % of target heart rate. The subjects in the control group did not participate in any kind of regular or organized sport activity. Body composition parameters and maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) were measured pre- and post-training. Results: The training program significantly increased VO 2 max values in both men (F= 22. 99) and women (F= 37. 93) (p 0. 05). The body fat mass increased in both training men and women, but this increase was statistically significant in men (p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Regular aerobic exercise without energy-restricted diet significantly increased VO 2 max values in both men and women. In spite of this increase, it can be said that training program alone may be inadequate for both genders to make positive changes in body composition...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} (OSMF) is {{a chronic}} {{condition of the}} oral cavity which results in permanent disability. The pathogenesis is poorly understood and the disease is difficult to treat. OSMF is associated with immunological changes (altered levels of serum immunoglobulins) {{and the effect of}} treatment (especially antioxidants and levamisole) on serum immunoglobulins (Ig) is not known. This study was carried out to evaluate the clinical effects of levamisole (VERMISOL), and antioxidants (ANTOXID) and its effect on serum immunoglobulins IgG, IgA <b>and</b> IgM. <b>Meterials</b> <b>and</b> Methods: Forty-five study subjects were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups. There were 15 patients in each group; group I patients received levamisole, 50 mg three times daily for three alternate weeks, group II patients received 2 capsules of antoxid daily for six weeks, group III patients received levamisole and antoxid. The results were analyzed with paired ′t′ test and unpaired ′t′ test. Results: The results indicated that levamisole, antoxid and the combination of levamisole and antoxid showed significant improvement in mouth opening and reduction in burning sensation. Significant reduction of serum IgG, IgA and IgM was seen in the levamisole group and combination group whereas in the antoxid group significant reduction was observed only in serum IgA and IgM. Interpretation and Conclusion: Levamisole can bring about clinical improvement and is better than antoxid and the combination regimen. The addition of antoxid to the treatment regimen {{does not seem to have}} an added advantage over levamisole alone...|$|R
