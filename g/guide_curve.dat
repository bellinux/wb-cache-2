The MITACS team, headed by computer science associate professor Karan Singh of the University of Toronto, created a mathematical formula known as a cord, {{which is used to}} represent the physical characteristics of animated curves. The cord was based on a cubic function with uniform parametrization. This cord enables rope-like objects, such as hair, string, or wire, to [...] "behave intuitively" [...] when rendered in animation, preserving [...] "length, elasticity and stiffness". Implemented using Maya, cords could be generated by defining a <b>guide</b> <b>curve,</b> a parametric curve in space, which the software would then follow to create an analytic, continuous shape wrapping around scene geometry. Singh was the software research and development director for the film. The MITACS team also executed all technical scripting and programming for the animation.|$|E

Raleigh is proposing {{the development of}} a new reservoir to meet midterm needs; however, the reservoir is a costly project with relatively short-term returns and is an environmentally sub-optimal solution. This report proposes four unique adaptive management options to Raleigh’s existing reservoir, Falls Lake, as alternatives to a new reservoir: Permanent flood control pool reallocation, dynamic reservoir management, permanent sedimentation pool reallocation and <b>guide</b> <b>curve</b> flexibility. Considering system risk, costs, ability to generate additional water supply and environmental impacts, we recommend the combination of sedimentation pool reallocation and a flexible <b>guide</b> <b>curve</b> be explored to increase the city’s water supply allocation from Falls Lake.

To achieve highest quality parts, generated trajectories not only describe the desired toolpath accurately, but also have smooth dynamics profiles. This paper presents a novel parametric interpolator based on <b>guide</b> <b>curve.</b> The relationships between geometric properties and kinematic properties are firstly discussed. Then, with a consideration of the important effect of the curvature of curvilinear path on the machining dynamics, a corresponding formula, which describes the relation of the maximum allowed feed acceleration/deceleration and the maximum allowed rate of change of curvature radius of paths, is built. Thus, based on a near arc parameterization and through modifying the curvature radius curve to deal with corners, key regions and other cases, adaptive feedrate schedule is completed according to the reconstructed smooth curvature radius curve. Consequently, confined chord errors, corners on the path and the acceleration/deceleration capabilities of the machine tool are simultaneously considered and incorporated into the <b>guide</b> <b>curve</b> based parametric interpolation system without using look-ahead scheme.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} addresses the representation, construction and interactive control of 3 D curves for various applications. Interactively controlling curves with empirical physical attributes of stiffness and elasticity that bend and wrap around 3 D scene geometry is a common and challenging problem. In this paper we address this problem with a novel 3 D curve called a cord. A cord is created and subsequently controlled in real-time by defining a secondary curve called the <b>guide</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>curve</b> represents the general 3 D path that the user wishes the cord to follow while bending and wrapping around scene geometry. Cords have attributes of length, stiffness, and elasticity {{that allow them to}} empirically capture a range of behavior from wire to string to rubber bands. Cords that make contact with geometry have a representation in the 2 D parameter space of scene objects and can be used not only as geometry for modeling and animation but as 2 D parametric strokes for rendering. We present techniques for the creation and interactive control of cords and show examples illustrating their creative use within the animation system Maya. ...|$|E
40|$|Development of any {{internal}} combustion engine is driven primarily by fuel efficiency and emission requirements. This requires refinement of the in-cylinder flow, mixture formation and combustion processes. Design optimization of the intake/exhaust port, valves and piston bowl is essential to realize the above mentioned requirements.

30|$|It may {{be noted}} that {{quantity}} based relaiability for all the cases was higher than time reliability for obvious reasons. It may also {{be noted that}} allocated demand meeting priority led to higher in-stream-flow reliability compared to M& I reliability. Further, it may be noted that integrated operation led to the marginal variation (1 to 5  %—not shown) of the performances of Tilayia,Konar and Tenughat reservoirs for all policies in spite of keeping them outside the purview of any modification. An inter seasonal comparison of reservoir performance (Fig.  4 a–f; Table  4) reveals the performance to be better for season 1 (not shown) and season 3 compared to that for season 2 and season 4 (with performance in season 4 to be worse than that in season 2) for all operation policies. This may be attributed to sufficient inflow received by the reservoir system in season 1 (which spans over monsoon when 85 – 90  % of annual flow is received by the system) and to full/nearly full conservation storage available on first day of season 3 (as realized by <b>Guide</b> <b>Curve</b> limited operation). Again, <b>Guide</b> <b>curve</b> limited operation in season 2 and lack of inflow as well as almost exhausted storage in season 4 (which coincides with summer and end of water year) led to poor performance in respective seasons.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{efficiently}} deliver respiratory-gated radiation during synchrotron-based pulsed heavy-ion radiotherapy, a novel respiratory guidance method combining {{a personalized}} audio-visual biofeedback (BFB) system, breath hold (BH), and synchrotron-based gating {{was designed to}} help patients synchronize their respiratory patterns with synchrotron pulses and to overcome typical limitations such as low efficiency, residual motion, and discomfort. Methods: In-house software was developed to acquire body surface marker positions and display BFB, gating signals, and real-time beam profiles on a LED screen. Patients were prompted to perform short BHs or short deep breath holds (SDBH) {{with the aid of}} BFB following a personalized standard BH/SDBH (stBH/stSDBH) <b>guiding</b> <b>curve</b> or their own representative BH/SDBH (reBH/reSDBH) <b>guiding</b> <b>curve.</b> A practical simulation was performed for a group of 15 volunteers to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. Effective dose rates (EDRs), mean absolute errors between the <b>guiding</b> <b>curves</b> and the measured curves, and mean absolute deviations of the measured curves were obtained within 10 %- 50 % duty cycles (DCs) that were synchronized with the synchrotron's flat-top phase. Results: All maneuvers for an individual volunteer took approximately half an hour, and no one experienced discomfort during the maneuvers. Using the respiratory guidance methods, the magnitude of residual motion was almost ten times less than during nongated irradiation, and increases in the average effective dose rate by factors of 2. 39 - 4. 65, 2. 39 - 4. 59, 1. 73 - 3. 50, and 1. 73 - 3. 55 for the stBH, reBH, stSDBH, and reSDBH guiding maneuvers, respectively, were observed in contrast with conventional free breathing-based gated irradiation, depending on the respiratory-gated duty cycle settings. Conclusions: The proposed respiratory guidance method with personalized BFB was confirmed to be feasible in a group of volunteers. Increased effective dose rate and improved overall treatment precision were observed compared to conventional free breathing-based, respiratory-gated irradiation. Because breathing guidance curves could be established based on the respective average respiratory period and amplitude for each patient, it may be easier for patients to cooperate using this technique.

40|$|The {{unsteady}} and three-dimensional {{nature of}} the flow past axial compressor blading poses substantial challenges {{to the design of}} the main flow passage. High aspect ratio blading is amenable to the approach of splitting the design task between the cascade and the meridional planes. However, the three-dimensional flows increasingly affect the st age aerodynamic performance with decreasing blade aspect ratios. At very high load conditions, corner vortices can grow to two-thirds of the blade span, {{under the influence of the}} pitchwise pressure gradient, causing significant blockage and loss. A survey of treatments for three - dimensional flows highlights a variety of approaches, including longitudinal and tangential slots for suction and blowing, fences, turning vanes, fillets, and grooves. The merits and issues exposed by past implementations of these end-wall treatments are summarized. Considered together, these arrangements display a variable and open approach, which points towards an opportunity for considering a more common framework, led by a greater understanding of the flow physics.

A boundary curve of the machined surface is subdivided into curve segments.

Forest sites were classified using direct and indirect (site index) and remote sensing (Landsat 7 ETM and Quickbird satellite image) methods. In the direct method, forest site classifications were assigned according to edafic (soil properties), climate (precipitation and temperature) and topographic (altitude, slope, aspect and landform) factors. Five different forest site classes (dry, moderate fresh, fresh, moist and highly moist) were determined. In the indirect method, the <b>guiding</b> <b>curve</b> was used to generate anamorphic site index (SI) equations resulting in three classes; good (SI=I-II), medium (SI=III) and poor (SI=IV-V). Forest sites were also determined with a remote sensing method (RSM) using supervised classification of Landsat 7 ETM and Quickbird satellite images with a 0. 67 kappa statistic value and 73. 3 % accuracy assessments; 0. 88 kappa statistic value and 90. 7 % accuracy assessments, respectively. Forest sites polygon themes obtained from the three methods were overlaid and areas in the same classes were computed with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results indicated that direct and SI methods were consistent as a 3 % dry site (19. 0 ha...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce cylindrical cams. According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a cylindrical cam, the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the <b>guiding</b> <b>curve</b> cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|HPLC-DAD systems {{generate}} time intensity (absorbance) matrices called spectrochromatograms. Under good experimental conditions, spectro-chromatograms of elution {{peaks of}} pure analytes are bilinear products {{of a time}} peak and an absorbance spectrum. Co-eluting impurities create deviations from this pure bilinear structure. Unfortunately, other imperfections, such as scan averaging, large optical windows, imperfect lamp alignment, mobile phase fluctuations, etc. also create departures from the pure bilinear structure. This {{makes it hard to}} distinguish low concentration impurities from artifacts and hampers safe detection of contaminants. There are two main ways to deal with such artifacts: removal and simulation, and ImpuR provides R functions to do both and to integrate both approaches. More specifically, ImpuR provides a set of tools to explore time-intensity matrices with respect to their bilinear structure and departures from it. It includes exploratory graphs for bilinear matrices (bilinear residual graphs and singular value decompositions), spectral dissimilarity curves via window-evolving factor analysis with heteroscedasticity correction and the sine method, methods for removal of artifacts, and a comprehensive simulation tool {{to assess the impact of}} potential artifacts and to allow for the construction of <b>guide</b> <b>curves</b> for use with the sine method. ...|$|R
