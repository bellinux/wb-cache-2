5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing <b>extradural</b> haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E

50|$|Two most {{commonly}} used and effective examination method for Tarlov Cysts are MRI and CT. Both CT and MRI are good imaging procedures that allow the detection of <b>extradural</b> spinal masses such as Tarlov cysts. Magnetic resonance neurography is an emerging imaging technology based on MRI that highlights neurologic tissue. Often cysts are under reported and under diagnosed as radiologists and neurosurgeons have been traditionally taught to ignore these cysts. Patients frequently experience difficulty in diagnosis, however this is changing as Tarlov cysts have now been recognized by NORD as a rare disease.|$|E

In diseases such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, signs and symptoms include headache, neck stiffness and back and leg pain. <b>Extradural,</b> subdural and intramedullary hematomas are all signs of acute cord compression. Gradual onset diseases are more common (85-90% of all diseases leading to a diagnosis of malformation) and are usually due to an increased venous pressure. Other factors such as thrombosis or arachnoiditis can be involved. A bruit (unusual blood sounds) may be heard overlying the spinal arteriovenous malformation. Very occasionally, nevus (moles) or angiolipomas are found.|$|E

50|$|Head {{injuries}} {{include both}} injuries {{to the brain}} and those {{to other parts of}} the head, such as the scalp and skull. Head injuries can be closed or open. A closed (non-missile) head injury is where the dura mater remains intact. The skull can be fractured, but not necessarily. A penetrating head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater. Brain injuries may be diffuse, occurring over a wide area, or focal, located in a small, specific area. A head injury may cause skull fracture, which may or may not be associated with injury to the brain. Some patients may have linear or depressed skull fractures.If intracranial hemorrhage occurs, a hematoma within the skull can put pressure on the brain. Types of intracranial hemorrage include subdural, subarachnoid, <b>extradural,</b> and intraparenchymal hematoma. Craniotomy surgeries are used in these cases to lessen the pressure by draining off blood.|$|E

Occasionally, these cysts are observed in the lumbar and thoracic spine. However, these cysts most commonly arise at the S2 or S3 junction of the dorsal nerve root ganglion. The cysts are often multiple, extending around the circumference of the nerve, and can enlarge over time to compress neighboring nerve roots, to cause bone erosion. [...] The cysts may be found anterior to the sacral area and {{have been known to}} extend into the abdominal cavity.

40|$|The <b>extradural</b> {{administration}} of opioids {{has been used}} increasingly {{in the management of}} post-operative pain since Behar and colleagues [1] first used <b>extradural</b> morphine 2 mg in the manage-ment of chronic pain.

Although the <b>extradural</b> {{administration of}} these doses of mor-phine resulted in analgesia, respiratory depression was an unpredictable problem [3]. In 1982, rostral spread of <b>extradural</b> morphine 10 mg in cerebro-spinal fluid, was confirmed by Bromage and colleagues [4]. <b>Extradural</b> morphine 4 — 8 mg provided 24 — 36 h of analgesia following Caesarean section, but adverse effects occurred after the use of larger doses [5 - 7].

However, <b>extradural</b> morphine 2 mg did not produce suf-ficient pain relief following Caesarean section [9]. Therefore, since Hanson, Hanson and Matousek [10] found <b>extradural</b> morphine 3 mg to be effective, this dose was used in the present study.
