40|$|<b>Early</b> <b>detection</b> of the {{introduction}} of an infectious livestock disease is of great importance to limit the potential extent of an outbreak. Classical Swine Fever (CSF) often causes non-specific clinical signs, which can take considerable time to be detected. Currently, the disease can be detected by three main routes, that are all triggered by clinical signs. To improve the <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of CSF an additional program, based on mortality data, aims to routinely perform PCR tests on ear notch samples from herds with a high(er) mortality. To assess {{the effectiveness of this}} new <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system,</b> we have developed a stochastic model that describes the virus transmission within a pig herd, the development of disease in infected animals and the different <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> programs. As virus transmission and mortality (by CSF and by other causes) are different for finishing pigs, piglets and sows, a distinction is made between these pig categories. The model is applied to an extensive database that contains all unique pig herds in The Netherlands, their herd sizes and their mortality reports over the CSF-free period 2001 - 2005. Results from the simulations suggest that the new <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> is not effective in piglet sections, due to the high mortality from non-CSF causes, nor in sow sections, due to the low CSF-mortality. In finishing herds, the model predicts that the new <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> can improve the detection time by two days, from 38 (27 - 53) days to 36 (24 - 51) days after virus introduction, when assuming a moderately virulent virus strain causing a 50 % CSF mortality. For this result up to 5 ear notch samples per herd from 8 (0 - 13) finishing herds must be tested every workday. Detecting a source herd two days earlier could considerably reduce the number of initially infected herds. However, considering the variation in outcome and the uncertainty in some model assumptions, this two-day gain in detection time is too small to demonstrate a substantial effect of the new <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> based on mortality data. But when the alertness of herd-owners and veterinarians diminishes during long CSF-free periods, the new <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> might gain in effectiveness. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

We conclude that an early detection system, as for public health surveillance, can be an effective tool for enhanced surveillance.

30|$|An {{automatic}} detection and a precise picking of the arrival times of seismic waves using digital seismograms {{are important for}} earthquake <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems.</b> Here we suggest a new method for detecting and picking P-and S-wave signals automatically. Compared to methods currently in use, our method requires fewer assumption with properties of the data time series. We divide a record into intervals of equal lengths and check the “local and weak stationarity” of each interval using {{the theory of the}} KM 2 O-Langevin equations. The intervals are stationary when these include only background noise, but the stationarity breaks abruptly when a seismic signal arrives and the intervals include both the background noise and the P-wave. This break of stationarity makes us possible to detect P-wave arrival. We expand the method for picking of S-waves. We applied our method to earthquake data from Hi-net Japan, and 90 % of P-wave auto-picks were found to be within 0.1 s of the corresponding manual picks, and 70 % of S-wave picks were within 0.1 s of the manual picks. This means that our method is accurate enough to use {{as a part of the}} seismic early detection system.|$|E

Methods: Epidemic definition variables generated from surveillance data were plotted against weekly malaria counts to assess which most accurately labelled aberrations. Various alert thresholds were then generated from weekly counts or log counts. Finally, the best epidemic definition was used to calculate and compare sensitivities, specificities, detection delays, and areas under ROC curves of the alert thresholds. Results: The best epidemic definition used a minimum duration of four weeks and week-specific and overall smoothed geometric means plus 1. 0 standard deviation. It defined 13 epidemics. A modified C-SUM alert of untransformed weekly counts using a threshold of mean + 0. 25 SD had the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. Untransformed C-SUM alerts also had the highest area under the ROC curve. Conclusions: Defining local malaria epidemics using objective criteria facilitated the evaluation of alert thresholds.
