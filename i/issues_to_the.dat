5|$|Bamber brought 16 <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence.

5|$|During {{his years}} in the House and Senate, Dodd built a long record of {{political}} positions on important <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation.

5|$|The {{franchise}} {{includes several}} spin-off games, including the Dragon Quest Monsters RPG. The series has also inspired arcade games {{such as the}} Japanese , where players compete for real-life cards with monster data that the arcade game <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> players through a slot on its front. The latter is the only spin-off series to have none of its titles released outside Japan. The Mystery Dungeon and Fortune Street series use characters and other elements from Dragon Quest games, and the Mystery Dungeon series {{has gone on to}} spawn its own franchise.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{probably}} with the regiment when it put down Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685, but {{his role in}} some of the more unsavory behaviour on the part of Kirke's troops is unknown. Kirke, who had been selected by Charles II as the governor of the prospective Dominion of New England, was strongly criticized {{for his role in the}} quashing of the rebellion, and James withdrew his nomination. The dominion's governorship instead went to Sir Edmund Andros, and Nicholson, now a captain, accompanied Andros as commander of a company of infantry to Boston in October 1686. Andros sent Nicholson on what was essentially a reconnaissance mission to French Acadia. Under the cover of delivering a letter protesting a variety of <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Acadian governor, Nicholson made careful observations of Port Royal's defenses. Nicholson impressed Andros in this service, and was soon appointed to the dominion's council.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{played a}} major part in {{the passage of the}} Legal Tender Act of 1862, when {{for the first time the}} United States issued {{currency}} backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century, until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913.|$|E

5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision {{on the future of the}} country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.|$|E
