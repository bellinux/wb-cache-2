40|$|<b>Domestic</b> food <b>waste</b> is {{a concept}} that {{recently}} has gained {{a lot of interest in}} the waste management industry. While people’s daily practices have converged more cultural and social symbols with food waste and keep re-defining and re-constructing the <b>domestic</b> food <b>waste</b> system, food waste then has emerged as a way to explain the real meaning hidden behind the everyday practices. By studying literature, conducting ethnographic fieldwork, as well as using cultural and anthropological theory to analyze empirical materials, my ambition is to answer the following questions: What and how do people define food waste?

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{discharge}} volume of <b>domestic</b> solid <b>waste</b> in rural China and to explore the potential impact of various factors that contribute to it. Design/methodology/approach - The data used in this study come from a large-scale field survey conducted in six Chinese provinces. Based on the collected survey data, econometric model on the determinants of <b>domestic</b> solid <b>waste</b> discharge was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - Results from the study show that the per capita daily discharge of rural <b>domestic</b> solid <b>waste</b> was close to 1 kg in 2010, slightly less than the urban level of 1. 2 kg. Results from descriptive statistical analysis and econometric estimation indicate that by implementing selected policy measures, the discharge of solid waste can be significantly reduced. In addition, the discharge of <b>domestic</b> solid <b>waste</b> is also closely related with local socio-economic development. In particular, the results show an obvious inverted U-shaped curve between discharge volume and income. The increase of off-farm labor opportunities would also reduce solid waste discharge in rural China. Originality/value - This paper focuses on <b>domestic</b> solid <b>waste</b> discharge and its determinants in rural China, a research area very important but seldom reported...|$|R

25|$|Israel has a {{large number}} of {{environmental}} concerns ranging from natural hazards to man-made issues both resulting from ancient times to modern development. Natural hazards facing the country include sandstorms which sometimes occur during spring in the desert south, droughts which are usually concentrated in summer months, flash floods which create great danger in the deserts due to their lack of notice, and regular earthquakes, most of which are small, although there is a constant risk due to Israel's location along the Jordan Rift Valley. Current environmental concerns include the lack of arable land and natural fresh water resources. Whilst measures have been taken to irrigate and grow in the desert, the amount of water needed here poses issues. Desertification is also a risk possible on the desert fringe, whilst air pollution from industrial and vehicle emissions and groundwater pollution from industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>waste</b> are also issues facing the country.
