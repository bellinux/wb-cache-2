5|$|Neuro: Supernatural Detectives manga {{has been}} popular in Japan, {{frequently}} ranking {{in the weekly}} Top Ten list of best-selling manga. It has sold over four million volumes as of April 2009 in Japan. The anime, however, has been criticized by fans because it deviates from Matsui's work, and received a low viewership. Critics of anime and manga often compared it to Case Closed, noting supernatural themes as the only <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{variations}} {{that were}} issued for the $10000 and $100000 denominations are {{recognised in the}} Standard Catalog of World Paper Money: the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> {{was the use of}} digit grouping. Cheques with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix AA, while notes with prefixes AB onwards is expressed as '10000' or '100000'.|$|E

5|$|At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} is a subtle <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> in the mudras, or the {{position}} of the hands. There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E

25|$|A {{binaural}} beat is an auditory illusion perceived {{when two}} different pure-tone sine waves, both with frequencies lower than 1500Hz, {{with less than}} a 40Hz <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> are presented to a listener dichotically (one through each ear).|$|E
25|$|In {{the formula}} above, T is the {{classical}} period of either orbit n or orbit m, since the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is higher order in h. But for n and m small, or if n − m is large, the frequencies are not integer multiples of any single frequency.|$|E

25|$|Affiliate {{marketing}} is commonly confused with referral marketing, as both forms of marketing use third parties to drive {{sales to the}} retailer. However, both are distinct forms of marketing and the main <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is that affiliate marketing relies purely on financial motivations to drive sales while referral marketing relies on trust and personal relationships to drive sales.|$|E
25|$|Capacitance {{is defined}} as the ratio of the {{electric}} charge on each conductor to the potential <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> The unit of capacitance in the International System of Units (SI) is the farad (F), defined as one coulomb per volt (1 C/V). Capacitance values of typical capacitors for use in general electronics range from about 1picofarad (pF) (10−12F) to about 1millifarad (mF) (10−3F).|$|E
25|$|Stray voltage is the {{occurrence}} of electrical potential between two objects that ideally should not have any voltage <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Small voltages often exist between two grounded objects in separate locations, due to normal current flow in the power system. Large voltages can appear on the enclosures of electrical equipment due to a fault in the electrical power system, such as a failure of insulation.|$|E
50|$|Remote Differential Compression (RDC) is a {{client-server}} synchronization protocol allows {{data to be}} synchronized with {{a remote}} source using compression techniques to minimize the amount of data sent across the network. It synchronizes files by calculating and transferring only the <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> on-the-fly. Therefore, RDC is suitable for efficient synchronization of files that have been updated independently, or when network bandwidth is small or in scenarios where the files are large but the <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> are small.|$|R

25|$|The Yakovlev OKB {{began work}} in February 1951 on an {{aircraft}} {{that could be}} used as a cheap bomber trainer as the Yak-UTB (oochebnotrenirovochnyy bombardirovshchik — bomber trainer), but this was quickly split into two closely related versions, the Yak-200 for pilot training and the Yak-210 for navigator/bombardier training. The primary <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> was in equipment; the Yak-200 lacked all of the specialized navigation and bombardier gear.|$|E
25|$|Squire married Susan Fey, a Labour Party activist, in 1981. Questioned {{about the}} marriage, Fey stated {{that she was}} on {{the right wing of the}} Labour Party and her husband was on the left of the Conservative Party. As such, she {{considered}} that there was no great political <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> The couple had two children (one son and one daughter) by Fey's previous marriage and divorced in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Many women {{participate}}d in the American Civil War. Two of the most notable Hispanic women to participate in that conflict were Lola Sánchez and Loreta Janeta Velazquez. The similarities between them were that both were Cuban born and both served for the Confederacy. However, the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> was that one served as a spy while the other disguised herself as a male and fought in various battles.|$|E

25|$|Development {{of speed}} {{cushions}} has {{focused primarily on}} the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller than American vehicles. This is to accommodate smaller demand for passengers and to better suit narrower road widths. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, and the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> makes speed cushions more applicable.|$|E
25|$|Atterberg limits : The Atterberg limits {{define the}} {{boundaries}} of several states of consistency for plastic soils. The boundaries are defined {{by the amount of}} water a soil needs to be at one of those boundaries. The boundaries are called the plastic limit and the liquid limit, and the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is called the plasticity index. The shrinkage limit is also a part of the Atterberg limits. The results of this test can be used to help predict other engineering properties.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the quality}} of Atma is {{primarily}} consciousness, all sentient and insentient beings are pervaded by Atma, including plants, animals, humans and gods. The <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is the contracted or expanded state of that consciousness. For example, animals and humans share in common the desire to live, fear of death, desire to procreate and to protect their families and territory {{and the need for}} sleep, but animals' consciousness is more contracted and has less possibility to expand than does human consciousness.|$|E
