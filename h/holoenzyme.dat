The feature that distinguishes the RNA polymerase II <b>holoenzymes</b> from other forms of RNA polymerase II in the cell is their tight association with SRB proteins. We investigated the fraction of genes that require SRB proteins in vivo by examining the effect of temperature-sensitive mutations in SRB genes on transcription by RNA polymerase II. Upon transfer to the restrictive temperature, there is a rapid and general shutdown of mRNA synthesis in srb mutant cells. These data, combined with the observation that essentially all of the SRB protein in cells is tightly associated with RNA polymerase II molecules, argue that SRB-containing <b>holoenzymes</b> are the form of RNA polymerase II recruited to most promoters in the cell...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{phosphatase}} 2 A (PP 2 A) {{is a major}} Ser/Thr phosphatase; {{it forms}} diverse heterotrimeric <b>holoenzymes</b> that counteract kinase actions. Using a peptidome that tiles the disordered regions of the human proteome, we identified proteins containing [LMFI]xx[ILV]xEx motifs that serve as interaction sites for B′-family PP 2 A regulatory subunits and <b>holoenzymes.</b> The B′-binding motifs have important roles in substrate recognition and in competitive inhibition of substrate binding. With more than 100 novel ligands identified, we confirmed that the recently identified LxxIxEx B′α-binding motifs serve as common binding sites for B′ subunits with minor variations, and that S/T phosphorylation or D/E residues at positions 2, 7, 8 and 9 of the motifs reinforce interactions. Hundreds of proteins in the human proteome harbor intrinsic or phosphorylation-responsive B′-interaction motifs, and localize at distinct cellular organelles, such as midbody, predicting kinase-facilitated recruitment of PP 2 A-B′ <b>holoenzymes</b> for tight spatiotemporal control of phosphorylation at mitosis and cytokinesis. Moroever, Polo-like kinase 1 -mediated phosphorylation of Cyk 4 /RACGAP 1, a centralspindlin component at the midbody, facilitates binding of both RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (Ect 2)) and PP 2 A-B′ that in turn dephosphorylates Cyk 4 and disrupts Ect 2 binding.

40|$|Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a {{ubiquitous}} {{second messenger}} that regulates many proteins, most notably cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA <b>holoenzymes</b> (comprised of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits) regulate {{a wide variety}} of cellular processes, and its functional diversity is amplified by the presence of four R-subunit isoforms, RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ. Although these isoforms all respond to cAMP, they are functionally nonredundant and exhibit different biochemical properties. In order to understand the functional differences between these isoforms, we screened cAMP derivatives for their ability to selectively activate RI and RII PKA <b>holoenzymes</b> using a fluorescence anisotropy assay. Our results indicate that RIα <b>holoenzymes</b> are selectively activated by C 8 -substituted analogs and RIIβ <b>holoenzymes</b> by N 6 -substituted analogs, where HE 33 is the most prominent RII activator. We also solved the crystal structures of both RIα and RIIβ bound to HE 33. The RIIβ structure shows the bulky aliphatic substituent of HE 33 is fully encompassed by a pocket comprising of hydrophobic residues. RIα lacks this hydrophobic lining in Domain A, and the side chains are displaced to accommodate the HE 33 dipropyl groups. Comparison between cAMP-bound structures reveals that RIIβ, but not RIα, contains a cavity near the N 6 site. This study suggests that the selective activation of RII over RI isoforms by N 6 analogs is driven by the spatial and chemical constraints of Domain A and paves the way for the development of potent noncyclic nucleotide activators to specifically target PKA iso-holoenyzmes...|$|R

Because the mass represents {{the sum of the}} molecular masses of all of the molecules comprising a PSD, it becomes possible to derive the number of copies of each protein, once its relative mass contribution is known. Mass contributions of PSD- 95, synapse-associated protein (SAP) 97, and α-Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were determined by quantitative gel electrophoresis of PSD fractions. The number of PSD- 95 molecules per average PSD, contributing 2. 3 % of the mass of the PSD, was calculated to be 300, whereas the number of SAP 97 molecules, contributing 0. 9 % of the mass of the PSD, was 90.

PKA anchoring is mediated by an amphipathic helix of 14 – 18 residues on each AKAP that binds to the R subunit dimer of the PKA <b>holoenzymes.</b> Using a combination of bioinformatics and peptide array screening, we have developed a high affinity-binding peptide called RIAD (RI anchoring disruptor) with> 1000 -fold selectivity for type I PKA over type II PKA.

40|$|SummaryThe biogenesis and {{function}} of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) involve the organization of RC enzyme complexes in supercomplexes or respirasomes through an unknown biosynthetic process. This leads to structural interdependences between RC complexes, which are highly relevant from biological and biomedical perspectives, because RC defects often lead to severe neuromuscular disorders. We show that in human cells, respirasome biogenesis involves a complex I assembly intermediate acting as a scaffold for the combined incorporation of complexes III and IV subunits, rather than originating from the association of preassembled individual <b>holoenzymes.</b> The process ends with the incorporation of complex I NADH dehydrogenase catalytic module, {{which leads to the}} respirasome activation. While complexes III and IV assemble either as free <b>holoenzymes</b> or by incorporation of free subunits into supercomplexes, the respirasomes constitute the structural units where complex I is assembled and activated, thus explaining the significance of the respirasomes for RC function...|$|R

The number of transcription factories in tissues is far more restricted than indicated by previous estimates from cultured cells.

Colocalization of transcribed genes has not been observed when using cultured fibroblast-like cells. Differentiated or committed tissue types have a limited number of available transcription sites.

Both <b>holoenzymes</b> displayed low basal phosphorylase phosphatase activity, which could be stimulated by protamine to an extent similar to that of previously characterized PP 2 A <b>holoenzymes.</b> Protein micro-sequencing of tryptic peptides derived from the 61 kDa protein, termed PR 61, yielded 117 residues of amino acid sequence. Molecular cloning by enrichment of specific mRNAs, followed by reverse transcription-PCR and cDNA library screening, revealed that this protein exists in multiple isoforms encoded by at least three genes, one of which gives rise to several splicing variants. Comparisons of these sequences with the available databases identified one more human gene and predicted another based on a rabbit cDNA-derived sequence, thus bringing the number of genes encoding PR 61 family members to five. Peptide sequences derived from PR 61 corresponded to the deduced amino acid sequences of either alpha or beta isoforms, indicating that the purified PP 2 A preparation was a mixture of at least two trimers. In contrast, the 56 kDa subunit (termed PR 56) seems to correspond to the epsilon isoform of PR 61.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are {{targets of}} measles virus (MV) and play central roles in viral dissemination. However, DCs express the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and Mda 5 that sense MV and induce type I {{interferon}} (IFN) production. Given {{the potency of}} this antiviral response, RLRs are tightly regulated at various steps, including dephosphorylation by PP 1 phosphatases, which induces their activation. We demonstrate that MV suppresses RIG-I and Mda 5 by activating the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and inducing signaling that prevents RLR dephosphorylation. MV binding to DC-SIGN leads to activation of the kinase Raf- 1, which induces the association of PP 1 inhibitor I- 1 with GADD 34 -PP 1 <b>holoenzymes,</b> thereby inhibiting phosphatase activity. Consequently, GADD 34 -PP 1 <b>holoenzymes</b> are unable to dephosphorylate RIG-I and Mda 5, hence suppressing type I IFN responses and enhancing MV replication.
