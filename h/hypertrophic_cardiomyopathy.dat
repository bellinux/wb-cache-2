5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (<b>hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathy),</b> constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (HCM) is {{a common}} {{condition}} (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall.

The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations.

25|$|The cloning of {{the human}} MYBPC3 cDNA and {{localization}} of the gene on human chromosome 11p11.2 has assisted the structure and function of cMyBP-C.

40|$|AbstractMitral valve {{regurgitation}} {{in association}} with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> is usually caused by the systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet. Recently, five patients were encountered with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> who had mitral regurgitation due to ruptured chordae tendineae. The diagnosis was confirmed in all patients during operation for left ventricular septal myectomy-myotomy (Morrow procedure). Preoperative identification of ruptured chordae tendineae {{as the cause of}} mitral regurgitation was established by transesophageal echocardiography in the three most recent cases. All patients had successful septal myectomy-myotomy for relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction, and mitral valve competence was restored by valve repair rather than by prosthetic valve replacement. The clinical course of these patients illustrates important management considerations as well as the utility of transesophageal echocardiography for diagnosis. Chordal rupture should be considered in the differential diagnosis of mitral regurgitation in patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> especially in those with acute hemodynamic deterioration...|$|R

40|$|Cardiomyopathies {{represent}} an important cause of cardiovascular {{morbidity and mortality}} due to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. A majority of <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathies</b> (HCM) and at least 30 % of dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM) are familial forms, with most often an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Over the last 15 years, our knowledge on the genetic bases of these diseases has considerably improved. Cardiomyopathies are characterized by a great genetic heterogeneity at both allelic and non-allelic levels. <b>Hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are mainly linked to mutations on genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, and beta myosin heavy chain and myosin binding protein C gene mutations account for about 80 % of genotyped cases. Familial DCM is associated with mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins but also other proteins of the myocyte, such as cytoskeletal or nuclear membrane proteins. Due to the genetic heterogeneity and the variable clinical expressivity of these diseases, the relations between genotype and phenotype remain complex, but the age of onset, the clinical severity, or associated phenotypes may be, at least in part, related to the precise gene mutations. Therefore, besides {{a better understanding of}} the molecular basis for cardiac remodeling and heart failure, the genetic analysis of cardiomyopathies is going to play an increasing role in the routine management of these patients in the following years, particularly in HCM...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of fibrosis in organ pathology and dysfunction {{appears to be}} increasingly relevant {{to a variety of}} distinct diseases. In particular, a number of different cardiac pathologies seem to be caused by a common fibrotic process. Within the heart, this fibrosis is thought to be partially mediated by transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), a potent stimulator of collagen-producing cardiac fibroblasts. Previously, TGF-β 1 had been implicated solely as a modulator of the myocardial remodelling seen after infarction. However, recent studies indicate that dilated, ischaemic and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are all associated with raised levels of TGF-β 1. In fact, the pathogenic effects of TGF-β 1 have now been suggested {{to play a major role}} in valvular disease and arrhythmia, particularly atrial fibrillation. Thus far, medical therapy targeting TGF-β 1 has shown promise in a multitude of heart diseases. These therapies provide great hope, not only for treatment of symptoms but also for prevention of cardiac pathology as well. As is stated in the introduction, most reviews have focused on the effects of cytokines in remodelling after myocardial infarction. This article attempts to underline the significance of TGF-β 1 not only in the post-ischaemic setting, but also in dilated and <b>hypertrophic</b> <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> valvular diseases and arrhythmias (focusing on atrial fibrillation). It also aims to show that TGF-β 1 is an appropriate target for therapy in a variety of cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{to be the result}} of gene mutations of contractile proteins. However, we have previously shown significant elevation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) at the messenger RNA, protein, and receptor levels in patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> when compared with myocardium from patients without this disorder. We hypothesized that this growth factor overexpression is a regional phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we compared levels of IGF-I and TGF-β 1 in hypertrophic and nonhypertrophic myocardium within the same group of patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> Methods: Two biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient undergoing septal myectomy for severely symptomatic <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> from hypertrophied septum and from nonhypertrophied myocardium (8 patients in total). Clinical data were prospectively recorded. Messenger RNA levels for growth factor were quantified by means of multiplex reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, expressed as a densitometric ratio of growth factor/glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. Protein levels were quantified by means of chemiluminescent slot blot analysis. Growth factor proteins were used to generate a standard curve. Results: IGF-I messenger RNA and protein levels in hypertrophic myocardium were 2. 6 and 2. 9 times greater, respectively, than in nonhypertrophic myocardium of the same patients (both P <. 01). TGF-β 1 messenger RNA and protein levels in the hypertrophic myocardium were 2. 5 and 2. 8 times greater, respectively, than the levels in the nonhypertrophied myocardium (both P <. 01). There was a significant correlation between the IGF-I protein ratio (hypertrophic/nonhypertrophic myocardium) and the inducible left ventricular outflow tract gradients measured at cardiac catheterization (r = 0. 77, P =. 025). Conclusions: Myocardial overexpression of IGF-I and TGF-β 1 is a regional phenomenon in patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> and is likely involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to show the influence of right ventricular pacing site on left ventricular outflow tract obstruction during pacing treatment of patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> Background. Atrioventricular synchronous pacing has been reported to reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction and symptoms in patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> A paradoxic septal movement induced by right ventricular pacing has been implicated as the mechanism behind the reduced left ventricular outflow tract obstruction; however, the importance of pacing site has not been clarified. Methods. Cardiac output, measured invasively, and left ventricular outflow tract gradient, estimated by Doppler echocardiography, were studied in 15 patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> Measurements were made with the right ventricular electrode in the septal and apical positions during temporary pacing and during sinus rhythm. Results. Right ventricular apical pacing reduced the outflow tract gradient in all 15 patients to a mean ± SD of 38 ± 24 mm Hg from 96 ± 33 mm Hg during sinus rhythm. During high septal pacing the outflow tract gradient was not reduced, remaining at 93 ± 44 mm Hg. No significant changes in cardiac output were seen when levels during sinus rhythm (6. 4 liters/min), apical pacing (6. 4 liters/ min) and high septal pacing (5. 6 liters/min) were compared. Conclusions. The right ventricular pacing site is of crucial importance for reducing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction when patients with <b>hypertrophic</b> obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> are treated with pacing. Cardiac output is not reduced by apical pacing...|$|R
