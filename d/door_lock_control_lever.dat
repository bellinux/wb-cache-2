50|$|In July 1999, Toyota began {{production}} of the seventh-generation Celica. It closely resembled the XYR concept {{with the exception of}} the front bumper and rear spoiler, while omitting the previously available coupe body style. The 2000 model year Celica was an element of Toyota Project Genesis, an effort to bring younger buyers to the marque in the United States. Toyota took time to lighten the car and lower cost wherever possible. Power window and <b>door</b> <b>lock</b> <b>controls</b> were placed in the center console so only 1 set was necessary for both doors. Initial sunroofs were made of polymer plastic instead of the traditional glass. This generation was assembled by Kanto Auto Works at its Higashi-Fuji plant in Susono, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.|$|R

Light guides are commonly used to distributively light dashboard displays, and premium vehicles are beginning to use distributive systems for lighting such items as <b>door</b> <b>locks,</b> window <b>controls,</b> and cup holders. [...] Distributive exterior lighting has also been explored, with high-intensity central light sources.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Formal {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to verify that a model of the system adheres to its requirements. As such, traditional formal analysis focuses on whether known (desired) system properties are satisfied. In contrast, this paper proposes an automated approach to generating temporal logic properties that specify the latent behavior of existing UML models; these are unknown properties exhibited by the system {{that may or may not}} be desirable. A key component of our approach is Marple, a evolutionary-computation tool that leverages natural selection to discover a set of properties that cover different regions of the model state space. The Marple-discovered properties {{can be used to}} refine the models to either remove unwanted behavior or to explicitly document a desirable property as required system behavior. We use Marple to discover unwanted latent behavior in two applications: an autonomous robot navigation system and an automotive <b>door</b> <b>locking</b> <b>control</b> system obtained from one of our industrial collaborators. ...|$|R

50|$|With the {{internal}} combustion engine and transaxle mounted very low in the back, the T3 had much larger disc brakes in the front, and drums in the rear.

Unlike the T2 before it, the T3 was available with amenities such as power steering, air conditioning, power <b>door</b> <b>locks,</b> electrically <b>controlled</b> and heated mirrors, lighted vanity mirrors, and a light above the glove box (most of which were essentially standard equipment in later models).|$|R
50|$|Small vacuum motors {{were also}} used to operate {{windscreen}} wipers in automobiles. In this case, the motors were powered by manifold vacuum. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the vacuum servo. Brakes are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors {{were also used}} from the late 1960s to control servomechanisms such as <b>door</b> <b>locks,</b> heater <b>controls</b> or movable bonnet ventilation flaps.|$|R
50|$|The four {{wheel drive}} system {{introduced}} on this generation was borrowed from the Toyota Celica GT-Four. Four wheel steering was available. The trim level designations were 1800V, 2000X, 2000GT and 2000GT-4WD. As a result of styling changes, sales improved {{in comparison to the}} second generation. A driver side airbag appeared September 1995, as well as speed sensitive <b>door</b> <b>locks</b> and climate <b>control</b> air conditioning. A passenger side airbag appeared June 1996. Production ended due to economic conditions April 1998.|$|R

The [...] "ZJ" [...] models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited, subsequent trims were added, included Orvis (95–98), TSI (97–98).

Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag (starting in 96) and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power <b>door</b> <b>locks,</b> cruise <b>control,</b> and a leather wrapped steering wheel.
