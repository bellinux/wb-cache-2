40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{experience}} of the criminal reforms carried out by the Italian fascist (1922 / 1943) and the Brazilian Estado Novo (1937 / 1945) authoritarian regimes by means of legislative <b>delegation,</b> <b>procedure</b> in which state authority achieves greater strength. The edition of such codes serves as a strategy to legitimize the regime by strengthening the government's authority imposing obedience of the new laws established by it. The analysis will examine the constitutional legality and legitimacy for the Parliament’s dismissal in the procedures. In Italy, the Parliament itself has abdicated its competence by a delegation of powers to the government; in Brazil, the 1937 coup d’État imposed a new constitution in which the parliament became inactive, leaving the legislative competence fully to the Executive...|$|E
40|$|An {{anonymous}} delegation system enables {{individuals to}} retrieve rights and to delegate different subparts of these rights to different entities. The <b>delegation</b> <b>procedure</b> is anonymous, such that no collusion of entities can track an individual’s delegation behavior. On the other hand, {{it is ensured that}} a user cannot abuse her delegation capabilities. This paper introduces a general delegation model and presents three implementations. Our implementations {{are based on}} credential systems and provide both anonymity for the individual and security for the organizations. The implementations are compared based on their functionality, privacy and security characteristics. Additionally, some guidelines are given for choosing a particular implementation based on the application’s requirements.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{interpreted}} {{the decision to}} vote for a particular party as a process of delegation to decision makers having a simplified system of preferences. Each person in a population votes for the political party that place priority on one or more issues that they consider important. Moreover, {{on the basis of a}} survey on preferences of population, we have simulated a <b>delegation</b> <b>procedure</b> which chart the selection process of a particular party. Finally, making use of noncommutative harmonic analysis, we decomposed the delegation function, and isolated the effect of a particular affinity, or a combination of either the pair of items that characterize a party. We used noncommutative harmonic analysis as an application of some results obtained by Michael E. Orrison and Brian L. %%@ Lawson in relation to spectral analysis applied in voting in political committees. ...|$|E

A large percentage (34 - 58 per cent) of both groups were unaware or mistaken in their perception of the legality of delegating sealants.

40|$|A rough {{consensus}} {{has emerged}} that states with proportional representation systems are" likely to run larger deficits than plurality states. We argue that electoral institutions matter because" they restrict {{the type of}} budgetary institution at the governmental phase which a state has at its" disposal. Cabinet members may willingly delegate authority to a finance minister who can monitor" spending ministers and punish those who defect' in a process we label <b>delegation</b> <b>procedure</b> is feasible in states where one-party governments are the norm. Such states usually have" plurality electoral systems. In multi-party governments, which are common in states with" proportional representation, the coalition members {{are not willing to}} delegate to one actor the ability" to monitor and punish the others. Negotiated targets in the form of fiscal contracts provide an" alternative in multi-party governments. Pooled time series regression results for the current" European Union states in the period 1981 - 94 support our contention that it is the presence or absence" of one of these budgetary institutions, rather than the plurality/proportional representation" dichotomy, which has the greatest impact on debt levels. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{endogenous}} formation of factions {{in the context}} of information aggregation. We model consultations within a party that lead to the design of its policy platform. Control rights over the design of the platform are allo-cated to party politicians with idiosyncratic ideological biases. Final outcomes are affected by fundamentals over which politicians hold private information. Politicians can strategically communicate and voluntarily delegate their deci-sion making authority. The <b>delegation</b> <b>procedure</b> determines the party factional structure. Whilst in principle this structure can be very complex, we show that, in any equilibrium, the party is divided in disjoint factions each with a single leader. We then calculate factional structure in simplified parties with many ideologically different politicians. Doing so we establish a positive role for fac-tions: policy outcomes can not be directly predicted from the ideological struc-ture of the party, so factions matter; and a factionalised party may outperform a non-factionalised one, and offer a second-best alternative to centralized author-ity under a moderate leader. We reinforce this message by studying different communication rules across and within factions that may change the equilib-rium factional structure...|$|E
40|$|Grid <b>delegation</b> is the <b>procedure</b> {{by which}} a valid user endows another user or a program or service {{with the ability to}} act on that user’s behalf. Delegation is the primary form of {{authorization}} in grids. The large and geographically distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous and scalable grid environment poses unique delegation requirements. Presently there are no standard mechanisms to guide grid delegation. As credential delegation has its own limitations in a dynamic grid environment, a new conceptual model is required to effectively formulate the grid delegation requirements. In this paper, we present a framework called Role-Based Grid Delegation Model (RB-GDM) for delegating access rights in grids. The basic unit of delegation in our model is role. Derived from the standard RBAC formalisms, this framework explores various approaches for authorization and revocation of delegation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDelegation {{is a very}} {{important}} part of the administrative process in access control systems; it provides resiliency and flexibility regarding to the management <b>procedure.</b> <b>Delegation</b> is the process of granting a specific authorization from a user to another user of the same system to carry out some functions on his behalf. The delegation, although widely used, is modeled in very little security policies because of its complexity. In this paper we aim to consider the delegation dynamically based on temporal context, to this end we redefine delegation for OrBAC using temporal nonmonotonic description logic. OrBAC is an access control model; it provides the mean to specify contextual authorizations, which facilitates modeling delegation features such as temporary delegation, multiple delegation, revocation, etc. The description logic that we use for the re-formalization process is T- JClassicδɛ. This logic gives the mean to specify nonmonotonic authorizations, and a better representation of the temporal aspects specific to a given delegation. This new representation augments the expressivity of the model and therefore it facilitates even more the representation and the management of the delegation characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} {{usefulness}} {{and implementation of}} practice standards in community pharmacy practice regarding contemporary core services. Setting: Community pharmacies in South East Queensland, Australia. Method: During August and September 2006 semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists explored practice processes and procedures and the utilisation of endorsed standards and guidelines. Thematic content analysis of the interviews, inductive analysis and continual comparison of categories and concepts enabled common and distinct themes to be clarified. Main outcome measure: Usefulness and integration of practice standards {{in the provision of}} core pharmacy services, utilisation of support staff, record keeping and overall risk management processes in community pharmacy. Results: Seventeen community pharmacists participated, representing a wide range of demographics, experience and pharmacy types. Staff utilisation and record keeping practices were analysed as well as two core services, namely: (1) the supply of over-the-counter medicines, and (2) the dispensing of prescriptions. The procedures followed concerning the supply of over-the-counter medicines varied. The majority of participants did not regard this as a pharmacist's immediate role, but rather relied on support staff to identify when the supply required a pharmacist's intervention. Whilst all participants involved dispensary assistants in the dispensing process, the <b>delegation</b> of <b>procedures</b> differed. Most participants did not clearly differentiate between pharmacists' and dispensary assistants' activities. Dispensing processes and the involvement of pharmacists in the provision of patient advice varied. Pharmacist intervention record keeping was uncommon and records of 'near misses' were not routinely kept by any of the participants. Conclusion: A lack of integration of practice standards indicated a need to review the standards for relevance. Additionally, pharmacists need to re-evaluate workflow models and the delegation of tasks in the light of new roles and responsibilities. Griffith Health, School of PharmacyFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Leading role in {{the process}} of {{development}} and improvement of modern Russian education plays an additional professional education, which, to the greatest extent, responds to the qualitative changes in the socio-economic relations in a rapidly changing world. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the organizational and legal problems of professional and public accreditation of additional professional education programs in Russia and the opportunities development of this institution in modern conditions.   The scientific research problem was to justify the need for professional and public accreditation of additional professional education programs of modern universities on the basis of <b>delegation</b> of <b>procedures</b> for evaluating the quality of education by public authorities to the public expert organizations, which ensure the independence and objectivity of the decisions made by qualified experts using a standardized assessment tools and tech to meet the needs of all parties concerned for highly qualified professionals.   Methods. Empirical and theoretical methods were applied {{in the process of}} solving the problems in the scientific work to achieve the objectives of the study and test the hypothesis of an integrated methodology.

40|$|Logo nanoworlds {{are small}} {{educational}} environments for Logo programming {{that focus on}} the mediation of intuitive models of informatics concepts. These are coherent Gestalt-like mental concepts, which are based on experience and which are subjectively certain (Fischbein 1987). Typical features of Logo nanoworlds are � Visualisation of activity defined by a Logo programme � Only a few Logo syntax elements are applied in each nanoworld � Simple ad hoc understandable interactive elements � Focus on certain intuitive models in each nanoworld � Diversity of different intuitions in different nanoworlds � Explication gaps � High speed: a visit to a nanoworld takes {{just a couple of minutes}} Two prototype nanoworlds are presented, which both adopt a <b>delegation</b> model for <b>procedure</b> calls. In Turtles on the Beach the player constructs (possibly recursive) procedures that produce graphical patterns. The editing is done by manipulating “puzzle pieces ” with code fragments on the screen. In contrast to conventional Logo Turtle environments the programme is executed by a team of Turtles. Each Turtle on the screen is attached to one procedure call. This model is supposed to facilitate the comprehension of recursive programmes. The second example is called Turtles in the Printery and is about recursive procedures containing print statements. Figure 1. Screenshots from the nanoworlds &quot;Turtles on the Beach &quot; and &quot;Turtles in the Printery&quot; Visiting a nanoworld is comparable to exploring an exhibit in a scientific museum or an art gallery. Classroom activities around nanoworlds include observing details of programme visualizations, comparing different intuitive models, bridging explication gaps and finding connections between visual representations and programming constructs...|$|R
40|$|Iatrogenic {{diseases}} {{are due to}} negligence or malpractice (Pezza et al., 2008). In human medicine, these conditions are widely described (Weingart et al., 2000), mostly for insurance issues related to hospitalization, while in veterinary medicine are reported only occasional case reports. 4155 clinical records related to cattle admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants and Swine of the University of Milan between 2005 and 2017 were analyzed. Clinical cases that required admission because of an iatrogenic related disease were selected for this study. For case selection, 3 experienced veterinarians examined the clinical records, cross-compared the selection and pick 114 cases (2, 7 %). The iatrogenic diseases were primarily caused by farmers (93 %) than veterinary practitioner (7 %). Iatrogenic diseases were caused mostly by erroneous administration of drugs (47, 4 %), excessive traction at birth (17, 5 %), improper milk or colostrum administration, frequently performed by oroesophageal tubing (16, 7 %) or by forced administration using a nipple bottle (12, 3 %). As verified by our study, farmers often performs medical, nursing and zootechnical procedures without adequate competences and sometimes choose medical treatment for sick animals without professional consultation of veterinarians. The veterinarian rule is fundamental in farmer education. Clinicians, especially in some professional branches as neonatology, should be more responsible of their assignments, avoiding <b>delegation</b> of specific <b>procedures</b> to unskilled staff.
