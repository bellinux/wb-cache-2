40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a brief overview of various inspection methodologies for continuously extruded products, such as wire, cable and optical fibres, and to describe the implementation of a practical surface inspection technique. The main feature of the developed system is the use of a conic reflector arrangement to collect light scattered from a cylindrical surface. Illumination is supplied by optical fibres, strategically positioned around the cone, to provide full circumferential lighting. The <b>inspection</b> <b>arrangement</b> was implemented and tested in an industrial environment and effectively detected defects, such as blisters on wire (of diameters 0. 2 mm to 3 mm), at a speed of up to 10 m s- 1...|$|R
50|$|Each casing {{exits the}} {{grinding}} zone onto a high speed conveyor that delivers them to whatever storage and/or <b>inspection</b> <b>arrangement</b> a manufacturer may have, inspection is also {{carried out by}} the operator of the centreless line, by checking finish appearance, diameter, squareness and roundness by use of a dial test indicator in varying configurations, size allowances are permitted but are extremely tight depending on the customers requirements and can vary plus or minus within micrometres of finish diameter, Sizes can be adjusted on all grinding stages via a compensation button which can be pushed to remove extra material in varying micrometre units, the grinding wheel can move away at the same compensation to make the casings bigger if so required if the casing size moves from the operators target, and as the grinding wheel wears. Because a centerless grinding line has typically three grinding machines the operator must be in complete control and must prevent blockages in transfers, grinding exits and packing areas, also size and quality must constantly be checked, so the operator is always alert while operating the line and checking for problems and quality issues.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of the new <b>inspection</b> <b>arrangements</b> on {{practitioners}} in further education (FE) colleges. It is based on a small study, involving FE practitioners who kept a record of their experiences before, during and after inspection. The aims of this research were to investigate a range of personal experiences of inspection in colleges and to build research capacity among the participants themselves. This research should shed light on the impact inspection has in colleges and provide useful information about the inspection experience for the inspectorates, for the Learning and Skills Council(LSC) and for all post- 16 stakeholders" [...] page 5...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{briefly on}} the quite {{different}} discourses of schooling-as-performance and education-as-exploration, the paper opens by exploring {{some of the}} consequences of the distinction between schooling and education for any system of school inspection. The second section of the paper examines the conceptual and practical inadequacy of ‘accountability’ as an agent of reciprocal public engagement in a participatory democracy. In its stead a more robust, more open notion of ‘reciprocal responsibility’ is offered as a more fitting means of professional and communal renewal. Section III focuses on the relationship between means and ends that is at once central to democracy and so conspicuously absent from current <b>inspection</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The short conclusion suggests we need a radical break from OFSTED if we wish to approximate more closely to our democratic aspirations...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Physical Education & Sport Pedagogy [© Routledge]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] 1995, the Office for Standards in Education has inspected the quality of all Initial Teacher Training (ITT) provision in England on behalf of the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA). Ofsted inspection results are published and are highly significant because the TDA has a statutory duty to take account of them when allocating trainee numbers, funding ITT provision and making accreditation decisions. Yet, concerns have been expressed over the reliability, validity and credibility of inspections as well as over limitations in the methodology and/or the ‘high stakes’ involved. More recently however, there have been revisions to the inspection framework and the current <b>inspection</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which now comprise full and short inspections, propose to be effective, efficient, cost effective and less burdensome (Ofsted, 2005 b; Ofsted & TTA, 2004). Purpose The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a critical account of our most recent ‘short’ Ofsted Inspection of ITT at Loughborough University as a follow up to earlier papers published by ourselves and colleagues on the inspection of our secondary Physical Education ITT provision (Hardy & Evans, 2000; Cale & Harris, 2003). In particular, we consider the extent to which the process is effective, efficient, cost effective, less burdensome and represents a ‘brief encounter’. Method The account is informed by data from various sources. ITT staff kept journals for a period of 7 months leading up to, during, and following the inspection in which they detailed their Ofsted activities, experiences and reflections. Staff periodically completed their journals recording the preparation, work and meetings they were involved in, and noting and reflecting on any problems, issues, concerns, anxieties, frustrations and/or other emotions they experienced. Documentary evidence in the form of Ofsted Handbooks, Guidance plus other paperwork the inspection generated was also collected for analysis. Finally, to augment and support the findings from the journals and documentary evidence, a review of related literature was undertaken. Analysis of the data involved identification of key issues. Discussion and Conclusion Based on our experiences and reflections and the findings from the literature, a number of issues and limitations with the inspection process and framework are highlighted. Given these, we declare that we remain cynical about the whole process and the validity of the outcomes. We contest the notion that the inspection process is effective, efficient and cost effective and feel that it still places an enormous burden on providers. Further, we suggest that the framework is fundamentally flawed which could have serious consequences not only for the future of our own course, but for the future of ITT...|$|E
40|$|This study, called "Business process related {{document}} flow charts for <b>inspection</b> and <b>arrangement</b> of document creation: an application", aims at determining the required steps to control, arrange and profit from documents, which are created {{in a company}} and explaining these steps on a sample application. Companies should decide to organize all documents and build up their business process flow charts, the subprocess flow charts {{or a combination of}} the two. For every time period, a different business process is used, and for each process, there is a different way of working. Document creation during that process is difficult, if not impossible. Proper documentation is the key to standard applications (in accordance with Total Process Management) and quality. There are no differences between business process and document flow charts. Because analyzing the business processes unveils hidden document flow. We require a proof of the business process, i. e. a "Document Flow Chart". While the company works the document flow-charts, it should expand the project within all its departments. There are 6 stages of creating document flow-charts : - Business process are defined and flow-charted. - Flow-charts are described accurately. - Documentation is reviewed. - TQM, TPM members and process owners are named. - Enterprise-wide mission is documented. - Process boundaries are defined. The company will integrate its business process over the document flow charts, enabling the Total Process Management at greater levels of efficiency. It should create additional new business processes and should update its document flowcharts. As a result of changes in the structure of companies, the document flow charts should be adapted to the new business or be updated accordingly. Organizations should meet the international standards while producing, inspectig and arranging their documents. As business conditions and organizations change, the decisionmaker should have all critical business process documented. Changing structure and work-processes in a company hinders the management and the communication within its departments and so the funtions of that company. The problems due to poor documentation can be solved through the "Document Inspection and Organization Project. " The companies need to establish their standards concerning their international documentations and then form the procedures about creaing documents...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{manufacturing}} techniques and materials {{have led to}} an increase in the demand for reliable and robust inspection techniques to maintain safety critical features. The application of modelling methods to develop and evaluate inspections is becoming an essential tool for the NDE community. Current analytical methods are inadequate for simulation of arbitrary components and heterogeneous materials, such as anisotropic welds or composite structures. Finite element analysis software (FEA), such as PZFlex, can provide the ability to simulate the <b>inspection</b> of these <b>arrangements,</b> providing the ability to economically prototype and evaluate improved NDE methods. FEA is often seen as computationally expensive for ultrasound problems however, advances in computing power have made it a more viable tool. This paper aims to illustrate the capability of appropriate FEA to produce accurate simulations of ultrasonic array inspections – minimizing the requirement for expensive test-piece fabrication. Validation is afforded via corroboration of the FE derived and experimentally generated data sets for a test-block comprising 1 D and 2 D defects. The modelling approach is extended to consider the more troublesome aspects of heterogeneous materials where defect dimensions can be of the same length scale as the grain structure. The model is used to facilitate the implementation of new ultrasonic array inspection methods for such materials. This is exemplified by considering the simulation of ultrasonic NDE in a weld structure in order to assess new approaches to imaging such structures...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of Ikebana is the meditation within the therapeutic process of arranging. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} know the proper etiquette required for an effective experience. The class has many rules enforced to help everything come into focus and quiet the room where Ikebana is taking place. The significance of this etiquette is to show respect toward the sensei and to avoid disrupting other deshi. The sensei will guide the class to start after meditation; and at this time, participants are obligated to stop conversing and sit.The sensei is the teacher and head of the class and it is important to express respect to him or her. The sensei decides by need rather than speed; therefore, an arrangement is not finished until the sensei approves the piece. The sensei can readjust and dismantle an arrangement to fit the lesson. Participants must not express grievances in the classroom, as to avoid offending the sensei. Additionally, participants should record notes of the critique.Students are not allowed to critique others, talk during the arrangement process, or stand and walk around the room. Participants must follow the sensei after each <b>arrangement</b> <b>inspection.</b> If there are questions, students must raise a hand, though {{it is not uncommon for}} only an assistant to have permission to interrupt the sensei.

60|$|She {{was giving}} the study {{the very best}} of her attention. After she had lapsed in some other part of the house from the {{standards}} of rigid economy she had set up, she would as it were restore the balance by adding something to the gracefully dignified arrangement of this den he was to use. And the brass rod of the Bokhara hanging that was to do instead of curtains released her mind somehow to the purchase of certain old candlesticks she had hitherto resisted. They were to stand, bored to carry candle electric lights, on either corner of the low bookcase that faced the window. They were very heavy, very shapely candlesticks, and they cost thirty-five shillings. They looked remarkably well when they were put up, except that a sort of hollowness appeared between them and clamoured for a delightful old brass-footed workbox she had seen in a shop in Baker Street. Enquiry confirmed her quick impression that this was a genuine piece (of quite exceptional genuineness) and that the price--they asked five pounds ten and came down to five guineas--was in accordance with this. It was a little difficult (in spite of the silent hunger between the candlesticks) to reconcile this particular article with her dominating idea of an austerely restrained expenditure, until she hit upon the device of calling it a hors d'oeuvre, and regarding it not as furniture but as a present from herself to Trafford that happened to fall in very agreeably with the process of house furnishing. She decided she would some day economise its cost out of her dress allowance. The bookcase on which it stood was a happy discovery in Kensington, just five feet high, and with beautiful oval glass fronts, and its capacity was supplemented and any excess in its price at least morally compensated by a very tall, narrow, distinguished-looking set of open shelves that had been made for some special corner in another house, and which anyhow were really and truly dirt cheap. The desk combined grace and good proportions to an admirable extent, the fender of pierced brass {{looked as if it had}} always lived in immediate contact with the shapely old white marble fireplace, and the two arm-chairs were marvels of dignified comfort. By the fireplace were a banner-shaped needlework firescreen, a white sheepskin hearthrug, a little patch and powder table adapted to carry books, and a green-shaded lamp, grouped in a common inaudible demand for a reader in slippers. Trafford, when at last the apartment was ready for his <b>inspection,</b> surveyed these <b>arrangements</b> with a kind of dazzled admiration.|$|R
