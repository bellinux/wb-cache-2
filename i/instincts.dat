In The Ego and the Id (1923) he would develop his argument to state that [...] "the death <b>instinct</b> would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an <b>instinct</b> of destruction directed against the external world". The following year he would spell out more clearly that the [...] "libido has the task of making the destroying <b>instinct</b> innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that <b>instinct</b> {{to a great extent}} outwards [...] The <b>instinct</b> is then called the destructive <b>instinct,</b> the <b>instinct</b> for mastery, or the will to power", a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.|$|R

40|$|Improving N use {{efficiency}} of applied N by corn (Zea mays L.), {{in order to}} minimize N losses from agricultural fields, is of concern to both producers and environmentalists. Use of nitrification inhibitors is thought to slow the conversion of applied NH 4 to NO 3, which would reduce N losses from the soil while increasing corn plant N uptake. This thesis includes two, small plot field studies designed to evaluate the effect <b>Instinct</b> (Dow AgroSciences, Indianapolis, IN) nitrification inhibitor had on corn production. The first study evaluated the effect of <b>Instinct</b> spring preplant applied with urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution on corn production, and optimum N rate across six N rates and two application methods. The second study evaluated the effect liquid swine (Sus scrofa) manure (LSM) applied with <b>Instinct</b> at, two rates, and without <b>Instinct</b> had on corn production at two application times in the fall. A comparison was also made in the second study with fall applied anhydrous ammonia (AA) without a nitrification inhibitor. At low to recommended N rates, early corn growth plant height, mid-vegetative (V 10) canopy normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), stalk lodging potential, and grain yield either had no response, or a negative response, to <b>Instinct</b> applied with spring preplant UAN solution. Above normal precipitation during one year of the study provided an opportunity for <b>Instinct</b> to improve N use efficiency by reducing the economic optimum N rate (EONR) and improving grain yield. Use of <b>Instinct</b> actually increased the EONR by 32 kg N ha- 1 across the three year study. Improved spring inorganic-N and corn grain yield was found when <b>Instinct</b> was fall applied with LSM. Liquid swine manure with the low <b>Instinct</b> rate had significantly higher corn grain yields than LSM with the high <b>Instinct</b> rate and LSM without <b>Instinct,</b> while no difference was found between LSM with the high <b>Instinct</b> rate and LSM without <b>Instinct.</b> Fall applied AA typically had higher NH 4 -N concentrations within the injected N band, lower NO 3 -N concentrations in the fall and spring, and higher grain yield than fall applied LSM without <b>Instinct,</b> regardless of application timing. With the inclusion of <b>Instinct</b> with fall applied LSM, grain yields were still not comparable to fall applied AA. The studies in this thesis show that use of <b>Instinct</b> nitrification inhibitor with applied N does not guarantee a positive corn response. Inclusion of <b>Instinct</b> with spring preplant UAN solution would not be considered a suitable N management practice for improving corn N use efficiency. If LSM is to be applied in the fall, <b>Instinct</b> with fall applied LSM would be a suitable N management practice for improving corn N use efficiency and potentially decreasing environmentally detrimental N losses. However, deciding to apply AA, instead of LSM, in the fall would be a better N management decision...|$|R
