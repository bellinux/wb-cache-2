25|$|The American Quarter Horse, or Quarter Horse, is an American {{breed of}} horse that excels at sprinting short distances.

25|$|Fifteen {{years after}} he had arrived in Pittsburgh, Father Hehir became {{president}} of the Pittsburgh Catholic College, succeeding Father John Murphy on August 20, 1899.

25|$|In the United States, {{containerization}} {{and other}} advances in shipping were impeded by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), {{which was created}} in 1887 to keep railroads from using monopolist pricing and rate discrimination but fell victim to regulatory capture.

The fully integrated systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> became possible only after the ICC's regulatory oversight was cut back (and abolished in 1995); trucking and rail were deregulated in the 1970s and maritime rates were deregulated in 1984.|$|E

These were the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in 1954 and Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment from 1965 to 1969. Both test reactors used liquid fluoride fuel salts. The MSRE notably demonstrated fueling with U-233 and U-235 during separate test runs.

25|$|The Escarpment was {{the first}} area of the Catskills to attract the {{interest}} of European settlers.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> {{there are}} two major {{national}} sanctioning bodies for BMX racing. One is the National Bicycle League (NBL), a nonprofit organization started in 1974 by George Edward Esser (September 17, 1925 â€“ August 31, 2006). It was originally based in Pompano Beach, Florida, in the US, but now its headquarters is located in Hilliard, Ohio. George Esser was exposed to BMX by his son Greg Esser, who was famous within the sport and one of the sport's earliest superstars and first professionals. Like Ernie Alexander and Scot Breithaupt before him, he was a promoter who created the NBL as the BMX auxiliary to the National Motorcycle League (NML), now-defunct, when he became dissatisfied with how the races were run.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the Roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s, the term liberalism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism. In Western Europe, however, the expanded welfare states created after the Second World War were created by socialist or social democratic parties such as the British Labour Party rather than liberal parties. As a result, many liberal parties in Western Europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism, the Free Democratic Party in Germany being one example. The Liberal Democrats in the UK have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party. In many countries liberalism or neoliberalism is used to describe what Americans call fiscal conservatism.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Canadian lynx, {{which they}} resemble, bobcats {{elsewhere}} have been highly adaptable to human-caused changes in environmental conditions; some biologists {{believe that there}} are more bobcats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today</b> than in colonial times. Yellowstone has many rock outcrops, canyons bordered by rock ledges, conifer forests, and semi-open areas that seem to offer conditions favorable for bobcatsâ€”adequate shelter, a variety of rodents, rabbits, hares, birds, and other small animals as well as seasonal carrion, for food. Carrion is seldom used if live prey is available. Studies elsewhere have shown that bobcats also may kill both young and adult antelope and deer; they stalk bedded adults and may be carried long distances while biting their prey in the neck. Bobcats live an average lifespan of about 7 years.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today,</b> {{the federal}} courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the {{substantive}} distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality. This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless {{a temporary restraining order}} (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like Employee Retirement Income Security Act specifically authorize only equitable relief, which forces US courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.|$|E
25|$|Agricultureâ€™s role in {{developed}} countries has drastically {{changed in the last}} century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from {{a small portion of the}} existing farms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>today.</b> This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigerationâ€™s use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.|$|E
