5|$|At the {{direction}} of Starfleet, Enterprise makes a <b>detour</b> to a planet passing between two gas giants, in order to observe the gravitational forces and subsequent volcanic activity. Their new course takes the ship close to that of E.C.S. Horizon, the cargo vessel where Ensign Mayweather grew up. He then requests permission for a further <b>detour</b> to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years. Captain Archer readily agrees, but bad news arrives when Mayweather learns that his father died some six weeks earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Henry Bridge, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge (which carries I-470), and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge {{were all}} closed in January 2005, {{stopping}} any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia {{for a few}} days because barges broke loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River. The Wheeling Tunnel was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to <b>detour.</b> The two <b>detour</b> routes were city streets in downtown Wheeling and the I-470 loop.|$|E
5|$|The app now helps users {{find the}} nearest gas station, {{fast-food}} restaurant or coffee shop, by swiping {{up from the}} bottom of the screen. Maps also estimates how long the <b>detour</b> will take.|$|E

30|$|According to [20], the {{shortest}} path from any node to an anchor, having a small average hop progress, is {{judged to be}} <b>detoured.</b> However, the judgement may be wrong since the small average hop progress of the anchor only indicates that the anchor has <b>detoured</b> paths to other anchors [11]. In fact, the <b>detoured</b> path detection problem can be readily solved if the expected hop count of the direct path between nodes is given; {{the shortest}} path between nodes is considered <b>detoured</b> if the hop count of the shortest path {{is larger than the}} expected hop count. Unfortunately, the expected hop count of the direct path between any node pair is unidentifiable. Besides, nodes are unable to estimate their expected hop count due to lack of information on their direct path (e.g., the Euclidean distance). Therefore, the <b>detoured</b> path detection problem for an anchor-to-normal node pair cannot be solved by itself.|$|R
30|$|This section {{presents}} a multihop range-free localization algorithm that estimates {{the distance between}} an anchor and a normal node by taking into account how much their shortest path is <b>detoured</b> from their direct path. Before introducing the proposed algorithm, we address the <b>detoured</b> path detection problem.|$|R
5|$|The {{section of}} US-59 between I-40 and SH-9 was {{pressed into service}} as a <b>detour</b> for {{eastbound}} I-40 traffic {{after the collapse of}} its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a <b>detour</b> to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another <b>detour,</b> to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|After the I-40 bridge disaster, {{parts of}} State Highway 9 in eastern Oklahoma {{served as an}} {{emergency}} <b>detour</b> for eastbound I-40 traffic. All eastbound traffic was routed along the section of SH-9 between SH-2 in Whitefield and US-59. In addition, the section of SH-9 between US-59 and the Arkansas state line were used for eastbound traffic for commercial trucks.|$|E

5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline. Several Emergency <b>Detour</b> Routes {{have been established}} further inland to guide drivers around such closures. Care should be taken during the winter months, as these storms can progress rapidly and unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|In August 1835 Etty spent a brief {{holiday in}} Shropshire, where he {{delivered}} Venus and Her Satellites to Owen. While en route back {{he made a}} <b>detour</b> to Manchester to visit an art exhibition; while there he made the acquaintance of wealthy cotton merchant Daniel Grant.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the substantial historical art collection held by the library gallery the collection consists of works by local artists. One Oregon resident has donated artwork from the annual Grand <b>Detour</b> Art Show regularly. Other area residents have donated pieces as well. In all, the library holds about 30 contemporary works by local artists.|$|E

5|$|The scenery is {{now less}} wild, the cliffs less high. Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck but the path heads {{straight}} past to Pentire Head then swings eastwards again into Polzeath.

5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand <b>Detour</b> and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a <b>detour</b> that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E

5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} {{a balloon}} in Washington with hopes of providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road.

Over the next few days, he repeatedly ascended in the balloon in order to make maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Lt. Milton R. Rubb and his {{electronics}} technician team {{returned the}} fathometer to operational status, and the Chief Engineer Donald D. Fears, Reactor Officer Lt. Cmdr. Robert P. McDonald, and Tritons engineering crew repaired the malfunctioning reactor. Since Poole's symptoms were intermittent, Triton continued south, {{although there was}} a <b>detour</b> to the Golfo Nuevo region when the ship investigated an unknown sonar contact. Contemporary news accounts reported the Argentine Navy had been encountering numerous unknown submarine contacts in the Golfo Nuevo during early 1960, but Tritons contact {{turned out to be a}} school of fish.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, M-154 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT).

No section of M-154 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Like M-154, {{there are two other}} highways located on islands in the state, M-134 connects by ferry across the <b>DeTour</b> Passage to Drummond Island, and M-185 is located on Mackinac Island.|$|E

5|$|Owing to {{its large}} {{physical}} size and extensive armament, Fort Runyon {{was intended to}} be the primary fort defending the Long Bridge. Fort Jackson, located {{at the southern end of}} the bridge, received four cannon and was intended as a guard post for soldiers inspecting civilian traffic crossing the bridge and to <b>detour</b> any Confederate saboteurs that might attempt to destroy the bridge. To man the fort's four guns, 60 artillerymen were assigned, bringing the total garrison to 200 men.|$|E
