5|$|On 8 July 1967, B-52D AF Ser. No. 56-0601, overran {{the runway}} due to loss of brakes during an {{emergency}} landing at Da Nang Air Base, Vietnam {{with the loss of}} five of her six crew. The aircraft had suffered an electrical malfunction that led to the <b>flameout</b> of two engines.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1982, B-52G 57-6482, {{assigned}} to 328th BS, 93rd BW, Castle AFB, California, was {{participating in a}} Minimum Interval Take-Off (MITO; 12 seconds between each aircraft on takeoff) from Mather AFB, CA. The incident aircraft was in the number two position of a three-ship group. The B-52G was equipped with water injection to give additional thrust for take-off, but the lead aircraft was not equipped with this system. After takeoff the aircraft began to rapidly overtake the lead, so the pilot retarded the throttles rapidly, causing <b>flameout</b> of four engines. The aircraft then stalled and crashed. Nine crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double <b>flameout</b> occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.|$|E

50|$|Being a simulation, F-16 Multirole Fighter is {{reasonably}} accurate, especially {{when compared to}} most console arcade-style games such as Namco's Ace Combat series and Konami's Airforce Delta series. Features such as limited ammunition quantity (important to consider when playing through campaigns) fuel levels, and that many flight characteristics come into play; things like engine <b>flameouts,</b> flatspins, red and blackouts (affected by the g-forces) so the player must quickly learn to compensate.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had {{to ditch}} {{in a river}} because of hail-induced engine <b>flameouts,</b> killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual <b>flameouts</b> due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve {{the way in which}} the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|R
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to <b>flameout</b> or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine <b>flameout</b> RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
25|$|The A-10 engines were {{initially}} susceptible to <b>flameout</b> when subjected to gases {{generated in the}} firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, {{the smoke from the}} gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is certainly capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired the igniters come on to reduce the possibility of a <b>flameout.</b>|$|E
50|$|The few 234Bs entered {{service in}} autumn and {{impressed}} their pilots. They were fairly fast and completely aerobatic. The long takeoff runs led to several accidents; {{a search for}} a solution led to improved training as well as the use of twin HWK-built, jettisonable liquid fueled monopropellant Starthilfe pioneering RATO units, one mounted under each outer wing. The Jumo 004 engines were always the real problem; they suffered constant <b>flameouts</b> and required overhaul or replacement after about 10 hours of operation.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1986 film Top Gun, Lieutenant Pete [...] "Maverick" [...] Mitchell, {{played by}} Tom Cruise, suffers two <b>flameouts</b> caused by {{passing through the}} jetwash of another aircraft, piloted by fellow aviator Tom [...] "Ice Man" [...] Kazansky (played by Val Kilmer). As a result, he is put into an {{unrecoverable}} spin and is forced to eject killing his RIO Nick [...] "Goose" [...] Bradshaw. In a subsequent incident, he is caught in an enemy fighter's jetwash, but manages to recover safely.|$|R
500|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 ( [...] , USAF/DoD designation: Type 1, NATO {{reporting}} name: Fargo) was {{the first}} turbojet fighter developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich {{in the years immediately}} after World War II. It used reverse-engineered German BMW 003 engines. Categorized as a first-generation jet fighter, it was moderately successful, but suffered from persistent problems with engine <b>flameouts</b> when firing its guns at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion. A number of different armament configurations were tested, but nothing solved the problem. Several different engines were evaluated, but none were flown as the prototype of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 promised superior performance.|$|R
25|$|On 15 August 2017, after “high {{vibration}} {{and high}} inter-turbine temperature readings”, the second prototype's right GE Passport had an in-flight <b>flameout</b> at FL410 and the aircraft {{went back in}} Wichita Airport 156nm (290km) away for a single engine landing.|$|E
25|$|In September 1954, 813 {{embarked}} {{with their}} Wyverns on HMS Albion for carrier-based {{service in the}} Mediterranean. The Wyvern soon showed a worrying habit for <b>flameout</b> on catapult launch; the high G forces resulting in fuel starvation. A number of aircraft were lost off Albion's bows and Lt. B. D. Macfarlane made history on 13 October 1954 when he successfully ejected from under water after his aircraft had ditched on launch and been cut in two by the carrier. 813 {{did not return to}} Albion until March 1955 when the problems had been resolved.|$|E
25|$|Before the crash, the {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} two accidents. On 14 January 2002, {{the aircraft}} was flying from Frankfurt to Novosibirsk when {{it had to be}} diverted to Omsk due to poor weather at the destination. On approach, pilots reported fuel supply problems, followed by a <b>flameout</b> of both engines. The aircraft glided and landed successfully, but overran the runway and collided with the lights after the runway threshold. There were no injuries. The aircraft was repaired and continued service. From August 2006 the aircraft was leased to various Russian airlines – Red Wings Airlines, Aviastar-TU, Interavia Airlines and then Aviastar-TU again.|$|E
50|$|Such starts {{were very}} unsafe, with drivers {{possibly}} rushing {{the process of}} fastening their safety equipment. Britain's RAC prohibited {{the use of the}} Le Mans start in English racing in late summer 1962 precisely for this reason. As a result, they are no longer used in any motorsport except for endurance motorcycle racing, such as the Coke Zero Suzuka 8 Hours and the 24 Heures Moto, bicycle endurance races, Kinetic Sculpture Races and due to their vulnerability to <b>flameouts,</b> in nitro powered radio-controlled racing, except they are held above ground until start by its mechanics whilst the drivers remain in their stand.|$|R
50|$|In-flight restarts are {{designated}} as either windmill or starter-assisted, depending {{where in the}} flight envelope the restart is attempted. The re-light envelope occupies {{the lower part of}} the flight envelope below about 30,000 ft (28,000 ft in the case of a Boeing 747, which experienced <b>flameouts</b> at 37,000 ft). When an appropriate initial altitude and forward speed are available, the mass airflow through the compressor blades can maintain sufficient rotational velocity for enough time to permit restart. If the aircraft's operating conditions are not sufficient for a windmill start, the engine's starter motor must be operated to increase the turbine velocity to the minimum required speed.|$|R
25|$|Supersonic speeds also {{threatened}} inlet stability; the inlet's central {{shock cone}} {{served as a}} compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip; known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned {{just in front of}} the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock would become supercritical, and supersonic airflow would enter the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in surges or compressor stalls, these could cause <b>flameouts</b> or damage.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was rebuilt, and resumed flight testing on 2 February 1965. On 8 September 1965, the aircraft suffered another fatal crash, once again {{while in a}} low altitude hover. The {{aircraft was}} being evaluated by United States Air Force Major P. E. Neale, {{as part of a}} Franco-American information exchange on VTOL programmes. Major Neale made an unsuccessful ejection outside the ejection seat's escape envelope. The findings of the accident investigation were never made public. It was speculated that hydraulic control difficulties coupled with excessive use of the lift engines resulted in fuel starvation and the <b>flameout</b> of all nine engines. Once again, the damage was not irreparable, but this time the aircraft was not rebuilt, as flight development of the Mirage IIIV prototype was already underway.|$|E
25|$|By January 1956, the U-2 so {{impressed}} the USAF that {{it decided to}} obtain its own aircraft. The USAF purchased a total of 31 U-2s through the CIA; the transaction's code name, Project Dragon Lady, was {{the origin of the}} aircraft's nickname. Meanwhile, U-2s conducted eight overflights of the U.S. in April 1956, convincing project overseers that the aircraft was ready for deployment. As often happens with new aircraft designs, there were several operational accidents. One occurred during these test flights, when a U-2 suffered a <b>flameout</b> over Tennessee; the pilot calculated that he could reach New Mexico. Every air base in the continental U.S. had sealed orders on what to do if a U-2 landed. The commander of Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, New Mexico was told to open his orders, prepare for the arrival of an unusual aircraft making a deadstick landing, and get it inside a hangar as soon as possible. The U-2 successfully landed after gliding for more than , and its strange, glider-like appearance and the space-suited pilot startled the base commander and other witnesses.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' anti-ice vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine anti-ice 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine <b>flameout.</b>|$|E

25|$|Plans {{were first}} drawn up in April 1939, and the {{original}} design {{was very different from}} the aircraft that eventually entered service, with wing root-mounted engines, rather than podded ones, when submitted in June 1939. The progression of the original design was delayed greatly by technical issues involving the new jet engine. Because the engines were slow to arrive, Messerschmitt moved the engines from the wing roots to underwing pods, allowing them to be changed more readily if needed; this {{would turn out to be}} important, both for availability and maintenance. Since the BMW 003 jets proved heavier than anticipated, the wing was swept slightly, by 18.5°, to accommodate a change in the center of gravity. Funding for the jet engine program was also initially lacking as many high-ranking officials thought the war could easily be won with conventional aircraft. Among those were Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, who cut the engine development program to just 35 engineers in February 1940 (the month before the first wooden mock-up was completed); Willy Messerschmitt, who desired to maintain mass production of the piston-powered, 1935-origin Bf 109 and the projected Me 209; and Major General Adolf Galland, who had initially supported Messerschmitt through the early development years, flying the Me 262 himself on 22 April 1943. By that time, problems with engine development had slowed production of the aircraft considerably. One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enough to endure the high temperatures involved, a problem that by the end of the war had not been adequately resolved. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines, after a November 1941 flight (with BMW 003s) ended in a double <b>flameout.</b>|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event [...] "best fit the available evidence" [...] for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track, likely on autopilot. No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory. If no control inputs were made following <b>flameout</b> and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive and entered the ocean within [...] of the <b>flameout</b> and disengagement of autopilot. The analysis of the flaperon showed that the landing flaps were not extended, supporting the spiral dive at high speed.|$|E
500|$|On 25 October 1973, the Akigssek ("Grouse"), an Air Greenland S-61N (registration OY-HAI), crashed about [...] {{south of}} Nuuk, {{resulting}} {{in the loss of}} 15 lives. It was en route to Paamiut from Nuuk. The same helicopter had had an emergency landing on the Kangerlussuaq fjord 2 years earlier, due to a double <b>flameout</b> on both engines because of ice in its intake.|$|E
50|$|Project Run In {{completed}} {{operational tests}} in November 1954 {{and found the}} aircraft to be to USAF satisfaction and considerably better than the F-84G. However, ongoing engine failures resulted in the entire fleet being grounded in early 1955. Also, the J65 engine continued to suffer from <b>flameouts</b> when flying through heavy rain or snow. As {{the result of the}} problems, the active duty phaseout began almost as soon as the F-84F entered service in 1954, and was completed by 1958. Increased tensions in Germany associated with construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 resulted in reactivation of the F-84F fleet. In 1962, the fleet was grounded due to the corrosion of control rods. A total of 1,800 man hours were expended to bring each aircraft to full operational capacity. Stress corrosion eventually forced the retirement of ANG F-84Fs in 1971.|$|R
50|$|The He 162 {{first saw}} combat in mid-April 1945. On 19 April, Feldwebel Günther Kirchner shot down a Royal Air Force fighter, and {{although}} the victory was credited to a flak unit, the British pilot confirmed during interrogation {{that he had been}} downed by an He 162. The Heinkel and its pilot were lost as well, shot down by an RAF Hawker Tempest while on approach to land, a point at which Allied pilots targeted German jets. Though still in training, I./JG 1 had begun scored kills in mid-April, but had also lost 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. Ten of the aircraft were operational losses, caused by <b>flameouts</b> and sporadic structural failures. Only two of the 13 aircraft were actually shot down. The He 162's 30-minute fuel capacity also caused problems, as at least two of JG 1's pilots were killed attempting emergency deadstick landings after exhausting their fuel.|$|R
25|$|Single- and double-engine engine <b>flameouts</b> {{plagued the}} program between June 1965 and July 1967, when fuel control {{problems}} were finally corrected. No aircraft were destroyed but one {{was out of}} service for six months after it crash-landed in a field near Albuquerque. By May 1968 stress cracks began appearing in the wing spars and ribs of all the RB-57Fs outboard of the main engines and numerous groundings forced the cancellation of many operational missions. Some aircraft were sent to General Dynamics for repairs but under Big Safari dicta the cost of repairing all of the aircraft was excessive and resulted in five being placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB in 1972 and another three in 1973. The remaining aircraft were retired in 1974. Each had accumulated on average a total of 3,000 hours of airframe life. The 58th WRS, the last squadron in the Air Force to use the WB-57F, was inactivated on 1 July 1974.|$|R
500|$|Knowing the {{location}} at the seventh handshake, investigators then {{needed to determine}} an appropriate width of the search area from the seventh arc. The seventh handshake was a 'log-on request' initiated by the aircraft and {{is believed to be}} the result of the SDU starting after power failure, resulting from fuel exhaustion and following the deployment of the ram air turbine and restart of the auxiliary power unit. The log-on request would have occurred 3 minutes and 40 seconds after fuel exhaustion—commonly known as <b>flameout</b> in aviation—of the second engine (<b>flameout</b> of both engines would not have occurred simultaneously), at which point the autopilot would have disengaged. The BFO value of this handshake indicates the aircraft may have been descending and the aircraft was travelling northeast to southwest. The ATSB has determined that an unresponsive crew/hypoxia event [...] "appeared to best fit the available evidence" [...] for the period of flight that Flight 370 tracked south over the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|Early {{on in the}} Hunter's {{service the}} Avon engines proved to have poor surge margins, and worryingly {{suffered}} compressor stalls when the cannon were fired, sometimes resulting in flameouts. The practise of [...] "fuel dipping", reducing fuel flow to the engine when the cannon were fired, was a satisfactory solution. Although the Sapphire did not suffer from the <b>flameout</b> problems of the Avon and had better fuel economy, Sapphire-powered Hunters suffered many engine failures. The RAF elected to persevere with the Avon to simplify supply and maintenance, since the Canberra bomber used the same engine.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} of aircraft systems, particularly the electrical system and autopilot, are ongoing. Boeing and Malaysia Airlines have conducted numerous end-of-flight scenarios in their Boeing 777 simulators. The scenarios involve <b>flameout</b> in one engine {{before the other}} without any input from the cockpit. This scenario results in the aircraft entering a spiraling low-bank turn with the aircraft entering the water a relatively short distance from the last engine <b>flameout.</b> If control inputs were made (i.e. the plane was {{under the control of}} a pilot) and depending on the initial altitude, {{it is possible that the}} aircraft could glide over [...] However, investigators believe Flight 370 was most likely uncontrolled at this point. The ATSB cites a previous study conducted for the BEA, which determined that in cases of an upset followed by loss of control all impact points were within [...] of the start of the emergency, and in most cases within [...] Based on this, the ATSB chose a [...] width— to the west and [...] to the east of the arc—for the underwater search in June 2014. While keeping the 50 nmi width for the priority search area, the ATSB determined that the aircraft most likely entered the ocean close to the seventh arc and the underwater search would be conducted from the seventh arc and progress outwards.|$|E
50|$|All the {{aircraft}} {{it was to}} power were either canceled or redesigned to use other engines, notably the J57 and the J71. The F4D Skyray had been designed to accept larger engines in case the J40 did not work out, and was eventually powered by the Pratt & Whitney J57. But no other engine could simply be fitted into the old Demons, as both the wings and fuselage {{would have to be}} redesigned and enlarged. The best alternative {{turned out to be the}} Allison J71 engine which was also used in the Douglas B-66 Destroyer. Subsequent F3Hs with this engine were designated the F3H-2N. In service, the J71 proved problematic, providing insufficient power for an aircraft of the Demon's size. The engine also suffered from frequent <b>flameouts</b> and compressor stalls. The first Demon with a J71 flew in October 1954. Another significant problem was the reliability of the ejection seats: initial versions were found to be unreliable and were eventually replaced with Martin-Baker ejection seats that were becoming the standard Navy seat of choice due to their higher performance at low altitude and better reliability.|$|R
40|$|As {{technologies}} advance, {{their growing}} complexity makes them harder to maintain. Detection methods for isolating and identifying impending problems {{are needed to}} balance this complexity. Through comparison of signal pairs from onboard sensors, the Beacon-based Exception Analysis For Multimissions (BEAM) algorithm can identify and help classify deviations in system operation from a data-trained statistical model. The goal of this task is to mature BEAM and validate its performance on a flying test bed. A series of F- 18 flight demonstrations with BEAM monitoring engine parameters in real time was used to demonstrate in-the-field readiness. Captured F- 18 and simulated F- 18 engine data were used in model creation and training. The algorithm was then ported to the embedded system with a data buffering, file writing, and data-time-stamp monitoring shell to reduce the impact of embedded system faults on BEAM'S ability to correctly identify engine faults. Embedded system testing identified hardware related restrictions and contributed to iterative improvements in the code's runtime performance. The system was flown with forced engine <b>flameouts</b> and other pilot induced faults to simulate operation out of the norm. Successful detection of these faults, confirmed through post-flight data analysis, helped BEAM achieve TRL 6...|$|R
500|$|The {{fourth and}} fifth {{aircraft}} of the parade batch were used in flight tests to eliminate the engine <b>flameout</b> problem from late 1947 through early 1948. They were fitted with a prominent rectangular hollow vane on {{the barrel of the}} N-37 cannon that was nicknamed the [...] "butterfly" [...] (bahbochka). This allowed all three cannon to be fired simultaneously at altitudes up to , but the fin disintegrated after only 813 shots, which could be very dangerous if the debris from the fin was ingested by the engines. An additional problem was that the fin hampered the directional stability of the aircraft and caused it to yaw after 3–5 shots. Another attempt to fix the problem was made in the I-302 (izdeliye FP), a modification of a production aircraft, that moved the N-37 to the port side of the aircraft, but this was apparently not successful either. Other attempts to ameliorate the problem included fitting a muzzle brake on the N-37 as well as extending its barrel, but nothing worked.|$|E
