25|$|Mohenjo-daro had no {{series of}} city walls, but was {{fortified}} with guard towers {{to the west}} of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{military}} débâcle this provoked for the Dutch army did {{cause trouble}} for the De Witt regime. De Witt's brother Cornelis, who acted as deputy-in-the-field (a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> commissar) to the army's commander-in-chief John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen (a cousin twice-removed of the Prince of Orange, who however, was acceptable to the States Party) was implicated in the initial panicky retreat behind the IJssel, that left the eastern provinces unprotected. However, now the French intervened, thanks to De Witt's treaty of alliance of 1662. French forces helped stabilize the Dutch front, and when promised English subsidies failed to materialize, von Galen was forced to retreat ignominiously. He concluded a humiliating peace in early 1666.|$|E

There has been a sound reason for this as all members, once admitted, have full democratic rights and stand in basic equality to one another.

25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, Islam {{experienced}} a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> rehabilitation because right-of-center secular leaders perceived {{religion as a}} potential bulwark in their ideological struggle with left-of-center secular leaders. A small advocacy group that became extremely influential was the Hearth of Intellectuals (Aydınlar Ocağı), an organization that maintains that true Turkish culture is a synthesis of the Turks' pre-Islamic traditions and Islam. According to the Hearth, Islam not only constitutes an essential aspect of Turkish culture but is a force that can be regulated {{by the state to}} help socialize the people to be obedient citizens acquiescent to the overall secular order. After the 1980 military coup, many of the Hearth's proposals for restructuring schools, colleges, and state broadcasting were adopted. The result was a purge from these state institutions of more than 2,000 intellectuals perceived as espousing leftist ideas incompatible with the Hearth's vision of Turkey's national culture.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the links between three <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> dissatisfaction and four types <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation {{during the early stages}} of the economic crisis in 2008 - 2009. Since economic crisis exacerbates negative political attitudes and thereby strains the legitimacy <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> system, it is im-portant to examine how citizens convey their grievances to political decision makers during such crisis. Recent decades have witnessed changes in patterns <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation entailing that citizens abstain from traditional political participation in favor of non-institutionalized activities, but the implications for democracy are disputed since it is unclear what drives non-institutionalized participation. To ascertain what the changes mean for democracy during times of economic crisis, it is helpful to distinguish different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> dissatisfaction with diverse implications for democracy. The data comes from the fourth round of the European Social Survey and include a total of 47489 respondents in 25 European democracies. The results suggest that only some <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> dissatisfaction affect the pro-pensity for political participation while others lead to passivity. Additionally, political dissatisfaction is not necessarily a major driving force behind the popularity of non-institutionalized participation since satisfied citizens are also involved in these. <br /...|$|R

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Watership Down contains symbolism of several religions, or that the stories of El-ahrairah were meant to mimic some elements of real-world religion. When asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams stated that the story was [...] "nothing like that at all." [...] Adams said that the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship, however, [...] "they believed passionately in El-ahrairah". Adams explained that he meant the book to be, [...] "only a made-up story... in no sense an allegory or parable or any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls". Instead, he explained, the [...] "let-in" [...] religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and that these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often [...] "grim" [...] tales of the [...] "real story".|$|E

500|$|American public feeling towards Truman grew {{steadily}} warmer {{with the}} passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. ranked Truman among the [...] "near great" [...] presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians {{and members of the}} public. [...] Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in Vietnam and Watergate, and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career. In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking in the Nixon White House. This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences Truman had recounted to journalist Merle Miller beginning in 1961, with the agreement {{that they would not be}} published until after Truman's death.|$|E
500|$|Jefferson {{wrote that}} a number of authors exerted a general {{influence}} on the words of the Declaration. English political theorist John Locke is usually cited as one of the primary influences, a man whom Jefferson called one of [...] "the three greatest men that have ever lived". In 1922, historian Carl L. Becker wrote, [...] "Most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> gospel; and the Declaration, in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's second treatise on government." [...] The extent of Locke's influence on the American Revolution has been questioned by some subsequent scholars, however. Historian Ray Forrest Harvey argued in 1937 for the dominant influence of Swiss jurist Jean Jacques Burlamaqui, declaring that Jefferson and Locke were at [...] "two opposite poles" [...] in their political philosophy, as evidenced by Jefferson's use in the Declaration of Independence of the phrase [...] "pursuit of happiness" [...] instead of [...] "property". Other scholars emphasized the influence of republicanism rather than Locke's classical liberalism. Historian Garry Wills argued that Jefferson was influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment, particularly Francis Hutcheson, rather than Locke, an interpretation that has been strongly criticized.|$|E
500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he is not a political writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, Little Bee and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E
