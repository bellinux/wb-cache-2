2500|$|... (literally [...] "abolish Buddhism {{and destroy}} Shākyamuni") {{is a term}} that {{indicates}} a current of thought continuous in Japan's history which advocates the expulsion of Buddhism from Japan. More narrowly, it also indicates a particular historic movement and specific historic events based on that ideology which, during the Meiji Restoration, produced the destruction of Buddhist temples, images and texts, and the <b>forced</b> <b>return</b> to secular life of Buddhist monks.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{narrower}} sense, shinbutsu bunri {{refers to the}} policy of separating Shinto and Buddhism pursued by the new Meiji government with the [...] of 1868. This order triggered the haibutsu kishaku, a violent anti-Buddhist movement that caused the forcible closure of thousands of temples, the confiscation of their land, the <b>forced</b> <b>return</b> of many monks to lay life or their transformation into Shinto priests, {{and the destruction of}} numerous books, statues and other Buddhist artefacts. [...] Even bronze bells were melted down to make cannons. [...] However, the process of separation stalled by 1873, the government's intervention in support of the order was relaxed, and even today the separation is still only partially complete: many major Buddhist temples retain small shrines dedicated to tutelary Shinto kami, and Buddhist figures, such as the goddess Kannon, are revered in Shinto shrines. The policy failed in its short-term aims and was ultimately abandoned, but it was successful in the long term in creating a new religious status quo in [...] which Shinto and Buddhism are perceived as different and independent.|$|E
2500|$|Walnut {{arrived at}} Halifax on 13 December. The small ship {{was among the}} {{smallest}} to ever call at the Pier 21 immigration terminal, dwarfed by the giant four stacker RMS Aquitania which arrived at the same pier {{a few days later}} with 1,656 passengers. [...] Walnut presented Halifax immigration officials with a dilemma. The passengers aboard had arrived in Canada without permission or clearance, {{one of a series of}} small ships carrying Baltic refugees, nicknamed [...] "The Viking Ships", which suddenly arrived in Canada in the fall of 1948. Others included the ships Gladstone, Sarabande, Parnu, Ostervag, Capry, and Amanda. Walnut had the largest number of aboard and became the focus of public and official attention over the fate of the refugees. The Baltic refugees had tried to come to Canada through official channels but were frustrated by the long delay and barriers in Canada's immigration system which left them vulnerable to a <b>forced</b> <b>return</b> to the Soviet controlled Baltic republics. Walnuts passengers were detained, some at Halifax's Rockhead prison and others in the detention quarters at the Pier 21 immigration terminal.|$|E

This in turn had motivated him to maintain a [...] "controlling voice" [...] in the Philippines after the Philippine–American War ended in 1902 and would encourage him to send the Great White Fleet on its worldwide voyage in 1907. (Unfortunately, the visit of the fleet would inspire Japan to step up its building program still further.) Japan's 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War would usher its entrance as a world power and begin a rivalry with the United States over dominance in the Pacific. As Roosevelt would surmise during that conflict in a letter to British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice, [...] "The Japs interest me and I like them.
