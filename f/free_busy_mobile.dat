40|$|Abstract. Traditional group {{scheduling}} applications often treat users' availability as binary: <b>free</b> or <b>busy.</b> This is {{an unrealistic}} representation {{because not all}} times are equally <b>free</b> or <b>busy.</b> The inflexibility {{makes it difficult to}} find times with which everyone is truly satisfied. We present an online group scheduling approach by which users indicate four-tier preferences for meeting times on a calendar, which dynamically adjusts to provide instant feedback and suggests optimal meeting times for all participants. Our prototype is geared toward college students and the scheduling is done through a democratic and open negotiation process where everyone's preference is heard. Students who evaluated the prototype thought that the scheduling process was more efficient than the widely-used e-mail scheduling among college students, which is largely based on binary availability. ...|$|R

Following a student-centered approach this study investigates adult students’ subjective perceptions while using distance education systems based on a videoconferencing platform as Quality of Experience (QoE). Based on a literature review, sociological behavior and expectations, we have constructed a structural equation model (SEM) illustrating relations among different variables that can predict positive levels of adult students’ QoE, thus providing guidelines for proper development. We have tested the model using a survey of 198 primary education school teachers involved in a videoconferencing-based learning program for teacher enhancement. Results show a good fit to the model developed. The analysis showed that adult students’ QoE is directly influenced by appropriateness of teacher-student interaction and ease of participation, as well predicted by students’ motivation to attend similar trainings. Additionally, we found that variances in technical quality did not directly influence their QoE from the learning sessions...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{analysis}} for third generation mobile telecommunication systems should {{take into account}} a variety of services (e. g., voice, data, video) and ""environments"" (private, public outdoor, public indoor) {{as well as the}} user mobility behavior. The analytical traffic model presented in this paper incorporates all the above mentioned features. The model utilizes a set of simplifying assumptions regarding the distribution of certain random time intervals (e. g., call duration and ""cell residence time"") and the handover arrival process. The core of the model focuses on the estimation of the cell border crossing rate and the time it takes a <b>busy</b> <b>mobile</b> user to leave a cell area. This allows for the estimation of the handover rate and the call duration within a cell, which in turn, utilizing an iterative method, allows for the calculation of the offered traffic load per cell. The major advantages of the model are: (a) the simple closed form solutions, (b) its independence from the applied radio resource management scheme, and (c) its accuracy. The latter is validated via a simulation tool, which accommodates different cell-layout scenarios over a geographical area, representing a 'typical' city center, modeled as a Manhattan grid. © J. C.

40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio (CR) networks, {{the knowledge of}} primary user (PU) traffic {{plays a crucial role}} in designing the sensing slot duration and synchronization with PU traffic. However, the secondary user (SU) sensing unit usually does not have the knowledge of the exact time slot structure in the primary network. Moreover, {{it is also possible that}} the communication among PUs are not based on synchronous schemes at all. In this paper, the effect of unknown primary user (PU) traffic on the performance of multi-antenna spectrum sensing is evaluated under a flat fading channel. In contrast to the commonly used continuous time Markov model of the existing literature, a realistic and simple PU traffic model is proposed which is based only on the discrete time distribution of PU <b>free</b> and <b>busy</b> periods. Furthermore, in order to assess the effect of PU traffic on the detection performance, analytical expressions for the probability density functions of the decision statistic are derived considering Energy Detection (ED) test as spectrum sensing method. It is shown that the time varying PU traffic severely affects the spectrum sensing performance. Most importantly, our results show that the performance gain due to multiple antennas in the sensing unit is significantly reduced by the effect of PU traffic when the mean lengths of <b>free</b> and <b>busy</b> periods are of the same order of magnitude of the sensing slot...|$|R

40|$|Much {{research}} has been done regarding the use of hard-ware sensors in smartphones, leading to the emergence of mobile sensing systems such as activity recognition, local-ization, and proximity sensing [2]. Although hardware sen-sors provide informative contextual information, continuous sensing and inference could incur prohibitive energy costs. We argue that besides hardware sensors, there exist many virtual sensors on mobile phones that are continuously avail-able and inexpensive to query from the operating system and services. Examples include screen status, mobile app usage, app notifications, and responses to notifications.

40|$|Consider {{a single}} server retrial {{queueing}} {{system in which}} customers arrive in a Poisson process with arrival rate λ that which follows a Poisson process. Let k be the number of phases in the service station. The service time has Erlang k-type distribution with service rate kμ for each phase. Two types of vacation policies are discussed in this research paper that is Bernoulli type vacation and exhaustive type vacation. The vacation rate follows an exponential distribution with parameter α. We assume that the services in all phases are independent and identical and only one customer at a time is in the service mechanism. If the server is free {{at the time of}} a primary call arrival, the arriving call begins to be served in Phase 1 immediately by the server then progresses through the remaining phases and must complete the last phase and leave the system before the next customer enters the first phase. If the server is busy or on vacation, then the arriving customer goes to orbit and becomes a source of repeated calls. This pool of sources of repeated calls may be viewed as a sort of queue. Every such source produces a Poisson process of repeated calls with intensity σ. If an incoming repeated call finds the server free, it is served in the same manner and leaves the system after service, while the source which produced this repeated call disappears. Otherwise, the system state does not change. We assume that the access from orbit to the service facility is governed by the classical retrial policy. This model is solved by using Matrix geometric technique. Numerical study have been done for Analysis of Mean number of customers in the orbit (MNCO),Truncation level (OCUT), Probabilities of server <b>free,</b> <b>busy</b> and in vacation for various values of λ, μ,k, p, α and σ in elaborate manner and also various particular cases of this model have been discussed...|$|R
