50|$|Especially for bulk {{heterojunction}} solar cells, understanding {{charge carrier}} transport is vital {{in improving the}} efficiencies of organic photovoltaics. Currently, bulk heterojunction devices have imbalanced charge-carrier mobility, with the hole mobility being at least {{an order of magnitude}} lower than that of the electron mobility; this results in space charge build-up and a decrease in the fill factor and power conversation efficiency of a device. Due to having low mobility, efficient bulk heterojunction photovoltaics have to be designed with thin active layers to avoid recombination of the charge carriers, which is detrimental to absorption and scalability in processing. Simulations have demonstrated that in order to have an bulk heterojunction solar cell with a fill factor above 0.8 and <b>external</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> above 90%, there needs to be balanced charge carrier mobility to reduce a space charge effect, as well as an increase in charge carrier mobility and/or a decrease in the bimolecular recombination rate constant.|$|E

It can be used for solar cells characterisation in a light beam induced current (LBIC) experiment from which <b>external</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> (EQE) of a device can be mapped.

Tunable sources were recently used for the development of hyperspectral imaging for early detection of retinal diseases where a wide range of wavelength, a small bandwidth and outstanding isolation is crucial in order to achieve an efficient illumination of the entire retina.

50|$|Although {{there is}} {{significant}} insight as to how OPVs work, it is still difficult to relate the device’s functionality to local film structures. This difficulty {{may be attributed to}} the minimal current generation at a given point within OPVs. Through pc-AFM, OPV devices can be probed at nano-scale level and can help to increase our fundamental knowledge of mechanisms involved in OPVs at nano-scale level. pc-AFM is capable of gathering information such as the mapping of photocurrents, differences in film morphology, determination of donor-acceptor domains, current density-voltage plots, quantum efficiencies, and approximate charge carrier mobilities. One of the other notable characteristics of pc-AFM is its ability to provide concurrent information regarding the topological and photocurrent properties of the device at nano-scale. Using this concurrent sampling method, the sample handling is minimized and can provide more accurate results. In a study by Pingree et al., pc-AFM was used to measure how spatial deviations in the photocurrent generation developed with different processing techniques. The authors were able to compare these photocurrent variations to the duration of the annealing process. They have concluded that lengthening the annealing time allows for improved nano-scale phase separation as well as created a more ordered device. Actual times for the annealing process vary depending on the properties of the polymers used. The authors have shown that <b>external</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels reach a maximum at certain annealing times whereas while the electron and hole mobility’s do not show the corresponding trends. Therefore, while lengthening the annealing time can increase the photocurrents within the OPV, there is a practical limit to after which the benefits may not be substantial.|$|E
