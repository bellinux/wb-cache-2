5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} part of the far south includes the city of Punta Arenas, which, with about 125,000 inhabitants, is the southernmost city of any appreciable size in the world. It receives much less precipitation; its annual total is only 438.5 millimeters, or a little more than what Valdivia receives in the month of June alone. This precipitation is distributed more or less evenly throughout the year, with the two main summer months receiving a monthly average of 31 millimeters and the winter months 38.9 millimeters, some of it in the form of snow. Temperatures are colder than {{in the rest of the}} country. The summer months average 11.1°C, and the winter months average 2.5°C.

500|$|Prost's Jean Alesi {{was passed}} {{fit in the}} days leading up to the race. At the {{previous}} race, Alesi had suffered a serious crash which involved a collision with Sauber driver Pedro Diniz, although he escaped uninjured apart from abdominal pains and suffered from dizziness and vomiting. Prost had their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin ready to replace Alesi should the latter had suffered a relapse. Alesi said he felt ready to race again: [...] "It took a few days before I really started to recover, but now I sleep and <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> better".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E
500|$|Fox {{said that}} while filming her highly {{anticipated}} kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was [...] "extremely uncomfortable" [...] but that she herself was not. [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} people that I had to kiss", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E

500|$|On The Guardian film blog, Peter Bradshaw {{considered}} [...] "Vincent and the Doctor" [...] to be a [...] "terrifically clever, funny, likeable wildly surreal episode". He {{praised the}} [...] " [...] Curtis dialogue" [...] and the [...] "uproariously emotional {{ending of the}} sort only Richard Curtis could get away with". Dan Martin on the same paper's regular Doctor Who blog was more critical, writing that its [...] "main problem [...] that it doesn't <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> like a Doctor Who story" [...] and would have worked better if [...] "the middle section with the monster had been stripped out". He also criticised the script for its [...] "lashings of weapons-grade sentimentality" [...] and for [...] "throwing up possibilities that weren't followed up" [...] and the monster as an [...] "afterthought ...no tangible threat". However, he did praise Curran's [...] "great performance" [...] along with the episode's treatment of depression, concluding like Wollaston that he enjoyed the episode despite his misgivings.|$|E
500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. [...] On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to <b>feel</b> <b>much</b> of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see how he did it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E
