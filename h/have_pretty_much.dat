Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now <b>have</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E

[...] Tom Young of BBC admitted that [...] "3 Spoons of Suga" [...] was [...] "ridiculously titled", yet [...] "ridiculously catchy". According to him, the song contains [...] "simple rocky edge" [...] that gives the [...] "rich textured voices" [...] of Berrabah and Buchanan [...] "plenty of room in which to excel." [...] Victoria Segal of The Times wrote that the [...] "sticky disco of 3 Spoons of Suga should stop Mutya Buena's victory lap in its tracks". The Scotsmans editor felt that the song has a [...] "playful attitude" [...] which is missing {{from the rest of}} the album. Emily Mackay of Yahoo! Music suggested that it was one of the stronger tracks on the album, writing [...] "the check-me-the-f*ck-out glammy strut of '3 Spoons Of Suga' finds them [...] on stronger footing." [...] Paul Schultz The Trades regarded it as a [...] "ridiculously danceable Bananarama mimicry" [...] and [...] "stirring anthem".|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by the {{production}} on Wrapped in Red, Clarkson wanted all the tracks on Piece by Piece {{to sound like}} its own soundtrack, while also wanting every song to have potential as a single. Taking inspiration from the soundtracks of the feature films Cruel Intentions (1999) and Love Actually (2003), she remarked: [...] "I love soundtracks and I love how you can tell, 'Oh, this {{should be in a}} soundtrack!' You can picture the movie. I definitely wanted the orchestral elements going on and I definitely wanted the intense factor going on." [...] Clarkson illustrated the album as a concept record telling a single [...] "awesome" [...] story, using different pieces of her character, leading her to name the album Piece by Piece. Citing the aspects of heartbreak and personal struggle as well as peace and empowerment in its lyrical content, she described the record as an album within an uplifting and reflective environment. She recalled: [...] "I'm 32 years old, I <b>have</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> run the gauntlet of pretty much every emotion you could possibly go through — especially being 19 [...] and being thrust into the industry, and growing up really quickly." ...|$|E

[...] She then pointed out that this assault [...] "was one of the many battlefield exploits of African Americans during the Civil War. [...] Before the war ended, black troops had been involved in hundreds of skirmishes and engagements including thirty-five major battles."

2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been about the long con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will <b>have</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox.
