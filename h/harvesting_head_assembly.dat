40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of some {{laboratory}} and field tests aimed at assessing the acceleration levels transmitted to the hand-arm system by electric portable harvesters for olive. Four <b>harvesting</b> <b>heads,</b> different for shape and kinematic system, and five bars, different for diameter, length and material (aluminium and carbon fibre), were used in assembling eleven harvesters. The vibrations were measured in two points, next to the handgrips. The laboratory tests allowed {{the evaluation of the}} acceleration levels in standard controlled conditions, while the field tests allowed the assessing {{of the effects of the}} tree canopy with respect to the no load running. The laboratory tests showed that in reducing the vibration level plays a major role the kinematic system of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> and then the bar material. The classical flap-type harvester produced accelerations of around 20 m/s 2, while by using a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> with two parts in opposite movement, the accelerations were lowered to about 6 m/s 2. The use of carbon fibres for the bars, besides the reduction in weight, produced also a reduction in acceleration (from 21 to 16 m/s 2). The field tests proved that the tree canopy had a negative effect on the vibrations transmitted to the hand-arm system, especially when the aluminium bar of small diameter was used...|$|R

40|$|Fortifikationsverket {{which is}} the {{landlord}} for the Swedish national defence has a great problem in their forestry due to the relatively large amount of metal objects in their timber. These metal objects cause different types of economical losses in the timber refinement chain. To enable out sorting of logs containing metal objects already in the harvesting phase, Fortifikationsverket is interested of the possibility to utilize some type of metal detector in a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> for that purpose. The goal {{of this study was}} to, with help of a case study, enlighten the problem that metal objects in timber cause for Fortifikationsverket and their customers of timber and to investigate conditions of to mount and utilize some kind of metal detector in a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> at present. The saw timber deliveries by Fortifikationsverket during the time period 2003 - 2005 was used as a reference volume for calculations of economical losses. In this case study was included two sawmills where timber from Fortifikationsverket were delivered to for further refinement. Factors investigated were the type of damage metal objects caused in these two sawmills and the economical signification of these damages. Even the harvesting and managing of Fortifikationsverket´s timber in areas where trees contained relatively much metal objects and the harvesting procedure was investigated by interviewing entrepreneurs. Further, the possibilities to use some type of metal detector on a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> for out sorting logs containing metal objects were investigated by interviewing scientists and specialists and by literature searches. The interval of damage costs for the sawmills included in this case study was approximately 14 000 – 433 000 SEK. The economical scope for a metal detector amounted to approximately 130 000 SEK for the reference volume when only economical losses due to metal objects in connection with harvesting and transport where taken into consideration. Electromagnetics, X-rays, microwaves and ultrasound are methods which could be used to detect metal objects in timber. The tough environment provided by the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> and the <b>harvesting</b> technique it self precludes a practical usage of these methods at present, but it could be theoretically possible with the aid of microwave technique...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to evaluate}} the vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system by two electric portable harvesters, different for size and teeth features of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head.</b> Moreover, being {{the bars of the}} two machines telescopic, they were operated at minimum and maximum length. The acceleration was measured, at different times, in two points, 1 m apart, next to the hand positions. Finally, measurements were carried out both at no load, in standard controlled conditions, and in field, under ordinary working conditions. To smooth the influence of external factors, the machines were operated by the same operator. The results showed that the greater and heavier <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> produced significantly higher acceleration at no load (10. 7 m/s 2 vs. 5. 5 m/s 2), and comparable acceleration at load (13. 9 vs. 14. 2 m/s 2). On average, the vibration was significantly higher at load (14. 0 vs. 8. 1 m/s 2). The difference between the two bar lengths was not statistically significant: 9. 4 m/s 2 when using the minimum length and 9. 8 m/s 2 when using the maximum one. Finally, {{the difference between the two}} measuring points was affected by the bar length: it was statistically significant when using the bar at its minimum length only. As far as the components are concerned, at no load the highest acceleration was measured along the bar axis for both <b>harvesting</b> <b>heads</b> (9. 2 m/s 2 for the greater head and 4. 2 m/s 2 for the smaller one). At load all the three components were comparable in the greater head (about 7. 8 m/s 2) whereas the x component was predominant in the other one (11. 4 vs. 4. 8 (y) and 6. 6 m/s 2 (z)) ...|$|R

40|$|Logging {{harvesters}} {{represent a}} set of high-performance modern forestry machinery, which can finish a series of continuous operations such as felling, delimbing, peeling, bucking and so forth with human intervention. It is found by experiment that {{during the process of}} the alignment of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> to capture the trunk, the operator needs a lot of observation, judgment and repeated operations, which lead to the time and fuel losses. In order to improve the operation efficiency and reduce the operating costs, the point clouds for standing trees are collected with a low-cost 2 D laser scanner. A cluster extracting algorithm and filtering algorithm are used to classify each trunk from the point cloud. On the assumption that every cross section of the target trunk is approximate a standard circle and combining the information of an Attitude and Heading Reference System, the radii and center locations of the trunks in the scanning range are calculated by the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithm. The method is validated through experiments in an aspen forest, and the optimized calculation time consumption is compared with the previous work of other researchers.
