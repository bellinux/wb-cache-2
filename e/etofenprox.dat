50|$|<b>Etofenprox</b> is an insecticide, which {{disturbs}} insect nervous systems following {{direct contact}} or ingestion, {{and which is}} active against {{a broad spectrum of}} pests. It is used in agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, forestry, animal health and public health against many insect pests, for instance Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera and Hymenoptera. In agriculture, <b>etofenprox</b> is used on a broad range of crops such as rice, fruits, vegetables, corn, soybeans and tea. It is poorly absorbed by roots and little translocation occurs within plants. In the public health sector, <b>etofenprox</b> is used for vector control either by direct application in infested areas or indirectly by impregnating fabrics, such as mosquito nets. <b>Etofenprox</b> is used at low volumes to control adult mosquitoes, non biting midges, biting and non-biting flies. <b>Etofenprox</b> is used undiluted for ultra low volume aerosol applications or diluted with a diluent such as mineral oil for direct applications, for the control of pest species in or near residential, industrial, commercial, urban, recreational areas, woodlands, golf courses, and other areas where these pests are a problem.|$|E

Field experiments showed the detrimental effects of <b>etofenprox,</b> tau-fluvalinate and spinosad on predatory mite populations. Panonychus ulmi populations reached higher densities on plots treated with <b>etofenprox</b> and tau-fluvalinate. Apparently neonicotinoids did not cause detrimental effects on predatory mites. In the laboratory, spinosad and tau-fluvalinate caused 100 % mortality. <b>Etofenprox</b> was associated to a significant mortality and a reduced fecundity.

40|$|O gorgulho do milho, Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch., 1855) é a {{principal}} praga no armazenamento de milho. Seu controle é feito com a aplicação de inseticidas curativos e ou preventivos, mas o método apresenta inconvenientes relacionados com fatores toxicológicos e de resistência da praga devido ao pequeno número de inseticidas registrados e estes pertencerem a grupos químicos antigos, como os organofosforados e piretróides. Com o objetivo de testar um grupo químico diferente e mais moderno no controle desta praga e analisar a variação de umidade e atividade de água dos grãos de milho no decorrer do experimento, foi instalado este ensaio. Os grãos de milho foram pulverizados na proporção de 5 litros de calda por tonelada de grão, e depois mantidos em sacos de pano para manter os insetos em contato com os grãos e ao mesmo tempo, possibilitar a troca de ar. O ensaio foi instalado com sete tratamentos no início do experimento e mais quatro depois de dois meses, para testar novas doses e misturas do <b>Etofenprox</b> no controle do gorgulho. Os produtos utilizados para comparação com <b>Etofenprox</b> foram: Sumigran 500 (15 mL/ton. grão), Sumigran Plus (20 mL/ton. grão), K-Obiol (15 mL/ton. grão) e óleo de eucalipto (12, 4 Lt/ton. grão), além da mistura do <b>Etofenprox</b> (20 mL/ton. grão) com Butóxido de Piperonila (0, 5 %) e com Sumigran (10 mL/ton. grão). O <b>Etofenprox</b> não apresentou eficiência no controle de S. zeamais, porém sua mistura com Butóxido de Piperonila e Sumigran apresentaram eficiência superior aos tratamentos com <b>Etofenprox,</b> sugerindo um possível efeito sinérgico e uma possível alternativa para o controle da resistência, uma vez que o <b>Etofenprox</b> pertence a um grupo químico diferente dos registrados atualmente, sendo muito menos tóxico. O efeito sinergista do Butóxido de Piperonila já é conhecido e foi testado o possível efeito sinérgico do <b>Etofenprox</b> com o Fenitrotion. O teste foi instalado sobre placas de concreto que tiveram metade de suas superfícies aplicadas com doses de Fenitrotion (0, 8 mL/m²; 0, 6 mL/m²; 0, 4 mL/m²; 0, 2 mL/m²; 0, 1 mL/m² e 0, 05 mL/m²) e a outra metade com as mesmas doses de Fenitrotion adicionadas ao <b>Etofenprox</b> (1, 25 mL/m²). Outra observação foi que o óleo de eucalipto, mesmo não sendo eficiente no controle de S. zeamais, teve eficiência superior à testemunha e inibiu a oviposição. Observou-se que o dano dos insetos alterou a umidade, uma vez que os tratamentos que tinham insetos vivos apresentaram sempre umidade superior em relação aos tratamentos eficientes no controle desta praga. A maior umidade dos grãos nos quatro tratamentos instalados posteriormente fez com que o tempo de controle fosse menor. Esse experimento conclui que: <b>Etofenprox</b> não é eficiente no controle de S. zeamais, nas doses testadas; <b>Etofenprox</b> não apresenta efeito sinérgico com Fenitrotion no controle de S. zeamais; o óleo de eucalipto obteve controle superior à testemunha e inibiu a oviposição; o dano do inseto afeta diretamente a umidade da massa de grãos; a umidade dos grãos reduz o tempo de controle dos produtos utilizados. The maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch., 1855) {{is the main}} pest found in maize grains storage. The control of this pest is done with the application of curative or preventive insecticides, but these methods have brought unwanted effects concerning toxicological factors in addition to pest resistance factors, once {{there was only a}} small number of pesticides registered and they belong to old chemical groups, such as Organophosphorus and Pyrethroids. Due to reasons listed above, the present experiment was carried out with the aim of testing alternative and modern chemical groups that could be able to control the pest and also, of evaluating the moisture content variation and water activity of maize grains during the period of the experiment. The maize grains were sprayed within the proportion of 5 litres of mixture per ton of grains, and after that, they were stored in cloth bad in order to keep the insects in touch with the grains, and at the same time, allowing aeration. Seven treatments were applied at the beginning of the experiment and other four treatments were applied two months after that, with the intention of testing new rates and mixtures of <b>Etofenprox</b> to control the maize weevil. Some insecticides were used to be compared with <b>Etofenprox,</b> as it follows: Sumigran 500 (15 mL/ton of grains), Sumigran Plus (20 mL/ton of grains), K-Obiol (15 mL/ton of grains) and eucalypt oil (12, 4 Lt/ton of grains), as well as the mixture of <b>Etofenprox</b> (20 mL/ton of grains) with Piperonyl Butoxide (0, 5 %) and Sumigran (10 mL/ton of grains). <b>Etofenprox</b> has not shown any efficiency in controlling the S. zeamais, on the other hand, its mixture with Piperonyl Butoxide and Sumigran has shown higher levels of efficiency than the treatments with pure <b>Etofenprox,</b> which suggests a possible synergistic effect and a possible alternative for the control of pest resistance, once <b>Etofenprox</b> belongs to a chemical group which is different from the ones currently registered and is less toxic than they are. The synergistic effect of Piperonyl Butoxide is already known and the possibility of a synergistic effect of <b>Etofenprox</b> with Fenitrotion was also tested. This test was installed on concrete slabs which had rates of Fenitrotion (0, 8 mL/m²; 0, 6 mL/m²; 0, 4 mL/m²; 0, 2 mL/m²; 0, 1 mL/m² and 0, 05 mL/m²) applied over half of their surfaces while the other half received applications of the same rate of Fenitrotion added to <b>Etofenprox</b> (1, 25 mL/m²). Besides that, it was also relevantly observed that although eucalypt oil not being efficient enough to control S. zeamais, it is more efficient than the untreated and also prevented oviposition. It was observed that the attack of insects affected the moisture, once the treatments containing alive insects have always shown moisture rate higher than the efficiently controlling treatments. The higher grain moisture rate of the four last treatments caused the control time to be shorter. After this experiment, it is possible to conclude that: the <b>Etofenprox</b> it´s not efficient in the control of Sitophilus zeamais, on the tested rates; the <b>Etofenprox</b> it´s not present any synergistic effect with Fenitrotion; eucalypt oil was more controlling than the untreated and prevented oviposition; the attack of insects directly affects moisture content of grains; the moisture rate of grains interfered in the control time of the products used...|$|E

40|$|Experimental huts in Côte d'Ivoire {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin, the non-ester pyrethroid <b>etofenprox,</b> the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl and the carbamate carbosulfan on bednets against pyrethroid-resistant #Anopheles gambiae$ Giles. To test for selection for the resistance gene by the treated nets, #A. gambiae$ collected live or dead from the huts were kept and analysed for the presence of the kdr gene using a new polymerase chain reaction followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing (PCR-SSOP) for kdr-genotyping. Deliberately holed bednets freshly treated with pirimiphos-methyl or carbosulfan caused over 90 % kill of #A. gambiae$ s. s. on the sleepers under the nets was only significantly reduced by alpha-cypermethrin and carbosulfan. Tests of the residual activity of the bednets after seven months showed that pirimiphos-methyl had lost its efficacy while carbosulfan still performed well. Once again the pyrethroid treated nets gave similar results to the untreated nets. Selection for the kdr-allele by alpha-cypermethrin and <b>etofenprox,</b> but not by carbosulfan, was indicated by PCR-SSOP genotyping of mosquitoes. Thus carbamates such as carbosulfan, or organophosphates of longer persistance than pirimiphos-methyl and of low mammalian toxicity, {{would seem to be a}} promising alternative to be used on bednets, particularly in areas of pyrethroid resistance.

Bednets were impregnated with the above mentioned compounds and randomly allocated to the huts. On the 40 consecutive mornings, after sleepers had occupied the huts overnight, mosquitoes were collected from the huts, identified and scored as live or dead (including delayed mortality). #An. gambiae$ s. l. that had been collected were tested for the presence of the kdr allele in heterozygous or homozygous form. Both non-pyrethroid treatments caused very high mortality, whereas mortality with alpha-cypermethrin and <b>etofenprox</b> generally did not differ from the levels observed with untreated control nets in this experiment. The nets had holes cut in them and there was considerable bloodfeeding on the sleepers, which was only significantly reduced for #An. gambiae$ by carbosulfan and alpha-cypermethrin. PCR genotyping suggested that there was selection for the kdr resistance allele by the pyrethroid treated nets. Organophosphates and carbamates may therefore present an alternative to be used on bednets especially in areas of pyrethroid resistance, but the safety of these insecticides will have to be carefully considered.

40|$|Corn (Zea mays L.) is {{cultivated}} in large areas and {{considered one of}} the world's major cereal crops. There are several arthropod pests that can reduce its production such as the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lep. : Noctuidae), which is considered to be the main pest for corn. Fall armyworm is primarily controlled by insecticides. The use of biological control agents to manage this pest is growing with an emphasis on the egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hym. : Trichogrammatidae). Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of the following insecticides (g ai L- 1) beta-cypermethrin (0. 03), chlorfenapyr (0. 60), chlorpyrifos (0. 96), spinosad (0. 16), <b>etofenprox</b> (0. 10), triflumuron (0. 08), alfa-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron (0. 0425 / 0. 0425), and lambda-cyhalothrin/thiamethoxam (0. 11 / 0. 083) on survival, sex ratio, reproduction, and T. pretiosum offspring. Distilled water was used as a control. Commercial insecticide formulations were diluted in distilled water. Bioassays used Anagasta kuehniella eggs treated with insecticides which were afterwards exposed to parasitism. Bioassays were conducted under controlled conditions at 25 ± 2 °C, 70 ± 10 % RH, and 12 : 12 h photoperiod. Alfa-cypermethrin/teflubenzuron, beta-cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, chlorfenapyr, spinosad, <b>etofenprox,</b> and lambda-cyhalothrin/thiamethoxam reduced parasitism capacity of maternal generation females as well as the percentage of insect emergence from the F 1 generation. Only triflumuron was selective for T. pretiosum and can be recommended along with this parasitoid in fall armyworm management programs in corn...|$|E

40|$|The present {{status of}} {{pyrethroid}} resistance in vectors of malaria; Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles subpictus, was tested in two malarious Districts, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee, of Sri Lanka. Both species were resistant to permethrin and susceptible to cypermethrin and cyfluthrin. An. subpictus were resistant to deltamethrin. lambda-Cyhalothrin and <b>etofenprox</b> resistance was shown only by Anuradhapura An. subpictus. Although {{there were no}} differences among the populations for esterase and glutathione S-transferase activities, increased monooxygenase levels were found among Trincomalee populations. The voltage-gated sodium channel gene, the target site gene of pyrethroids, was partially sequenced to screen for mutations previously associated with insecticide resistance. The classic leucine to phenylalanine substitution, TTA to TTT, was detected in An. subpictus. It appears that both kdr type and monooxygenase resistance underlie pyrethroid resistance in these two malaria vectors of Sri Lanka. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
