40|$|This CICAD 1 on {{resorcinol}} {{was prepared}} by the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine, Hanover, Germany. It {{is based on the}} BUA (1993) report, the German MAK Commission report (MAK, 2003), the Health Council of the Netherlands (2004) report, and a preliminary IUCLID for the USEPA HPV Challenge Program (INDSPEC, 2004). Information on the source documents and their peer review is presented in Appendix 2. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted up to February 2005 to identify any relevant references published subsequent to those incorporated in these reports. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 3. This CICAD was considered and approved as an international assessment {{at a meeting of the}} 13 th Final Review Board, held in Nagpur, India, on 31 October - 3 November 2005. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are presented in Appendix 4. The International Chemical Safety Card for resorcinol (ICSC 1033), produced by IPCS (2003), has also been reproduced in this document. At the time of approval of the CICAD on resorcinol, an assessment of the chemical was also being undertaken as part of the HPV Chemicals Programme of the OECD. Peer review of this CICAD was extended to OECD Member countries during August and September 2005. As part of ongoing cooperation, any new information provided in the course of the OECD assessment will be provided by the OECD to IPCS. Resorcinol (CAS No. 108 - 46 - 3) is a white crystalline compound. The chemical is soluble in water and has a low vapour pressure and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. The resorcinol moiety has been found in a wide variety of natural products, and resorcinol is a monomeric by-product of the reduction, oxidation, and microbial degradation of humic substances. The largest user of resorcinol is the rubber industry (about 50 %). Resorcinol is also used for high-quality wood bonding applications (about 25 %) and is an important chemical intermediate in the manufacture of speciality chemicals. Other uses include the manufacture of dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, agricultural chemicals, fungicidal creams and lotions, and hair dye formulations. Resorcinol is released into the environment from a number of anthropogenic sources, including production, processing, and consumer uses, especially from hair dyes and pharmaceuticals. In addition, localized high concentrations can appear in coal conversion wastewater or wastewater in regions with oil shale mining. Calculations predict the hydrosphere to be the main target compartment of resorcinol. Data indicate that resorcinol is essentially non-volatile from aqueous solution. In the hydrosphere, hydrolysis is not expected to occur. However, in aqueous solution, autoxidation of resorcinol takes place, and it can be assumed that resorcinol reacts in water bodies with hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. Resorcinol is readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions and is likely to be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions. In the upper atmosphere, resorcinol is rapidly degraded (half-life about 2 h) by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. Experimental data using silty loam indicate a very low soil sorption of resorcinol, leading to a high potential for mobility. Bioaccumulation is not to be expected, based on the calculated BCF. Localized concentrations are available only for coal conversion wastewater or wastewater in oil shale regions. These values are unsuitable for a risk assessment of the emissions from anthropogenic sources, because they are not representative of the background or local concentrations. Therefore, estimates of environmental concentrations were made for Europe using the software EUSES 2. 0. 3. The results of the calculations show that the highest concentrations are expected at local point sources, such as at sites where hair dyes are formulated or rubber products are manufactured. These estimated concentrations in water are 1 order of magnitude higher than the local concentrations resulting from emissions from the use of consumer products containing resorcinol, which are released on a continental scale. The results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats, rabbits, and humans suggest that resorcinol is absorbed by the oral, dermal, and subcutaneous routes, rapidly metabolized, and excreted principally as glucuronide conjugates in the urine. The available studies give no indication of bioaccumulation. There is a limited potential for absorption of resorcinol through intact skin using a hydroalcoholic vehicle. In animal studies, the toxicological effects reported to be caused by administration of resorcinol include thyroid dysfunction, skin irritation, CNS effects, and altered relative adrenal gland weights. In some studies, decreases in body weight gain and decreased survival were noted. Acute lethal toxicity data in experimental animals showed resorcinol to be of low toxicity following inhalation and dermal exposure but of higher toxicity after oral, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Resorcinol is irritating to eyes and skin and may cause sensitization by skin contact. Short-term (17 days) oral exposure studies via gavage in F 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice dosed 5 days/ week resulted in NOAELs of 27. 5 mg/kg body weight and 75 mg/kg body weight, respectively, for clinical signs such as hyperexcitability, tachypnoea, and tremors, which were most probably caused by an acute effect of resorcinol on the CNS. No gross or microscopic lesions were seen. In a 13 -week study in F 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice, LOAELs for adrenal gland weight were in the range of 28 - 32 mg/kg body weight and the NOAEL for liver weight was 32 mg/kg body weight (dosing 5 days/week), without a clear dose-response. The highest dose levels (420 - 520 mg/kg body weight) caused tremors and increased mortality. No differences were seen in haematology or clinical chemistry, and no gross or microscopic lesions in dosed animals were found. No signs of carcinogenicity were seen in male F 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice of both sexes dosed with 0 - 225 mg/kg body weight and female rats exposed to 0 - 150 mg/kg body weight for 5 days/week for 104 weeks (NTP, 1992). Clinical signs of ataxia and tremors were noted at about 100 mg/kg body weight, but no differences in haematology, clinical chemistry, or other clinical pathology parameters were seen. There was a NOAEL of 50 mg/kg body weight for acute clinical signs indicative of effects on the CNS. A study with transgenic CB 6 F 1 -Tg rasH 2 mice gavaged with 0 or 225 mg/kg body weight 5 days/week for 24 - 26 weeks showed only a slight, non-significant increased incidence of adenomas in the lungs. Negative results were mostly reported in the initiation-promotion studies performed using several species. However, three studies using nitrosamines as the initiator showed increased tumour incidences. In bacterial mutagenicity assays, resorcinol showed mostly negative results. However, it induced mutations in the TK locus in mouse lymphoma cells. Resorcinol did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in hepatic cells or single-strand DNA breaks in mammalian cells in vitro. Studies for SCE and chromosomal aberrations in vitro in isolated cells and cell lines gave both negative and positive results. Cytogenetic studies in vivo (micronuclei in bone marrow in rats and two strains of mice; SCE in male and female rats) gave consistently negative results. In a dose range-finding drinking-water study in male and female rats dosed continuously with resorcinol up to 360 mg/l for a minimum of 28 consecutive days prior to mating, no adverse effects concerning reproductive performance, mortality, and body or organ weights were observed (RTF, 2003). In the following two-generation drinking-water study, doses of 0, 120, 360, 1000, or 3000 mg/l were administered. A NOEL of 1000 mg/l and a NOAEL of 3000 mg/l for parental systemic and reproductive toxicity as well as neonatal toxicity were derived. When expressed on a body weight basis (average of F 0 and F 1 animals), the NOAEL corresponded to approximately 233 mg/kg body weight per day for males over the entire generation, 304 mg/kg body weight per day for females during premating and gestation, and 660 mg/kg body weight per day for females during lactation (RTF, 2005). A battery of neurotoxicological tests was included in the reproductive <b>dose</b> <b>range-finding</b> <b>study,</b> but no effects in tests other than the locomotor activity test in male offspring were observed. Earlier studies with pregnant rats and rabbits had also shown no effects on developmental toxicity. Dosing of rats via gavage at up to 500 mg/kg body weight on gestation days 6 - 15 caused no embryotoxicity and no adverse effects on mean numbers of corpora lutea, total implantations, viable fetuses, or mean fetal body weights. There was also no increase in fetal anomalies or malformations. Slight maternal toxicity (weight loss at 24 h with decrease in maternal weight gain at 72 h) was seen in rats in a further study at doses of 667 mg/kg body weight. Effects on the thyroid gland have been described in 30 -day and 12 -week drinking-water studies in rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight per day. No histopathological changes in the thyroid were found in subacute, subchronic, or chronic studies performed via gavage in rats or mice; however, T 3 /T 4 levels were not determined, with the exception of the 0 and 130 mg/kg body weight dose groups in the 13 -week rat study. In the long-term study (104 weeks), NOAELs for thyroid effects were 150 - 520 mg/kg body weight per day (5 days/week); however, these studies were not designed to investigate this end-point. In a one-generation dose range-finding drinking-water study, male and female rats were dosed continuously with resorcinol at up to 360 mg/l (males: 1, 4, 13, or 37 mg/kg body weight per day; females: 1, 5, 16, or 47 mg/kg body weight per day). Some effects on the thyroid gland were reported, but they were inconsistent, not statistically significant, and not dose related (RTF, 2003). In the two-generation drinking-water study (RTF, 2005), no statistically significant resorcinolrelated changes in the mean concentrations of T 3, T 4, or TSH were observed in the F 0 and F 1 parental animals or in the F 1 and F 2 pups selected for analysis (PND 4 or PND 21). Higher TSH values were noted in the F 0 males at scheduled necropsy, but these were not considered as resorcinol-related effects in the absence of effects on T 3 or T 4, organ weights, or adverse macroscopic or microscopic findings. Test article-related decreased colloid within the thyroid glands of the 3000 mg/l F 0 males was not considered to be adverse due to a lack of associated functional effects. Resorcinol administered at high doses to rodents can disrupt thyroid synthesis and produce goitrogenic effects. There are species-specific differences in synthesis, binding, and transport of thyroid hormones that complicate interpretation of goitrogenesis. In vitro studies indicate that the anti-thyroidal activity observed following resorcinol exposure is due to the inhibition of thyroid peroxidase enzymes, as evidenced by disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis and changes in the thyroid gland consistent with goitrogenesis. In humans, exposure to resorcinol has been associated with thyroid effects, CNS disturbances, and red blood cell changes. Dermal sensitization to resorcinol has been well documented, but in practice it is rare; the available data do not allow assessment of the sensitization potency. There are two toxicological effects that could be used for deriving a tolerable intake: thyroidal and neurological effects. Both these effects have been reported in human case-reports from dermal application of high concentrations (up to 50 %) of resorcinol in ointments for ulcers and in peelings, as well as in rodent studies at high concentrations. There is no rodent study covering both end-points adequately. The human data describing thyroidal and neurological effects were case-reports giving only estimates of exposure and are therefore inadequate to provide a tolerable intake. For this reason, the study chosen to derive a tolerable intake was the long-term NTP (1992) study in which a NOAEL of 50 mg/kg body weight per day (about 36 mg/kg body weight per day after correcting for 5 days/week dosing) for neurological effects (acute clinical signs) was derived. No histopathological changes were seen in the thyroid. There was no measurement of T 3 /T 4 ratio. Application of uncertainty factors for interspecies (10) and intraspecies (10) differences results in a tolerable intake of 0. 4 mg/kg body weight per day. In a worst-case exposure study in human volunteers using 2 % anti-acne cream, no thyroidal effects (i. e. no alterations in T 3 /T 4 /T 7 /TSH levels) were seen at a dermal dose of 12 mg/kg body weight per day (estimated systemic dose levels of 0. 4 mg/kg body weight per day). Therefore, the tolerable intake of 0. 4 mg/kg body weight per day derived from the NTP (1992) study would be protective for both neurological and thyroidal effects. From valid test results available on the toxicity of resorcinol to various aquatic organisms, resorcinol can be classified as being of low to high toxicity in the aquatic compartment. The lowest NOEC was determined for Daphnia magna in a full life cycle toxicity test based on measured concentrations (21 -day NOEC = 172 g/l). However, higher concentrations were not tested, so the actual NOEC is likely to be higher. Nethertheless, a PNECaqua of 3. 4 g/l can be derived using an assessment factor of 50 according to the EU Technical Guidance Document (EC, 2003 a), as results from chronic studies from two trophic levels (fish and daphnia) are available. Using this PNEC value and PEC values for surface water, the risk (PEC/PNEC) from resorcinol for the aquatic environment (surface water) was estimated. For regional surface waters, calculations showed a low risk. The rubber industry is the largest consumer of resorcinol. The PEC/PNEC value indicates a risk for surface waters, assuming that the wastewater of the rubber production sites is connected to a wastewater treatment plant. If this is not the case, the calculated risk from rubber industry effluent would be increased. Applications as hair dyes and pharmaceuticals result in a low probability for negative effects on the surface water ecosystem. In contrast, at local point sources, such as at sites where hair dyes are formulated, a risk cannot be excluded using the conservative approach. However, in sewage treatment plants, as indicated by a simulation test, there is a higher removal of resorcinol, which would result in a reduced calculated risk. In conclusion, there may be a risk from resorcinol in the aquatic environment from sites where hair dyes are formulated and from rubber production plants. The data availability for toxicity to terrestrial organisms is not sufficient for a quantitative risk assessment. However, an estimation of risk using the equilibrium partitioning method can be made. Using this method, a low risk was found for the regional soil compartment, but a risk at local point sources cannot be excluded...|$|E

Two isomers of dinitrotoluene (2, 4 - and 2, 6 -) are often found in soil associ-ated with those activities at considerable concentrations. Con-sequently, issues regarding the effects of exposure to birds that visit these habitats require evaluation. To provide data useful to a risk assessment approach, we followed a controlled dosing regime (gavage) using 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (2, 4 -DNT) in the Northern Bob-white (Colinus virginianus) for 60 days following a 14 -day <b>range-finding</b> <b>study</b> and the determination of a LD 50 using the up/down method.

The initial <b>range-finding</b> <b>studies</b> showed that a pharmacologically significant amount of the decapeptide can be transported across the skin in a relevant period of time. However, metabolism of nafarelin was observed to take place during its transdermal delivery. It was further found that a reservoir of nafarelin could be established in the skin; for example, following current passage {{for a period of}} 12 h, the amount transported across the tissue was comparable to that which subsequently desorbed passively from the skin over the next 12 h. Different current profiles were tested in an attempt to improve drug delivery and minimize the apparent reservoir effect.

The latest years it has been of increasing interest to investigate the possible relationship between exposures to brominated flame retardants and the risk of cancer development. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the negative effects of the toxicants Tetrabromobispehenol-A (TBBPA), using the epithelial liver cell line IAR 20 in vitro with special emphasis on cell viability, gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and DNA damage. Concentrations ranging from 0, 06 μM to 25 μM were tested in the current study, based on a pilot <b>dose</b> <b>range-finding</b> viability assay for TBBPA. The objective was demonstrated through the Alamar blue viability assay, the scrape dye-loading assay and the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay). The comet assay was performed with a smaller range of concentrations of TBBPA than that used in the scrape dye load assay and the AB assay, 1, 25 μM, 2, 5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, 15 μM and 20 μM was used as exposure concentrations. TBBPA exercised an inhibiting effect on the intercellular communication via gap junctions in the highest dose range. The cells remained viable up to an exposure of 15 μM TBBPA and showed to have a GJIC significantly different from the negative control starting from 2, 5 μM and up. This shows that the cells continued to be viable, but didn’t communicate as well. The DNA damage in the cells was shown to be significant at a concentration of 2, 5 μM up to 20 μM. In vitro results from this study cannot be directly compared to in vivo experiments, but it provides indications of exposure effects, as exposure to TBBPA for 24 hours can reduce cell viability, disrupt GJIC and cause DNA damage in IAR 20 cells.

Previous research has evaluated petroleum toxicity to coral {{using a variety}} of methodologies, including monitoring effects of acute and chronic spills, in situ exposures, and ex situ exposures with both adult and larval stage corals. Variability in toxicant, bioassay conditions, species and other methodological disparities among studies prevents comprehensive conclusions regarding the toxicity of hydrocarbons to corals. This research evaluated the 48 -hour toxicity of 1 -methylnaphthalene to Porites divaricata using a continuous-flow passive <b>dosing</b> system. The <b>range-finding</b> exposure evaluated the dosing protocol and verified the effectiveness of the passive dosing technique at maintaining exposure concentrations. The full-toxicity exposures resulted in a precise estimate of toxic threshold concentrations for use in the target lipid model. The target lipid model promoted comparisons across different species by calculating the critical target lipid body burden of 355. 7 µmol/ g lipid for P. divaricata. This indicates a greater resilience to petroleum hydrocarbon exposure compared to other species for which these data are available...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{exposure}} regimens {{of cigarette smoke}} {{have been used in}} animal models of lung diseases. In this study, we compared biological responses of smoke exposure in rats, using different smoke concentrations (wet total particulate matter [WTPM]), daily exposure durations, and total days of exposure. As a <b>range-finding</b> acute <b>study,</b> we first compared pulmonary responses between SD and F 344 strains after a single nose-only exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke or LPS. Secondly, F 344 rats were exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 or 13 weeks under the comparable daily exposure dose (WTPM concentration x daily exposure duration; ac-cording to Haber’s rule) but at a different WTPM concentration or daily exposure duration. Blood carboxylhemoglobin was increased linearly to the WTPM concentration, while urinary nicotine plus cotinine value was higher for the longer daily exposure than the corresponding shorter exposure groups. Gamma glutamyl transferase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased dose dependently after 2 and 13 weeks of cigarette smoke exposure, while the neutrophil content in BALF was not increased notably. Smoke-exposed groups showed reduced body weight gain and increased relative lung and heart weights. While BALF parameters and the relative lung weights suggest pulmonary responses, histopathological examination showed epithelial lesions mainly in the upper respiratory organs (nose and larynx). Collectively, the results indicate that, under the employed study design, the equivalent daily ex-posure dose (exposure concentration x duration) induces equivalent pulmonary responses in rats.

40|$|Hensikten med denne studien var å undersøke de tre kjemikaliene Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) og Tetrabromobispehenol-A (TBBPA) sitt karsinogene potensiale. Dette ble gjort ved å utføre Syriskhamsterembryo (SHE) celletransformasjonsanalyse (CTA). Dette er en {{in vitro}} analyse basert på endring i cellekoloniers morfologi etter eksponering av karsinogene stoffer. Cellene benyttet er primærceller, isolert fra 13 dager gamle Syriske hamsterembryoer. Denne analysen har blitt benyttet i flere tiår og Organization for Economic Co-operation (OECD) har gjort en prevalideringsstudie og lagd en anbefalt protokoll, samt en fotoguide for å hjelpe med scoringen av transformerte kolonier. Konsentrasjoner mellom 0, 1 nM og 550 μM ble testet av de ulike kjemikaliene, basert på doseområde tester utført for hvert enkelt kjemikalie. I tillegg til analysen av SHE celle transformasjon ble det utført en DCF analyse. Dette ble gjort for å se om eksponering av SHE celler av PFOS, Perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA), PFNA og TBBPA ville øke produksjonen av reaktive oksidanter (ROS) i cellene. Dette ble gjort for å undersøke om økt ROS produksjon kunne være en grunn til eventuelt karsinogent potensiale. I eksperimentene med de perfluorerte stoffene ble konsentrasjoner mellom 1 μM og 1 mM undersøkt. I eksperimentet med TBBPA ble konsentrasjoner mellom 10 nM og 1 mM testet. Resultatene fra analysen etter eksponering av SHE celler for PFOS kunne ikke gi et gyldig resultat, fordi det var for lav transformasjonsrate på den positive kontrollen Benzo-a-Pyrene (B[a]P). PFNA eksponeringen ga et usikkert resultat med bare en signifikant konsentrasjon i tillegg til den positive kontrollen. TBBPA ga derimot et positivt resultat i SHE CTA med to konsentrasjoner signifikant forskjellig fra den negative kontrollen Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). På bakgrunn av DCF forsøkene ser det ikke ut til at de perfluorerte stoffene testet her gir økning i ROS produksjon i forhold til DMSO kontrollen. Det var ikke mulig å undersøke om TBBPA ga økning i ROS produksjon basert på testen benyttet i denne studien. The main {{objective of this}} thesis {{was to investigate the}} carcinogenic potential of the three toxicants Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and Tetrabromobispehenol- A (TBBPA), using the Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) Cell Transformation assay (CTA). The SHE CTA is an in vitro assay based on the morphological change of cell colonies when exposed to carcinogenic compounds. The cells used were primary cells isolated from Syrian hamster embryos. The SHE CTA has been used for several decades (Rivedal 1982), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation (OECD) has recently performed a prevalidation study and made a recommended protocol with a photo catalogue to help the scoring of the transformed colonies (Maire et al. 2012 a; Maire et al. 2012 b). Concentrations between 0. 1 nM and 550 μM were tested in the current study, based on a <b>dose</b> <b>range-finding</b> experiment for each of the chemicals. In addition to the SHE CTA, the DCF assay was used to investigate if exposure to PFOS, Perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA), PFNA and TBBPA would increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SHE cells. This was tested to investigate if increased ROS production {{could be one of the}} mechanisms behind potential carcinogenicity of the compounds. In the experiments with the perfluorinated compounds concentrations between 1 μM and 1 mM were tested. In the experiment with TBBPA concentrations between 10 nM and 1 mM were tested. The SHE CTA of PFOS did not give a valid answer, because of too low transformation frequency in the positive control Benzo-a-Pyrene (B[a]P). PFNA gave an inconclusive result, with only one concentration significantly different from the negative control Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the experiments. TBBPA on the other hand gave a positive response in the SHE CTA with two positive concentrations, and it is therefore possible to say that TBBPA causes transformation in SHE cells. On the basis of the DCF assay experiments, it is unlikely that increase in ROS production is a part of the mechanisms behind these perfluorinated compounds’ cytotoxic and carcinogenic potential. It was not possible to detect if TBBPA caused an increase in ROS production based on the assay used in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of {{pesticides}} in soil {{is based on}} a tiered approach that uses surrogate indicators of risk spanning from single species in the laboratory to soil organism communities in the field. This thesis aims {{to bridge the gap between}} laboratory approaches and field studies using a Terrestrial Model Ecosystem (TME). Chapter I provides a systematic approach that is applied in this thesis. The effects to soil communities and the corresponding detection limits depend largely on the intrinsic variability and the sensitivity of the systems. Since TME are meant to provide a high degree of realism comparable to field studies, the first chapter gives an overview on the characteristics of soil ecosystems and the ecology of the soil organisms. Chapter II gives an overview of the experimental approaches, the test compound lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) and the assessment endpoints measured in both TME and field studies. The complex community-level data of different soil organism groups requires a variety of uni- and multivariate statistical methods. Chapter III involves the description and interpretation of effects of the persistent and toxic pesticide lindane on soil microarthropod communities that were detected in a one-year <b>range-finding</b> <b>study</b> in TME. The open, intact soil cores (diameter 300 mm, height 400 mm) included indigenous soil organisms of undisturbed grassland. Forty units were placed outdoors in an experimental facility. The key objective was at first to evaluate the dynamics and stability of microarthropod communities on grassland over a period that is relevant for assessing the intrinsic recovery potential of the TME communities following toxic stress. Sufficient numbers of organisms and replicates of the experimental units ensured that a statistical evaluation could be performed to estimate the sensitivity and the natural dynamics and the variability of the populations upon application of lindane applied at high rates of 7. 5 and 75 kg active ingredient (a. i.) /ha. The results showed that TME soil cores maintained communities of soil organisms marked by typical diversity of improved grassland. Lindane applied at excessive rates caused clear dose-related and long-lasting effects on the communities of microarthropods. On the contrary, lumbricids, the total feeding activity and the growth of plant biomass were not affected by both treatments. Based on the results of the first effect study, a modified ‘dose-response study’ with the same compound lindane was designed (Chapter IV). Further organism groups were included, so that the effects on collembolans, oribatid mites, nematodes, soil fungi and plant biomass could be determined in forty-two TME. Lindane was applied in five concentrations between 0. 032 mg a. i. /kg dry soil and 3. 2 mg a. i. /kg dry weight soil, six-fold replicated each. Twelve TME served as untreated controls. Abundance and community structures of oribatids, collembolans, enchytraeids, nematodes and fungi were recorded. Oribatid mites’ community responded three months after treatment, although they were not significantly affected by the overall treatment regime. Collembolans in total and species-specific abundance as well as the community endpoints were adversely affected by moderate dosages of lindane. Effects were transient between three and five months after treatment with a recovery within one year. No significant effects have been detected for enchytraeids, nematodes and fungi. The study design and the obtained results allow for calculations of no observed effect concentrations below the highest treatment level for populations and for soil communities as defined entities, as well as effective concentrations as indicators of dose related responses. In Chapter V the ecology of the coring area is described by means of floristic and faunistic surveys. The distribution of collembolans is analysed by geostatistical methods and categorized as patchy or gradiental. These findings lead to conclusions on optimized soil coring strategies, which are proposed as small-scaled as possible to avoid excess variability. The temporal stability of TME is investigated under the propositions of the criteria ‘no tendency towards altered abundances and diversity structures’ and ‘similarity of communities compared to the original state’. The issue ‘for which kind of habitat is the particular TME representative’ is raised. It has been concluded that a high degree of similarity between field and TME samples remains manifest over time and the pattern persists the large seasonal variation of community structures. Prospective power analyses led to an estimation of the limits of effect detection. On average, the detectable differences of abundances of treatment groups compared to control level (MDD) was between five percent for nematodes and about fifty percent for enchytraeids, collembolans and oribatids, markedly varying between sampling dates...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this thesis was to {{determine}} if expression of hsp 70 and a reporter construct hsp 70 -eGFP could be used as biomarkers of toxic exposure in zebrafish larvae. Cadmium and arsenic were chosen as the model toxic compounds to test this hypothesis because they are both strong inducers of hsp 70 in other model systems, and their toxicity in fish has been well characterized. Before investigating the effects of cadmium and arsenic on hsp 70 expression, it was necessary to determine the normal expression patterns under non-stressed conditions. A time course from the early blastocyst embryo to post-hatch larvae (3 - 96 hpf) showed that hsp 70 is not expressed under non-stressed conditions except for the developing lens. It was determined that this localized lens expression is constitutive rather than stress-induced, and {{may play a role in}} the development of the lens. It was also determined that the reporter hsp 70 -eGFP gene closely mimicked endogenous hsp 70 under non-stressed conditions (i. e. constitutive lens expression) and following heat shock (i. e. strong expression throughout) and therefore is a reliable method to monitor hsp 70 expression in vivo. An initial <b>range-finding</b> acute toxicity <b>study</b> showed that post-hatch zebrafish larvae were much more sensitive to cadmium than pre-hatch embryos, and therefore only larvae were used for further toxicity tests. The dose-response relationships of the acute (96 hr) toxicity of cadmium and arsenic to larvae were determined and the median effective doses calculated (LC 50 and EC 50). The primary gross effects of edema, trunk abnormalities, immobility, and death were observed for both cadmium and arsenic, however cadmium was much more toxic than arsenic. Based on the acute toxicity tests, relevant doses of cadmium and arsenic were chosen as exposure treatments in order to measure in vivo expression of hsp 70 and hsp 70 -eGFP. The patterns of expression for hsp 70 and hsp 70 -eGFP were investigated in larvae following acute pulse (3 hr) exposures to cadmium and arsenic (only hsp 70). The patterns of expression for hsp 70 and hsp 70 -eGFP were dose-dependent and tissue specific. Cadmium induced expression of hsp 70 and hsp 70 -eGFP in the skin, gills, olfactory rosette, liver, and kidney, all of which are either accumulators or target organs of cadmium in fish. Arsenic also induced expression of hsp 70 in the liver, gills, olfactory rosette and skin...|$|R
