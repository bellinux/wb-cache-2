5000|$|The post-war {{housing needs}} in the mid-twentieth century {{prompted}} standardization in residential <b>design.</b> <b>Mass</b> production, cost efficiency, and functional layouts were not only necessary {{for the production of}} high volumes of residential architecture, but were also tenets of modern design. Modern architects designing residential properties reflective of the International Style developed innovative concrete systems that adapted to normative construction processes. This allowed for mass prototypes that streamlined housing architecture in the midcentury. Pre-fabrication became a way for architects to design economical buildings that could help Americans purchase their own home and achieve the “American Dream.” Lyles, Bissett, Carlisle, and Wolff all designed their own homes and demonstrated how architects employed the use of the international style for residential architecture. Modern architecture not only emphasized style, but introduced good style on a large scale. LBC&W published several design books dedicated to different designs of residential homes. For example, “Small Homes” promoted their designs as “economical, efficient, and simple to build,” without compromising “attractiveness, durability, and livability of the finished product.” While not usually considered explicit expressions of Modern architecture, these other residential homes incorporated modern materials and overall design iterations from the modern movement and helped foster modern architecture for the masses. LBC&W did not design every residential building in the International Style. James F. Byrnes, who was a notable politician and statesman, commissioned his residence {{to be done in the}} Colonial Revival style.|$|E
