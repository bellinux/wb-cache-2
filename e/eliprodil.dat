50|$|Due to {{the binding}} {{capabilities}} of antipsychotic drugs and various neurotransmitters associated with mood, the sigma-2 receptor {{is a viable}} target for therapies related to neuropsychiatric disorders and modulation of emotional response. It {{is thought to be}} involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and sigma-2 receptors have been shown to be less abundant is schizophrenic patients. Additionally, PCP, which is an NMDA antagonist, can induce schizophrenia, while sigma-2 receptor activation has been shown to antagonize effects of PCP, implying antipsychotic capabilities. Sigma receptors are a potential target for treatment of dystonia, given high densities in effected regions of the brain. Anti-ischemics ifenprodil and <b>eliprodil,</b> the binding of which increases blood flow, have also shown affinity to sigma receptors.In experimental trials in mice and rats, the sigma-2 receptor ligand siramensine caused reduced anxiety and displayed antidepressant capabilities, while other studies have shown inhibition of selective sigma receptor radioligands by antidepressants, in the mouse and rat brain.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effects of <b>eliprodil,</b> a noncardiac drug with neuroprotective properties, on the cardiac repolarisation under in vitro circumstances, under normal {{conditions}} and after the attenuation of the ‘repolarisation reserve' by blocking the inward rectifier potassium current (IK 1) current with BaCl 2. In canine right ventricular papillary muscle by applying the conventional microelectrode technique, under normal conditions, <b>eliprodil</b> (1 μM) produced a moderate reverse rate-dependent prolongation of the action potential duration (7. 4 ± 1. 5, 8. 9 ± 2. 1 and 9. 9 ± 1. 8 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 9). This effect was augmented in preparations where IK 1 was previously blocked by BaCl 2 (10 μM). BaCl 2 alone lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner (7. 0 ± 1. 3, 14. 2 ± 1. 6 and 28. 1 ± 2. 1 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 8). When <b>eliprodil</b> (1 μM) was administered to these preparations, the drug induced a marked further lengthening relative to the APD values measured after the administration of BaCl 2 (12. 5 ± 1. 0, 17. 6 ± 1. 5 and 20. 5 ± 0. 9 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 8). In the normal Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart, <b>eliprodil</b> (1 μM) produced a significant QTc prolongation at 1 Hz stimulation frequency (12. 7 ± 1. 8 %, n= 9). After the attenuation of the ‘repolarisation reserve' by the IK 1 blocker BaCl 2 (10 μM), the eliprodil-evoked QTc prolongation was greatly enhanced (28. 5 ± 7. 9 %, n= 6). In two out of six Langendorff preparations, this QTc lengthening degenerated into torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia. <b>Eliprodil</b> significantly decreased the amplitude of rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), but slow component (IKs), transient outward current (Ito) and IK 1 were not considerably affected by the drug when measured in dog ventricular myocytes by applying the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. The results indicate that <b>eliprodil,</b> under normal conditions, moderately lengthens cardiac repolarisation by inhibition of IKr. However, after the attenuation of the normal ‘repolarisation reserve', this drug can induce marked QT interval prolongation, which may result in proarrhythmic action...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : First {{principles}} calculations {{were performed}} to study four multiple sclerosis drugs namely, Ampyra, Fingolimod, Mitoxantrone and <b>Eliprodil</b> in gas and liquid phases using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Computational chemistry simulations were carried out to compare calculated quantum chemical parameters for Ampyra, Fingolimod, Mitoxantrone and <b>Eliprodil.</b> Materials and Methods: All calculations were performed using DMol 3 code {{which is based on}} DFT.   The Double Numerical basis set with Polarization functions (DNP) was used. Results: Mitoxantrone has highest HOMO energy, global softness, solvation energy and molecular mass and lowest LUMO energy, energy gap, global hardness and total energy in comparison to Ampyra, Fingolimod and <b>Eliprodil</b> in gas and solvent phases. Calculations were carried out to study the interaction of covalently binding Mitoxantrone to functionalized carbon nanotube. The Mitoxantrone local reactivity was studied through the Fukui indices in order to predict both the reactive centers and the possible sites of nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks. The Mitoxantrone binding energy  is calculated to be 6. 507 eV in gas phase and - 9. 943 eV in solvent phase that is a decrease in BE as the drug phase changes from gas to liquid. Conclusion: The simulation results show Mitoxantrone is quite a reactive drug. The quantum chemical parameters of pristine nanotube and f-SWNT-Mitoxantrone showed that reactivity of f-SWNT-Mitoxantrone increased in comparison to pristine nanotube in both phases...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—This study characterised the {{pharmacology}} of [3 H]-ifenprodil binding to the polyamine binding sites (PBS) on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel {{complex on}} human retinas. These data {{were correlated with}} the known neuroprotective effects of ifenprodil and <b>eliprodil.</b>  METHODS—Specific binding of [3 H]-ifenprodil (under sigma site blockade) was investigated using human retinal homogenates and radioligand binding techniques. Scatchard and competition analyses were utilised to define the pharmacology of the [3 H]-ifenprodil binding sites.  RESULTS—Specific binding of [3 H]-ifenprodil comprised 73 % (SEM 3 %) of total and reflected interaction with two affinity sites (Kds =  0. 39  and 4. 3  µM) of different densities (Bmax =  14. 4  and 105  pmol/ mg protein) (n =  5). The rank order of affinity of compounds competing for [3 H]-ifenprodil binding to the high affinity PBS was: ifenprodil > eliprodil > arcaine > spermine > diaminodecane > spermidine > putrescine >> MK- 801 (n =  3 - 7). However, [3 H]-ifenprodil binding was minimally inhibited by glutamate, NMDA, and kainate.  CONCLUSION—These studies have shown, for the first time, the presence of specific [3 H]-ifenprodil binding sites in the human retina with pharmacological characteristics of PBS associated with the NMDA receptor ionophore complex. The neuroprotective effects of <b>eliprodil</b> and ifenprodil may, in part, be mediated via these [3 H]-ifenprodil labelled sites.    Keywords: retina; neuroprotection; eliprodil; NMDA receptor...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{endogenous}} acetylcholine {{was measured in}} electrically (5 - 20 Hz) stimulated guinea pig cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus slices under ischemic (hypoxic and glucose-free) conditions. Ischemia reduced acetylcholine release by 40 - 90 %; the inhibition depended on the duration of ischemia (10 - 30 min) while the extent of post-ischemic recovery was inversely related to it. Caudate nucleus slices displayed a higher sensitivity to ischemia than did cortical slices. To test the effects of excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists on the ischemia-induced reduction of acetylcoline release and on its post-ischemic recovery, the following drugs were used: 5 -methyl- 10, 11 -dihydro- 5 -H-dibenzo-[a,b]-cyclohepten- 5, 10 -imine (MK- 801,-a blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] receptor-linked channel), 7 -chloro-kynurenic acid (7 -Cl-KYN) and (E) - 3 -[2 (phenylcarbamoyl) ethenyl]- 4, 6 -dichloroindole- 2 -carboxylic acid sodium salt (GV 150526 A, blockers of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor), <b>eliprodil,</b> (an antagonist at the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor), and 6 -cyano- 7 -nitro-quinoxalin- 2, 3 -dione (CNQX, a D,L-alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxalone propionic acid [AMPA] receptor antagonist). These did not modify the time-course {{and the extent of}} ischemia-induced inhibition but improved post-ischemic recovery in a concentration dependent manner. GV 150526 A and CNQX appeared to be more effective in the cerebral cortex. Only <b>eliprodil</b> was devoid of any effect in both areas. The evaluation of acetylcholine release from brain slices represents a suitable in vitro model to quantify the effectiveness of drugs in favouring recovery from the cholinergic presynaptic failure induced by ischemic conditions. The different effects of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists cited above, depending on the brain areas considered and the receptor subtypes involved, may be of interest in view of their therapeutic potential...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{characterization}} of the cardiac N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) as a target for endogenous and synthetic agonists and antagonists. Using isolated perfused rat hearts, we have shown that intracoronary administration of the NMDAR agonists and antagonists has a pronounced effect on autonomous heart function. Perfusion of rat hearts with autologous blood supplemented with NMDAR agonists was associated with induction of tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia and ischemia occurring within physiological plasma concentration range for glutamate and glycine. Intracoronary administration of the NMDAR antagonists exerted an anti-arrhythmic effect and resulted in bradycardia and improvement of capillary perfusion. Action of antagonists <b>eliprodil,</b> Ro 25 - 6981, memantine, ketamine, and MK- 801 on autonomous heart function diverged strikingly from that of L-type Ca channel blockers. Cardiac NMDAR subunit composition differed from that of neuronal receptors and was age- and chamber-specific. Transcripts of the GluN 3 A and GluN 2 D were found in all heart chambers, whereas expression of GluN 1 and GluN 2 A and 2 C were restricted to the atria. Expression of the GluN 2 B protein in ventricles increased markedly with age of the animals. The obtained data reveal that NMDARs are expressed in rat heart contributing to the autonomic heart rate regulation and {{the function of the}} cardiac conduction system...|$|E
40|$|From the {{therapeutic}} point of view, {{the real challenge}} {{is not only to}} improve the symptoms, but to interfere with the pathomechanism of the disease. That is why a considerable interest has recently been devoted to developing glutamate receptors antagonists (mainly of the NMDA type) for acute and chronic neurodegeneration. Developing such a treatment that slows down the progression of the disease is extremely time and costs consuming. At present there is consensus that competitive NMDA receptor antagonists will not find therapeutic applications, in contrast to agents acting at the glycineB site, or channel blockers. Recently, at least seven glycine B antagonists (e. g. ACEA 1021, GV- 150526, GV- 196771 A, ZD- 9379, MRZ 2 / 576) and over 10 NMDA channel blockers (e. g. Remacemide, ARL- 15896 AR, HU- 211, ADCI, CNS- 5161, Neramexane-MRZ 2 / 579) have been under development, most of them as neuroprotective agents for acute (stroke, trauma) or chronic insult (e. g. Huntington’s or Alzheimer’s disease). Several substances selective for NR 2 B NMDA receptor subtypes such as: <b>eliprodil,</b> CP- 101606 and Ro- 25 - 6981 have been claimed to have a good neuroprotective profile. This presentation is an attempt to critically review preclinical and scarce clinical experience in the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotective agents according to the following scheme: rational, preclinical findings in animal models and finally clinical experience if available. The general impression is that NMDA receptor antagonists may find use in chronic type of neurodegeneration while AMPA antagonists seems to show better promise in acute insult...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8126 The polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine are {{ubiquitous}} compounents of eukaryotric {{cells in}} nature and are found in high concentrations in brain tissue. Polyamines have been implicated in cell growth, differentiation and nerve regeneration, but at high doses are neurotoxic. Administration of spermine (100 ?g icv) causes CNS excitation culminating in fatal tonic convulsions, within 8 hours. It is thought that spermine mediates this effect at least in part, through enhancement of activity on the NMDA receptor through positive modulatory extracellular binding site on the NMDA macrocomplex. To further enhance understanding of the mechanism of action of polyamines the antagonist potential of NMDA receptor antagonist, calcium channel antagonists, N 1 - dansylspermine and 6 novel polyamine analogues (Bu 31 b, Bu 37 b, Bu 33 b, Bu 40 b, Bu 36 b and Bu 43 b) from Brock University Canada, was assessed in the spermine CNS excitation model. The investigation revealed that the NMDA antagonists ifenprodil, <b>eliprodil,</b> arcaine and memantine inhibited the spermine-induced CNS excitation. L-type calcium channel antagonists, nisoldipine and nitrendipine, also were shown to inhibit the development of spermine-induced convulsions. N 1 -dansylspermine, a potent polyamine antagonist, also inhibited the effect of spermine. Of the novel polyamine analogues, Bu 36 b and Bu 43 b reduced the development of CNS excitation to the greatest degree. Bu 3 Ib and Bu 40 b {{did not have a}} pronounced inhibitory effect on spermine-induced convulsions. However, Bu 33 b and Bu 37 b did elicit an inhibitory effect on the development of spermine- induced CNS excitation...|$|E
