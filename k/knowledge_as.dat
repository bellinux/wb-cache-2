Humanity might at first revere the <b>knowledge</b> <b>as</b> having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} service {{is similar to}} other Pentecostal churches, for example the Assemblies of God. There is no formal order of service, but most churches follow a routine of congregational singing, an offering/tithe collection, prayer, a sermon and an altar call. During the service, congregants may operate in various spiritual gifts, such as a message in tongues, a prophecy and words of wisdom or <b>knowledge,</b> <b>as</b> {{inspired}} by the Holy Spirit. During the congregational singing part of a service, a believer’s attitude of worship is often expressed through raising their hands in the orans posture.|$|E

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, the College of the Marshall Islands {{announced}} {{the development of a}} new Marshallese Studies program, one whose only requirements were that it fit within the institution’s academic template and did not challenge accreditation standards. This paper asks the question of whether such an endeavor is possible, framed by an ethics of difference and paralogy theorized through a decolonizing lens. Here I am concerned with the effects of trying to create an area studies program that is disciplined within institutional assumptions of objectivity, truth, and a politics of neutrality, while simultaneously attempting to privilege the production of local Marshallese <b>knowledges</b> <b>as</b> legitimate in a colonial structure that forecloses on such spaces of political, ethical, and epistemological alterity. I consider a trio of problematic initiatives that fell short of legitimizing indigenous <b>knowledges,</b> <b>as</b> well as the difficulty and necessity of forcing the issue of institutional contingency through the privileging of Marshallese language. peer-reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Japanese {{forces were}} taking over Java and {{threatening}} the Allied headquarters at Bandung. On 5 March, the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers {{had to be}} evacuated from Bandung. Winckel {{was chosen as the}} pilot. He protested the decision, arguing that his lack of rest would hinder his chances of finding Bandung in the dark as he did not have any electronic aids. However, Winckel was seen {{to be one of the}} most experienced pilots because of his terrain <b>knowledge</b> <b>as</b> a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights. Another factor was that his Lodestar, although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome, was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission. Winckel flew to Java, where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights. He picked up fourteen passengers, refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{sought to}} ingratiate himself with Mehmed by sending out orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, {{enabling}} his captor to take command {{of more than}} 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, {{had no intention of}} sparing Stephen's life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović's document, but Mehmed's Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a fatwah declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his <b>knowledge.</b> <b>As</b> if to demonstrate the validity of his fatwah, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed. The chronicler Benedetto Dei, who claimed to {{have been part of the}} Sultan's retinue, recorded that Mehmed himself decapitated Stephen. According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field").|$|E

5|$|This {{traditional}} approach towards Byzantium has been partially or wholly disputed and revised by modern studies, which {{focus on the}} positive aspects of Byzantine culture and legacy. Averil Cameron regards as undeniable the Byzantine contribution to the formation of the medieval Europe, and both Cameron and Obolensky recognise the major role of Byzantium in shaping Orthodoxy, which in turn occupies a central position in the history and societies of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Georgia, Serbia and other countries. The Byzantines also preserved and copied classical manuscripts, and they are thus regarded as transmitters of the classical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>as</b> important contributors to the modern European civilization, and as precursors of both the Renaissance humanism and the Slav Orthodox culture.|$|E
5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of <b>knowledge</b> <b>as</b> to how to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized <b>knowledge</b> <b>as</b> well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
