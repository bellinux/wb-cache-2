5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004. It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a young woman from southern England who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to the North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
25|$|But Hester {{had been}} {{alienated from the}} Puritan society, both in her {{physical}} life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale dies, she knows she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on because she can no longer conform to the Puritans' strictness. Her thinking is free from religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs.|$|E

Therefore, the station on that channel <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> another channel number.|$|R

25|$|While {{students}} in {{lower secondary school}} stay in their classroom {{for most of the}} time (during physical education they go to the gym for example), in high school they will be the one to move from the classroom to the laboratory, but the teacher still <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from one classroom to another if the lesson is not held in a laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Buckling of {{an elastic}} {{structure}} strongly {{depends on the}} curvature of the constraints against which {{the ends of the}} structure are prescribed to move (see Bigoni, Misseroni, Noselli and Zaccaria, 2012). In fact, even a single-degree-of-freedom system (see Fig.3) may exhibit a tensile (or a compressive) buckling load as related to the fact that one end <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> along the circular profile labeled 'Ct' (labelled 'Cc').|$|E
25|$|In the episode, Phil's father visits {{unexpected}} {{bringing a}} dog, named Scout, with him. Claire is {{angry with him}} because he is planning to leave the dog with them but when he finally leaves and takes Scout with him, Claire is upset because she has bonded with him. Jay takes Manny {{with him to the}} movies to watch a movie that an old friend of Mitchell is playing in, but he does not know that is a horror movie, leading Manny to be scared causing troubles at home.

25|$|The Doppler {{effect is}} used in some types of radar, to measure the {{velocity}} of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Moonraker in 1979, the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, while clearly expressing his {{approval}} of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, criticised the pace in which {{the locations of the}} film evolved, remarking that, [...] "it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> at a trot just to make it into all the scenes". Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said of the film: [...] "Most rational observers agree that Moonraker is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time". However, while he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences, he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark [...] "I think he's attempting re-entry!" [...] by [...] "Q" [...] during Bond and Goodhead's orbiting of the Earth which he described as [...] "featuring what might be the best double entendre ever".|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{later became}} the center of disapproval from viewers, who felt Declan was moving on too fast after Bridget's death when he developed feelings for Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). Sorensen then backed the storyline, wanting his character to move on stating: [...] "It's a difficult situation. Declan was truly in love with Bridget. He was {{one of the lucky ones}} to have found his soul mate early in life, but at the same time, he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on and live his life." [...] further adding: [...] "A lot of people do think it's too soon for another relationship. But I can assure you that it's done very tastefully." [...] He then added an explanation to how Declan feels, adding: [...] "He feels as though he's cheated on Bridget and that he hasn't mourned for long enough to be able to move on without showing proper respect to the love of his life. He's left confused and upset." [...] As scenes from the storyline began to air Brewer made comment on the storyline reassuring viewers adding: [...] "I think they'll be okay with it... I think they'll be accepting. It's done very tastefully and very slowly. The two characters don't rush anything." ...|$|E
500|$|On a mixed note, Toure of Rolling Stone {{stated that}} the album's [...] "few sublime moments {{outweigh}} the lackluster album around them," [...] further praising [...] "Prettyman" [...] for being [...] "a roaring up-tempo number" [...] but panning [...] "Undisputed" [...] and [...] "Hot Wit' U" [...] for being [...] "the worst of his nineties work". Eamon Sweeney from Hot Press was also mixed in his review, stating that it [...] "would be hard to name another artist who can produce such a perfect soundtrack", but found at times that the singer [...] "ha lost his magic". Similarly, Robin Rothman of Village Voice enjoyed the collaborations, but opined that they would [...] "be better described as augmentations". In a very negative review, a critic from NME stated [...] "To paraphrase Woody Allen, genius is like a shark; it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward or it dies. And {{what we have here}} is a patchily impressive, fleetingly satisfying, but very, very dead shark". In a list compiled by staff members from Stereogum ranking the singer's albums out of thirty positions, they listed Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic at number 25. The site's consensus stated that among the album's tracks, his cover of [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] was the only highlight.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Hayes {{quit the}} serial and her exit storyline played {{out the same}} year. It was {{initially}} left unclear what impact her departure would have on Miles'. Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't agree with what she did or how she did it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles {{would have tried to}} talk her out of leaving if he had been made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings a little fun back into Miles' life." ...|$|E
