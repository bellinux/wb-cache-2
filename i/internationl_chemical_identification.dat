40|$|A {{new method}} for <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> based on {{orthogonal}} parallel liquid chromatography separation and accurate molecular weight confirmationRecent {{advances in the}} theory and application of orthogonal LC separation have allowed {{for the establishment of}} a more effective method for the <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> of target compounds in complex samples, especially structurally similar compounds. In this study, a new <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> method based on orthogonal parallel separation and accurate molecular weight confirmation was developed. An orthogonal separation system consisting of an XTerra MS C- 18 column, a home-made Click OEG column, and a Click CD column was established for separation and identification. In addition, 82 flavonoids were selected as references, to be used for the construction of a library. Retention times of each reference flavonoid on each column and accurate molecular weights were recorded and imported into a searchable library as "tags" for the unknown screening. For the method validation, two complex mixtures, fractions of Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, specifically, were separated and identified. In total, nine compounds were unequivocally identified by retention time and confirmation of accurate molecular weight, demonstrating that this method is suitable and efficient for the <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> of complex samples.

40|$|Atomic level {{understanding}} {{of water on}} titanium dioxide (TiO 2), in particular the mineral form anatase, is exceptionally important, considering its practical applications including photocatalytic water-splitting, photoinduced hydrophilicity, and water purification. 1 - 3 Although much effort {{has been devoted to}} the study of water adsorption and dissociation on anatase, investigating the fundamental steps of single water splitting remains challenging.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a language for expressing criteria for <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography paired with mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS) and presents computer-based tools implementing the language. The Computer Language for Indentifying Chemicals (CLIC) allows expressions that describe rules (or constraints) for selecting chemical peaks or data points based on multi-dimensional chromatographic properties and mass spectral characteristics. CLIC offers chromatographic functions of retention times, functions of mass spectra, numbers for quantitative and relational evaluation, and logical and arithmetic operators. The language is demonstrated with the compound-class selection rules described by Welthagen et al. [W. Welthagen, J. Schnelle-Kreis, R. Zimmermann, J. Chromatogr. A 1019 (2003) 233 – 249]. A software implementation of CLIC provides a calculator-like graphical user-interface (GUI) for building and applying selection expressions. From the selection calculator, expressions {{can be used}} to select chromatographic peaks that meet the criteria or create selection chromatograms that mask data points inconsistent with the criteria. Selection expressions can be combined with graphical, geometric constraints in the retention-time plane as a powerful component for <b>chemical</b> <b>identification</b> with template matching or used to speed and improve mass spectrum library searches...|$|R
40|$|Semiochemicals {{are often}} {{produced}} in infinitesimally small quantities, so their isolation requires {{large amounts of}} starting material, not only requiring significant effort in sample preparation, but also resulting in a complex mixture of compounds from which the bioactive compound needs to be purified and identified. Often, compounds cannot be unambiguously identified by their mass spectra alone, and NMR analysis is required for absolute <b>chemical</b> <b>identification,</b> further exacerbating the situation because NMR is relatively insensitive and requires large amounts of pure analyte, generally more than several micrograms. We developed an integrated approach for purification and NMR analysis of < 1 µg of material. Collections from high performance preparative gas-chromatography are directly eluted with minimal NMR solvent into capillary NMR tubes. With this technique, (1) H-NMR spectra were obtained on 50 ng of geranyl acetate, which served as a model compound, and reasonable H-H COSY NMR spectra were obtained from 250 ng of geranyl acetate.
