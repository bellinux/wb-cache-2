500|$|The first {{political}} philosopher to {{call himself}} an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term [...] "libertarianism" [...] has often {{been used as a}} synonym for anarchism and was used almost <b>exclusively</b> in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as libertarian anarchism.|$|R
5000|$|Since the 1890s, {{the term}} libertarianism {{has been used}} as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost <b>exclusively</b> in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> until the 1950s in the United States. At this time, {{classical}} liberals in the United States began to describe themselves as libertarians, and it has since become necessary to distinguish their individualist and capitalist philosophy from socialist anarchism. Thus, the former is often referred to as right-wing libertarianism, or simply right-libertarianism, whereas the latter is described by the terms libertarian socialism, socialist libertarianism, left-libertarianism, and left-anarchism. [...] Right-libertarians are divided into minarchists and anarcho-capitalists or voluntarists. Outside the English-speaking world, libertarianism generally retains its association with left-wing anarchism.|$|R

The 14 autonomous churches of Byzantine tradition have a single liturgical rite, but vary mainly in liturgical language, while on the contrary the single Latin Church has several distinct liturgical rites, whose universal main form, the Roman Rite, is practised in Latin or in the local vernacular).|$|R

40|$|The use of {{autonomous}} vehicles in air, {{land and water}} has grown in recent years, with increased attention given to heavily transited areas. For the case {{of autonomous}} underwater vehicles, these regions of interest include harbors and river basins where the risk of collision rapidly increases {{with the number of}} ships. This thesis presents a collision avoidance system based on passive acoustic sensing, which may be used to alert an AUV's autonomy software of the threat that an approaching vessel may represent in such shallow water environments. Experiments were conducted to collect and process data from static and vehicle-mounted hydrophone arrays, and preliminary measurements were post-processed using various signal smoothing and data-fitting techniques. Results were then compared with a mathematical model used to describe the expected sound propagation profile, to identify how the system was limited by disturbances in the test conditions, such as variable ship speed and bearing, with respect to the vehicle's frame of reference. The benefits and limitations of each data processing approach were identified, and are herein discussed through three separate case studies to highlight the benefit of parallel-model fitting. A Bluefin SandShark AUV was used for a series of deployments performed to test the vehicle's ability to change behaviors in response to approaching vessels that present a chance of collision, relying <b>exclusively</b> on <b>this</b> passive <b>sensing</b> system as the alarm trigger. During the final autonomous behavior-response experiments spanning six distinct deployments, a total of 21 successful alarm triggers were recorded in the vehicle logs, along with a cumulative 142 minutes of acoustic data. by Oscar Alberto Viquez Rojas.
