500|$|On April 8 or 12, the {{government}} capitulated. Low's Alberta Social Credit Act delivered what the insurgents wanted, including {{the creation of}} [...] "Alberta credit" [...] {{in the amount of}} [...] "the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services", the establishment of [...] "credit houses" [...] to distribute this credit, {{and the creation of a}} Social Credit Board. The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and [...] "if anyone gets <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> he's going to get into trouble... we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart." ...|$|E
500|$|In Peng's letter, Peng {{compared}} {{himself to}} the courageous but tactless Han dynasty general Zhang Fei. Because of Mao's appreciation of Zhang's enemy, Cao Cao, Mao interpreted this as implying a confrontational relationship. Peng criticized the poor allocation of labour across China, especially the inefficient, country-wide practice of forcing farmers to work in backyard furnaces. He criticized the nationwide famine and severe shortage of cotton, and stated that the Chinese people were justified in demanding change from the present conditions. Peng blamed {{the problems of the}} Great Leap on what he called [...] "problems <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> of thinking and style of work", especially the tendency for Party administrators to submit exaggerated production reports, and for Party bureaucrats to accept these figures uncritically. Peng blamed the mistakes of the Party on a culture of [...] "petty bourgeois fanaticism", a tendency to believe in achieving change through blindly encouraging mass movements, and claimed that the acceptance of this culture had led to the Party leadership forgetting [...] "the mass-line and the style of seeking truth from facts", which Peng believed had led to the Communist victories over the Japanese and Kuomintang. Peng criticized Mao's policy of [...] "putting politics in command", substituting economic principles and productive work for political objectives.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1972, an Ulster Vanguard {{political}} rally {{was held}} in Tobermore, where Ulster Unionist Party deputy leader, John Taylor, made a speech {{on the use of}} violence stating: [...] "We should make it clear that force means death and fighting, and whoever gets <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> whether republicans or those sent by the British government, there would be killings".|$|E

2500|$|It had {{its roots}} in the Vanguard or Ulster Vanguard wing of the Ulster Unionist Party who were opposed to the {{policies}} of the party's leader, and last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Brian Faulkner. The Ulster Vanguard movement was originally a political pressure group within the UUP. It was formed on 9 February 1972 and was led by William Craig (former Minister of Home Affairs at Stormont) with its deputy leaders Rev Martin Smyth and the former Stormont MP for Carrick, Captain Austin Ardill. At its first meeting in Lisburn, on 13 February 1972, Craig made the first of a number of bellicose pronouncements, declaring, [...] "God help those who get <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way</b> for we mean business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Chamberlain {{was always}} very {{supportive}} of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:The Armenian insurrection [...] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a [...] "diversion". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking {{as if it were}} umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened…No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all sides. During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>way.</b> And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction. At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other {{at a time when he}} believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged [...] "Yellow Peril". In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and has it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners. Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: [...] "This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it".|$|E
