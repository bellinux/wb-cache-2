50|$|As {{the date}} of opening drew near, the Directors found that the EP&DR was unwilling to spare a {{locomotive}} to work the line, as had been hoped, although {{they were prepared to}} <b>hire</b> <b>rolling</b> stock to the little company.

50|$|A railtour is {{a special}} train which is run {{in order to allow}} people to {{experience}} rail travel which is not available using timetabled passenger services. The 'unusual' aspect may be the route of the train, the destination, specific sections of railway track (for example, freight-only lines), the locomotive hauling the train, the rolling stock (passenger carriages), or any combination of these. Organisers may own or <b>hire</b> locomotives or <b>rolling</b> stock, or tours may be organised by railway management or other bodies outside the railway fraternity. Perhaps the most famous railtour in England was the Fifteen Guinea Special, the last steam hauled main line train run by British Railways. Railtours are often identifiable {{through the use of a}} train headboard, often identifying the name of the specific tour or the tour operator. On TOPS, railtours are always given a 1Zxx headcode.|$|R
