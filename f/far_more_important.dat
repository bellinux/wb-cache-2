5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its {{popularity}} in Japan is synonymous with RPGs. While the game's elements had been present in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set the template for others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior {{changed the nature of}} video game development by making scenario writers <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first Eblaites worshiped {{many other}} deities, {{such as the}} Syrian goddess Ishara, who was the goddess of the royal family. Ishtar was also worshiped but was {{mentioned}} only five times {{in one of the}} monthly offering lists, while Ishara was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> appearing 40 times. Other deities included Damu; the Mesopotamian god Utu; Ashtapi; Dagan; Hadad (Hadda) and his consort Habadu; and Shipish, the goddess of the sun who had a temple dedicated to her cult. The four city gates were named after the gods Dagan, Hadda, Rasap and Utu, but it is unknown which gate had which name. Overall, the offering list mentioned about 40 deities receiving sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{commenced}} in Toraja in the 1970s, {{and accelerated}} in the 1980s and 1990s. Between 1984 and 1997, {{a significant number}} of Torajans obtained their incomes from tourism, working in and owning hotels, as tour guides, drivers, or selling souvenirs. With the rise of political and economic instability in Indonesia in the late 1990s—including religious conflicts elsewhere on Sulawesi—tourism in Tana Toraja has declined dramatically. Toraja continues to be a well known origin for Indonesian coffee, grown by both smallholders and plantation estates, although migration, remittances and off-farm income is considered <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> to most households, even those in rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Cheese was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> as a foodstuff, {{especially}} for common people, {{and it has}} been suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Woodfull led the Australians back to England for a {{tour that}} was to mend {{relations}} after assurances had been given that bodyline would not be repeated. The Australians won 2–1, and Woodfull remains the only first captain to regain the Ashes twice. Woodfull was criticised for adopting excessively cautious tactics after the advent of bodyline. Woodfull retired after the tour; his family claimed that the bodyline controversy had sapped his passion for cricket. The British king offered Woodfull a knighthood for his services to cricket, and in reference to his actions during the bodyline series, but Woodfull declined, stating that {{his work as a}} teacher was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than cricket. A mathematics teacher, Woodfull went on to become headmaster at his alma mater, Melbourne High School.|$|E

5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His government would not accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important,</b> he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|A key {{criticism}} of the Act {{at the time as}} well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices—this was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929–33 had depressed prices 20% and more. There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited. But other economists disagree, pointing to <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression. Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.|$|E
5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.|$|E

The outer works were {{finished}} by 1687 and, beginning in 1663, {{the town of}} Gotha was also fortified. In 1672, the House of Saxe-Altenburg ended {{and most of the}} Duchy passed to Ernst, who now was ruler of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Although the Duchy now had two Residenzen, Gotha was by <b>far</b> the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> one.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also criticized}} Freud's dualistic thinking. According to Fromm, Freudian {{descriptions}} of human consciousness as struggles between two poles was narrow and limiting. Fromm also condemned {{him as a}} misogynist unable to think outside the patriarchal milieu of early 20th century Vienna. However, Fromm expressed a great respect for Freud and his accomplishments, {{in spite of these}} criticisms. Fromm contended that Freud was one of the [...] "architects of the modern age", alongside Albert Einstein and Karl Marx, but emphasized that he considered Marx both <b>far</b> <b>more</b> historically <b>important</b> than Freud and a finer thinker.|$|R

5000|$|Palgrave {{published}} both {{criticism and}} poetry, but {{his work as}} a critic was by <b>far</b> the <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> His Visions of England (1880-1881) has dignity and lucidity, but little of the [...] "natural magic" [...] which the greatest of his predecessors in the Oxford chair considered rightly to be the test of inspiration. His last volume of poetry, Amenophis, appeared in 1892. His criticism is considered to demonstrate fine and sensitive tact, quick intuitive perception, and generally sound judgment. His Handbook to the Fine Arts Collection, International Exhibition, 1862, and his Essays on Art (1866), though flawed, were full of striking judgments strikingly expressed.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "twin pillars" [...] of {{the economy}} are tourism and {{financial}} services. Politically, tourism is the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> of the two, as it employs {{a greater number of}} people within the territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors). Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial centre are by <b>far</b> the <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).|$|R
50|$|The Christian left {{sometimes}} approaches {{issues such}} as homosexuality differently from other Christian political groups. This approach can be driven by focusing on issues differently despite holding similar religious views, or by holding different religious ideas. Those in the Christian Left who have similar ideas as other Christian political groups but a different focus may view Christian teachings on certain issues, such as the Bible's prohibitions against killing or criticisms of concentrations of wealth, as <b>far</b> <b>more</b> politically <b>important</b> than Christian teachings on social issues emphasized by the religious right, such as opposition to homosexuality. Others in the Christian Left have not only a different focus on issues from other Christian political groups, but different religious ideas as well.|$|R

60|$|Although every {{variation}} is {{either directly or}} indirectly caused by some change in the surrounding conditions, we must never forget that the nature of the organisation which is acted on, is by <b>far</b> the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> factor in the result.

Although some of these latter cases are due to reversion, others cannot thus be accounted for.|$|R

50|$|To avoid a long sea {{crossing}} over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the Bosphorus to Turkey, traversing the Levant, then bypassing the Sahara Desert {{by following the}} Nile valley southwards, or follow a western route over the Strait of Gibraltar. These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy. The eastern route is by <b>far</b> the <b>more</b> <b>important</b> with 530,000 white storks using it annually, making the species the second commonest migrant there (after the European honey buzzard).

2500|$|Freud {{has been}} {{compared}} to Marx by Reich, who saw Freud's importance for psychiatry as parallel to that of Marx for economics, and by Paul Robinson, who sees Freud as a revolutionary whose contributions to twentieth century thought are comparable in importance to Marx's contributions to nineteenth century thought.

Fromm nevertheless credits Freud with permanently changing the way human nature is understood. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari write in Anti-Oedipus (1972) that psychoanalysis resembles the Russian Revolution in that it became corrupted almost from the beginning. They believe this began with Freud's development of the theory of the Oedipus complex, which they see as idealist.|$|R
