40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with three different fixed pressure-measuring <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> sensor configurations which were strut-mounted on a nose boom. The tests were performed at free-stream Mach numbers from 0. 2 to 3. 6. The boom-angle-of-attack range was - 6 to 15 deg, and the angle-of-sideslip range was - 6 to 6 deg. The test Reynolds numbers were from 3. 28 million to 65. 6 million per meter. The results were used to obtain angle-of-attack and angle-of-sideslip calibration curves for the configurations. Signal outputs from the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> sensor had to be specially processed to obtain accurate real-time angle-of-attack and angle-of-sideslip measurements for pilot displays or aircraft systems. Use of the fixed sensors in flight showed them to be rugged and reliable and suitable {{for use in a}} high temperature environment...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to fabricate a silver nano-mouth array via a cost-effective <b>inverted</b> <b>hemispherical</b> colloidal lithography method. It shows that the nano-mouth supports a strong localized surface plasmonresonance,which results in anextraordinary opticaltransmission peak. When the nano-moutharray is transferred on to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, we show that the localized surface plasmon resonance can be tuned via the swelling and recovery of the PDMS in ethyl acetate solvent. The resonant peak can be tuned with a relative bandwidth of over 10 %. We also demonstrate the refractive index sensitivity of the nano-mouth array at a wavelength of 1300 nm. This structure might be useful for optical microfluidic devices and sensors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{developed}} {{a method to}} fabricate a periodic array of three-dimensional crescent-like holes (3 DCLH) via an <b>inverted</b> <b>hemispherical</b> colloidal lithography. It is found that there exists an extraordinary optical transmission in this non-planar perforated periodic array of 3 DCLH when the electric field of the incident light is perpendicular to the cross-line of the crescent-like hole. This extraordinary optical peak is insensitive with the incident angles and sensitive with the angle between the electric field of the incident light to the cross-line of the 3 DCLH. Numerical simulation based on finite-difference time-domain method reveals that this peak is caused by an asymmetric localized surface plasmon resonance.

50|$|Douglas {{motorcycles}} {{also became}} popular in dirt track racing. The 1923 RA model with disc brakes was favoured initially and this prompted Douglas to build specific dirt track models. These motorcycle designs were gradually increased {{in size and}} power with 500 cc and 600 cc engines fitted to the DT5 and DT6 Dirt Track models in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The engines had <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> and a short rigid forged crankshaft. They dominated dirt track racing for about three years. In 1929, the most successful dirt racing year, 1,200 Dirt Track motorcycles were sold.|$|R
50|$|Alfa Romeo has {{produced}} many successful hemi-head engines throughout the years. Arguably {{one of their}} most beloved examples is Giuseppe Busso's original 2.5-liter V6, which has been cited by some {{as one of the best}} and most distinctive sounding production engines (even in its latter 24v forms) of all time. Part of this praise is likely because the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> on the original 2-valve engine allowed for an almost completely straight exhaust port, resulting in a less diluted or muddied engine sound, allowing Alfa Romeo to use quieter stock exhausts without losing much of their distinct and beloved race-bred engine noise.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} white to pale yellow and {{arranged}} in <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads,</b> {{mostly on the}} ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering but sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The heads are about 18 mm in diameter and contain 3 to 10 individual flowers. The petals are 1.7-3 mm long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 10 to 18 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody, barrel-shaped capsules more or less scattered along the branches.|$|R
50|$|The {{single most}} {{significant}} technical {{achievement in the}} development of Dolphin is the pressure hull itself. It is a constant diameter cylinder, closed at its ends with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads,</b> and utilizes deep frames instead of bulkheads. The entire design of the pressure hull has been kept as simple as possible to facilitate its use in structural experiments and trials. Hull openings have been minimized for structural strength and minimum hull weight, in addition to eliminating possible sources for flooding casualties. The submarine has no snorkel mast; her one hatch must be open while her diesels are running.|$|R
5000|$|At top {{dead centre}} the pistons of a petrol engine are flush (or nearly flush) with {{the top of the}} {{cylinder}} block. The combustion chamber may be a recess either in the cylinder head, or {{in the top of the}} piston. A design with the combustion chamber in the piston is called a Heron head, where the head is machined flat but the pistons are dished. The Heron head has proved even more thermodynamically efficient than the <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head.</b> Intake valves [...] permit the inflow of a fuel air mix; and exhaust valves allow burnt gases to be scavenged.|$|R
5000|$|From 1984 to 1988 the {{standard}} G10 engine used a <b>hemispherical</b> <b>head</b> carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates {{in the form}} of throttle body injection and hydraulic lifters. A detuned [...] unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as 58 miles per gallon. In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use throttle body injection for fuel delivery.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{ships are}} {{launched}} using {{a series of}} inflated tubes underneath the hull, which deflate to cause a downward slope into the water. This procedure has the advantages of requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. The airbags provide support to the hull {{of the ship and}} aid its launching motion into the water, thus this method is arguably safer than other options such as sideways launching. These airbags are usually cylindrical in shape with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> at both ends.The Xiao Qinghe shipyard launched a tank barge with marine airbags on January 20, 1981, the first known use of marine airbags.|$|R
50|$|The {{buoyancy}} effect of water makes swimming close to non-weight bearing. It allows {{the horse to}} maintain condition while reducing trauma to joints, making it especially useful for animals recovering from joint-related lameness. However, weight-bearing rehabilitation is also important before the animal goes back to normal exercise, since swimming does not maintain joint tone. Additionally, swimming encourages the horse to maintain a <b>hollow,</b> <b>inverted</b> position with the head up, back dropped, and legs kicking out behind it. It is therefore less suitable for riding horses {{that are expected to}} develop the strength to carry the back up with an engaged hind end, and may also be associated with back or stifle problems.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s, Ford {{designed}} {{and produced a}} small-block engine with <b>hemispherical</b> <b>heads</b> to address the growing concerns about fuel economy.

This plus {{the cost of the}} valve actuation systems, along with the cost of the high pressure pump needed to deliver fuel directly into the chamber, as well as the gilmer belt drive system needed to drive the pump, made further development pointless at the time. Most 1980s 4-cylinder Fords used the Ford CVH engine, CVH meaning [...] "Compound Valve, Hemispherical (Head)".|$|R
