This study investigates the macroscopic models <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> characteristics on a new weaving section on the Taiwan National Freeway Systems, focusing on the interrelations between the traffic speed, density, and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> the congestion traffic conditions. The analysis based on these driver behaviors includes 100 % lane-changing and 65. 22 % weaving activities. The results for this study show the fundamental interrelation <b>of</b> traffic <b>flow</b> characteristics on the completely congestion traffic flow condition similar to Greenshield model and showing no influence on lane changing and weaving activities. These regression models concludes that the critical density is 55. 74 vehicles per kilometer, the speed is 34. 29 kilometer per hour, and the maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> (capacity) is 1854 vehicles per hour per lane, respectively.

40|$|From February to September 1954, {{observations}} were　made <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> and {{the water}} temperatures at a spring called　"Tanaka-no-Yu", Misasa Hot Springs, Tottori Prefecture. Simultaneously with these observations, the water level of the River Misasa and that of an irrigation　stream nearby were also determined. The procedures for the observations {{were the same as}} in the previous report. Comparing the results here obtaind wite those previously obtaind, and referring to the conclusions in the previous　report, the author has been led to the following conclusions. From the observations in the period from February to September, 1954, as from those in the period from June, 1953 to　January, 1954, a positive correlation　was found between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> {{and the water}} teperature, the correlarion coefficient being 0. 828 (highly significant). The analsis of variance of the obseryed results showed that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> and the water temperature appear to be affected by the water levels of the River and of the irrigation stream, and also　by their interaction. This conclusion supports what was deduced in the previous report. The average water levels of the River and of the irrigation stream, the average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> and the average water temperatures, for the　period from June to September in 1953, were compared with　those for the period from June to September in 1954. The differences in the average water levels of the River, the average <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> and the average water temperatures are significant; while that in average water levels of the　stream is not significant. From this it may be concluded that the increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> {{and the rise of the}} water temperature were resulted from the upheaval of the water level of the River, which followed the construction of a dam there...|$|R
