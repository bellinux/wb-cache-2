40|$|The {{presence}} of {{high concentrations of}} microorganisms in the water of <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> is a phenomenon that is now recog-nized by the scientific community; however, knowledge {{about the risks of}} infection associ-ated with this phenomenon and the ways to decontaminate the tubing of <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> has not advanced a great deal over the past 5 years. During that time, there has been no prolif-eration of infections, and documented cases of infections linked to the water of <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> have been rare. 1, 2 There are 4 possible reasons for the low number of documented cases: such cases truly are rare; in instances where litiga-tion is undertaken, the matter is settled out of court, without being made public; cases that have occurred have not been published; or it has been difficult to correlate probable cases with dental treatments. Bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas, Legionella, Mycobacterium and others) are thought to be the primary source of risk, but the {{presence of}} amoebae in freshwater also repre-sents a potential risk. Infections caused by fresh-water amoebae are rare but serious and may be fatal if they reach the brain. 3 These infections include keratitis (which may be caused by Acanthamoeba) and meningoencephaliti...|$|R
40|$|Background: The hygienic-microbiological {{control of}} 6 <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> being in {{use for the}} past 16 years {{revealed}} a significantly increased microbial contamination of their cooling water system. In order {{to comply with the}} requirements of the drinking water directive (“Trinkwasserverordnung”), the commercially available production system ActiDes, producing on-site ActiDes-Blue which is based on hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and generated by anodic oxidation, was investigated. Method: Water samples from the 6 contaminated <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> were examined for the total number of colony forming units (cfu), contamination with molds, L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa. The control period for the total colony count was 4 weeks (8 samples/unit). The subsequent application phase of the ActiDes-Blue procedure was 6 months (31 samples/unit). Additionally, the redox potential and the pH value were measured...|$|R

40|$|SummaryUbiquitous {{free-living}} amoebae of {{the genus}} Acanthamoeba can be pathogenic and can serve as carriers of other pathogenic organisms. These amoebae are potentially dangerous when they contaminate health facilities, and these organisms may act {{as a source of}} infection for medical personnel and those seeking medical care. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the extent to which Acanthamoeba species contaminate hemodialysis and <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> in Alexandria, Egypt. Seventy samples were collected aseptically from these systems and cultivated on non-nutrient agar at room temperature, followed by morphological confirmation of the identity of Acanthamoeba using trichrome-stained smears. This study revealed that 42. 9 % of water samples from the hydraulic systems of both hemodialysis and <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> were positive for Acanthamoeba, with no statistically significant difference between the two unit types or between pre- and post-disinfection samples for each type of unit. The surgical category of dental clinics had the highest contamination rate (72. 7 %), whereas no contamination was observed for water samples from pediatric dentistry clinics. In conclusion, the hydraulic systems of hemodialysis and <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> in Alexandria are contaminated with Acanthamoeba species, and to minimize the risk of human infections, there is an urgent need to implement effective preventative measures, such as the installation of water filtration units...|$|R

25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> were raised for service in Japan {{as part of}} the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in 1946. In 1948, Australia's {{part-time}} military force was re-raised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> were raised in each State to provide support to CMF units. Regular Army units were also raised in each State, and at major training establishments. That year the corps gained Royal assent when they were granted the title of the Royal Australian Army Dental Corps in recognition of its service during the war. At this time the corps colour was changed to green, although it was changed back to burnt orange in 1961. Later, further Regular Army units were raised for overseas service during the Korean War, Confrontation and the Vietnam War.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} tooth {{loss and}} retention in 500 dry maxillae of adult South African Bantu-speaking blacks. The tribe, sex, and stated {{age at death}} were available. Specimens were equally distributed over the third to the seventh decades of life. The presence of <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> was recorded and analyzed between and within age groups. A total of 5063 <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> was recorded. Reduction of the frequency of <b>dental</b> <b>units</b> was mild and not significant between the third andfourth decades of life and between the sixth and seventh. Severe and signif-icant tooth loss was recorded between the fourth and the fifth, and between thefifth and the sixth decades of life. Specimensfrom younger individuals (from 21 to 30 years of age) retained more teeth in the anterior region; after the third decade of life, {{there was a clear}} and significant persistence of canines with tendency toward loss of teeth anterior and posterior to them. Based upon the present observations and previous studies in this population, it is suggested that: (a) in most teeth, tooth retention pattern is indirectly related to periodontal bone loss (In the canines, however, the long roots rather than "resistance " to periodontitis may be the cause for the relatively high longevity rate); and (b) caries may have been the main cause for tooth loss until the fourth decade of life- later, periodontal disease may have become the predominant rea-son...|$|R
