5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E
5|$|Several {{different}} {{habitat types}} {{are found in}} Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs {{and a variety of}} coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves, particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.|$|E

5|$|Other animals became locally extinct through overhunting. The last elk in Pennsylvania {{was killed}} in Elk County in 1867. The Pennsylvania Game Commission brought 177 animals from the Rocky Mountains to the state from 1913 to 1926; today the elk herd of over 600 animals can often be seen in Quehanna Wild Area. Between 1906 and 1925, Pennsylvania became so {{concerned}} about declining numbers of white-tailed <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> it imported nearly 1,200animals from Michigan to re-establish the species, and made it the official state animal in 1959. In the early 21st century, over-grazing by deer threatens plant diversity. By the early 20th century, the fisher, a small mammal similar to the European polecat or American marten, was hunted to extinction in Pennsylvania. Between 1994 and 1998, 190animals were released in five sites {{in the northern part}} of the state, including 23animals along Quehanna's Wykoff Run in 1995. Breeding populations of fisher appear to have been reestablished.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) by Valmiki {{does not}} mention Maya Sita. Sita, the princess of Mithila, is married to Rama, the prince of Ayodhya.

Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, plots to abduct Sita, aided by Maricha, who transforms into a magical golden deer (Maya mriga, an illusional <b>deer),</b> <b>that</b> entices Sita. While in exile in Dandaka forest, Rama goes after the deer and slays it. The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama's voice. Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama, leaving her alone. Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her. He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. When Rama doubts Sita's chastity, she undergoes a trial by fire (Agni Pariksha). Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that if she has been faithful to Rama let the fire not harm her; she comes out unscathed with the fire-god Agni as proof of her purity. Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen.|$|E

25|$|Moose also eat many aquatic plants, {{including}} lilies and pondweed. Moose {{are excellent}} swimmers and {{are known to}} wade into water to eat aquatic plants. This trait serves a second purpose in cooling down the moose on summer days and ridding itself of black flies. Moose are thus attracted to marshes and river banks during warmer months as both provide suitable vegetation to eat and water to wet themselves in. Moose {{have been known to}} dive underwater to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complex snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> are capable of feeding underwater. As an adaptation for feeding on plants underwater, the nose is equipped with fatty pads and muscles that close the nostrils when exposed to water pressure, preventing water from entering the nose. Other species can pluck plants from the water too, but these need to raise their heads in order to swallow.|$|E

500|$|The site's {{history in}} the Anglo-Saxon period begins with the {{division}} of the Isle of Thanet into eastern and western parts during the 7th century. The division is attributed in medieval sources to the route taken by a tame female <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> was set free to run across the island by Æbbe, founder and first abbess of the double monastery at Minster-in-Thanet, thereby marking out its endowment. The route was circuitous, beginning {{on the north side of}} the island at Westgate-on-Sea and ending on the south side at Sheriff's Court, halfway between Minster-in-Thanet and Monkton, which are about [...] apart. While land to the east of this route was given to Æbbe for her monastery, which was in existence by 678, land to the west, described broadly as Westanea, or [...] "the western part of the island", was given to the monastery at Reculver by King Hlothhere of Kent in 679. This division of the island is apparent in Domesday Book, which was compiled in 1086, and remained an important feature in the early 15th century, when it was included prominently in a map of the island drawn up by Thomas Elmham. According to Edward Hasted the division was still marked in 1800 by [...] "a bank, or lynch, which goes quite across the island, and is commonly called St. Mildred's lynch." ...|$|E
500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby <b>deer</b> <b>that</b> had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E
