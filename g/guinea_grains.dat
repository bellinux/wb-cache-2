In 1717, Great Britain adopted the gold standard, {{at a rate of}} one <b>guinea</b> to 129.438 <b>grains</b> (8.38 g) of crown gold, which was 22 carat gold.|$|R
40|$|A {{regional}} sorghum head-bug {{and grain}} mold resistance trial {{was conducted in}} 1996 and 1997 at 15 and 13 research stations located in 10 West and Central African countries, respectively. Two cultivars namely IS 14384 and CGM 39 / 17 - 2 - 2 exhibited consistently high levels of resistance both to head-bugs and grain molds over years and localities. Eurystylus oldi was the dominant head-bug species at all localities except in Benin, Chad and <b>Guinea.</b> Sorghum <b>grain</b> mycoflora varied little between sites with genera Phoma and Fusarium dominating, followed by Curvularia. Efficiency of the insecticidal treatment on head-bug incidence partially confirmed the critical role played by head-bugs in aggravating mold infectio...|$|R

This spice, {{commonly}} known as ossame, grains of paradise, Melegueta pepper, alligator pepper, <b>Guinea</b> <b>grains,</b> fom wisa, or Guinea pepper, is obtained from the ground seeds; it imparts a pungent, peppery flavour with hints of citrus.|$|E
50|$|Fort William, {{also known}} as Anomabu Castle, was {{designed}} by the British engineer John Apperley and constructed between 1753 and 1760. It is about 10 mi from Cape Coast Castle. After his death in 1756, Irishman Richard Brew took over the Governorship of the fort and continued its construction. The Anomabu fort {{became the center of}} British slave trading along the Gold Coast until the practice was outlawed in 1807. In the same year, a small garrison successfully resisted the entire Ashanti army, although the city suffered greatly from the attack. In the later 19th century, it exported in palm oil, ivory, gold dust, peanuts, and <b>Guinea</b> <b>grains</b> in exchange for considerable imports of manufactured goods. Its population in the 1870s was around 4500.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of farmers` crop management practices on Striga infestation and maize grain yield. Sixty farmers` fields were randomly selected in nine communities across three savanna zones. About 35 % of the farmers had cultivated their fields for over 10 years, 48 % grew the Striga resistant variety 97 TZL Comp- 1 -W, 68 % planted maize in mid-June and 60 % practiced legume-maize rotation. About 33 % intercropped maize + cowpea, 42 % applied 100 kg N ha - 1 and 87 % conducted 2 to 3 hoe weedings. The Striga resistant maize variety reduced Striga count and host damage score and increased grain yield ha - 1 in northern and southern Guinea savannas. However, the varieties grown in Sudan savanna increased Striga count ha - 1 (R = 0. 56 **) and Striga damage (R = 0. 59 **) because they were not resistant to Striga. Planting maize in mid-July reduced Striga infestation in northern <b>Guinea,</b> but <b>grain</b> yield ha - 1 was highest when maize was planted in mid-June in all three zones. Soybean-maize or groundnut-maize rotation reduced Striga count in all the agro-ecosystems. Relay intercropping of cowpea into maize reduced Striga count in northern Guinea. Higher nitrogen fertilizer rate reduced Striga count and score and significantly increased grain yield in the three zones. Two or three hoe weedings reduced Striga count in the three zones and Striga score in Sudan savanna. Thus, the farmers` practices sampled significantly influenced Striga infestation of maize fields in the three agro-ecosystems. The Striga resistant maize variety, Soybean-maize rotation, 100 kg N ha - 1 and three hoe weedings could serve as component technologies in an integrated package for combating Striga menace in the region.
