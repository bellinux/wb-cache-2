40|$|The {{effect of}} {{oxidative}} stress induced by neurotoxic metal ions on {{the properties of}} the brain 20 S proteasome or multicatalytic proteinase complex (MPC) has been studied. Exposure of the 20 S proteasome to increasing amounts of Fe(III), Fe(II), Cu(II) or Zn(II) affects its main hydrolytic activities: trypsin-like (T-L), chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L), peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase (PGPH), branched-chain amino acid preferring (BrAAP) and caseinolytic activities, although in different ways. T-L activity showed gradual activation by both iron ions but inhibition by Cu(II) and Zn(II). ChT-L and PGPH activities were inhibited whereas BrAAP activity was widely activated by all the tested metal salts except for zinc ions. Moreover, the exposure to <b>ferrous</b> <b>salt</b> increased the degradation rate of casein. The functional effects appear to be linked to oxidation-induced modifications, as demonstrated by an increase of carbonyl groups following the exposure to metal ions. In addition, modifications induced by <b>ferrous</b> <b>salt</b> on the catalytic subunits were also supported by western blot analyses performed using anti-X, anti-Y and anti-Z antibodies.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that fats and oils develop rancidity when exposed to the air. Atmospheric oxygen attacks the {{unsaturated}} triglyceride molecules with the formation of many oxidation products, among which peroxidic and carbonyl compounds are the most important. This deterioration of the fat results in the production of off-flavours and odours which render the fat unpalatable. Many chemical tests have been employed for the detection of rancidity which depend on the presence of these compounds. Recently a very sensitive method has been developed based on the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric by the peroxides present in an oxidized fat. The ferric ion produced is determined colorimetrically as ferric thiocyanate. This method has recently been severely criticized by Lea, who stated that the method was subject to serious error owing to the interference of atmospheric oxygen. The presence of air in the reaction mixture has also resulted in high peroxide values of fats and oils when determined by other modifications of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>salt</b> method.

40|$|In November 2012, the Beaver Water District (BWD) {{switched}} primary oxidants {{from free}} chlorine to chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) to curb formation of trihalomethanes, a regulated group of organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs).

In this study, two <b>ferrous</b> <b>salts</b> - ferrous chloride (FC) and ferrous sulfate (FS) - were compared as secondary coagulants in combination with alum, the primary coagulant. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>salts</b> were dosed stoichiometrically to reduce chlorite and alum was dosed at percentages (0 - 100 %) relative to a typical alum dose at the BWD, 30 mg/L as alum. Settled water turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chloride to sulfate mass ratio (CSMR), solids settleability, and water filterability were assessed in laboratory scale bench tests and pilot plant studies {{as a function of}} percent alum dose reduction (ADR). Results from bench scale jar tests and pilot plant study showed that settled water turbidity and DOC were not compromised up to ~ 40 % ADR (18 mg/L as alum) and were indifferent to the type of ferrous salt added. As expected, CSMR, a corrosion surrogate, increased with increasing ADR (or decreasing sulfate addition) and was higher for the FC-treated waters compared to the FS-treated waters. However, CSMR remained below the suggested threshold of 0. 6 for ADR values up to 60 %, indicating both <b>ferrous</b> <b>salts</b> were viable options for chlorite quenching at BWD.

40|$|The {{addition}} of <b>ferrous</b> <b>salts</b> is a commonly used strategy for sulfide control in sewer networks. The Fe(2 +) dosing requirement in rising main sewers which {{takes into account}} {{of the effect of}} anaerobic sewer biofilms on the dosing demand is investigated. A laboratory-scale rising main sewer, consisting of four biofilm reactors in series and fed with real sewage, was operated for over 12 months, during which FeCl(2) was dosed at several locations and at various dosing rates. The experimental results consistently revealed that approximately 0. 7 mol of Fe(2 +) was required to precipitate sulfide formed from the reduction of 1 mol of sulfate by anaerobic sewer biofilms. This ratio is significantly lower than the ratio expected from reaction stoichiometry (molar ratio of 1 : 1), and also the Fe(2 +) to sulfide ratio (1. 07 - 1. 10 mol: 1 mol) observed in batch tests conducted with real wastewater in the absence of sewer biofilms. Biofilms adapted to Fe(2 +) addition were found to contain a substantially higher amount of elemental sulfur than biofilms not receiving Fe(2 +) dosage. This suggests Fe(2 +) addition might have altered the final product of sulfate reduction by anaerobic sewer biofilms. The study also showed that the {{addition of}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>salts</b> at the inlet of a rising main sewer can effectively control sulfide throughout the whole system despite of the presence of competing anions in wastewater.
