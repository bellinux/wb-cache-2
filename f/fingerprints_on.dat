5|$|Records {{from the}} Auburn Public Library, when subpoenaed, showed that Nickell had checked out {{numerous}} books about poisons, including Human Poisonings from Native and Cultivated Plants and Deadly Harvest. The former was marked as overdue in library records, indicating that Nickell had borrowed but never returned it. The FBI identified Nickell's <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> cyanide-related {{pages of a}} number of the works she had checked out from the library in this period.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{it emerged}} that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> {{the letters and}} used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, {{but that he had}} made errors, such as leaving a copy of an {{extortion}} demand on a newsagent's photocopier, however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself. Although Dyer initially demanded only £200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated £5million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo.|$|E

5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E

5|$|Mark {{shows an}} {{interest}} in Paige, but discovers she is dating Tyler. He later learns {{that this is a}} ruse to cover up their involvement with Dimato, who has bought the garage. They eventually regain Mark's trust after helping to bring Dimato to justice, and Mark and Paige reunite. Mark and Tyler's brother Aaron (Matt Wilson) comes to stay with them, and they are later joined by their father Russell (Russell Kiefel), who has a strained relationship with his sons. The Brennans consider buying the garage together, but Tyler later reveals that Russell abused him when he was younger. Mark and Aaron support Tyler and force Russell to leave. Mark and Paige discuss their future together when he admits that he is ready to have children, while she is not. Mark asks Tyler to buy Number 24 with him. They brothers fall out when Tyler learns that Mark tried to protect Aaron from arrest during his investigation into the Erinsborough High fire. While discussing their future, Mark and Paige get engaged. Mark is deeply critical of Paige when she befriends Dimato's lover Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who claims to be on the run from Dimato. The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's <b>fingerprints</b> <b>on</b> them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were trying to set her up and that Paul helped her deal with the situation, and that she did not tell Mark to protect him. Furious at Paige for further lies after promising there would be no secrets between them, Mark calls off the wedding. He later apologises and tries to convince Paige to take him back, but she refuses, wanting to find direction in her life and believing they are too different.|$|E

40|$|Spectral {{fingerprinting}} {{of chemical}} indicators, using computer screens as light sources and web cameras as imaging detectors, is an emerging approach for chemical sensing {{with the potential}} to coexist in common consumer electronic devices. The migration of this technique to mobile phones is key to extend this sensing approach to the most ubiquitous and familiar type of instrumentation. Here, we investigate the feasibility and performance of spectral <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>on</b> reference samples using a standard mobile phone as a complete measuring platform, where the screen provides controlled illumination while the front camera is the imaging detector. Key elements for the execution of such experiments are the software design, the definition of the sample layout, the type of alignment between the phone and the sample, and the influence of ambient illumination. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of reflectance <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>on</b> standard mobile phones and identify the operating conditions of the key parameters that produce an adequate evaluation performance.

50|$|When {{a firearm}} or a bullet or {{cartridge}} case are {{recovered from a}} crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic <b>fingerprint</b> <b>on</b> the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic <b>fingerprint</b> <b>on</b> the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators {{may be able to}} connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.|$|R
