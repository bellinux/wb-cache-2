40|$|Proton pumping A-type {{cytochrome}} c oxidase (CcO) terminates {{the respiratory}} chains of mitochondria and many bacteria. Three possible proton transfer pathways (D, K, and H channels) {{have been identified}} based on structural, functional, and mutational data. Whereas the D channel provides the route for all pumped protons in bacterial A-type CcOs, studies of bovine mitochondrial CcO have led to suggestions that its <b>H</b> <b>channel</b> instead provides this route. Here, we have studied H-channel function by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on the entire, as well as core, structure of bovine CcO in a lipid-solvent environment. The majority of residues in the <b>H</b> <b>channel</b> do not undergo large conformational fluctuations. Its upper and middle regions have adequate hydration and H-bonding residues to form potential proton-conducting channels, and Asp 51 exhibits conformational fluctuations that have been observed crystallographically. In contrast, throughout the simulations, we do not observe transient water networks that could support proton transfer from the N phase toward heme a via neutral His 413, regardless of a labile H bond between Ser 382 and the hydroxyethylfarnesyl group of heme a. In fact, the region around His 413 only became sufficiently hydrated when His 413 was fixed in its protonated imidazolium state, but its calculated pK(a) is too low for this to provide the means to create a proton transfer pathway. Our simulations show that the electric dipole moment of residues around heme a changes with the redox state, hence suggesting that the <b>H</b> <b>channel</b> could play a more general role as a dielectric well...|$|E

The subcellular localization and biophysical properties of h channels govern their function, but the mechanisms controlling these characteristics, and especially the potential role of auxiliary subunits or other binding proteins, remain unclear. We focused on TRIP 8 b, an h channel-interacting protein that colocalizes with HCN 1 in cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendrites, {{and found that it}} exists in multiple alternative splice variants with distinct effects on <b>h</b> <b>channel</b> trafficking and function. The developmentally regulated splice variants of TRIP 8 b all shared dual, C terminus-located interaction sites with HCN 1. When coexpressed with HCN 1 in heterologous cells individual TRIP 8 b isoforms similarly modulated gating of I h, causing a hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence of channel activation, but differentially upregulated or downregulated I h current density and HCN 1 surface expression. In hippocampal neurons, coexpression of TRIP 8 b isoforms with HCN 1 produced isoform-specific changes of HCN 1 localization.

Igneous fractionation trends in the rare-element granitic pegmatites of the Mavis Lake group, the focus of this study, are described by: (l) systematic changes in the mineral assemblage of the pegmatites with increasing distance from the parent granire (beryl to spodumene- beryl- tantalite), (2) decreasing K,/Rb ratio in blocky K-feldspar that coexists with beryl (K/RbKrs = 59 to 16), (3) increasing concentrations of <b>channel</b> <b>H</b> 2 O in beryl (1. 16 to 2. 25 wt. t/o), and (4) increasing 6 D values in beryl (- 78 to- 53 %o).

To study the functional properties of identified DA neurons in mouse midbrain slices, we combined patchclamp recordings with either neurobiotin cell-filling and triple labeling confocal immunohistochemistry, or single-cell RT-PCR. We discriminated four DA subpopulations based on anatomical and neurochemical differences: two calbindin D 28 -k (CB) expressing DA populations in the substantia nigra (SN/CB�) or ventral tegmental area (VTA/CB�), and respectively, two calbindin D 28 -k negative DA populations (SN/CB�, VTA/CB�). VTA/ CB � DA neurons displayed significantly faster pacemaker frequencies with smaller afterhyperpolarizations compared with other DA neurons. In contrast, all four DA populations possessed significant differences in I <b>h</b> <b>channel</b> densities and I h channel-mediated functional properties like sag amplitudes and rebound delays in the following order: SN/CB � 3 VTA/ CB � 3 SN/CB � 3 VTA/CB�. Single-cell RT-multiplex PCR experiments demonstrated that differential calbindin but not calretinin expression is associated with differential I <b>h</b> <b>channel</b> densities. Only in SN/CB � DA neurons, however, I h channels were actively involved in pacemaker frequency control.
