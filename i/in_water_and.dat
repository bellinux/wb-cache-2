40|$|The {{concentration}} of trace elements and other analytes of environmental interest was determined <b>in</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> sediments of the Coya and Cachapoal rivers (VI Region, Central Chile), which {{corresponds to a}} location highly polluted by copper mining activity. Analysis showed the highest pollution at the sampling station closest to the copper smelter (Caletones), then pollutant concentrations decrease at sites far away from this source. The statistical correlation between the different variables determined <b>in</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> sediments was carried out through a principal components analysis (PCA). It was observed that the parameters fell into three groups: (a) analytes present <b>in</b> <b>waters</b> <b>and</b> sediments which come from the mining wastes (b) analytes of lithoge-nic character present <b>in</b> <b>waters</b> plus alkaline <b>and</b> alkaline earth metals plus organic matter present <b>in</b> sediments <b>and</b> <b>waters,</b> <b>and</b> (c) lithogenic elements present in sediments.

5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> on land, the newts {{are largely}} nocturnal.

They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E

5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds.

5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E

5|$|The eggs of {{amphibians}} {{are typically}} laid <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development <b>in</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In {{many species of}} frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the alpine salamander (Salamandra atra) {{and some of the}} African live-bearing toads (Nectophrynoides spp.) are viviparous. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are ovoviviparous. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species. The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting <b>in</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices.
