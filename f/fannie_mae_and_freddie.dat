5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, UBS {{settled a}} lawsuit filed against it and 17 other banks by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the U.S. federal agency that oversees <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac, with a payout of US$885 million, but without UBS having to admit any wrongdoing. At {{the time of the}} {{settlement}}, the agency already settle with two other institutions, but UBS settlement was the first where the amount paid was released to public.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, 2008, The New York Times {{reported}} that U.S. government officials were considering {{a plan for}} the U.S. government to take over <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> smaller <b>Freddie</b> Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump. The government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of $5 trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies.|$|R
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

40|$|Section 26 of the Constitution of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 {{provides}} that housing {{is a basic}} human right {{and that the government}} must take reasonable legislative and other measures to achieve the realisation of this right. A number of measures were taken to try to resolve this socio-economic issue. A number of housing institutions were established, various pieces of legislation were passed and housing subsidies were provided. However, housing backlogs remain a challenge. In March 1994 the housing backlog was estimated between 1, 3 and 1, 8 million units. When more than a million houses were provided by 2001, the housing backlog had increased to between 2 and 3 million houses. To date subsidies in excess of R 29 billion have been spent on housing provision. A study by the Department of Housing concluded that, at the current rate of increase of housing funding vis-a-vis the growing backlog and rapid urbanisation, the household backlog will not be changed in ten years' time. The United States of America (USA) had a similar low cost housing problem, but securitisation alleviated it with the participation of government agencies <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae,</b> Ginnie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. In South Africa, the NHFC tried to emulate the USA model by establishing Gateway Home Loans (Pty) Limited (Gateway) in 1999. Gateway, however, was not a success. This research investigates whether securitisation can be applied in South Africa to alleviate the low cost housing issue. The study finds that there is a credit availability gap for the low income sector earning less than R 8 000 per month because of the perceived risk of default and unwillingness by banks to lend to this sector. The increase in housing backlog that continues unabated, inadequate housing finance system to low income earners, the lessons learnt from the failure of Gateway, the success factors of the USA securitisation model and the sound and sophisticated South African financial system are the rationale for applying securitisation. A proposal of how to effectively apply securitisation to low cost housing in South Africa is provided with recommendations to revive the primary market. ...|$|R

25|$|On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett {{introduced}} the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, {{if it were}} passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. The bill would require {{that the cost of}} direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt.
