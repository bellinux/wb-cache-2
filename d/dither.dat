Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called <b>dither</b> noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E

50|$|Colored <b>dither</b> is {{sometimes}} mentioned as <b>dither</b> {{that has been}} filtered {{to be different from}} white noise. Some <b>dither</b> algorithms use noise that has more energy in the higher frequencies so as to lower the energy in the critical audio band.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dithering</b> {{technique}} {{has been used}} to reduce the quantization error for more than thirty years. This thesis reviews the theories of quantization and <b>dithering,</b> which explain the effect of <b>dithering</b> from a theoretical point of view. Applying <b>dithering</b> to digital Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is the focus of this thesis. Two applications, FLC for Inverted Pendulum and FLC for Truck Backer-Upper, have been simulated and reported. The results of the simulation demonstrate the positive effect of input signal <b>dithering</b> on the resolution of the digital FLC output, especially for the case of the coarse quantization of the input signal...|$|R
40|$|The Quantization Theorem I (QT I) {{implies that}} the {{likelihood}} function can be reconstructed from quantized sensor observations, given that appropriate <b>dithering</b> noise is added before quantization. We present constructive algorithms to generate such <b>dithering</b> noise. The application to maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is studied in particular. In short, <b>dithering</b> has the same role for amplitude quantization as an anti-alias filter has for sampling, in that it enables perfect reconstruction of the <b>dithered</b> but unquantized signal’s likelihood function. Without <b>dithering,</b> the likelihood function suffers from a kind of aliasing expressed as a counterpart to Poisson’s summation formula which makes the exact mle intractable to compute. With <b>dithering,</b> it is demonstrated that standard mle algorithms can be re-used on a smoothed likelihood function of the original signal, and statistically efficiency is obtained. The implication of <b>dithering</b> to the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is studied, and illustrative examples are provided.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to make quantization noise more audibly benign by applying <b>dither.</b> To do this, a noise-like signal {{is added to the}} original signal before quantization. <b>Dither</b> makes the digital system behave as if it has an analog noise-floor. Optimal use of <b>dither</b> (triangular probability density function <b>dither</b> in PCM systems) has the effect of making the rms quantization error independent of signal level, and allows signal information to be retained below the least significant bit of the digital system.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the signal}} being {{dithered}} is to undergo further processing, {{then it should}} be processed with a triangular-type <b>dither</b> that has an amplitude of two quantisation steps; for example, so that the <b>dither</b> values computed range from, say, −1 to +1, or 0 to 2. This is the [...] "lowest power ideal" [...] <b>dither,</b> in {{that it does not}} introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and completely eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantisation. If a colored <b>dither</b> is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may [...] "bleed" [...] into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable, which could become distractingly audible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dither</b> {{can also}} be used to {{increase}} the effective dynamic range. The perceived dynamic range of 16-bit audio can be 120 dB or more with noise-shaped <b>dither,</b> taking advantage of the frequency response of the human ear.|$|E
50|$|Noise shaping is a {{filtering}} {{process that}} shapes the spectral energy of quantisation error, typically to either de-emphasise frequencies {{to which the}} ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If <b>dither</b> is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper: if inside, the <b>dither</b> is treated {{as part of the}} error signal and shaped along with actual quantisation error; if outside, the <b>dither</b> is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantisation without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat <b>dither</b> spectrum and the shaped quantisation noise. While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding <b>dither</b> at all, in which case the usual harmonic-distortion effects still appear at low signal levels.|$|E
