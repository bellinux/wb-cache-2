5|$|There {{are three}} species of trees that are {{considered}} mangroves: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All grow in oxygen-poor soil, can survive drastic water level changes, and are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water. All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves have the farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments that help build coastlines after and between storms. All three types of trees absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and fish, and rookeries for birds. The region supports Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) and stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industries; between 80 and 90 percent of commercially harvested crustacean species in Florida's salt waters are born or spend time near the Everglades.|$|E

40|$|Crustaceans are cultured {{extensively}} {{around the}} world in intensive farming systems. High-performance formulated feeds have been developed <b>for</b> <b>crustacean</b> aquaculture, which are often supplemented with a number of natural and synthetic carotenoid sources. Studies {{over a number of years}} have consistently shown that dietary carotenoid supplementation is beneficial <b>for</b> <b>crustacean</b> aquaculture across a range of commercially relevant parameters. Most obvious is the effect on pigmentation, where carotenoid inclusion levels in feeds and duration of feeding diets with carotenoids have been optimised across many species to improve product colour, and subsequently quality and price. However, beneficial effects of carotenoid inclusion have increasingly been demonstrated on other parameters. This review updates the recent progress in our understanding of dietary carotenoid utilisation and storage, and the combined effects of diet, genetics and environment on crustacean pigmentation. In addition, the range of other physiological benefits this class of molecules brings to these animals is summarised. These include improvements in survival, growth, reproductive capacity, disease resistance and stress resistance. © 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|R
25|$|Just as some prey species evolved cryptic {{colouration}} {{and patterns}} to help avoid predators, some ambush predators evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The tassled scorpionfish is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right). They lie {{on the bottom and}} wave a conspicuous worm-like lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10cm (4in) long, they can also inflate themselves like puffers.|$|E

Over [...] of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponges, and seagrasses serve as shelter and food <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and mollusks, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. [...] Sharks, stingrays, and barracudas also live in this ecosystem, as do larger species of fish that attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, and black skimmers (Rynchops niger) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).|$|E
500|$|The harbour has a {{total area}} of about [...] {{and is used}} by commercial, fishing and {{pleasure}} craft. Inshore fishing, particularly <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and line fish, takes place along the coast. Lobsters, brown and velvet crabs {{are important to the}} local fishery. From May to August, salmon is found in the Esk and small open boats are licensed to net these off the harbour entrance. There are around 40 licensed angling party boats. The commercial catch is no longer herring but has been replaced by cod, haddock, and other fish caught within [...] of the coast. A fish market on the quayside operates as need arises.

40|$|Availability of {{specific}} microhabitat exerts {{a strong influence}} on recruitment and abundance of coral reef fishes, but the ecological basis for microhabitat selection is not always clear. This study used a combination of field-based sampling and aquarium-based experiments to test microhabitat preferences of juvenile coral trout (mostly, Plectropomus maculatus), and assess whether microhabitat selection is related to prey access. In the field, coral trout use live Acropora corals situated over sand 3 times {{more than any other}} microhabitat, even through these specific microhabitats accounted for only 12. 8 % of habitat area. Field-based surveys revealed that live coral habitats support higher densities of potential prey species (71. 73 individuals per m²± 8. 4 SE for fish; 423. 36 individuals per m²± 91. 8 SE <b>for</b> <b>crustacean)</b> compared to dead corals (21. 92 individuals per m²± 3. 9 SE for fish; 146. 67 individuals per m²± 38. 1 SE <b>for</b> <b>crustacean).</b> Furthermore, structural microhabitats on sand have higher densities of prey (57. 61 individuals per m² 9. 6 SE for fish; 539. 04 individuals per m²± 79. 0 SE <b>for</b> <b>crustacean)</b> compared to comparable microhabitats on consolidated carbonate substrata (36. 05 individuals per m²± 6. 7 SE for fish; 12936 individuals per m²± 15. 9 SE <b>for</b> <b>crustacean).</b> In the absence of prey, juvenile coral trout did not distinguish between live versus dead corals (37. 18 %± 82 SE and 35. 48 %± 6. 1 SE), but both of these microhabitats were preferred over rubble (1621 %± 35 SE), macroalgae (11. 09 %± 6. 1 SE) and sand (0 %). In tank-based studies of prey use, juvenile coral trout consumed prey fishes that associate with non-coral habitats (e. g., Eviota zebrina; 33. 28, 4 ± 3. 4 SE) and mid water species (e. g., Aioliops tetrophthalmus; 47. 97 %± 2. 8 SE), but did not consume those fishes with an obligate association with live corals (4. 7 %± 1. 9 SE; 6. 03 %± 2. 2 SE; 7. 9 %± 2. 8 SE). Our results suggest that studies of microhabitat preferences should consider both the structure and location {{of specific}} microhabitats. It is presumed that structural microhabitats are essential for evading predators, while occupation of live corals positioned over sandy substrata maximizes accessibility to a diverse array of potential prey fishes and crustaceans...|$|R

500|$|The {{estuaries}} act as fisheries for fry and nurseries <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails {{thrive in}} these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a $59million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a $22million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry. [...] Between 80 and 90percent {{of species that}} are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem {{to build up the}} coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Definitions of pain vary, {{but most}} involve {{the ability of}} the nervous system to detect and reflexively react to harmful stimuli by {{avoiding}} it, and the ability to subjectively experience suffering. Suffering cannot be directly measured in other animals. Responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured, but not the experience itself. To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain, argument by analogy is sometimes used. [...] Another approach is to construct a list of criteria and assess whether the animal fulfills these. Crustaceans fulfill several criteria proposed as indicating that non-human animals may experience pain. [...] These fulfilled criteria include a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors, opioid receptors and reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics, physiological changes to noxious stimuli, displaying protective motor reactions, exhibiting avoidance learning and making trade-offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements. In vertebrates, endogenous opioids are neurochemicals that moderate pain by interacting with opioid receptors. Opioid peptides and opioid receptors occur naturally in crustaceans, and although it was concluded in 2005 [...] "at present no certain conclusion can be drawn", more recent considerations suggest their presence along with related physiological and behavioural responses as indicating that crustaceans may experience pain. [...] Opioids may moderate pain in crustaceans in a similar way to that in vertebrates. If crustaceans feel pain, there are ethical and animal welfare implications including the consequences of exposure to pollutants, and practices involving commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, food preparation and <b>for</b> <b>crustaceans</b> used in scientific research.|$|E
