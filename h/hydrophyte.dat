Species that form canopies e. g., Potamogeton pectinatus were found as poor trapping, Myriophyllum spictum and Ceratophyllum demersum that form dense understories, {{were found to}} be highly efficient for suspended particles traps. The floating <b>hydrophytes</b> Eichhornia crassipes fixed valuable amounts of sediments through its root system.

In conclusion, trapping of suspended silt and clay may lead to protection of the plant from harmful chemicals due to sprout it on its surface by colloidal affinities or opposite charges. Also, supplies the plant with essential minerals especially under unfavourable conditions. This may explain to some extent, the abilities of some <b>hydrophytes</b> like E. crassipes to overcome the nutrient and mineral deficiency in outer media via picking up its nutrient requirements from suspended particles trapped by its root which acts as minerals store.

It was established that investigated aquatic plants {{have a high}} capacity for removal of metal nanoparticles from aqueous solution (30 – 100 %) which indicates their high phytoremediation potential. Analysis of the water samples content for elements including the mixture of colloidal solutions of metal nanoparticles (Mn, Cu, Zn, Ag[*]+[*]Ag 2 O) before and after exposure to plants showed no significant differences when using submerged or free-floating <b>hydrophytes</b> so-called pleuston.

40|$|Abstract — Characteristics of diversity, abundance, distribution, and {{ecological}} status of aquatic macrophytes {{were observed in}} 2000 and 2007 on a circa 4. 5 km long section of the Turiec River using Kohler´s method. In comparison to 2000, {{the total number of}} macrophytes in 2007 increased markedly (from 25 to 35), although only the numbers of amphiphytes and helophytes were changed substantially. The number of <b>hydrophytes</b> increased from 11 to 12; an invasive, Elodea canadenis, was the only new species. The relative plant mass of <b>hydrophytes</b> represents the bulk of all recorded species (95 and 80 % in 2000 and 2007, respectively), and it was changed for most <b>hydrophytes.</b> The most significant changes were detected for Myriophyllum spicatum (decrease), filamentous algae (decrease), and Potamogeton crispus (increase). In 2007, the mean mass total (MMT) sum of <b>hydrophytes</b> decreased from 16. 46 to 14. 5. On the other hand, the MMT sum of amphiphytes and helophytes doubled in value (7. 4 and 14. 1 in 2000 and 2007, respectively). Within <b>hydrophytes,</b> Batrachium species (including B. aquatile and B. trichophyllum), Myriophyllum spicatum, and Potamogeton crispus were ubiquitous (distribution ratio d> 0. 5) in 2000, whereas in 2007 only Batrachium species and Potamogeton crispus were ubiquitous. At all times, Batrachium species were the most frequent species in the study area, and their abundance was relatively high (MMT> 2. 5). A poor ecological status (MMP = 0. 378 and MMP = 0. 333 in 2000 and 2007, respectively) of the surveyed river section was found in both years, but a slight decline of quality as determined on the basis of aquatic plants was observed after 7 years...|$|R
40|$|Questions: Does {{the plant}} hydrotype {{composition}} of phreatophytic vegetation alter with drawdown {{of the water}} table? Can alternative states of phreatophytic vegetation be identified, and do they persist despite a multi-decadal drying of a mediterranean-type landscape? Location: Field study, coastal sandy plain, Gnangara Groundwater System, south-western Australia. Methods: We used a data set spanning 35 yr to determine alternative states of phreatophytic vegetation and how they relate to spatial variation and temporal change in hydrological habitat. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to identify the range in depth to groundwater associated with vegetation states (characteristic hydrotype compositions). Logistic regression {{analyses were conducted to}} predict the proportional representation of each hydrotype. Hydrotype compositions of recent observations were correlated against modelled values derived from historic observations to test whether the relationship between vegetation states and supporting hydrological habitats remains valid after significant decline in the water table. Results: The MRT analyses for the historic and recent observations produced a main split criterion at 2. 0 and 2. 9 m groundwater depth, respectively, essentially dividing records into those dominated by <b>hydrophytes</b> or xerophytes. No <b>hydrophytes</b> were present at groundwater depths 3 ̆e 10. 5 m (3 ̆e 8. 5 m for recent observations), where xerophytes and generalists were dominant. Only extreme groundwater depths were dominated by a single hydrotype class (<b>hydrophytes</b> or xerophytes), while intermediate clusters represented a transition across the hydrotype classes. The logistic regressions of the proportion of hydrotypes as a function of groundwater depth resulted in good fits for <b>hydrophytes</b> and xerophytes only. Conclusions: Vegetation states were consistent over 35 yr of progressive increase in depth to water table. Distribution of alternative states along a gradient in groundwater depths was exponential and was reflected in the distribution of <b>hydrophytes</b> and mesophytes. The ranges of groundwater depths at which individual states occur suggest that as groundwater depth increases, the degree of habitat specificity decreases. The narrow range of groundwater depths within which <b>hydrophytes</b> and mesophytes are dominant suggests that small changes in depth could lead to transitions between states. With ongoing drying of the landscape, persistence of these vegetation states can be expected to diminish...|$|R

Atrazine and alachlor were added to wetland mesocosms to obtain approximate concentrations of 25 g/L each. Atrazine mass loss was more rapid in the emergent mesocosms than in the open or submergent mesocosms. The dissipation half-life of atrazine mass in the emergent mesocosms was 58 - 70 days compared to 85 - 115 days for the open and submergent mesocosms.
