40|$|Strategies to {{manipulate}} the gut microbiota in infancy have been considered to prevent the development of allergic diseases later in life. We aimed to elucidate the effects of maternal dietary supplementation with a prebiotic oligosaccharide on gut microbiota and spontaneously developing atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in the offspring of NC/Nga mice. Female NC/Nga mice were fed diets either with or without <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> supplementation during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, offspring were fed the diets supplemented with or without <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> for 11 weeks in an air-uncontrolled conventional room. Changes in gut microbiota were assessed by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} of the PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene. Skin lesions were evaluated by a clinical score and scratching behaviour. Serum antibody levels were measured by ELISA, and expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in lesional tissue were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. Maternal supplementation with <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> modulated the gut microbiota in sucklings. Although maternal supplementation with <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> suppressed the increase in clinical skin severity score and scratching behaviour in offspring, dietary <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> after weaning was less effective. The diminution of skin lesions was accompanied by lower serum concentrations of total IgGl and lower expression levels of TNF-α in the lesional tissue. These data suggest that maternal consumption of <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> diminishes the severity of atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in the offspring of NC/Nga mice...|$|E

The oat bran fraction {{was obtained by}} debranning and was compared with other carbon sources such as whole oat flour, glucose, and <b>fructo-oligosaccharide.</b> The oat bran fraction showed a decrease in culturable anaerobes and clostridia {{and an increase in}} bifidobacteria and lactobacilli populations. A similar pattern was observed in <b>fructo-oligosaccharide.</b> Butyrate production was higher in oat bran compared to glucose and similar to that in <b>fructo-oligosaccharide.</b> Production of propionate was higher in the two oat media than in <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> and glucose, which can be used as energy source by the liver. This study suggests that the oat bran fraction obtained by debranning is digested by the gut ecosystem and increases the population of beneficial bacteria in the indigenous gut microbiota.

Prebiotic <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> restore balance in the gastrointestinal microbiome. This study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dietary <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> on intestinal barrier function and steatohepatitis in methionine-choline-deficient mice. Three groups of 12 -week-old male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were studied for 3 weeks; specifically, mice were fed a methionine-choline-deficient diet, a methionine-choline-deficient diet plus 5 % <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> in water, or a normal control diet. Fecal bacteria, short-chain fatty acids, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were investigated. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations were performed using mice livers for CD 14 and Toll-like receptor- 4 (TLR 4) expression and intestinal tissue samples for IgA and zonula occludens- 1 expression in epithelial tight junctions. The methionine-choline-deficient mice administered 5 % <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> maintained a normal gastrointestinal microbiome, whereas methionine-choline-deficient mice without prebiotic supplementation displayed increases in Clostridium cluster XI and subcluster XIVa populations and a reduction in Lactobacillales spp. counts. Methionine-choline-deficient mice given 5 % <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> exhibited significantly decreased hepatic steatosis (p = 0. 003), decreased liver inflammation (p = 0. 005), a decreased proportion of CD 14 -positive Kupffer cells (p = 0. 01), decreased expression of TLR 4 (p = 0. 04), and increases in fecal short-chain fatty acid and IgA concentrations (p < 0. 04) compared with the findings in methionine-choline-deficient mice that were not administered this prebiotic. This study illustrated that in the methionine-choline-deficient mouse model, dietary <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> can restore normal gastrointestinal microflora and normal intestinal epithelial barrier function, and decrease steatohepatitis.

40|$|The {{contents}} of short-chain fatty acids were investigated in rats fed lactitol, lactulose and four <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> of different degree of polymerisation and solubility. <b>Fructo-oligosaccharides</b> {{with a low}} degree of polymerisation (2 - 8) generated {{the highest levels of}} butyric acid all along the hindgut, whereas <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> {{with a high degree of}} polymerisation (10 - 60) generated the highest levels of propionic acid. These specific differences were also generally reflected in the caecal pools and molar proportions of short-chain fatty acids. The lower solubility of the <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> was related to a lower degree of caecal fermentation. Lactulose and lactitol yielded high proportions of acetic acid and low proportions of butyric acid. It is concluded that both the degree of polymerisation and the solubility may affect short-chain fatty acid formation, whereas the fructose content per se seem to be of less importance.

40|$|ABSTRACF Fructo-oligosaccharides are {{naturally}} occurring sweet substances that are poorly absorbed {{and have the}} potential to be clinically useful nonnutritive sweeteners. Because most nonabsorbed carbohydrates are fermented yielding gas, we assessed flatulent symptoms and H 2 excretion during ingestion of <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> (5 g tid) for 12 d. Ten subjects had signif-icantly greater flatulence while taking the oligosaccharide than did five subjects taking sucrose (5 g tid). Breath H 2 after 10 g <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> was similar to that of 10 g lactulose, suggesting near total malabsorption of the <b>fructo-oligosaccharide.</b> Although previous studies found a marked diminution in breath H 2 after prolonged exposure to lactulose, breath H 2 response increased by 50 % after a l 2 -d period on the oligosaccharide and gaseous symptoms did not improve.

Ten fistulated sheep were managed in five consecutive periods, with each of five treatments (an 'acidified saline' control or one of four prebiotic candidates chosen to represent different types of oligosaccharides: Arabinogalactan, Fibruline, Raftilose, or Yacon) administered to two sheep in each period. Seven grams of <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> were used daily for each animal. In each period, fresh faecal samples were collected before, during and after 'supplementation' {{for the analysis of}} bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, sulphite-reducing clostridia, total anaerobes, pH and dry matter. The treatments with Fibruline, Raftilose and Yacon increased the sheep faecal bifidobacteria after 9 days of daily dosing. Compared with the control, the Raftilose treatment caused the greatest increase by 2. 128 log 10 CFU/g of faeces (P< 0. 01), followed by the Yacon and Fibruline treatments, by 0. 990 (P< 0. 05) and 0. 925 log 10 CFU/g of faeces (P= 0. 05), respectively.

Over a period of 3 weeks, the-mice were fed daily with a preload containing 32 mg of <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> or alginate or 13 mg of guar gum.

The 3 dietary fibers produced a similar decrease in total daily food intake (14 to 22 %) at the end of the first week, and this effect disappeared over time. The 3 dietary fibers induced a slight variation in satiation parameters. Body weight and expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide genes were not affected by any of the treatment. Preload of <b>fructo-oligosaccharide</b> and guar gum induced a similar and substantial decrease in the development of adiposity (17 % and 14 %, respectively), while alginate had no effect.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that intake of dietary fiber (DF) {{potently}} decreases food intake and feelings of hunger and/or promotes satiety ratings. However, the mechanisms explaining these effects are not well characterized. This work was performed to determine which of satiation and/or satiety mechanisms provoke the decrease of food intake induced by DF in mice. We tested in an intra-group protocol a low-viscosity (LV, <b>fructo-oligosaccharide),</b> a viscous (VP, guar gum) and a high-viscosity (HV, mixture of guar gum and <b>fructo-oligosaccharide)</b> preload. These were given to mice by intra-gastric gavage. It appeared that viscous preloads such as VP and HV reduced the daily energy intake by 14 % and 21 % respectively. The strong effect of HV was mainly due to a large decrease of meal size (by 57 %) and meal duration (by 65 %) with no effect on ingestion rate during the first 30 min after administration. Therefore, the DF-induced decrease of energy intake was due to a satiation mechanism. This is further supported by a 3 -fold increased sensitization of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract as observed by c-Fos protein immunolabelling. No compensation of food intake was observed {{during the rest of the}} day, a phenomenon that may be explained by the fact that metabolic rate remained high despite the lower food intake. We have also shown that the DF-induced inhibition of food intake was not paired with a conditioned taste aversion. To conclude, this work demonstrates that DF inhibits food intake by increasing satiation during similar to 1 h after administration. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

E. hallii L 2 - 7 and A. caccae L 1 - 92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with B. adolescentis L 2 - 32 butyrate was formed, indicating cross-feeding of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. Studies with [13 C]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme A, to butyrate both in pure cultures of E. hallii and in cocultures with B. adolescentis. Similar results were obtained in cocultures involving B. adolescentis DSM 20083 with <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> as the substrate.

This is probably a consequence of the release by B. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to Roseburia sp. strain A 2 - 183.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of growing-up milk (GUM) with added short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides (scGOS) / long-chain <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> (lcFOS) (9 : 1) (Immunofortis) and n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) on the occurrence of infections in healthy children attending day care centres. Methods: In a randomised double-blind controlled, parallel, multicountry intervention study, 767 healthy children, ages 11 to 29 months, receive...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate changes in the lumen and wall of the intestinal tract of weaned pigs caused by <b>fructo-oligosaccharides</b> (FOS) and consequences for growth. Twelve male pigs weaned at 24 days were individually housed and fed either control, 0. 25 % FOS, or 3 % FOS diets for 21 days after weaning. The pH of chyme in the caecum and proximal colon were lower (...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 A low, but significant, {{fraction}} of the carbohydrate portion of herbaceous biomass may be composed of fructose/fructosyl-containing components (“fructose equivalents”); such carbohydrates include sucrose, <b>fructo-oligosaccharides,</b> and fructans. Standard methods used for the quantification of structural-carbohydrate-derived neutral monosaccharide-equivalents in biomass are not particularly well suited for the quantification of fructose equivalents due to the inherent instability of fructose in conditions commonly used for hemicellulose/cellulose hydrolysis (> 80...|$|R
