5|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting {{that it was}} smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow, listing <b>its</b> <b>range</b> as New South Wales, and described {{what is now the}} Australian crow as another subspecies, C. coronoides cecilae, calling it the north-western crow and recording <b>its</b> <b>range</b> as northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing <b>its</b> <b>range</b> as New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies. Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbird—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where <b>its</b> <b>range</b> {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. <b>Its</b> <b>range</b> does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E

5000|$|The {{essential}} supremum {{of a real}} valued function {{equals the}} supremum of its essential image and the essential infimum equals the infimum of <b>its</b> essential <b>range.</b> Consequently, a function is essentially bounded {{if and only if}} <b>its</b> essential <b>range</b> is bounded.|$|R
5|$|Introduced {{invasive}} species. New {{plant species}} have harmed the desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida's official tortoise). Egg-eating fire ants {{have reduced the}} Texas horned lizard (Texas) from part of <b>its</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} <b>its</b> <b>range,</b> but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of <b>its</b> <b>range</b> it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout <b>its</b> <b>range,</b> although birds at the extreme north of <b>its</b> <b>range</b> may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, <b>its</b> <b>range</b> stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{tropical}} montane forest at around 1400 - 1500 m asl. There are no specific threats to it, and <b>its</b> known <b>range</b> {{is within the}} Gunung Kinabalu National Park. Nevertheless, <b>its</b> small <b>range</b> makes it vulnerable to stochastic events.|$|R
