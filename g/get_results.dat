25|$|Pap smears {{have not}} been as {{effective}} in developing countries. This is in part because many of these countries have an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interepret Pap smears, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to <b>get</b> <b>results.</b> These realities {{have resulted in the}} investigation of cervical screening approaches that use fewer resources and offer rapid results such as visual inspection with acetic acid or HPV DNA testing.|$|E
25|$|Sandhowe {{stayed on}} as {{manager for the}} next season, {{but was unable to}} <b>get</b> <b>results.</b> Hence he was {{replaced}} by assistant manager Ronny Thielemann in October. The continuing string of bad results that saw Magdeburg slip to last place led to Thielemann's dismissal from the manager role. Detlef Ullrich became the new manager in March, with Thielemann working as assistant manager. Towards the end of April, the club presented Andreas Petersen as the manager for the next season and on 3 May announced that Detlef Ullrich had been relieved of all duties, with Carsten Müller again serving as the interim manager for the remaining three matches.|$|E

25|$|Town {{began their}} Conference {{campaign}} with a 1–0 win at big-spending promotion favourites Crawley Town. Inconsistency followed, {{with the club}} managing to perform and <b>get</b> <b>results</b> {{against some of the}} league's top sides but struggling to beat the teams {{at the lower end of}} the table. After a long winter break due to postponements, Grimsby started the new year scoring 13 goals in 2 games, beating Mansfield Town 7–2 at home and Histon 6–1 at Bridge Road. After this, yet another inconsistent period followed that saw only 2 wins in 9 games and saw the club's play-off aspirations take a severe hit. As a result of this, Neil Woods was relieved of his duties on 24 February 2011 after 15 months in charge. He left the club in 9th position in the Conference National.|$|E
25|$|The {{marginalization}} {{degree of}} the district was {{directly related to the}} time it took for the results to be carried to the corresponding CEDAT. Those of very low marginalization took an average of 4:31 hours; those of low marginalization an average of 6:14 hours; medium marginalization an average of 6:54 hours; high marginalization 8:45 hours; and very high marginalization an average of 10:32 hours. The time it took to <b>get</b> <b>results</b> from a polling place to the corresponding CEDAT was also directly related to the average distance between the polling place and the CEDAT. Almost two thirds of Calderón's votes came from districts with very low marginalization, arriving first, with almost three percentage points advantage over López Obrador. Moreover, it was only on those districts that Calderón obtained victories, while López Obrador was ahead mainly in districts with low, medium, and high marginalization; Madrazo only won in some districts with very high marginalization. Pliego Carrasco states that taking all these factors into consideration completely explains the behavior of the partial tallies, in particular the changes in the rates of growth that began occurring around 9 pm, and the further changes (outlined by the Alianza in their judicial filings) between 2 and 3 am. Pliego Carrasco criticizes Mochán and others for not considering the marginalization and the distance between districts and the corresponding CEDAT, and for considering only a very rough urban/rural sorting {{of the district}}s and using methods and techniques that are valid for the natural sciences and engineering but that he considers unjustified in their application to social sciences.|$|E

500|$|The {{metallic}} {{state has}} historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids. The first theoretical description of metals was given by Paul Drude in 1900 with the Drude model, which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an ideal gas of then-newly discovered electrons. [...] He was able to derive the empirical Wiedemann-Franz law and <b>get</b> <b>results</b> {{in close agreement with}} the experiments. [...] This classical model was then improved by Arnold Sommerfeld who incorporated the Fermi–Dirac statistics of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat of metals in the Wiedemann–Franz law. [...] In 1912, The structure of crystalline solids was studied by Max von Laue and Paul Knipping, when they observed the X-ray diffraction pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic lattices of atoms. [...] In 1928, Swiss physicist Felix Bloch provided a wave function solution to the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential, called the Bloch wave.|$|E

Philipps... balked at sending waves of [...] men unprotected against machine guns" [...] and Travers wrote that Philipps had shown moral courage in cancelling unprepared attacks and for giving his troops [...] "instructions not to press the attack if machine-gun fire was met". Horne had intended to replace Philipps with Major-General Charles Blackader but was overruled by Haig who ordered that Herbert Watts, commander of the 7th Division, was to take temporary command. During 9 July, the decision was made that the division would launch a full-scale attack the next day. At 03:30 on 10 July, the preliminary bombardment began.|$|E

Ebony described the January 28 recording session, in which Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being [...] "a major moment in world music that showed we can change the world". [...] "We Are the World", along with Live Aid and Farm Aid, demonstrated that rock music had become more than entertainment, but a political and social movement.

2500|$|The TMAS {{scale was}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} past, however, its use has declined over the years due to problems with the validity of this self-report measure.

Noting that Arkansas lay directly in the path {{to be used in}} the removal of the Eastern Indians, the governor spoke frequently of the need [...] "to place the Militia in a condition to afford immediate protection to our settlements, should any disorder attend the passage of those people." [...] Governor Izard's agitation slowly began to <b>get</b> <b>results.</b> In 1825 the legislature authorized the printing of the militia laws of the territory, with a copy of each to go to every officer in the militia. Izard issued three militia reorganization plans in his three years as governor. He worked to regularize musters, established a regimental organization, and tried to improve the officer corps by forcing the resignation of officers who failed to attend musters, left the territory for more than three months, or who failed to send their strength reports. Finally, in November 1827, a bill passed providing for the first complete overhauling of the militia. The act organized the forces into two separate brigades, provided that battalions were to muster annually and companies were to assemble twice yearly, and established an administrative framework to oversee the organization. Izard's periodic reorganization orders, combined with legislation, resulted in the formation of a much more effective militia system for Arkansas Territory.|$|E
