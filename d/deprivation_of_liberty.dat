25|$|The plaintiffs {{were seeking}} {{compensation}} from the Commonwealth for wrongful imprisonment and <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty.</b> For {{seven of the}} plaintiffs, Alec Kruger, Hilda Muir, Connie Cole, Peter Hansen, Kim Hill, George Ernest Bray, Janet Zita Wallace and Marjorie Foster, the claim was based on their removal from their families while they were children between 1925 and 1944. The claim of the eighth plaintiff, Rosie Napangardi McClary, was based on her being a mother whose daughter had been removed. One of the barriers {{for members of the}} Stolen Generation obtaining compensation was that their removal was authorised by the 1918 Ordinance, a barrier the plaintiffs sought to remove by challenging the legality of the ordinance.|$|E

Tiede was acquitted on three charges, including hijacking and possession of a firearm, but convicted of taking a hostage. The jury found Tiede guilty of hostage-taking, but not guilty of acts against the safety of civil aviation, <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> and battery. The minimum sentence for hostage-taking was three years. However, Stern sentenced Tiede to time served during pretrial detention, about nine months.

2500|$|Justice Marshall also {{believed}} that the Due Process Clause {{gave rise to a}} liberty interest in being released on parole, and rejected the majority's distinction between release and revocation.

[...] Marshall observed that the Court's prior decisions never had held that the process due a person upon a <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> depended {{on the extent to which}} subjective determinations were involved. [...] Finally, parole was such an integral part of the criminal sentencing scheme that it was difficult for Marshall to imagine that there was not an abstract liberty interest in parole.|$|E

2500|$|Administrative {{detention}} is {{a procedure}} under which prisoners are held without charge or trial.

Amnesty International is also concerned that prisoners of conscience are being [...] "held solely for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association". [...] According to B'Tselem there are currently 645 Palestinians being held under administrative detention by the Israel Prisons Service and 105 by the IDF.

2500|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{protects against}} the <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> {{interests}} {{at the hands}} of the state.

[...] No prisoner has a liberty interest in being released before his sentence expires, because the trial and appeals processes have ensured that the state has lawfully deprived the person of his interest in being free from confinement. [...] A state may create a parole system for its prisoners, but it is not required to do so. [...] Parole exists as an adjunct to the penological goals of rehabilitation and deterrence. [...] Like the prison system itself, the parole regime is created and managed by the executive branch, which has no obligation to make error-free determinations in executing the laws.|$|E
40|$|A basic {{function}} {{of the criminal justice}} system is to impose legal punishment through <b>deprivations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty.</b> Because <b>deprivations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> that flow from civil institutions are not punitive, the distinction between civil and criminal institutional <b>deprivations</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> arguably hinges on the concept of punishment. Punishment, in turn, may be distinguished from non-punitive sanctions based on its unique expressive function; that is, punishment is defined in part by the special feelings of resentment and judgments of disapproval that it expresses. These feelings and judgments have been labeled “condemnation. ” This dissertation explores whether condemnation can be translated into an empirical construct that may be assessed reliably and used to study judgments concerning an actor’s suitability for punishment. A condemnation scale was designed, and in the first of two studies the scale proved to be a reliable measure of condemnation expressed toward hypothetical criminal defendants who raised the insanity defense. Condemnation scores differed significantly depending on the mental impairments alleged by the defendants, such that higher average scores were associated with diagnoses that do not seem to diminish the defendants’ criminal responsibility. In addition, significantly higher condemnation scores were associated with defendants who committed more severe crimes. Condemnation scores were also predictive of mock jurors’ verdict decisions in some cases. A revised version of the scale was also found to be a reliable measure of the condemnation expressed by legal professionals toward hypothetical juveniles facing either delinquency adjudications or trials in criminal court. Although condemnation scores did not vary significantly based on the severity of the juvenile’s offense or his premeditation, scores were predictive of the participants’ charging decisions. The findings suggest that juvenile court charging decisions and insanity case judgments may be associated with the intensity of the condemnation that decision-makers direct toward the accused. Although the findings do not (and cannot) confirm the normative argument that condemnation is a defining characteristic of punishment, they suggest that judgments generally track legal institutions’ conceptual and justificatory foundations.

2500|$|What we did prove, {{and quite}} conclusively, is that Washington cannot {{be called a}} Deist—at least, not {{in a sense that}} {{excludes}} his being Christian. Although he did most often address God in the proper names a Deist might use—such as [...] "Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be" [...] and [...] "Disposer of all human events"—the actions that Washington expected God to perform, as expressed both in his official public prayers (whether as general or as president) and in his private prayers as recorded, are the sorts of actions only the God of the Bible performs: interposing his actions in human events, forgiving sins, enlightening minds, bringing good harvests, intervening on behalf of one party in a struggle between good and evil (in this case, between liberty and the <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty),</b> etc. Many persons {{at the end of the}} 18th century were both Christians and Deists.

2500|$|Some {{conditions}} of probation and supervised release, such as compliance with drug tests, are made mandatory by statute, {{while others are}} optional. Some terms are recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines for specific situations; for instance, a requirement of participation in a mental health program is recommended when [...] "the court has {{reason to believe that}} the defendant is in need of psychological or psychiatric treatment." [...] The judge has broad discretion in deciding what optional conditions to impose, as long as those conditions are reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and involve no greater <b>deprivation</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberty</b> than is reasonably necessary for these purposes and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission. The possible length of supervision is specified by law, with recommendations for particular situations being provided by the sentencing guidelines.
