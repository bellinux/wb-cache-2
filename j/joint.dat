5|$|Defining {{levels of}} <b>joint</b> {{attention}} {{is important in}} determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate <b>joint</b> attention. There are three levels of <b>joint</b> attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow <b>joint,</b> ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and <b>joint,</b> large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock <b>joint,</b> first phalanx (long pastern), pastern <b>joint,</b> second phalanx (short pastern), coffin <b>joint,</b> outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle <b>joint,</b> tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and <b>joint,</b> large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal <b>joint</b> (coffin <b>joint)</b> has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any <b>joint</b> in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal <b>joint</b> (pastern <b>joint)</b> is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) <b>joint,</b> which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Many U.S. states {{recognize}} {{two forms}} of <b>joint</b> custody, <b>joint</b> physical custody and <b>joint</b> legal custody. The definition of <b>joint</b> custody may vary across the United States, along with the laws governing the grant of <b>joint</b> custody to parents.|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of a timber structure must be sufficient to preserve life and property. Because this performance, which involves safety and serviceability, is frequently governed by the stiffness and strength of <b>joints,</b> the <b>joints</b> are important components of a timber structure. The number {{of different types of}} <b>joints</b> used in timber structures has increased over time. At present, various <b>joints</b> are utilized, including nailed <b>joints,</b> bolted <b>joints,</b> screwed <b>joints,</b> glued <b>joints,</b> glued-in-rod <b>joints,</b> and large-finger <b>joints</b> [1].|$|R
50|$|The {{geometry}} of <b>joints</b> {{refers to the}} orientation of <b>joints</b> as either plotted on stereonets and rose-diagrams or observed in rock exposures. In terms of geometry, three major types of <b>joints,</b> nonsystematic <b>joints,</b> systematic <b>joints,</b> and columnar <b>jointing</b> are recognized.|$|R

5|$|As {{described}} in attachment theory, infants {{need to develop}} a relationship with a primary caregiver to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be <b>joint</b> attention. In addition to language development, <b>joint</b> attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to <b>joint</b> attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age. Anticipatory smiling (a low level form of <b>joint</b> attention involving smiling at an object then turning the smile to one's communicative partner) at 9 months positively predicts parent-rated social competence scores at 30 months in infants. Early <b>joint</b> attention abilities account for differences in social and emotional abilities in later life.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{mobility}} of the single compliant <b>joints</b> and entire compliant mechanisms. The compliance of the <b>joints</b> and the mobility of the compliant mechanism can be increased by variations of geometry as well as material type of the <b>joints.</b> Therefore the mobility of three kinds of compliant <b>joints</b> with different geometrical shapes (beam <b>joints,</b> film <b>joints</b> and notch <b>joints)</b> will be researched. The mobility of the compliant <b>joints</b> made of different material types (plastic <b>joints,</b> silicone <b>joints)</b> will be also researched. The mobility of compliant mechanisms will be analyzed by using of the Roberts-Tchebicheff mechanism which coupler point can be guided on an approximately rectilinear path...|$|R

5|$|Glucocorticoids {{have been}} found to be as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the <b>joint.</b> A <b>joint</b> infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen <b>joint).</b> The metatarsal-phalangeal <b>joint</b> {{at the base}} of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. <b>Joint</b> pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the <b>joint</b> pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E
30|$|Standardized {{examinations}} {{were carried}} out in 12 <b>joints</b> (6 <b>joints</b> bilaterally) for each patient: first metatarsophalangeal <b>joints</b> (MTP I), upper ankle (talonaviculare) <b>joints,</b> knee <b>joints,</b> wrists, thumb basal <b>joints</b> (MCP I) and elbows. All studies were performed in two dimensions by scanning across the <b>joints</b> and moving the probe from medial to lateral and from distal to proximal. Each site was scanned in gray scale mode to detect structural changes and Power Doppler technique to detect abnormal blood flow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jointed</b> plain {{concrete}} pavements contain enough <b>joints</b> {{to control the}} location of all the expected shrinkage cracks. The concrete cracks at the <b>joints</b> and not elsewhere in the slabs. <b>Jointed</b> plain pavements do not contain any steel reinforcement. However, there may be smooth steel bars at transverse <b>joints</b> and deformed steel bars at longitudinal <b>joints.</b> The spacing between transverse <b>joints</b> is typically about 15 ft for slabs 7 to 12 in thick.

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) studies have shown increased 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in <b>joints</b> of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and inflamed <b>joints</b> of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study compares FDG uptake in <b>joints</b> of RA and OA patients and FDG-uptake with clinical signs of inflammation. Procedures: FDG-PET scans of hands and wrists were performed in patients with RA and primary OA. PET data were compared with clinical data. Results: 29 % of RA <b>joints</b> and 6 % of OA <b>joints</b> showed elevated FDG-uptake. The level of uptake in PET-positive OA <b>joints</b> was {{not significantly different from}} that in RA <b>joints.</b> The majority of PET results of RA <b>joints</b> corresponded with clinical findings. Clinical synovitis was found some OA <b>joints</b> with FDG-uptake. Conclusions: FDG-uptake was observed in the majority of clinically inflamed RA <b>joints</b> and in a few OA <b>joints</b> with no significant difference in uptake level. The latter may be due to secondary synovitis...|$|R
