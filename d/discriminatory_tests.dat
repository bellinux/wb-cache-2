40|$|Abstract: In the {{scientific}} literature, {{the use of}} a surfactant is recommended for both designing quality control tests for water insoluble or sparingly water soluble drugs and for predicting the bioavailability of drugs from various types of for-mulations. Since the number of poorly soluble drugs is increasing, the selection of adequate dissolution test for these be-comes more and more important. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop predictive and <b>discriminatory</b> <b>test</b> methods based on surfactants that are recommended in the literature. Particular respect was given to the use of sodium lauryl sul-fate and Tween 80, the two most commonly used surfactants for this purpose. Tamoxifen was used as a model drug. Dis-solution experiments were performed using various concentrations of the two surfactants in buffer media typically used to prepare biorelevant test media. Results were then compared with those deriving from the same test formulations in biorelevant and simplified “biorelevant ” media. Results from this study indicate that the concentration of surfactant has a huge impact on both the rate and extent of drug release from the formulation and also on the discriminatory power of the test. However, they also indicate that a well designed and validated test medium containing SLS or Tween 80 can be useful in terms of establishing a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>test</b> medium that possibly could also be used to assure batch to batch bioequivalence. Therefore, the approach described in the present paper might be very helpful for developing predictive and discriminatory methods in early formulation development for poorly soluble drugs and which could also be adopted for QC...|$|R

40|$|Adenosine {{is perhaps}} the most {{important}} and universal modulator in the brain. The current consensus is that it is primarily produced in the extracellular space from the breakdown of previously released ATP. It is also accepted that it can be released directly, as adenosine, during pathological events primarily by equilibrative transport. Nevertheless, there is a growing realization that adenosine can be rapidly released from the nervous system {{in a manner that is}} dependent upon the activity of neurons. We consider three competing classes of mechanism that could explain neuronal activity dependent adenosine release (exocytosis of ATP followed by extracellular conversion to adenosine; exocytotic release of an unspecified transmitter followed by direct non-exocytotic adenosine release from an interposed cell; and direct exocytotic release of adenosine) and outline discriminatory experimental tests to decide between them. We review several examples of activity dependent adenosine release and explore their underlying mechanisms where these are known. We discuss the limits of current experimental techniques in definitively discriminating between the competing models of release, and identify key areas where technologies need to advance to enable definitive <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tests.</b> Nevertheless, within the current limits, we conclude that there is evidence for a mechanism that strongly resembles direct exocytosis of adenosine underlying at least some examples of neuronal activity dependent adenosine release...|$|E

However, while updating the series we encounter a number of problems. As the generating process is determined by the sample in hand the estimates obtained for the whole period (1960 - 1990) differ from the earlier estimates. Thus, we can obtain a number of competing estimates for the 'hidden economy ' series for the same time period. To discriminate between the two competing series we used a short-run government expenditure function (GEF) as a guideline. GEF has been estimated first by using the published official data. The GEF is then re-estimated incorporating two different versions of the estimated 'hidden economy ' series with similar behavioural assumptions.

The current European guidelines for biocidal efficacy testing are not adequate for sessile microorganisms; hence, alternative <b>discriminatory</b> <b>test</b> protocols should be used. The activities of a broad range of biocides on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were evaluated using such in vitro assays. Nearly all selected biocides showed a significant decrease in S. aureus biofilm viability, with sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid as the most active biocides. Only hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite showed some inhibitory effect on the matrix. Treatment of P. aeruginosa biofilms was roughly comparable to that of S. aureus biofilms. Peracetic acid was the most active on viable mass within 1 min of contact. Isopropanol ensured a greater than 99. 999 % reduction of P. aeruginosa viability after at least 30 min of contact. Comparable to results with S. aureus, sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide markedly reduced the P. aeruginosa matrix. This study clearly demonstrated that despite their aspecific mechanisms of action, most biocides were active only against biofilm bacteria, leaving the matrix undisturbed. Only hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite were active on both the biofilm matrix and the viable mass, making them the better antibiofilm agents. In addition, this study emphasizes the need for updated and standardized guidelines for biofilm susceptibility testing of biocides...|$|R

Aim of the study: Assessing: (1) the phenotypic features of different Candida species isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract diseases; (2) enzymatic properties of fungi allowing to determine codes, extracellular hydrolases enzymograms and their biotypes. Material and methods: Materials (sputum, bronchial secretions collected during bronchoscopy, BAL, urine, blood, throat swabs) were collected from patients treated in The Center and Rehabilitation Pulmonary Diseases in Lodz. The fungi were isolated and their species and biochemical properties were determined. Results: The 100 strains, which were isolated from the patients were classified into Candida (7 species) and Trichosporon (1 species). The dominant strain was found to be C. albicans, for which 9 of 50 marked code were found, the most frequent being 2576174. Analyzing the activity of 19 extracellular hydrolases, six enzymes were found to be active in all strains, five enzymes in most of them and none in eight 8; the most common biotype was biotype B 4.

There was {{a difference between the}} mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml; low probability scans, 295 ng/ml; indeterminate probability scans, 510 ng/ml; high probability scans, 952 ng/ml (p less than 0. 001). Of the patients with high probability scans, 96 % had raised concentrations. Explanations for discrepant low results include incorrect scan diagnosis, delay in blood sampling, and anticoagulation. Of the patients with a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, 43 % had increased {{concentrations of}} cross linked fibrin degradation products that could be attributed in most cases to another illness. Owing to the wide range of values in each lung scan diagnostic category, raised concentrations of these fibrin degradation products cannot be used without reference to the patient's clinical state as a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>test</b> for pulmonary embolism.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether Lyme disease can become a persistent infection {{in the form of}} chronic Lyme disease has caused heated debates, public protests, litigation, harassment and even death threats over the last decades. Against the established view of Lyme disease as an acute infection that is easily treated with few complications once recognized, a vocal dissenting minority of scientists maintains the existence of an unrecognized epidemic of chronic bacterial infestation caused by the tick-borne Borrelia spirochetes. We aim to review interpretations of continued reporting of symptoms despite antibiotic treatment as per standard of care; while the term chronic Lyme disease implies an unsuccessfully eradicated infection, Post-Lyme disease syndrome accounts for this as post-infectious sequelae. In addition, we also examine diagnostic strategies, summarize the contenting recommendations given by the two sides, and briefly asses some of the more controversial laboratory tests being used for chronic Lyme Disease in the private market. We find that chronic Lyme disease is defined as a very vague diagnosis based on symptoms and clinical findings, of which several are present in more than 10 % of the general population, regardless of exposure indicators such as a recognized tick-bite or Borrelia being endemic in the area or not, and supported by a myriad of unvalidated diagnostic tests.

To follow {{the spread of}} infection and trace the source of isolates, adequate typing methods are needed. We have developed an automated typing system based on biochemical fingerprinting of bacteria (the PhP system) for typing of different Salmonella serotypes. The system measures the kinetics of various biochemical reactions of bacteria grown in liquid medium in microtiter plates and uses numerical techniques to identify biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) among the tested strains. In the present study we used a set of 16 highly <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tests</b> to differentiate strains of Salmonella of serotype Livingstone and evaluated the system for its discriminatory ability using a collection of 34 unrelated human isolates of S. Livingstone. We also used the system to investigate BPTs of 45 Livingstone strains isolated from animals and feedstuffs in Sweden between 1987 and 1991. Altogether 19 different BPTs were found among human isolate giving a diversity index (Di) of 0. 930. In contrast, most strains isolated from animals and feedstuffs in Sweden belonged to 2 dominating BPTs (Di = 0. 704). One of these contained 17 strains mainly isolated during 1992 whereas the other contained 18 strains isolated between 1987 and 1991. None of the Swedish human isolates were identical to those of animals and feedstuffs. These findings suggest that 2 different BPTs of Salmonella Livingstone strains are particularly common among animals and feedstuffs in Sweden {{and that they are}} not related to human cases of enteritis in this country.

The methods included (i) the reference method based on growth tests, (ii) API ID 32 Staph (bioMerieux), (iii) Staph-Zym (Rosco), and (iv) a rapid 4 -h method developed in our laboratory (UZA method). The last method {{is based on the}} detection within 4 h of enzymatic activity of heavy bacterial suspensions in three substrate solutions (nongrowth tests). For 16. 5 % of the isolates some supplementary growth tests read after 24 h had {{to be added to the}} enzyme data for satisfactory identification. The reference method failed to identify four isolates. Of the 440 isolates identified by the reference method, API ID 32 Staph, Staph-Zym, and the UZA method correctly identified 419 (95. 2 %), 429 (97. 5 %), and 430 (97. 7 %) and misidentified 8 (1. 8 %), 4 (0. 9 %), and 1 (0. 2 %), respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, S. lugdunensis, S. schleiferi, and S. capitis were identified with an accuracy of 98 to 100 % by all the systems tested. S. capitis subsp. ureolyticus was not recognized by the API ID 32 system because the biochemical profiles for it are not yet included in the corresponding database. Whereas API ID 32 identified all 13 S. warnerii isolates, both Staph-Zym and the UZA method missed 2 of these. S. hominis was identified with the least accuracy by the API ID 32 system (26 of 39 isolates), whereas the UZA and Staph-Zym methods identified 36 of the isolates belonging to this species. The UZA method did not identify any of the S. cohnii, S. xylosus, S. lentus, and S. sciuri strains, since it included no <b>discriminatory</b> <b>tests</b> for these species, because they are extremely rarely found in humans. Of all 440 isolates tested, the UZA method failed to identify 9 and misidentified 1 other.

40|$|Background & objectives: Human {{cryptosporidiosis}} is endemic worldwide, and {{at least}} eight species {{have been reported in}} humans; the most common being Cryptosporidium hominis and C. parvum. Detailed understanding of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium is increasingly facilitated using standardized universal technique for species differentiation and subtyping. In this study micro- and minisatellite targets in chromosome 6 were used to assess genetic diversity of C. hominis by sequence length polymorphisms along with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methods: A total of 84 Cryptosporidium positive stool specimens were subjected to speciation and genotyping using small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) as the target gene. Genetic heterogeneity amongst C. hominis isolates was assessed by sequencing minisatellites, microsatellites and polymorphic markers including genes encoding the 60 kDa glycoprotein (GP 60), a 47 kDa protein (CP 47), a mucin-like protein (Mucin- 1), a serine repeat antigen (MSC 6 - 7) and a 56 kDa transmembrane protein (CP 56). Results: Of the 84 Cryptosporidium positive stool specimens, 77 (92 %) were positive by SSU rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Of these 77 isolates, 54 were identified as C. hominis and 23 as C. parvum. Of all the loci studied by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), GP 60 gene could reveal the highest genetic diversity. Population substructure analysis of C. hominis performed by combined sequence length and nucleotide polymorphism showed nine multilocus subtypes, all of which were distinct groups in the study population. Interpretation & conclusions: MLST, a powerful <b>discriminatory</b> <b>test,</b> demonstrated both variations and distribution pattern of Cryptosporidium species and its subtypes...|$|R
40|$|Current European Commission (EC) {{surveillance}} regulations require <b>discriminatory</b> <b>testing</b> of all transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) -positive small ruminant (SR) samples in order to classify them as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or non-BSE. This requires a range of tests, including characterization by bioassay in mouse models. Since 2005, naturally occurring BSE has been identified in two goats. It has also been demonstrated {{that more than one}} distinct TSE strain can coinfect a single animal in natural field situations. This study assesses the ability of the statutory methods as listed in the regulation to identify BSE in a blinded series of brain samples, in which ovine BSE and distinct isolates of scrapie are mixed at various ratios ranging from 99 % to 1 %. Additionally, these current statutory tests were compared with a new in vitro discriminatory method, which uses serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA). Western blotting consistently detected 50 % BSE within a mixture, but at higher dilutions it had variable success. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method consistently detected BSE only when it was present as 99 % of the mixture, with variable success at higher dilutions. Bioassay and sPMCA reported BSE in all samples where it was present, down to 1 %. sPMCA also consistently detected the presence of BSE in mixtures at 0. 1 %. While bioassay is the only validated method that allows comprehensive phenotypic characterization of an unknown TSE isolate, the sPMCA assay appears to offer a fast and cost-effective alternative for the screening of unknown isolates when the purpose of the investigation was solely to determine {{the presence or absence of}} BSE...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to obtain parameters for classification of paddy soils using spectral data obtained by diffuse spectroradiometry. The soil samples used were collected in a wetland with {{a great variety of}} soil classes. These were subjected to chemical and physical analysis for classification, and also spectral analyses to discrimination of classes. Spectral data were statistically analyzed for development of discriminant equations that could characterize the soil classes. There were seven distinct classes of soil in the field, which are classified with different levels of success, according to the equations generated by the statistical system <b>discriminatory.</b> A <b>test</b> procedure for the model was also applied, obtaining values of success under other existing work, however, acceptable to the unique conditions found in this area.
