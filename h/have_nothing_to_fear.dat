25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> {{from engaging in}} theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.|$|E
25|$|But as to {{our country}} and our race, {{as long as the}} well {{compacted}} structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

500|$|Author Brett Alan Weiss {{wrote that}} Skeet Shoot was [...] "a shoddily programmed, {{graphically}} primitive game" [...] {{and said that}} the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game [...] "virtually worthless". A writer for Atari HQ called it a mediocre game. Lee Peppas of ANALOG Computing remarked that [...] "Atari & Activision <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the graphics on this first release." [...] TV Gamer opined {{it was one of the}} worst games for the system, saying that it was boring and criticizing the fact that it was difficult to hit the skeet.|$|E
500|$|In one of Adorján's books, GM Lajos Portisch {{opined that}} [...] "at least {{two-thirds of all}} 'tested' {{openings}} give White an apparent advantage." [...] According to Portisch, for Black, [...] "The {{root of the problem}} is that very few people know which are the openings where Black is really OK. Those who find these lines <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear,</b> as Black is indeed OK, but only in those variations!" [...] Rowson considers this an important point, noting that [...] "1.d4players struggle to get anywhere against main-line Slavs and 1.e4players find the Najdorf and [...] particularly tough." ...|$|E
500|$|Truman {{continues}} to sail until – {{to his surprise}} – his boat punctures {{the wall of the}} dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is [...] "no more truth" [...] in the real world and [...] "I know you better than you know yourself", that he brings comfort to his audience and that by staying in his artificial world, he would <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear.</b> Truman considers this, then states: [...] "You never had a camera in my head!" [...] and [...] "In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night," [...] previously his unwitting catch-phrase, takes a bow, and leaves. Watching the show at home, Sylvia races to meet Truman, while Christof's supervisors end the show for the last time and the audience starts looking for something else to watch.|$|E

"We <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> {{from the}} {{publication}} of documents", exclaimed Pope Leo XIII, when on 20 June 1879, he appointed the ecclesiastical historian, Joseph Hergenröther, [...] "Cardinal Archivist of the Holy Roman Church" [...] (Palmieri, [...] "Introite ed Esiti di Papa Niccolò III", Rome, pp. xiv, xv; Friedensburg, [...] "Das kgl.

2500|$|Moscoe stood down as TTC chair {{following}} the 2006 election, and {{was selected as}} chair of Toronto's licensing and standards committee. He {{is also a member}} of David Miller's executive committee [...] Soon after the swearing-in ceremony in December 2006, Moscoe distributed a list of his priorities to journalists, which was highlighted by a plan to license Toronto's landlords. The plan calls for landlords to pay a high per-unit fee if their properties are run down, and a low fee if the buildings are in good shape. [...] "Good landlords <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the licensing scheme because the amounts they are going to pay will be marginal," [...] he has said. [...] "The emphasis in whatever scheme we establish must be making the bad landlords pay". He conducted a media tour of the worst-kept buildings in Toronto in early 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarians, however, were {{repeatedly}} {{defeated by}} the Romanians. By the middle of July 1919, Hungary had begun a major offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esperey, wrote to Marshal Ferdinand Foch on 21 July 1919: [...] "We {{are convinced that the}} Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, we <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no {{more than two or three}} weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 September, the {{day after}} Piquet Jr.'s {{statement}} to the FIA was leaked, Renault F1 stated that it intended to take legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr and his father in both French and British courts, stating that [...] "...today the ING Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore personally wish to state they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr and Nelson Piquet Sr in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive {{for the remainder of}} the 2009 season". In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated [...] "Because I am telling the truth I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear,</b> whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore – and while I am well aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the evil}} Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) is told by his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) that the emperor demands {{to know how}} he will deal with the rebellion, {{particularly}} with Kröd. Dongalor claims they <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from Kröd, who used to beat Dongalor up in the military academy with as a youth. Later, Dongalor reveals he has found the Eye of Gulga Grymna, the deadliest weapon of the ancient world, which had been lost for a millennium but was unearthed by [...] "the finest child labor to ever feel the lash": he also ignores the warning the Eye's power once destroyed an entire kingdom, and has the bearer of bad news killed. Meanwhile, Kröd and his friends unlock the dungeon doors and liberate the prisoners. There they find General Arcadius and his new lover, the flamboyant Bruce (Marques Ray). Before the group can leave, Loquasto accidentally locks the door shut behind them, trapping them all in the dungeon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his third}} year, he joined John Stevens Henslow's natural history course and was {{introduced}} to the Cambridge version of natural theology, part of the liberal Christianity of colleagues such as Adam Sedgwick, George Peacock and William Whewell who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the Geological Society of London in 1831 which declared that [...] "No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived." [...] For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.|$|E
60|$|The {{capital was}} entirely tranquil. The theatres and cafes were open as usual, and the masked balls {{attended}} with great enthusiasm: confiding in their hundred and twenty-four forts, the light-minded people <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Trotsky's {{position}} formed {{while he}} led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a {{need to create a}} militarized [...] "production atmosphere" [...] by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> from the state, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for [...] "such a regime under which each worker feels himself to be a soldier of labor who cannot freely dispose of himself; if he is ordered transferred, he must execute that order; if he does not do so, he will be a deserter who should be punished. Who will execute this? [...] The trade union. It will create a new regime. That is the militarization of the working class." [...] Lenin sharply criticised Trotsky and accused him of [...] "bureaucratically nagging the trade unions" [...] and of staging [...] "factional attacks". His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, [...] "Introduction of genuine labor discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above." [...] This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.|$|E
