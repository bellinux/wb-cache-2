500|$|In mid-2000, {{the band}} signed with Richard Branson's V2 Records. Rich explained, [...] "The cool thing about V2, {{the reason that}} we chose them, is that they told us, 'You guys <b>go</b> <b>make</b> the record you want to make. Then give it to us and we'll sell it.' [...] That's what we needed to hear." [...] The freedom V2 afforded through its {{hands-off}} approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well. According to Chris, [...] "Lions is a symbol that stands for the fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you." ...|$|E
500|$|... "This Love" [...] was {{the second}} single from Maroon 5's 2002 debut album, Songs About Jane. In an {{interview}} with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine revealed that he wrote the song the day his girlfriend moved away after they broke up. In another interview, Levine revealed that the song {{was written in the}} [...] "most emotionally trying time" [...] in his life. He also added, [...] "I was in a relationship that was ending, but I was really excited on the other end because the band was about to <b>go</b> <b>make</b> the record and I was ecstatic to go in the studio. She was literally leaving town within days of me writing the lyrics to 'This Love', so I was in prime emotional condition to write a song with that kind of conflict." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's {{family members}} to devote some {{publishing}} rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can <b>go</b> <b>make</b> this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars {{if you can get}} up and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E
5000|$|The message [...] "Come back home" [...] {{might be}} {{translated}} by the drummers as: [...] "Make your feet {{come back the}} way they <b>went,</b> <b>make</b> your legs come back the way they went, plant your feet and your legs below, in the village which belongs to us".|$|R

500|$|Morello and Cornell {{initially}} disagreed {{over the}} particulars of Cornell quitting the group, with Morello claiming that Cornell did not communicate directly with him about leaving, while Cornell countered: [...] "Tom and I did have communications {{about the fact that}} I was gonna <b>go</b> <b>make</b> a record, and that I was tired of what ended up seeming like political negotiations toward how we were gonna do Audioslave business and getting nowhere with it." [...] He also added that this process of [...] "doing Audioslave business" [...] led him to go solo. Cornell has said that the breakup was not about money, but that he was just not getting along with the other members during their later years. Said Cornell, [...] "Getting along as people is one thing. Getting along as a group of people that can work together in a band situation...We weren't particularly getting along well, no. Bands work in a way where everyone at some point has to have a similar idea of how you do things...Three albums into it, it started to seem like our interests weren't as conjoined anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, nobody wanted to step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you <b>go</b> <b>make</b> a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to <b>go</b> <b>make</b> our own version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E

2500|$|Weaning is {{the process}} of {{replacing}} breast milk with other foods; the infant is fully weaned after the replacement is complete. Psychological factors affect the weaning process for both mother and infant, as issues of closeness and separation are very prominent. [...] If the baby is less than a year old substitute bottles are necessary; an older baby may accept milk from a cup. [...] Unless a medical emergency necessitates abruptly stopping breastfeeding, it is best to gradually cut back on feedings to allow the breasts to adjust to the decreased demands without becoming engorged. [...] La Leche League advises: [...] "The nighttime feeding is usually the last to <b>go.</b> <b>Make</b> a bedtime routine not centered around breastfeeding. A good book or two will eventually become more important than a long session at the breast." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Man in Three Worlds did {{not find}} {{intermarriage}} between the Pallache brothers or sons {{and members of the}} Portuguese Sephardic community in the Netherlands. [...] In fact, it documents the contrary, e.g., that sons Isaac and Joshuae did not <b>go</b> <b>make</b> such marriages. [...] "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community... it is surely significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'." [...] In September 2016, however, two 1643 marriage certificates were discovered for David Pallache (1598–1650) and Judith Lindo (???–October 30, 1665) of Antwerp, daughter of Ester Lindo [...] Death details for David Pallache also confirm the marriage. [...] Further, three years later, in 1646, Samuel Pallache (1616–???), son of Isaac Joseph Pallache and nephew of David Joseph Pallache, married Abigail (born 1622), sister of Judith Lindo.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2010, it was {{announced}} by Phil Lesh on his official message board that former Primus drummer Jay Lane would be leaving his previous band Furthur to rejoin Primus. On May 3, 2010, Primus announced a new tour with Gogol Bordello, Wolfmother, and the Dead Kenny G's. The press release for the tour revealed that the band were looking to [...] "refine their chops before heading into the studio to record their first album of brand new music since 1999's Antipop." [...] Correlating with this announcement, the Primus website was updated with an animation of an elevator with its twelfth floor featuring a stylized question mark, and a sign reading [...] "Primus {{will be with you}} shortly", alluding to future plans. In 2011, Claypool elaborated on the band's decision to record an album, stating that [...] "(Lane) coming back has just breathed life back into the project. We did some touring, and we decided, [...] "Let's <b>go</b> <b>make</b> a record," [...] because we were creating things on the road." ...|$|E

Side-Line also stated the Police were {{to embark on a}} massive world tour. Billboard magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Andy Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-Synchronicity: [...] "The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, <b>go</b> <b>make</b> a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we could have done that. Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried on, and we could probably still be there. That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour." [...] The band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Police, and we're back!" [...] before launching into [...] "Roxanne". After the dissolution of the Police, Sting adamantly refused to reunite with Copeland or Summers for any prolonged period, often commenting [...] "If I ever reform the Police I should be certified insane." [...] However, by 2007, he had a change of heart. When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said [...] "I'd just done the lute album—Songs from the Labyrinth. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'" [...] Sting added he saw the reunion as [...] "a kind of healing. I think solving problems is an exercise worth doing".|$|E
