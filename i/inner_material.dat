It began to be used in that period as intermarriages between Goryeo and the Yuan Dynasty of China happened.

During the reign of King Gwanghaegun, black silk began to be used for the covering whereas purple silk was used as the inner fabric. Thereafter, as women enjoyed wearing a jokduri, it became almost a national style in fashion. In the late Joseon period, King Yeongjo (r. 1724-1776) and Jeongjo (r. 1776-1800) prohibited women from wearing gache (wigs) and, instead, encouraged them to wear jokduri.

30|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar is a subsurface {{imaging method}} that provides high-resolution in formation {{to a depth}} of typically 0 – 10  m, although depths up to 40  m [3, 4, 5] are possible in some geological environments. This penetration depth is limited by the transmitted power. They use high voltage (up to 1000  V impulses) and low frequency (25 – 50  MHz antennae), which can reach up to 40  m depth in low conductivity ground conditions. Future GPR systems will deploy a new generation of UWB current-driven antenna, rather than voltage–driven antenna [6]. The GPR system comprises an antenna which emits electromagnetic energy, and receiver which receives the reflected energy from the surfaces as well as that from the inner subsurface. The reflected energy depends majorly upon the type and nature (frequency) of the antenna, and the nature of materials involved. The energy reflected is transformed into visual images, which provide extensive data on the sub-surface (<b>inner)</b> <b>materials,</b> when interpreted properly.|$|R

The iterative milling and scanning system is set up to generate the 3 -D rock mesostructures.

The key factor {{in the production of}} aroma textiles is their long-term aroma-releasing properties, which makes it necessary for the products to have good influencing power, stability, durability, and retention behavior. The aroma can be applied to textiles by enclosing it in a microcapsule, and then applying it to textiles by padding, coating, spraying, or bath treatment, without altering their feel and color. Microcapsules represent an extra degree of freedom in the formulation or development of the aroma products, and the use of microcapsules is one means of achieving controlled release of the core <b>inner</b> <b>material.</b> In microencapsulation, the core material for aromatherapy purposes is sealed in minute shells, measuring anywhere from a few μm to a few hundred μm, and then dispersed in a matrix.

40|$|Tris-disrupted and intact brush border {{membrane}} preparations from mucosa of hamster jejunum {{were capable}} of preferentially binding actively transported D-glucose in a similar manner. Density gradient centrifugation of the Tris-disrupted brush borders indicated that D-glucose was bound to a fraction containing the cores or <b>inner</b> <b>material</b> of the microvilli. The properties of this binding were examined with the Tris-disrupted brush border preparation. Actively transported sugars competitively inhibited preferential D-glucose binding, whereas no effect was observed with nonactively transported sugars. Neither actively nor nonactively transported amino acids affected D-glucose binding. D-Glucosamine, which is not actively transported, was inhibitory to preferential D-glucose binding {{as well as to}} the active transport of D-glucose by everted sacs of hamster jejunum. No inhibitory effect was observed with the same concentration of D-galactosamine. Preferential D-glucose binding was also inhibited by sulfhydryl-reacting compounds, Ca 2 +, and Li+ ions. On the other hand, Mg 2 + was shown to be stimulatory and Na+, NH 4 +, and K+ had no effect on this phenomenon.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{appliance}} of ultrasonic diagnostics for the condition assessment of polymeric insulation systems is investigated. Especially, singular {{flaws in the}} insulation volume and inhomogeneities at <b>inner</b> <b>material</b> interfaces are regarded including a relevant risk potential concerning the isolation capability. The detection of such inhomogeneities and the evaluation of parameters that affect the risk potential like sizing of a singular flaw or determination of a delamination at an inner boundary are not well investigated yet. This thesis presents methods for the detection and evaluation of the inhomogeneities described above. An ultrasonic measurement system is used that allows automated measurements applying the immersion technique with water as acoustic coupling material. The data processing and interpretation of the measurement results are done with the developed software DISCUS. The reference block method is suited for sizing a detected and localised flaw. By evaluating the spherical and discoidal reference reflector size, the minimal and the expected dimension of an gas-filled void with a size {{in the range of}} 0, 2 mm to 3 mm can be specified independent of the depth position. Furthermore, influencing parameters on the sizing result like kind of the regarded silicone rubber or temperature are analysed. Conclusions on the flaw material can be made by evaluating the phasing of the reflected ultrasonic impulses. Information of the flaw geometry and orientation are gained by setup the transducers in different angles. As an evaluation method, the dynamic of the reflectance over the intromission angle is presented. It can be shown that a differentiation between planelike and ball-shaped flaws is possible if the boundary specific effects are considered like dependence of intromission angle on the echo transmissibility or the refraction at the test piece surface. Regarding the diagnostic of <b>inner</b> <b>material</b> interfaces, an automated method is developed basing on a correlation algorithm. The method evaluates the phase jump resulting at a delamination by calculating the similarity measure of echo impulses. As a result the method provides a colour scaled correlation map (K-Scan) of the investigated material interface. Thereby, open delaminations with a diameter of 1 mm can be detected automatically at interfaces such as silicone - metal, silicone - epoxy resin and epoxy resin - metal, in dependence of the layer thickness above the interface. In addition, singular flaws at interfaces with a size of 0, 4 mm can be detected. The capability analysis of the presented methods shows that a multitude of relevant influences on the risk potential of an inhomogeneity in polymeric insulation systems can be investigated and evaluated...|$|E
