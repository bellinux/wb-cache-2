5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The <b>import</b> <b>tariff,</b> enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the <b>import</b> <b>tariff.</b> However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E

5000|$|Tariffs: Typically, tariffs (or taxes) {{are imposed}} on <b>imported</b> goods. <b>Tariff</b> rates usually vary {{according}} to the type of goods <b>imported.</b> <b>Import</b> <b>tariffs</b> will increase the cost to importers, and increase the price of imported goods in the local markets, thus lowering the quantity of goods imported, to favour local producers. Tariffs may also be imposed on exports, and in an economy with floating exchange rates, export tariffs have similar effects as <b>import</b> <b>tariffs.</b> However, since export tariffs are often perceived as [...] "hurting" [...] local industries, while <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> are perceived as [...] "helping" [...] local industries, export tariffs are seldom implemented.|$|R

25|$|Production {{of tobacco}} leaf {{increased}} by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 {{million tons of}} leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the UN, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. This number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. The production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. During that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. China's increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. China's share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. This growth can be partially explained by {{the existence of a}} high <b>import</b> <b>tariff</b> on foreign tobacco entering China. While this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it still has led to local, Chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.|$|E

[...] He also advanced a hypothesis, believing Saul's analysis to be [...] "simplified", which placed a heavier emphasis on happenings in the US than in Britain: that the US <b>import</b> <b>tariff</b> of 45% on machinery and engineered products, which was {{the highest in the world}} until 1908, protected the development of the US industry in such products while it reached a maturity which enabled its prices to fall to a level that was highly competitive in the world market.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{measuring}} {{the impact of}} world price volatility and <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> on rice on poverty in Indonesia. Applying a Computable General Equilibrium-Microsimulation approach and the endogenous poverty line, this {{study found that the}} volatility of world rice prices during 2007 to 2010 had a large effect on the poverty incidence in Indonesia. The simulation result showed that a 60 per cent increase in world rice price raises the head count index by 0. 81 per cent which is equivalent to {{an increase in the number}} of poor by 1, 687, 270. However, both the 40 per cent decrease in the effective <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> on rice enacted by regulation No. 93 /PMK. 011 / 2007 and the zero <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> implemented by regulation No. 241 /PMK. 011 / 2010 in response to high world rice prices could not perfectly absorb the negative impact of increasing world rice prices on poverty. The 40 per cent decrease in the effective <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> on rice reduced the head count index by 0. 08 per cent equal to 161, 546 people while the zero <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> on rice reduced the head count index by 0. 19 per cent equal to 390, 160 people. These policies might not be enough to absorb the negative impact of an increase in world rice prices from 2007 - 2010, because, during this period, the world rice prices increased on average by almost 71 per cent, which have impoverished approximately two million people. Moreover, protection in the agricultural sector, such as raising <b>import</b> <b>tariffs,</b> intended to help agricultural producers will have the reverse effect of raising the head count index. ...|$|R

2500|$|Since the 1980s until 2011, {{domestic}} ethanol producers {{were protected}} by a 54-cent per gallon <b>import</b> <b>tariff,</b> mainly intended to curb Brazilian sugarcane ethanol imports. Beginning in 2004 blenders of transportation fuel received a tax credit for each gallon of ethanol they mix with gasoline. Historically, the tariff was intended to offset the federal tax credit that applied to ethanol regardless of country of origin. [...] Several countries in the Caribbean Basin imported and reprocessed Brazilian ethanol, usually converting hydrated ethanol into anhydrous ethanol, for re-export to the United States. They avoided the 2.5% duty and the tariff, thanks to the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and free trade agreements. This process was limited to 7% of U.S. ethanol consumption.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1840s, {{sugarcane}} plantations {{gained a}} foothold in Hawaiian agriculture. Steamships provided rapid and reliable transportation to the islands, and demand increased during the California Gold Rush. [...] The land division law of 1848 (known as The Great Mahele) displaced Hawaiian people from their land, forming {{the basis for the}} sugarcane plantation economy. [...] In 1850, the law was amended to allow foreign residents to buy and lease land. In 1850, when California became a state, profits declined and the number of plantations decreased to five due to the <b>import</b> <b>tariff</b> that was created. Market demand increased even further during the onset of the American Civil War which prevented Southern sugar from being shipped northward. [...] The price of sugar rose 525% from 4 cents per pound in 1861 to 25 cents in 1864. [...] The Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 allowed Hawaii to sell sugar to the United States without paying duties or taxes, greatly increasing plantation profits. [...] This treaty also guaranteed that all of the resources including land, water, human labor power, capital, and technology would be thrown behind sugarcane cultivation. [...] The 1890 McKinley Tariff Act, an effort by the United States government to decrease the competitive pricing of Hawaiian sugar, paid 2 cents per pound to mainland producers. [...] After significant lobbying efforts, this act was repealed in 1894. [...] By 1890, 75% of all privately held land was owned by foreign businessmen. The plantation owners wanted the United States to annex Hawaii so that Hawaiian sugar would never again be subject to tariffs. They also wanted the United States to annex Hawaii so there could be a U.S military base on the island (Pearl Harbor).|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} financial markets for trade policy under conditions of uncertainty. It builds upon and extends an earlier work by Stockman and Dellas. Using a two country, two good stochastic general equilibrium model where both countries impose a combination of export and <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> and the agents trade in financial contracts to insure against policy risk, with the provision of spot trading in consumption goods, it is shown that: (i) the structure of commercial policy (i. e. <b>import</b> or export <b>tariffs)</b> matters, so that Lerner 2 ̆ 7 s symmetry theorem does not extend to a stochastic framework with asset markets; (ii) the Stockman-Dellas conclusions {{are sensitive to the}} choice of tariffs; (iii) in general, it is optimal to use both export and <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> in such a framework;The assumption of exogenous tariffs is relaxed next by making endowments random and by assuming tariffs are chosen optimally. The values of optimal policies are compared across states within any regime as well as across alternative policy regimes. The simulation results indicate that the expected welfare when both export and <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> are used is at least as high as that when only <b>import</b> <b>tariffs</b> are used. However, if commercial policy is restricted to <b>import</b> <b>tariffs,</b> the introduction of asset markets can be welfare-deteriorating, even though there remains potential gains from engaging in inter-state trade.
