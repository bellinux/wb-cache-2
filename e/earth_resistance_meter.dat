50|$|Electromagnetic (EM) {{conductivity}} instruments have {{a response}} that {{is comparable to}} that of <b>resistance</b> <b>meters</b> (conductivity is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a magnetic field underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features. Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than <b>resistance</b> <b>meters</b> to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to <b>resistance</b> <b>meters.</b> Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments.

This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest.

Because of the symmetric insulation of the two circuits, the case that both circuits trip out often happens when the tower suffer lightning strike.

Using this model, combining the analysis of physical mechanism of back striking trip-out, the influences of <b>earth</b> <b>resistance,</b> height of tower and length of insulator on the lightning withstand level of back striking (LWLBS) were clarified. The LWLBS of high tower is much low, therefore the relative high tower should be {{paid more attention to}} defense the back striking.
