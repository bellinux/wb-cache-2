A great number of anesthetic techniques (general, regional, spinal, epidural, caudal, hypotensive, total intravenous, regional intravenous, inhalation, and nerve blocks) can be used formultiple surgical procedures [1 – 3]. The effect of anes-thetic technique on perioperative outcomes is controversial. Central neuraxial blocks including spinal, <b>epidural,</b> <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> anesthesia are regional anesthesia techniques. Regional anesthesia techniques provide important advan-tages compared with general anesthesia in some surgical procedures [1, 3]. Regional anesthesia is not only performed for adequate anesthesia in the surgical procedures. There are other advantages {{for the use of}} regional anesthesia techniques including excellent pain control, reduced sid...|$|R
2500|$|Central neuraxial {{anesthesia}} is {{the injection}} of local anesthetic around {{the spinal cord}} to provide analgesia in the abdomen, pelvis or lower extremities. [...] It is divided into either spinal (injection into the subarachnoid space), epidural (injection outside of the subarachnoid space into the <b>epidural</b> space) <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> (injection into the cauda equina or {{tail end of the}} spinal cord).

40|$|Circumcision {{is an easy}} {{commonly}} performed {{surgical procedure}} in childhood. However, it is not free of a low number of complications, (1 - 5 - 5 %). Here we report {{a case of a}} 3 -year-old boy with glans superficial necrosis after circumcision, managed with topical (nitroglycerin, gentamicin), oral (pentoxifylline) <b>and</b> <b>epidural</b> (urgent <b>caudal</b> block with bupivacaine) treatment. A review of the literature and the different treatments reported by other authors was done. After 7 days of treatment, local signs of ischemia and severe pain disappeared, without adverse events related to treatment. Although the ischemia or necrosis of the glans after circumcision are rare, we may suspect them in case of presence of severe acute pain or dark color. We report the successful management of this complication...|$|R
30|$|At {{the first}} visit to the {{outpatient}} pain department, the patient complained of severe pain throughout the body. His answer to the question “Where does it hurt most?” was “The worst discomforts are the abnormal sensation in my laryngopharyngeal area and the back pain.” He experienced very severe back pain in the region from Th 3 to Th 7. Therefore, he was administered trigger point injections (1  mL of 0.5  % lidocaine at each tender point) at the painful areas on his back. At each visit, approximately ten tender locations were treated. He was administered one set of trigger point injections monthly for 4  months, and each time, the pain subsided for several days after treatment but returned unabated after several days. Five months after his {{first visit to the}} outpatient pain department, we explained the methodologies, actions, effects, and complications of stellate ganglion block, thoracolumbar <b>epidural</b> block, <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> <b>epidural</b> block. He selected caudal epidural block, as it has a low risk of complications such as subarachnoid puncture. He underwent caudal epidural block (3  mL of 0.2  % ropivacaine +  6  mL of saline +  1.65  mg of dexamethasone) for his lumbar pain during an outpatient visit. Immediately following the caudal epidural block, not only his lumbar pain, but also his upper back pain was alleviated for approximately 2  weeks. Therefore, he underwent another caudal epidural block at his own request in the sixth month during an outpatient visit. His back pain and the abnormal sensation in the laryngopharyngeal area were alleviated for approximately 3  weeks after the second block. He continued receiving caudal epidural blocks once a month, and after a total of four blocks, his back pain was alleviated for approximately 3  weeks after the block, and the abnormal sensation in the laryngopharyngeal area almost disappeared. After approximately 3  weeks, the pain returned; however, the intensity was much lower than that at {{the first visit}}. On assessing his pain using PainVision (Kato 2011), we found that his PainVision score of 750 at the first visit reduced to 139 at the ninth month (1  month after the fourth epidural block). Medication was used as an adjunct therapy at the outpatient fibromyalgia clinic. The patient’s mental condition might have contributed to his symptoms associated with fibromyalgia; however, there was no change in his prescription drug regimen and his mental condition during the period presented in this report.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in October 1941, Robert Andrew Hingson (19131996), Waldo B. Edwards and James L.

Hingson <b>and</b> Southworth first used this technique in an operation to remove the varicose veins of a Scottish merchant seaman. Rather than removing the <b>caudal</b> <b>needle</b> after the injection as was customary, the two surgeons experimented with a continuous caudal infusion of local anesthetic. Hingson then collaborated with Edwards, the chief obstetrician at the Marine Hospital, to study the use of continuous caudal anesthesia for analgesia during childbirth. Hingson and Edwards studied the caudal region to determine where a needle could be placed to deliver anesthetic agents safely to the spinal nerves without injecting them into the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|R

50|$|The folding of {{the neural}} tube {{to form an}} actual tube does not occur all at once. Instead, it begins {{approximately}} {{at the level of}} the fourth somite at Carnegie stage 9 (around Embryonic day 20 in humans). The lateral edges of the neural plate touch in the midline and join together. This continues both cranially (toward the head) and caudally (toward the tail). The openings that are formed at the cranial <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> regions are termed the cranial <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> neuropores. In human embryos, the cranial neuropore closes approximately on day 24 <b>and</b> the <b>caudal</b> neuropore on day 28. Failure of the cranial (anterior) <b>and</b> <b>caudal</b> (posterior) neuropore closure results in conditions called anencephaly and spina bifida, respectively. Additionally, failure of the neural tube to close throughout the length of the body results in a condition called rachischisis.|$|R
