5000|$|Baumeister {{approaches}} {{the topic of}} free will from the view-point of evolutionary psychology. He has listed the major aspects that make up free will as self-control, rational, intelligent choice, planful behavior, and autonomous initiative. Baumeister proposes that [...] "the defining thrust of human psychological evolution was selection in favor of cultural capability" [...] and that these four psychological capabilities evolved to help humans function {{in the context of}} culture. In his view, free will is an advanced form of action control that allows humans to act in pro-social ways towards their enlightened self-interest when acting in these ways would otherwise be in conflict with the fulfillment of evolutionarily older drives or <b>instincts.</b> <b>Research</b> by Baumeister and colleagues (principally Kathleen Vohs) has shown that disbelief in free will can lead people to act in ways that are harmful to themselves and society, such as cheating on a test, increased aggression, decreased helpfulness, lower achievement levels in the workplace, and possible barriers to beating addiction.|$|R

50|$|Rogers {{agrees that}} we may behave {{aggressive}} and violent at times, but at such times we are neurotic and are not functioning as fully developed human beings. Rogers reverses Freud's concept of neuroticism and thinks that what Freud has construed as our natural state of being is actually unnatural and unhealthy behaviour. For Rogers, {{the core of our}} nature is essentially positive and aligned towards self-actualisation, while for Freud, we solely are driven by sexual and aggressive <b>instincts.</b> Recent <b>research</b> support Rogers' point of view as it has shown that people with an optimistic style of thought tend to cope more effectively with stress than do people who have a pessimistic style.|$|R

40|$|Enrico Fermi {{is unquestionably}} among the greats of the world's physicists, {{the most famous}} Italian {{scientist}} since Galileo. Called the Pope by his peers, he was regarded as infallible in his <b>instincts</b> and <b>research.</b> His discoveries changed our world; they led to {{weapons of mass destruction}} and conversely to life-saving medical interventions. This unassuming man struggled with issues relevant today, such as the threat of nuclear annihilation and the relationship of science to politics. Fleeing Fascism and anti-Semitism, Fermi became a leading figure in America's most secret project: building the atomic bomb. The last physicist who mastered all branches of the discipline, Fermi was a rare mixture of theorist and experimentalist. His rich legacy encompasses key advances in fields as diverse as comic rays, nuclear technology, and early computers. In their revealing book, The Pope of Physics, Gino Segré and Bettina Hoerlin bring this scientific visionary to life. An examination of the human dramas that touched Fermi’s life as well as a thrilling history of scientific innovation in the twentieth century, this is the comprehensive biography that Fermi deserves...|$|R
50|$|Instinct theory {{developed}} in the 1930s {{within the framework of}} ethology. It owes its basic ideas to William McDougall among others, and its elaboration mainly to Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen. Lorenz believed that instincts are physiological processes, and assumed they could be described as neuronal circuitry in the brain. But already Arnold Gehlen had disputed that humans still have much instinct at their disposal; for him, plasticity and learning aptitude outranked <b>instinct.</b> In today's <b>research,</b> the term <b>instinct</b> is regarded as absolete. Recent studies have demonstrated that motherly behavior is not inbred but biologically and socially determined. It is partly triggered by oxytocin, partly learned.|$|R

A comparative analysis {{was made of the}} laws of the UK, France and Italy, supplemented by an analysis of the laws of Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. By considering the role of public trust in fostering compliance with the law, the paper explores the impact of criminalisation measures on institutions’ authority to compel individuals to comply with the law (institutional legitimacy). The study finds that certain indicators question institutional legitimacy and reveals the varied nature and extent of penalties imposed by different member states. The paper concludes that there is an important role for public trust in immigration law compliance, not just in measures directed towards irregular migrants but also towards those acting in solidarity with irregular migrants...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} analyses the activity of creative idea evaluation {{in the early stages}} of the New Product Development (NPD) process. The focus of this study is on the first evaluation of ideas carried out just after the idea generation phase, which means the very rapid preliminary screening of ideas, normally done by experts. This work was undertaken by analysing in detail the activities of professional design experts who evaluate creative design ideas or concepts in a company. The study shows that there are two distinct stages in their evaluation. The first one is based on the underlying judgement, effectively a technical feasibility filter, using criteria of quite an objective nature. The second one is based upon Subjective Criteria (SC) and interestingly on just a basic 'feeling' or <b>instinct.</b> The <b>research</b> also shows that generally experts spend more time with ideas that will be accepted than ones that will end up rejected. In addition the study indicates that long idea-evaluation sessions are not very beneficial. The data shows a distinct difference in the mindset of the participants after an hour and many more ideas were rejected. This research suggests that good ideas may have been excluded or lost due to the duration of the session...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{topic of}} my bachelors thesis, {{entitled}} "Suicidal Behaviour in Children and Adolescents is swathed {{in a certain}} mystery. Even though {{it is the second}} most common cause of death in young people, it is rarely discussed and often overlooked. Perhaps all of us once in our lives, especially during adolescence, have wondered thought what would happen if we were no longer be here, if we were to leave this world voluntarily. But of course it is a very big step from having the idea to actually putting it into practice. This work focuses specifically on those children and adolescents who went so far that they tried to cross the boundary dividing life and death. The theoretical part covers suicidal behaviour in general and explains some of the terms associated with this subject. This section also discusses the different forms and methods involved in suicidal behaviour. Another important part comprises the risk factors or developmental aspects of suicidal behaviour and the concept of death. Also worth mentioning is self-harming, which is closely connected with suicidal activities. The last chapter is devoted to prevention, which is this case is indispensable. The aim of my work is to describe the disorder of the self-preservation instinct and to assess the characteristics shared by a sample of children and adolescents with a case history of suicidal behaviour. Based on the information available I decided to carry out a qualitative survey. The documents analysis method was used for this. More specifically, this was documentation available concerning children and adolescents who had been observed as having a disorder of the self-preservation <b>instinct.</b> The <b>research</b> sample consisted of fifteen boys with a case history of suicidal behaviour and who were hospitalized in a mental institution. As this was a small, monothematic sample group, I opted for the qualitative form of work. The most crucial result of the research was the finding that children with suicidal habits come from a background with a low level of emotion and inadequate emotional support. These deficiencies then make it harder for the person to adapt and unable to deal with conflict situations...|$|R

O 2 ̆ 7 Connor found parallels with Jung 2 ̆ 7 s theory of the unconscious and Catholic dogma, but ultimately found White 2 ̆ 7 s Catholicized presentation of the unconscious, which equated the unconscious psyche with the soul, more amenable to her faith. This research first highlights the attention O 2 ̆ 7 Connor gave to Jung 2 ̆ 7 s and White 2 ̆ 7 s theories of the unconscious as found in her public lectures, her personal letters and in her book reviews. In these, she expresses great doubts about the conscious, rational mind 2 ̆ 7 s ability to understand Reality and argues instead that it is ultimately Mysterious. Her letters also reveal her shared concern with both Jung and White that the Church has become too influenced by the modern temper and has abandoned its respect for Mystery and for the individual 2 ̆ 7 s personal religious <b>instincts.</b> This <b>research</b> then examines how her understanding of the unconscious is manifest in her first novel, Wise Blood, and four of her most popular short stories: 2 ̆ 2 A Good Man Is Hard to Find, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Good Country People, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 The Displaced Person, 2 ̆ 2 and her very last story 2 ̆ 2 Judgment Day. 2 ̆ 2 In the novel and the stories we find her protagonists, whom she once labeled as 2 ̆ 2 Christ-haunted, 2 ̆ 2 driven by an unconscious and seemingly irrational force that longs for and leads them toward their eternal Home.

40|$|Introduction. Ecological farming {{occupies}} a special position among various technologies in agriculture. It {{is based on}} modern, environment friendly technologies which do not use synthetic chemical substances (fertilizers, pesticides, drugs, growth enhancers, etc.), but use their substitutes instead. Ecological rabbit breeding is a novelty in Lithuania; however, the observations prove {{that the number of}} those willing to run such farms is increasing. The conditions of rabbit keeping must be as close to natural as possible to assure that the wellbeing and health requirements for the animals are fulfilled. Rabbits must have a possibility to move freely, satisfy their <b>instincts.</b> Goal of <b>research.</b> The research aims to study the digestibility of nutrients in rations used for feeding rabbits with ecological feedstuffs. Method of research. The research has been carried out at the vivariums of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy using New Zealand rabbit breed. To study digestibility 3 groups were formed, 10 rabbits aged 60 days were selected from each group. The rabbits were kept in individual cages and had sufficient of water. The same feedstuffs as on ecological farms were used. The research consisted of the following stages: 1. Adaptation (duration – 3 days); 2. Preparatory stage (duration – 5 days); 3. Collection of faeces and stale (duration – 5 days). Review of research data. The crude protein and raw fat in ration perform a specific function of life-support and production, in case of necessity {{can be used as a}} source of energy. If there is a surplus of protein, after deamination it can be used for production of energy (Hulot et al., 1996). The research on digestibility has demonstrated that the most influenced area was the digestibility of crude protein, raw cell matter. The average intake of feedstuff dry matter is 62 g per 1 kilo of rabbit body mass. The chemical analysis of the meat has shown that the feedstuffs used did not largely affect the quality of the meat. In all the groups the cholesterol level in meat did not exceed the permitted limits (was less than 36 mg/ 100 g). Conclusions. In rabbit breeding on ecological farms the application of complex rations and amino acids obtained from night faeces suffice to satisfy their nutritional needs. The obtained digestibility coefficients of feedstuff nutrients point to a high level of digestion of nutrients, which assures fulfillment of rabbits’ nutritional needs. The proteins in pulses are rich in indispensable amino acids (especially lysine) and their digestibility is better compared to that of grains. Swallowing of night faeces affects the digestibility of nutrients in the ration, especially that of proteins. When caprofagy is incomplete, digestibility of dry matter decreases by 6 %...|$|R
