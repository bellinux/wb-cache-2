5|$|<b>Farthest</b> South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for <b>Farthest</b> South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the Board of Transportation {{issued a}} $1billion {{plan that would}} extend the subway to the <b>farthest</b> reaches of the outer boroughs.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2016, {{researchers}} using Hubble data {{announced the}} discovery of the <b>farthest</b> known galaxy to date: GN-z11. The Hubble observations occurred on February 11, 2015, and April 3, 2015, as part of the CANDELS/GOODS-North surveys.|$|E
5|$|UEFA {{acknowledges}} Maribor {{as one of}} {{the winners}} of the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup, however, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced <b>farthest</b> in UEFA competitions that season.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the temple}} <b>farthest</b> from the door was a {{substantial}} monument to Robert Petre, a renowned 18th-century horticulturist. Executed in stucco and probably crafted by Roubiliac, it depicted an angel blowing the last trump, causing a stone pyramid to crumble and revealing the corpse within to be rising from the dead.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the <b>farthest</b> comet {{from the}} Sun {{discovered}} by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was {{visible to the naked}} eye for twice as long as the previous record-holder. It was also brighter than magnitude0 for eightweeks, longer than any other recorded comet.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danielle did {{not have}} any impact on land and no damage or {{fatalities}} were reported. No ships were reported to have come into contact with Danielle. When Danielle became a tropical storm at 24.8°W, it was the <b>farthest</b> east that a storm had received a name since Hurricane Alberto in the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Nansen's <b>farthest</b> north record {{lasted for}} just over five years. On 24 April 1900 {{a party of}} three from an Italian {{expedition}} led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86°34′N, having left Franz Josef Land with dogs and sledges on 11 March. The party barely made it back; one of their support groups of three men vanished entirely.|$|E
5|$|The aphelion, or <b>farthest</b> {{point from}} the Sun, {{would be in}} the general {{direction}} of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the Sun, {{would be in the}} general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.|$|E
5|$|The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is {{closest to}} the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, {{it is also the}} <b>farthest</b> above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, {{preventing}} a collision.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on September 1, a tank-led relief {{force of}} C Company {{headquarters}} troops cleared {{the road to}} Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition {{just in time for}} it to repel another North Korean assault, killing 77 and capturing 21 North Koreans. Although Fisher's 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines. The <b>farthest</b> eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north-south road there.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its <b>farthest</b> distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
5|$|Bénouville was the <b>farthest</b> forward {{point of}} the British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force {{attacked}} the bridges with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized anti-aircraft guns around the bridges and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the ensuing}} months, the {{expedition}} explored the southern Pacific Ocean before Cook took Resolution south again—Adventure had retired back to South Africa after a fracas with the New Zealand native population. This time Cook {{was able to}} penetrate deep beyond the Antarctic Circle, and on 30 January 1774 reached 71°10'S, his <b>Farthest</b> South, but {{the state of the}} ice made further southward travel impossible. This southern record would hold for 49years.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{expedition}} 1907–1909 he and three companions established {{a new record}} <b>Farthest</b> South latitude at 88°S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles, 180km) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. For these achievements, Shackleton was knighted by King Edward VII on his return home.|$|E
5|$|Eris is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) and {{a member}} of a high-eccentricity {{population}} known as the scattered disk. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. , its distance from the Sun was , roughly three times that of Pluto. With the exception of some long-period comets, Eris and Dysnomia are currently the second-most-distant known natural objects in the Solar System, the <b>farthest</b> object being V774104 discovered in November 2015 at 103 AU.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the ground}} of Queen Maud Land is {{dominated}} by Precambrian gneiss, formed c.1 to 1.2Ga, before {{the creation of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks, formed c.500 to 600Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In the <b>farthest</b> western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{a corner}} of our 60m3 room <b>farthest</b> away from the apparatus, we {{exploded}} 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh later joined Ernest Joyce {{and others}} on a journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna Bluff, to lay a depot for Shackleton's polar party, whose return from their {{southern}} march was awaited. On 3 March, while keeping watch {{on the deck of}} Nimrod, Mackintosh observed a flare, which signalled the safe return of Shackleton and his party. They had fallen just short of their South Pole objective, having reached a <b>Farthest</b> South of 88° 23' S.|$|E
5|$|Operation Market Garden was an {{airborne}} assault by three {{divisions in the}} Netherlands in September 1944, including the British 1st and the American 82nd and 101st, to secure key bridges and towns along the expected Allied axis of advance. <b>Farthest</b> north, 1st Airborne, supported by the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting an easy advance, XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, to reach the airborne force at Arnhem within two to three days.|$|E
5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, {{and much}} of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the local communities <b>farthest</b> from the coast have larger temperature ranges, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{established}} the general geography of this region, and named {{many of its}} features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, {{but was unable to}} do so, achieving his <b>Farthest</b> South in a small Barrier inlet at 78°10′, in February 1842. Ross suspected that land lay to the east of the Barrier, but was unable to confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Some Solar System models {{attempt to}} convey the {{relative}} scales involved in the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361-ft) Ericsson Globe in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Arlanda International Airport, 40km (25mi) away, whereas the <b>farthest</b> current object, Sedna, is a 10-cm (4-in) sphere in Luleå, 912km (567mi) away.|$|E
5|$|The American {{plan was}} that Putnam would direct the {{defenses}} from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their {{troops would be}} stationed on the Guan Heights. The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights. Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell {{back to the main}} defenses at Brooklyn Heights. There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road <b>farthest</b> to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, {{in the center of the}} American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Road <b>farthest</b> to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively. Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known pass through the heights farther to the east called the Jamaica Pass, which was defended by just five militia officers on horses.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. Kayaks were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous <b>Farthest</b> North record of 83°24.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve have {{walked on the}} Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. The <b>farthest</b> that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season Ross {{returned and}} located an inlet in the Barrier face that enabled him, on 23 January 1842, {{to extend his}} <b>Farthest</b> South to 78°09'30"S, a record which would remain unchallenged for 58years. Although Ross {{had not been able}} to land on the Antarctic continent, nor approach the location of the South Magnetic Pole, on his return to England in 1843 he was knighted for his achievements in geographical and scientific exploration.|$|E
5|$|The {{most heavily}} trafficked station is Jernbanetorget, which is {{adjacent}} to Oslo Central Station, closely followed by Majorstuen, the main transfer station between lines {{west of the}} city center and to several lines of the Oslo Tramway, and Nationaltheatret, {{which is in the}} heart of the city center and provides direct transfer to trains on the Drammen Line. All three stations are in the Common Tunnel. The least-used station is Lillevann, which serves the recreational area of Nordmarka. At a distance of , Kolsås is the <b>farthest</b> from the city center.|$|E
5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second <b>farthest</b> from the planet among its five major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{holds the}} record for being the <b>farthest</b> {{northeast}} forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October4. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center. The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6, though the remnants merged with a separate system near the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vince {{was named}} on October 9 {{in the east}} Atlantic near Madeira (east-southeast of the Azores) and was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane later that day though later analysis indicated that it had formed as a subtropical storm the previous day. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the eastern Atlantic, well away from where hurricanes are usually found. This may be the <b>farthest</b> north and east a tropical cyclone has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914, Morshead {{resigned}} his teaching position and his commission in the Cadet Corps to travel to Sydney and enlist as a private in the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in September. He landed at Anzac on 25 April 1915, and his battalion made the <b>farthest</b> advance of any Australian unit that day. Invalided to Australia, he became commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which he led on the Western Front at Messines, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, and Amiens.|$|E
5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these <b>farthest</b> reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on September 1, {{a relief}} force of C Company {{headquarters}} troops, led by American tanks, cleared {{the road to}} Sibidang-san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon, B Company, with ammunition {{just in time for}} it to repel another North Korean assault. This failed assault resulted in the killing of 77 and capturing of 21 North Koreans. Although the 35th Infantry held all its original positions, except that of the forward platoon of G Company, 3,000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines. The <b>farthest</b> eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north-south road there.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the <b>farthest</b> it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
