500|$|The song [...] "Threshold" [...] {{is about}} {{reaching}} one's limit {{with a person}} in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get [...] "under your skin", while [...] "Cast Down" [...] features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. [...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on serial killers, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really [...] "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted he was trying to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> person's mind; [...] "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mindset." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{musician}} Weldon [...] "Big Bill" [...] Lister, {{who performed}} in the Hadacol Caravan, [...] "The only way you could <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> show was with a Hadacol boxtop, And believe me, we played to crowds of ten, twelve thousand people a night. Back in those days there wasn't many auditoriums that would hold that many people. We played ball parks, race tracks - you know anywhere where they had enough big bleachers to handle those kind of crowds." [...] The final show was on 17 September 1951. Paul Schrader wrote a script entitled Eight Scenes from the Life of Hank Wlliams, which {{has not yet been}} produced. It includes a sequence on his performances with the Hadacol Caravan.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Guitar Mix" [...] {{features}} Vernon Reid of Living Colour. Reid stated, [...] "'Black Cat' {{was one of}} {{my favorite}} tracks on Rhythm Nation. I had the song and learned the parts, the structure of it, and just went in and did it. I think we used the second take. I just wanted to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> arena thing. It's meant to sound really big." [...] Jesse Johnson provided a guitar solo which was not used for the album version, but is featured in each of its remixes. The remixes have the added component of live drumming performed by Derek Organ of Switch, showcasing more of a heavy metal feel in the extended solo and double kick drums. Both versions omit the panther roar introduction and vocal refrain closing from the album edit.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1994 {{the band}} moved to Crossover Soundstage in Atlanta, Georgia. At Crossover, {{most of the}} album's basic tracks were {{recorded}} live, as if the band were playing in concert. Litt said, [...] "I thought since they hadn't toured in a while, {{it would be good}} for them to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> mind-set--you know, monitors, PA, standing up". The sessions were hampered by a number of events, including Berry and bassist Mike Mills falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members, and the deaths of Stipe's friends River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain. The band wrote and recorded [...] "Let Me In" [...] in tribute to Cobain, and dedicated the album to Phoenix, whose sister Rain sang background vocals on [...] "Bang and Blame".|$|E

5000|$|He is {{mentioned}} in the classical 1950 Billie Wilder film Sunset Boulevard by Joe Gillis's agent: [...] "Once a talent like yours <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through. / Gillis: Forget Romanoff's." ...|$|R

2500|$|In June 2011, French actress Élodie Yung {{was cast}} as Jinx for the 2013 film [...] Jinx was {{featured}} in the first promotional pictures and trailer, shown sparring against Snake Eyes while clad in red and blindfolded, and fighting together with him against the Red Ninjas while wearing a yellow suit. Yung, who already owned a black belt in karate, prepared {{for about a month}} for the role, focusing on her cardio [...] "because of how demanding it all was", and training in the Chinese martial art wushu for dual sword fighting. The cliff battle scene required two months of green screen work to be done. Yung also said: [...] "I was wearing a yellow costume that got pretty hot. It looks sexy, but I needed five people to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> suit." [...] According to MTV, [...] "the totally silent mountainside battle between Snake Eyes, Jinx and a squad of Cobra ninjas mirrors the similarly silent comic book issue in the original Marvel series, which depicts Snake Eyes rescuing Scarlett from a Cobra castle in the Balkans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trouble {{was formed}} in 1979 by Rick Wartell and was joined by guitarist Bruce Franklin, vocalist Eric Wagner, bassist Tim Ian Brown (not to be {{confused}} with lead singer of English band The Stone Roses), and drummer Jeff Olson. Ian Brown was replaced by Sean McAllister in 1983. Drawing from Black Sabbath for inspiration (with occasional nods to the psychedelic sounds of the late 1960s), the band used gloomy down-tuned riffs and spiritual, often openly Bible-inspired lyrics, which led Metal Blade to market the band as [...] "white metal" [...] as opposed to black metal. [...] "I was brought up Catholic", vocalist and primary lyric writer Wagner explains in the liner notes of Psalm 9 re-issue (2006), [...] "but you have to remember, back in the early 1980s, all the metal was kind of satanic, and I did not <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> vibe." [...] Wagner has implied that Metal Blade actually came up with the term in the first place, which the band rejected: [...] "I think it was more like Metal Blade trying to be cute or something, with everything [...] being called black metal, why not call us white metal, which is a bunch of crap." ...|$|E

60|$|This {{was real}} delight, for between her excitements Ethelberta had been seriously sick-hearted at the horrible {{possibility}} of his never calling again. But alas! for Christopher.
