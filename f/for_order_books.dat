40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{stochastic}} order-driven market model with waiting costs, <b>for</b> <b>order</b> <b>books</b> with heterogenous traders. Offer and demand of liquidity drives price formation and traders anticipate future evolutions of the order book. The natural framework we use is mean field game theory, a class of stochastic differential games with a continuum of anonymous players. Several sources of heterogeneity are considered including the mean size of orders. Thus {{we are able to}} consider the coexistence of Institutional Investors and High Frequency Traders (HFT). We provide both analytical solutions and numerical experiments. Implications on classical quantities are explored: order book size, prices, and effective bid/ask spread. According to the model, in markets with Institutional Investors only we show the existence of inefficient liquidity imbalances in equilibrium, with two symmetrical situations corresponding to what we call liquidity calls for liquidity. During these situations the transaction price significantly moves away from the fair price. However this macro phenomenon disappears in markets with both Institutional Investors and HFT, although a more precise study shows that the benefits of the new situation go to HFT only, leaving Institutional Investors even with higher trading costs.

State dependency is included in our framework by allowing the order flow intensities to depend on the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> state. Furthermore, contrary to most existing models, the impact of the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> updates on the reference price dynamics is not assumed to be instantaneous.

40|$|Electronic limit <b>order</b> <b>books</b> are {{ubiquitous}} in markets today. However, theoretical models <b>for</b> limit <b>order</b> markets fail {{to explain the}} real world data well. Sandas (2001) tests the classic Glosten (1994) model <b>for</b> <b>order</b> <b>book</b> equilibrium and rejects it. We reconfirm this result {{for one of the}} largest European stock markets. We then relax one of the model's assumptions and allow the informational content of trades to change over time. Adapting Hasbrouck's (1991 a,b) methodology to estimate time varying trade informativeness we find that it is a slowly mean reverting process. By conditioning on trade informativeness, we find support for the Glosten model's implication that books are more shallow during times of informative market orders. However, a high level of liquidity supply is committed up to an economically significant trade size volume, even when trade informativeness is high. This {{can be seen as a}} vindication of the open <b>order</b> <b>book</b> design which dispenses with dedicated market makers. We also find evidence <b>for</b> a market <b>order</b> trader population which is quite heterogenous with respect to price sensitivity...|$|R

For the off-book market, trades in clustered (popular) sizes carry significantly more information than non-clustered trades. Despite the significant differences in the price impact estimates between the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> and off-book, we show that traders placing large orders off-book are still better off than trading via the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> as they benefit from a large discount from the current midpoint price.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} broker anonymity on bid-ask spreads in order driven markets. Previous theoretical research predicts that limit order anonymity results in deeper and more liquid markets. This paper examines this proposition using three natural experiments provided by Euronext Paris, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Korea Stock Exchange. Euronext Paris and the Tokyo Stock Exchange removed broker identifiers from limit orders on April 23, 2001 and June 30, 2003, respectively.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{modeling}} {{framework for the}} dynamics of a reduced form <b>order</b> <b>book</b> in event time and based on event sizes. Our framework <b>for</b> the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> is influenced by [9], but compared to [9] we allow the best bid ask spread to be larger than one tick. Based on the modeling assumption that the best bid {{as well as the}} best ask price can only move by at most one tick (up or down), when an event occurs, we show that the dynamics of this simplified <b>order</b> <b>book</b> is completely described by a non-linear transformation of two processes (X, Y). A key challenge in the modeling is the empirical fact that the high frequency order flow is strongly autocorrelated, a fact {{we have to deal with}} in the modeling of (X, Y). The core of our framework is a semi linear regression type model for (X, Y), influence by more classical ARMA and AR models, and one key degree of freedom is the potentially non-linear basis functions used in the regression. We use results from the theory of random iterative function systems to understand issues concerning stationarity and ergodicity in our models. We show how to rapidly calibrate the model by inverting block Toeplitz matrices in an efficient way. All components are worked through and explain in an application and the predictability of the model <b>for</b> <b>order</b> flows and price moves are analyzed in the context of a high frequency dataset...|$|R
