40|$|Reviewed in {{this article}} are {{selected}} recent advances and future challenges for psychiatric epidemiology. Major advances in <b>descriptive</b> psychiatric <b>epidemiology</b> in recent years include the development of reliable and valid fully structured diagnostic interviews, the implementation of parallel cross-national surveys of the prevalences and correlates of mental disorders, and the initiation of research in clinical epidemiology. Remaining challenges include the refinement of diagnostic categories and criteria, recognition and evaluation of systematic underreporting bias in surveys of mental disorders, creation and use of accurate assessment tools for studying disorders of children, adolescents, the elderly, and people in less developed countries, and setting up systems to carry out small area estimations for needs assessment and programme planning. Advances in analytical and experimental epidemiology have been more modest. A major challenge is for psychiatric epidemiologists to increase the relevance of their analytical research to their colleagues in preventative psychiatry as well as to social policy analysts. Another challenge is to develop interventions aimed at increasing the proportion of people with mental disorders who receive treatment. Despite encouraging advances, much work still needs to be conducted before psychiatric epidemiology can realize its potential to improve the mental health of populations...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A common {{issue in}} <b>descriptive</b> injury <b>epidemiology</b> {{is that in}} order to {{calculate}} injury rates that account for the time spent in an activity, both injury cases and exposure time of specific activities need to be collected. In reality, few national surveys have this capacity. To address this issue, we combined statistics from two different national complex surveys as inputs for the numerator and denominator to estimate injury rate, accounting for the time spent in specific activities and included a procedure to estimate variance using the combined surveys. METHODS: The 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was used to quantify injuries, and the 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) was used to quantify time of exposure to specific activities. The injury rate was estimated by dividing the average number of injuries (from NHIS) by average exposure hours (from ATUS), both measured for specific activities. The variance was calculated using the 2 ̆ 7 delta method 2 ̆ 7, a general method for variance estimation with complex surveys. RESULTS: Among the five types of injuries examined, 2 ̆ 7 sport and exercise 2 ̆ 7 had the highest rate (12. 64 injuries per 100 000 h), followed by 2 ̆ 7 working around house/yard 2 ̆ 7 (6. 14), driving/riding a motor vehicle (2. 98), working (1. 45) and sleeping/resting/eating/drinking (0. 23). The results show a ranking of injury rate by activity quite different from estimates using population as the denominator. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach produces an estimate of injury risk which includes activity exposure time and may more reliably reflect the underlying injury risks, offering an alternative method for injury surveillance and research...|$|R

The spoligotyping analysis identified 10 distinct M. bovis profiles (SB 0121 n = 14, SB 0295 n = 6, SB 0140 n = 6, SB 0881 n = 3, SB 1144 n = 2, SB 1145 n = 2, SB 0134 n = 1, SB 1050 n = 1, SB 1055 n = 1, SB 1136 n = 1) grouped in six clusters and four orphan patterns. The MIRU-VNTR 24 -loci grouped the same isolates in six clusters and 22 unique orphan patterns, showing higher discriminatory power than spoligotyping. When associating the results of both techniques, the isolates were grouped in five clusters and 24 unique M. bovis profiles. Among the 24 -loci MIRUVNTR evaluated, two, ETR-A and QUB 11 b loci, showed high discriminatory ability (h = > 0. 50), while MIRU 16, MIRU 27, ETR-B, ETR-C, Mtub 21 and QUB 26 loci showed moderate ability (h = 0. 33 or h = 0. 49) and were the most effective in evaluating the genotypic similarities among the clinical M. bovis isolate samples.

It is known that individuals who are socially vulnerable {{are more susceptible to}} HIV transmission and tuberculosis as well. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a geoepidemiological study on HIV/AIDS, AIDS-Tuberculosis co-infection and social vulnerability. METHOD: This is an ecological study using incidence rates and the human development index to produce thematic maps and a <b>descriptive</b> analysis of <b>epidemiology.</b> The records of reported cases of HIV/AIDS from 1982 to 2007 were used, considering as cases of AIDS-Tuberculosis those records that were positively diagnosed with tuberculosis and those records with unknown diagnosis of tuberculosis, but showing compatible signs and symptoms with tuberculosis (fever, cough, cachexia and asthenia). RESULTS: The maps allowed the identification of areas with social differences and different patterns of incidence of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-Tuberculosis; regional differences were similar to those found by Josu&# 233; de Castro, in 1940; regions with higher human development index values also showed higher incidence HIV/AIDS and AIDS-Tuberculosis.
