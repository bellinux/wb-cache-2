[...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he just blew the whistle."

500|$|After {{the opening}} skirmishes {{of the war}} took place near Boston, Cornwallis put his {{politics}} aside and sought active service. [...] Despite {{his opposition to the}} king's colonial policy, Cornwallis had retained King George III's favour, and was rapidly promoted. [...] On September 29, 1775 he was promoted to major general. [...] In November he offered to serve in North America on a proposed expedition to the southern colonies, even though the number of officers that were senior to him in rank meant he was unlikely to get an independent command. [...] This generosity was appreciated by the king and by Lord George Germain, the secretary of state for the colonies. [...] On January 1, 1776 he was given the rank of lieutenant general in North America. [...] His orders from Lord Germain were to accompany a convoy of troops from Cork, Ireland to North America, where he was to join at Cape Fear, North Carolina with General Henry Clinton, who was bringing troops from Boston for operations in the southern colonies. [...] Clinton arrived at Cape Fear well before the earl, since logistics delayed the convoy's departure, and then bad weather slowed its progress across the Atlantic. [...] Cornwallis expected to have good relations with Clinton; a mutual friend, William Phillips, reported Cornwallis to be [...] "very happy to think he shall serve under an old friend and a man <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>so</b> good an opinion of." ...|$|E

[...] Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: [...] " [...] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're {{going to have to change}} the rules."
