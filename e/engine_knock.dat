5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4â€“25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
25|$|Automotive engine {{management}} systems use piezoelectric transducers to detect <b>Engine</b> <b>knock</b> (Knock Sensor, KS), {{also known as}} detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.|$|E
25|$|When the {{pressure}} of the engine's intake air is increased, its temperature also increases. In addition, heat soak from the hot exhaust gases spinning the turbine will also heat the intake air. The warmer the intake air, the less dense, and the less oxygen available for the combustion event, which reduces volumetric efficiency. Not only does excessive intake-air temperature reduce efficiency, it also leads to <b>engine</b> <b>knock,</b> or detonation, which is destructive to engines.|$|E
50|$|An {{antiknock}} {{agent is}} a gasoline additive {{used to reduce}} <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> and increase the fuel's octane rating by raising the temperature and pressure at which auto-ignition occurs.|$|R
50|$|Water {{injection}} {{was used}} historically {{to increase the}} power output of military aviation engines for short durations, such as dogfights or takeoff. However {{it has also been}} used in motor sport and notably in drag racing. In Otto cycle engines, the cooling effects of water injection also enables greater compression ratios by reducing <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (detonation). Alternately, this reduction in <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> in Otto cycle engines means that some applications gain significant performance when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger, turbocharger, or modifications such as aggressive ignition timing.|$|R
50|$|Triacetin {{can also}} be used as a fuel {{additive}} as an antiknock agent which can reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> in gasoline, and to improve cold and viscosity properties of biodiesel.|$|R
500|$|A {{murder of}} giant crows attacks the {{vegetable}} car during the drive, forcing Wirt to veer {{off into a}} cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole, which scares off the crows. Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the [...] "big city," [...] {{which turns out to}} be an old-fashioned small farm community {{in the middle of the}} cornfield. While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car, Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city's gazebo garden party. Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage. Crops apologizes and there's a sudden announcement that the party's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled. Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities, and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician. Back at the car, Wirt, who can't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables, and Beatrice, who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car's front bumper to start the <b>engine,</b> <b>knock</b> over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working. This summons the giant crows, as well as giant turkeys, who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants. Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg, while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music, unaware of the chaos around him, even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention. As Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops, they are set upon by the giant animals, who start to devour the vegetable car. As Wirt tries to fend them off, Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed. Suddenly, they hear Greg's screams from the cornfield. The screams continue, until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield, unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride. The city becomes peaceful once more, as Greg's screams had scared the birds off forever, and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate, the cabbage woman. Wirt, Gregory, Beatrice, and their new companion Goose, continue to travel onwards, deeper and deeper, into the Unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{gave the}} Bel Air top marks for handling. Popular Mechanics reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with Powerglide as being 0-60mph in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride, and good visibility. On the other hand, the horn ring blocked {{some of the}} speedometer, regular gasoline made the <b>engine</b> <b>knock,</b> and the first V8 engines off the line burned too much oil. Front legroom was 43.1". Brakes were 11" [...] drums. A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was air conditioning, with outlets {{on each side of}} the dashboard; a heavy-duty generator was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.|$|E
5000|$|Less <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and noise: as {{the fuel}} {{is quick to}} ignite, it also burns longer, which allows the {{pressure}} to rise more smoothly in the chamber ...|$|E
50|$|Higher {{compression}} ratios will however make gasoline engines {{subject to}} <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used.

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost octane rating and reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b> The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|R
5000|$|The mixture {{known as}} {{gasoline}} or petrol, {{when used in}} high compression internal combustion engines, {{has a tendency to}} knock (also called [...] "pinging" [...] or [...] "pinking") and/or to ignite early before the correctly timed spark occurs (pre-ignition, refer to <b>engine</b> <b>knocking).</b>|$|R
50|$|Unintentional {{detonation}} when deflagration {{is desired}} {{is a problem}} in some devices. In internal combustion engines it is called <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> or pinging or pinking, and it causes a loss of power and excessive heating of certain components.

50|$|Methanol is (In {{automotive}} terms) hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} will absorb water vapor {{directly from the}} atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the methanol (although it suppresses <b>engine</b> <b>knock),</b> and may cause phase separation of methanol-gasoline blends, containers of methanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed.|$|E
50|$|First, {{a higher}} {{mechanical}} compression ratio (or, with super-charged or turbo-charged engines, maximum combustion pressure) {{may be used}} for better thermodynamic efficiency. Since fuel is not present in the combustion chamber until virtually the point at which combustion is required to begin, there is no risk of pre-ignition or <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ethylbenzene {{is added}} to {{gasoline}} as an anti-knock agent, meaning it reduces <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> and increase the octane rating.

50|$|The SKYACTIV-G or {{formerly}} SKY-G is {{a family}} of direct injection gasoline engines. The engine compression ratio is increased to 14:1. To {{reduce the risk of}} <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> at high compression, residual gas is reduced by using 4-2-1 engine exhaust systems, implementing a piston cavity, and optimizing fuel injection. In addition, combustion duration is shortened by intensifying air flow, increasing injection pressure, and using multi-hole injectors.|$|E
50|$|An {{optional}} trip computer, the SCC, {{was introduced}} for the 1993 model year, and provided mileage, speed warning, and alarm functions. A new turbocharger management system, Trionic 5, was equipped from the 1993 model year onwards.

5000|$|Raising the {{compression}} ratio {{by reducing the}} size of the combustion chamber, which makes more efficient use of the cylinder pressure developed and leading to more rapid burning of fuel, by using larger compression height pistons or thinner head gaskets, or by using a milling machine or [...] "shaving" [...] the cylinder head. High compression ratios can cause <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> unless high octane fuels are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotary valve}} {{combustion}} engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional assemblies, including significantly higher compression ratios and rpm, meaning more power, {{a much more}} compact and light-weight cylinder head, and reduced complexity, meaning higher reliability and lower cost.

5000|$|India: India's {{ordinary}} and premium gasolines are of 91 RON. The premium gasolines are generally ordinary fuels with additives, {{that do not}} really change the octane value. Two variants, [...] "Speed 93" [...] and [...] "Speed 97", were launched, with RON values of 93 and 97. India's economy-class vehicles usually have compression ratios under 10:1, thus enabling them to use lower-octane gasoline without <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{high output}} and low fuel consumption, the MIVEC system and other {{measures}} (including optimized shaping of the intake and exhaust manifolds and cylinder head) were used to promote intake and exhaust efficiency.
