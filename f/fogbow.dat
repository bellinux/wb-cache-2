50|$|Blevins’ first {{national}} publication was in Richard Grossinger’s Io. He has published four books of poetry, three since 2000. Three Sleeps: A Historomance (1992) announced the poet as what Olson called an ‘istorin, or one who sees for himself. Its trip {{reports from the}} American West include poems written during field work for his dissertation. <b>Fogbow</b> Bridge: Selected Poems, 1972-1999 (2000) makes available all the material that the poet, at 50, wished to claim. Herman Melville is the presiding spirit, from the title through a central poem, “Clarel’s Motel,” of this collection. His two latest books are exercises in the long poem and meant to extend the poet’s range from history into studies in music and photography. Castle Tubin (2006) features meditations on Shostakovitch’s “Preludes and Fugues” and the symphonies of Eduard Tubin. Captivity Narratives (2008) pairs long poems on the lost careers of photographer Fred Holland Day and pre-Imagist Adelaide Crapsey.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fogbows</b> form in {{the same}} way as rainbows, but they are formed by much smaller cloud and fog {{droplets}} that diffract light extensively. They are almost white with faint reds on the outside and blues inside; often one or more broad supernumerary bands can be discerned inside the inner edge. The colours are dim because the bow in each colour is very broad and the colours overlap. <b>Fogbows</b> are commonly seen over water when air in contact with the cooler water is chilled, but they can be found anywhere if the fog is thin enough for the sun to shine through and the sun is fairly bright. They are very large—almost as big as a rainbow and much broader. They sometimes appear with a glory at the bow's centre.|$|R
50|$|A {{photometeor}} is a {{topic in}} atmospheric optics. These can be bright objects or phenomena appearing in Earth's atmosphere when sunlight or moonlight creates a reflection, refraction, diffraction or interference under particular circumstances. The most frequent are halos, rainbows, <b>fogbows,</b> cloud iridescences (or irisation), glories, Bishop's rings, coronas, crepuscular rays, parhelia, light pillars, mirages, scintillations, green flashes, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} on the optics of fogbows is scarce, and their polarization characteristics {{have never been}} measured to our knowledge. To fill this gap we measured the polarization features of 16 fogbows during the Beringia 2005 Arctic polar research expedition by imaging polarimetry in the red, green and blue spectral ranges. We present here the first polarization patterns of the <b>fogbow.</b> In the patterns {{of the degree of}} linear polarization p, fogbows and their supernumerary bows are best visible in the red spectral range due to the least dilution of <b>fogbow</b> light by light scattered in air. In the patterns of the angle of polarization α fogbows are practically not discernible because their α-pattern is {{the same as that of}} the sky: the direction of polarization is perpendicular to the plane of scattering and is parallel to the arc of the bow, independently of the wavelength. Fogbows and their supernumeraries were best seen in the patterns of the polarized radiance. In these patterns the angular distance δ between the peaks of the primary and the first supernumerary and the angular width σ of the primary bow were determined along different radii from the center of the bow. δ ranged between 6. 08 ° and 13. 41 °, while σ changed from 5. 25 ° to 19. 47 °. Certain fogbows were relatively homogeneous, meaning small variations of δ and σ along their bows. Other fogbows were heterogeneous, possessing quite variable δ- and σ-values along their bows. This variability could be a consequence of the characteristics of the high Arctic with open waters within the ice shield resulting in the spatiotemporal change of the droplet size within the fo...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} method to render rainbows, coronas, fogbows, and halos realistically with a 3 D scene in real-time using pre-calculated lookup textures. A summary of the basic physics of rainbows and other atmospheric phenomena is also provided. Rainbows, fogbows, corona (around the sun) and halos (around the moon) are each created when small water droplets scatter light {{in a particular way}} as it travels to your eye. This whitepaper tells you how to create this effect in a 3 D scene without computing a complex equation for every pixel on the screen. It explains the basic optics behind rainbows, fogbows, coronas and halos and tells you where to find out all the gritty details behind the physics. It lists the steps to render a rainbow using lookup textures. It discusses how to combine these light effects with the rest of your scene and describes directions for future work. After reading this whitepaper you should have all the info you need to add a realistic rainbow, <b>fogbow,</b> corona, or halo to your game engine...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the metaphors of the rainbow and the <b>fogbow,</b> {{investigations}} and evaluations, public Internet monitors, writing women, reflections and discussions about politics, design and democracy. It is also about the ongoing re-structuring of participation in service design within the development of E-Government. The aim behind the drive towards E-Government is to modernise administration {{and make it more}} efficient. The transformation and modernisation of public services are proclaimed to bring about a change in services based on a 'citizen-centred approach. ' In such a process, communication between citizens and public authorities should play an essential role. Themes such as accountability, accessibility and participation all form part of the reconfiguration {{and at the same time}} these themes is shaped by the transformation. The papers in this thesis discuss, in different ways, how this reconfiguration is enacted in practice. Theories and methodologies from feminist theories, participatory design and informatics, are used in order to develop broader and more complex understandings of ongoing development within E-Government. Introduction to the papers Paper I Everyday Dialogue and Design for Co-Operative Use: An Evaluation of the Public Internet Monitor Project Accessibility is a central issue in the achievement of democracy, i. e. with respect to the opportunity for and right to 'access' to new technology and information – an argument also used when justifying the Public Internet Monitor Project. 'Access' in this context refers not only to purely physical access to new technology and information, it is also about the opportunity to take part in community business on several different levels. The present sub-report presents the project and its background. The paper also discusses the way in which the Public Internet Monitor Project as a whole has contributed to the development of a social interface or contact surface between citizens and public authorities, as well as how it has stimulated processes of change within public administration and in contacts between public authorities and citizens. Among the questions raised during the evaluation are; how local networks and activities can be stimulated by the citizen monitor and how the user's ideas and experience can be utilised in local adaptations so that they become an essential part of a continuous development of services and technology. The paper also describes the linked chains of responsibility exemplified in the excerpts from the interviews. These also include final users as a means of creating a personalised service adapted to local praxis and user environments. The question is posed "is it possible to talk in terms of interactivity on several different levels, not only in the sense of transmitting information or communicating, but also as a means of creating a relation-based interactivity?" Paper II Reconfiguration of Citizenship: Rights and Duties in Development of Public Services This paper presents the case of the cleaner in the library and some examples of feedback failures. Access to information, technology, and to some degree, participation in development of new services, is a central issue in the prevailing eGovernment discourse. This vision also comprises the idea of the active, contributing citizen and considers the development of local public participation as a process of co-construction of citizenship and services engaging several actors on different levels. At the same time, access must be seen as a contemporaneous process of inclusion and exclusion, a defining and drawing up of the boundaries of a new electronically mediated membership, where access is becoming a prerequisite for activating citizenship, transforming "the right to have access" into a "duty to participate", not just for citizens but for the employees who must manage the reconfiguration of citizenship and relations. The foundations for participation, however, turn out to be relatively restricted in practice. The original title of the paper was: Co-Construction of Citizenship: Rights and duties in development of public services. Paper III Consulting the Citizens – Relationship-based Interaction in the Development of E-Government This paper investigates current practices for involving citizens in the development of web-based services in public administration and tries to track their motives. With respect to democratisation, I argue that there is a large potential in adopting participatory design methods for establishing relation-based interaction between administration and citizens. The paper presents an analysis of E-Government initiatives. More particularly it explores the discourse of the materials surrounding these initiatives, particularly with respect to value systems derived from the marketing perspective contra democratic values. It demonstrates that conventional images of democracy have only a background role to play in such efforts. Paper IV Mapping Out and Constructing Needs in the Development of Online Public Services This paper is based on a study concerning experiences of, access to and requests for public services on-line, within the RISI+ Project. The paper presents a pilot study of the setting up of public services in the local context of the county of Blekinge, in southeast Sweden. The study was conducted as a peer evaluation of a selection of methods, or types of needs analysis, used by different actors and producers of public services in order to gain a picture of various needs among users. One part of this study focuses on the views expressed by service providers about the dialogue between themselves and citizens on the provision of public services. This is compared with the practical use or, in some cases, lack of use, of explicit techniques, such as questionnaires, larger surveys and work carried out with the help of focus groups. A basic question is, 'what role does citizen involvement play in the analysis of needs and services and in the choice of design?'. Parts of this report were presented in a poster display at the NordiCHI 2000 conference, "Design versus design" in Stockholm in October 2000 and, in a different version, as a work-in-progress report at the PDC 2000 (Participatory Design) Conference "Bringing in more voices", in New York in November. Paper V Making E-Government Happen : Everyday Co-Development of Services, Citizenship and Technology This paper describes the use of a metaphorical figure used in different contexts as part of a discussion of working relationships of the co-development of services, citizenship and technology change. The paper discusses the challenge of developing a supportive infrastructure for the ongoing local adaptation and development of public services as citizens use them. Developing supportive structures for co-operation in the design task involves incorporating ways of including the general public, mapping out networks, developing tailorable software and cultivating shop-floor management. If continuous joint co-development of services is made a central part of the co-development of services, citizenship and technology, this also blurs the boundaries between governmental and municipal authorities, private sector employees and other actors within, for example, the voluntary sector - but above all, continuous joint co-development blurs the boundary between citizens and local authorities. The citizens become key figures in the 'web of connections' that makes up the design, content and use of new technologies. In the discourse on participation in E-Government, few reflections are made concerning the basic issue of the democratic values that could be gained by early involvement of local employees and citizens in developmental work or technology-based changes. Making more deliberate use of participatory design methods for incorporating multi-perspectives in service design as well as technology production and use could be a way to stimulate a broader, more inclusive and sustainable participation in local development of E-Government. Paper VI Discourses and Cracks - A Case Study of Information Technology and Writing Women in a Regional Context This is the first of the papers I wrote, where empirical material from a local IT project is discussed and mirrored against the dominating discourses of information technology. Paper VI discusses information technology as a political and practical discourse, which is in part shaped by the repetition of an exalted rhetoric. This repetitive discursive model can be distinguished in global, regional and local contexts and reflects an optimistic belief in technology as an independent power that automatically furthers democratic development. The second part of the paper presents empirical material and experiences from the Women Writing on the Net-project (this was included in the framework of the DIALOGUE project, which was partially funded by ISPO/EC). The aim of the project was to create a virtual space for women on the Internet, and to explore the writing process in terms of aims, tool and method. The method of approach incorporates reflections and discussions about empowerment, democracy and representation of women. This contributed to a more complex understanding of the values of the predominant IT discourses, and revealed the "cracks" in, and possibilities of feminist redefinitions of, these values. Denna licenciat avhandling diskuterar bland annat regnbågars och dimbågars relevans som metaforer för tillgång till teknik. Vidare presenteras utvärderingar och studier samt reflektioner kring politik, utveckling av e-government och e-demokrati, även benämnd 24 -timmarsmyndigheten. Dessa studier av olika praktiker och diskurser relateras till design och utveckling av elektroniska tjänster på lokal, regional och nationell nivå. Syftet bakom den pågående omvandlingsprocessen är en vilja att modernisera och effektivisera offentlig administration. Denna förändring och modernisering av offentlig service är avsedd att få tills tånd förändring inom såväl offentlig administration som vad gäller utformning och erbjudande av offentliga tjänster, och att stimulera verksamhetsutveckling. Tjänster erbjuds elektroniskt och tillskapas utifrån ett medborgarperspektiv (citizen-centered-approach). I en sådan omfattande omvandlingsprocess spelar kommunikationen mellan medborgaren och offentliga myndigheter en väsentlig roll. Teman som ansvarstagande (accountability), tillgänglighet(accessibility) och deltagande (participation), utgör aktiva delar av denna omstrukturering som får effekter för utvecklingen av publika tjänster, verksamheter och utövandet av medborgarskap. Samtidigt gestaltas och omskapas också själva förändringsprocessen utifrån vad som faktiskt sker i olika praktiker. I sammanlagt sex paper diskuteras, med olika utgångspunkt, hur denna omstrukturering tar sig uttryck. Teori- och metodram är hämtade från flera discipliner och tillämpade forskningsområden, några exempel är feministiska teorier, deltagande (participatory, även collaborative) design, samt community informatics med syfte att skapa en holistisk, mångfacetterad förståelse och ge utrymme för den komplexitet som den pågående utvecklingen inom e-government och e-demokrati omfattar...|$|E
50|$|In certain circumstances, one {{or several}} narrow, faintly {{coloured}} bands {{can be seen}} bordering the violet edge of a rainbow; i.e., inside the primary bow or, much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon {{is also known as}} a stacker rainbow. The supernumerary bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern. The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours. Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in <b>fogbows.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceBased on full-sky imaging polarimetric measurements, in {{this chapter}} we {{demonstrate}} that the celestial distribution of the angle of polarization (or E-vector direction) of skylight is a very robust pattern being qualitatively always the same under all possible sky conditions. Practically the only qualitative difference among clear, partly cloudy, overcast, foggy, smoky and tree-canopied skies occurs {{in the degree of}} linear polarization d: The higher the optical thickness of the non-clear atmosphere, the lower the d of skylight. We review here how well the Rayleigh model describes the E-vector pattern of clear and cloudy skies. We deal with the polarization patterns of foggy, partly cloudy, overcast, twilight, smoky and total-solar-eclipsed skies. We describe the possible influences of the changed polarization pattern of smoky and eclipsed skies on insect orientation. We consider the polarization of ‘water-skies’ above Arctic open waters and the polarization characteristics of <b>fogbows.</b> Finally, we deal with the change of skylight polarization due to the transmission through Snell’s window of the flat water surface...|$|R

Several lake-releated classes are being created to support the AquaDiva project and foundational semantics for extending atmospheric semantics have been developed. The continuation of work with CESAB and the generation of this synthesis centre's subset In addition, more upper-level classes from BFO have been imported to begin the restructuring of ENVO's branches for improved axiomatisation, interoperation with other OBO resources, and clarity. Users should prepare for the environmental feature branch to be markedly restructured (most individual PURLs will not be affected, only their positioning and axioms). :warning: Dead Simple Design Patterns were used to generate classes not mentioned in this note.
