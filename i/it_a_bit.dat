5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> confounding.|$|E
25|$|The {{extremely}} bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome in Mexico saw {{a number}} of incidents during practice, including Senna crashing at the very fast Peraltada while trying to take <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> faster than usual and his car overturned when it hit the tire barrier. Senna had come to Mexico City with a head injury that he got while jetskiing in Brazil, and had {{been critical of the}} dusty circuit's condition all through the weekend. Williams took 1–2 in qualifying with Patrese ahead of Mansell, Senna, Alesi, Berger and Piquet. Patrese made a poor start and lost three places while Alesi dived ahead of Senna. The order was: Mansell, Alesi, Senna, Patrese, Berger and Piquet. There was action as Senna passed Alesi with Patrese following him through and then Modena getting by Piquet.|$|E

The album was {{followed}} only {{five months later}} by an eight-track EP German Engines launched at The Toff in Town. Andrew Cox announced on stage: [...] "Japanese Engines {{was kind of the}} poppier record.

500|$|However, Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{rated the}} episode 40 out of 100, {{describing}} it as [...] "classic bad Big Bang Theory". Pierson said [...] "a story like this makes <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> harder {{to believe in}} Sheldon" [...] and suggested that Sheldon should [...] "take something from this experience". Pierson also disliked the girls' subplot as it did not [...] "go anywhere" [...] and described the guys as [...] "cowards".|$|E
500|$|... "Katie and Emily" [...] {{featured}} numerous cameo appearances by the series' {{crew members}} and the winners of various Skins-related competitions. While filming one of the episode's fight scenes, according to Kathryn Prescott, the actors [...] "did <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too properly", with injuries sustained to both Megan Prescott and Giles Thomas. The episode drew just under one million viewers on its first broadcast and was E4's highest-rated programme of the week. It was received generally well by critics.|$|E

White noted that, [...] "Jim did bumble <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{in the face of}} Cathy taking insincere offense at his accusation, but the outcome wasn't hard to predict. Of course Jim would stay true to his real soulmate." [...] Sepinwall noted Dwight's cartoonish behavior in the episode, although he called it a good addition to the Jim-Cathy story-line. [...] McNutt wrote that due to the [...] "choppy storytelling", the Jim-Cathy storyline was not able to feel awkward enough to [...] "feel Jim's struggle".|$|E
500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the track}} {{was a major}} hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of [...] "Lola", saying, [...] "In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, {{it made me feel}} a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a {{different}} sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder".

500|$|In May 2012, Malcolm Young {{confirmed}} that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, so I think we need a couple of years to recuperate and work on <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} pilot filmed was darker in tone {{than the}} one aired. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN [...] "credit" [...] as they only wanted <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate as to whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. In the aired version of the pilot, Lilly Kane was found by the pool {{in the same spot}} where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going {{to be found in the}} ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was [...] "too dark and creepy" [...] for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Backwell {{described}} {{the filming of}} the ball as her [...] "most favourite, most mental day of filming". At {{the end of the}} final take of Pandora's dancing with Doug, the students' head of year, the entire crew danced into shot. Director Charles Martin was initially dubious of whether Megan and Kathryn Prescott would be able to film Katie and Emily's fight well enough, but Kathryn said that on their first rehearsal they [...] "did <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too properly", ripping out parts of Megan's hair extensions. Emily's accidental punching of Doug during the fight was choreographed so that when Kathryn Prescott punched the air in front of Giles Thomas's face, the camera angle would make it appear that she was actually hitting him. While they were filming, however, Prescott genuinely punched Thomas by accident, causing him to stumble back and step on Megan Prescott's bare foot, which she injured.|$|E

500|$|Countdown to Extinction {{received}} generally {{positive reaction}} from critics. Spin {{wrote that the}} album [...] "may just be the finest thrash metal album ever made, although purists may find <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too polished and easy to swallow". AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey said that [...] "Megadeth guns for arena thrash success and gets it on Countdown to Extinction". However, Huey noted the simplification of Megadeth's sound on the album in response to Metallica's commercially successful self-titled album released the previous year. Sputnikmusic reviewer Mike Stagno praised Mustaine's vocals {{as well as a}} number of the album's tracks. Despite calling this effort [...] "Megadeth's first step into the world of mainstream music", he also noted that [...] "the band still maintains its identity". Reflex described the sound as [...] "impressively clean, streamlined, and sharp, brimming with killing riffs". They highlighted the vocal delivery on the record, saying [...] "Mustaine's never sounded more confident, verbally and vocally".|$|E
500|$|The {{read-through}} for {{the episode}} {{took place in}} September 2009. Though {{it is the first}} episode of the series, [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] was not the first to be shot. It was filmed in the third production block, after the completion of episodes 2-5. As Smith was aware of how his Doctor would act in the following episodes, he used this one to establish the character. The plan was to retain traces of Smith's predecessor, but the executive producers wanted Smith to be [...] "stranger". The episode was directed by Adam Smith, who was attracted to the [...] "brilliant script" [...] and working with Matt Smith after seeing him on stage. Smith was asked to direct [...] "the same but make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> different– the producers didn't want it to be radically different, but they did want it to be different". The goal was to make it more [...] "cinematic" [...] and magical, and Smith took inspiration from E.T. and Tim Burton's work.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've {{gotten to the point where}} I understand the raw stuff is usually better." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot in May 2014 at The Underground Club in London and {{directed}} by Colin Tilley. It premiered on 9 June 2014.

'Cos the songs quite up, and pop, it's got that feel, so I wanted it to have the urban twist. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more of that urban vibe." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Beat of My Heart" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that Duff sounds {{like she is}} bored and [...] "going through the motions" [...] on the song. She further stated that Duff has [...] "lost her sauciness and ironically, her spunk" [...] in the song. Avoledo concluded her review by calling [...] "the bland electro pop" [...] song an [...] "insult to the genre. It's like spilling ramen on a Vivenne Westwood evening gown." [...] A reviewer from CBBC Newsround commented that the song is so repetitive that you will feel like [...] "you've listened to it 20 times after just one play". The reviewer praised the heartbeat present on the track, writing that it [...] "make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a foot-tapper", but deemed the lyrics to be [...] "meaningless". The reviewer concluded that: [...] "You'll find yourself humming it but will be hard pushed to remember what on earth she was singing about!" [...] Spence D. of IGN wrote that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] does not try for subtlety as it utilizes the [...] "much overused heartbeat" [...] for the [...] "foundation rhythm" [...] of the song.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, {{the episode}} was, for Owen, [...] "a writing masterclass", created with {{considerable}} skill, {{and with a}} plot that held together even when scrutinised. Mellor, similarly, praised the intelligence of the plot, provided one takes [...] "on faith the unlikely notion that {{a mother and her}} new husband would have no contact with her children from a previous marriage, not even recognising them as adults". [...] "From the lightning flashes that punctuate hints and story shifts to the wordplay and in-jokes peppered through the script", Mellor said, the episode is highly precise. The ending was described on the British Comedy Guide as perhaps the best of any Inside No. 9 episode in the first three series, while Butler called it one of Inside No. 9 darkest and most bizarre. Some, he suggested, [...] "may have found <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too unpalatable", though he added that the plot and ironic humour suggested that viewers can [...] "can perhaps avoid taking it too seriously". Morales received particular praise for his attention to detail and foreshadowing of future events in the episode, with Mellor explaining that he and the writers ...|$|E
500|$|While on hiatus {{between the}} release of his first EP Versus and Looking 4 Myself, Usher told AOL Music that he mainly {{traveled}} to various locations {{to listen to music}} which he [...] "felt was really significant in terms of energy." [...] Some of these locations included the Coachella Music Festival, Ibiza, Germany, Las Vegas, Miami and Southern France. He described some of the music as a [...] "little bit more electronic, some of it a little bit more dance. Some of <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more world." [...] It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album's title track, with producer Rico Love, which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn't work with or admired, such as Diplo. Usher's intention for the album was one [...] "that was not genre-specific but just experimental". During an episode of NBC's The Voice, Usher called the album [...] "by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself". Looking 4 Myself was chosen as the album's title as it described Usher's 'musical journey'.|$|E
