50|$|One example {{involves}} spillovers {{from the}} labor market to the goods market. If there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply, then the amount {{that they are able}} to supply will influence their demand for goods; the demand <b>for</b> <b>goods,</b> contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied, is their effective demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b> In contrast, if there were no labor market disequilibrium, individuals would simultaneously choose both their quantity of labor to supply and the quantity of goods to purchase, and the latter would be their notional demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b> In this example, the effective demand <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> would be less than the notional demand <b>for</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The tâtonnement {{process is}} a model for {{investigating}} stability of equilibria. Prices are announced (perhaps by an [...] "auctioneer"), and agents state how much of each good {{they would like to}} offer (supply) or purchase (demand). No transactions and no production take place at disequilibrium prices. Instead, prices are lowered <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> with positive prices and excess supply. Prices are raised <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> with excess demand. The question for the mathematician is under what conditions such a process will terminate in equilibrium where demand equates to supply <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> with positive prices and demand does not exceed supply <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> with a price of zero. Walras was not able to provide a definitive answer to this question (see Unresolved Problems in General Equilibrium below).|$|R

5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required <b>for</b> <b>good</b> health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E

BLS prices likewise increase more quickly <b>for</b> <b>goods</b> with steeper quality Engel curves, suggesting the BLS does not fully net out the impact of quality upgrading.

5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement <b>for</b> <b>good</b> health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622.
