40|$|On a farrow-to-finish pig farm, Salmonella {{prevalence}} was monitored {{depending on}} time and site aiming to overview of a complete fattening period. Sampling was conducted from November 2009 to April 2010 at intervals of 14 days and included stables, the environment, farm equipment {{as well as the}} staff in charge of the animals. During {{the second part of the}} sampling period, Nll. jejunales from six shipments of finisher pigs were investigated. Using the records, the animals were associated to the <b>fattening</b> <b>units.</b> Suspicious subcultures were isolated and serotyped. In the end, prevalence profiles along pre-fattening and finishing period as well as carcasses from three <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> were available. The Salmonella prevalence varied between 5. 3 % and 21. 2 %, with an average of 10. 0 %. Only the monophasic variants of Salmonella Typhimurium with the antigenic structure 4, 5, 12 :i:- and 4, 12 :i:- as well as the biphasic variants of Salmonella Typhimurium with the antigenic structure 4, 5, 12 :i: 1, 2 and 4, 12 :i: 1, 2 were found. While the monophasic variances were obtained along the entire sampling period, the biphasic variants emerged in the second half of the sampling period, with different percentage at every sampling occasion. 4. 0 % of the samples taken from the environment were Salmonella positiv. Within the sow area no sample was Salmonella positiv during the entire sampling period. 1. 7 % of the samples taken in the farrowing area contained Salmonella, the highest proportion of positive samples was found in samples from the pre-fattening area (29. 7 %). In the fattening area, a prevalence of 15. 8 % was obtained. Samples taken from the farm staff were Salmonella negativ. Of the six shipments sent to slaughter, 5. 9 % to 43. 8 % of the lymph nodes were Salmonella positive, on average, 26. 3 % were positive. Parallel with the other samples, the serotypes were different. A broad spectrum of variants was found in the three units which were monitored during prefattening and fattening. Lymph node examinations of two <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> revealed a variant of Salmonella Typhimurium which had not been found in those units previously. A general prevalence of Salmonella on this farm was obtained. When compared to the prefattening period, lymph node examinations revealed a large percentage of fattening pigs as Salmonella carriers. There is a constant risk of a Salmonella reentry. Therefore, every regrouping poses a risk of potential transfer. In conclusion: ● A low sampling frequency and a few number of samples taken, may lead to a false estimation of Salmonella prevalence. ● Microbiological investigations of randomly collected samples at one sampling occasion or of samples taken from single <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> do not allow a general conclusion concerning the Salmonella load of all fattening pigs...|$|R

Load variation in the engine-generator set was evaluated in the SMCP (system of protection and synchronism). There was an increase in the emission of nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and exhaust gas temperature, in both cases.

50|$|Routine {{anthelmintic}} treatments, {{commonly used}} in intensive pig rearing systems, are not systematic and treatment schemes vary according to farm and animal category. The breeding stock is usually treated with 3-4 month intervals or prior to farrowing. (Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Piglets are typically treated upon entering the <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> and maybe once more halfway the fattening period. However, these treatment schemes seem to be unable to significantly decrease the infection intensity on a farm. Treatment frequency {{must be based on}} the prepatent period of the worm species. For Ascaris this is 42 days. However, when anthelmintic treatment is ineffective i/n killing the migrating larval stages, it is possible that egg shedding occurs earlier as larvae remain in the lung up to 10 days post infection (Roepstorff et al., 1997). Treatment of pigs every 5 weeks would therefore eliminate the worms before they are able to produce millions of eggs and contaminate the environment all over again. When a strict deworming process is applied, the infectivity of the environment will drop, as new hosts will take up eggs from the environment, and eggs will be swept away by cleaning actions or eventually lose their viability. This will ultimately result in a stock of pigs with a reduced or absent parasitic burden. It is important to understand that persistence in the repeated application of the anthelmintic is necessary. If the environmental contamination is high, it will most likely take several fattening rounds to eventually reduce the infection pressure (Bakker, 1984; Jourquin, 2007).Both the fact that infections usually seem to occur in the <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> and the fact that anthelmintic treatment has limited persistent activity against recurring infectious larvae lead to believe that the common practice of treating pigs prior to, or upon arrival in the <b>fattening</b> <b>units,</b> might be superfluous. In two experiments, {{it has been reported that}} a single anthelmintic treatment of fatteners at the start of the fattening period is not justified on economie grounds. It showed to be ineffective in reducing parasite prevalence and it did not have a positive effect on performance results, nor did it influence the incidence of other lesions like white spots (Boes et al., 2010; Nilsson, 1982; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990). More importantly, Roepstorff (1997) showed that, depending on the infection status, it might sometimes be more economically beneficial to switch from a routine anthelmintic treatment program to the conditional usage of anthelmintics, treating only when parasite levels reach an unacceptable level. This should however be supported by routine diagnostic screening of pigs from different age categories and is probably only applicable to farms with moderate to highly intensive management.|$|R

40|$|Relevance of a Salmonella {{serological}} {{detection technique}} was studied from complete results obtained from 9 pigs <b>fattening</b> <b>units.</b> Feces and overshoes were sampled at different periods after starting fattening (2, 3 and 4 months) while caecal contents were {{taken on the}} slaughter line. The bacteriological technique used {{was based on a}} Diasalm enrichment and a commercial test was used for serology on an average of ten animals per batch. The aim of this work was to establish a correlation between serological results obtained at slaughter (10 samples/batch) and bacteriological results. In this context, two types of logistic regression models were tested by considering alternatively serology and Salmonella detection in caecal contents as the dependent variables. Firstly, beside the fact that all logistic regression models show weak correlations, the first finding was that positive results in overshoes taken at 2 and 3 months are slightly correlated with serological status of herds (odds-ratios of 4. 96 and 2. 55). Secondly, when batches were characterized as positive on the basis of serological results, the probability of Salmonella recovery in caecal contents was higher than when the batches were considered as negative (odds-ratios comprised between 4. 36 and 5. 81). A major conclusion is that serology can be used to follow the improvement of an integrated pig production system, but is not the unique solution for assessing risk of Salmonella shedding from specific herds.

Piglets were first fed in the farrowing pen with organic feed for piglets (period 0). The diet was changed to another organic diet when pig-lets were moved to the <b>fattening</b> <b>unit</b> (2 piglets/pen) (period 1). Diets were switched to starch based diets for the determination of the SID of amino acids. There were two dietary treatments: 1) low-protein diet to determine the basal endogenous losses of amino acids, 2) diet in which only protein source was mussel meal, 30...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} two or three decades, there has been an {{increasing}} cattle fattening practices around large cities in the Sudan. A survey was carried, by using well designed questionnaire, to study cattle fattening units around Sinnar city (Sudan). The objective of this study is a survey of these units and study activities practice in this unit. The study was conducted from April to June 2008. During this period the temperture ranged between 38 - 43 C. Twenty - five fattening units were studied. The number of cattle in each unit ranged between 15 and 150 heads. The total numbers of animals in these units was 1773. 68 % of these cattle were of the Western Baggara type, 24 % were of Fulani type, and the rest (8 %) were Kenana breed. When brought to the <b>fattening</b> <b>unit,</b> the weight of the steers ranged between 200 and 300 kg and finished at 300 - 420 kg in two to four months. Feeds used in fattening were Sorghum grain, groundnut seed cake, wheat bran, sorghum stover and molasses. Most of animals were kept in the open without any housing system. Water was provided from the main canal of the Gezira shewee and (Haffeer). Cattle fattening around Sinnar city is progressing and seem profitable...|$|E
50|$|Presumably, A. suum {{infections are}} present in pig farms all over the world. However, few {{countries}} have up-to-date information on its prevalence. In a Swedish study {{it appeared that the}} pens of sows and fatteners are the heaviest infected environments. This was shown by the presence of eggs in old faecal deposits collected from the pens. These findings were supported by studies from China and Denmark where the highest prevalence of A. suum was also found in breeding sows and fatteners. The prevalence in breeding boars is usually lower than in sows or fatteners. Nevertheless, infected boars could also be an important source of transmission of parasite eggs on the farm since they are often located in more traditional pens than the sows (e.g. with solid floor and/or bedding). Moreover, boars are regularly used for contact stimulation of the sows, which allows them to spread the infection by defecating in areas other than their own pen.Strong evidence exists that under indoor conditions, massive infection of piglets with A. suum usually occurs shortly after arrival in the highly infectious <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> and not in the farrowing pens. Several studies have shown that A. suum egg excretion was nearly absent in weaners despite the, sometimes substantial, presence of eggs in the farrowing pens of intensive herds. Here, the increased hygienic standards in combination with the low humidity in the farrowing pens may significantly reduce the presence of favourable microenvironments for egg survival. On the other hand, in piglets raised under outdoor conditions, significant transmission is thought to occur soon after birth and pigs are infected before fattening.|$|R
40|$|In France, {{the young}} bulls sector {{has a very}} complex {{organization}} where beef calves areraised by a cow-calf producer and then sold to a fattener through numerous middle men. Thisorganization is in favour of an increased incidence of respiratory diseases in fattening units,and thus increased use of antibiotics. No study allows a holistic understanding of the young bulls' value chain, in France or in othercountries. This {{would lead to a}} better apprehension of the influence of stakeholders to controlbovine respiratory diseases (BRD) and of the possible lever to improve the existing situation. In this research, we aimed at (i) describing the functioning of the French young bulls value chain and the different roles of stakeholders and institutions, (ii) understanding how the present organization influences the risk to develop BRD in <b>fattening</b> <b>units,</b> (iii) observing the existing strategies of stakeholders to control the risk of BRD and discussing some possible alternative methods. We collected information from cow-calf producers, middle men, and fatteners relying on qualitative semi-structured interviews and on observations on field conducted in major beef cattle regions in France. The main findings first confirmed the expected complexity of different existing commercial paths in the value chain and the role of this vertical organization in increasing risks factors for BRD. Second, there was a preventive and quasi systematic use of antibiotics which sharply reduced (i) the potential effects of technical and sanitary interdependency between the cowcalf producer and the fattener, (ii) the risk to develop BRD, when there were an increased number of middle men before fattening. Finally, main opportunities to improve sanitary health status of animals would be to (i) reduce the number of intermediaries and (ii) the number of farms of origin in weanling batches, (iii) increase the use of vaccination by cowcalf producers...|$|R
40|$|Young bulls {{and beef}} heifers {{are the main}} cattle {{categories}} of the Italian production of beef meat, accounting for over 70 % of domestic cattle meat supply. The majority of this production is achieved in intensive farms located in the Po Valley, specialized in fattening of young animals imported from other European countries (mainly France). Animals are reared in pens and fed total mixed rations based on maize silage and concentrates. Although beef production in north Italy {{can be considered as}} distinguishing within European beef production scenario, benchmarks concerning performance and feeding traits are still scarcely known. On the basis of results from a survey on <b>fattening</b> <b>units</b> located in Veneto region (north east Italy), this study aimed to provide reference values on main productive characteristics of intensive young bulls production system of north Italy. Data were collected in 17 herds and included information on growth performance and diets characteristics such as ingredients and chemical composition. The reference unit of the survey was a farm batch, intended as a group of young bulls homogeneous for genotype, fattening period and diets. The final database included 237 batches with an average size of 67 young bulls. Productive data and diet composition were analyzed using ANOVA with farm and breed as fixed effects. Average weight at starting and finishing fattening period was 370 and 669 kg, respectively, average length of fattening period was 232 d and average daily gain was 1. 31 kg/d. Diets were based on a common base of maize silage and soybean meal; CP, starch and NDF of the diets averaged 14. 3 %, 32. 7 % and 32. 5 %, respectively. Farm and genotype effects were significant sources of variation for productive and feeding traits. The future perspective is to approach the environmental sustainability of this production system by developing indicators able to consider the interaction between land use and carbon footprints of ‘north Italy’ beef meat...|$|R
