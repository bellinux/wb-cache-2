5000|$|Keeping {{connection}} to online devices: Profile servers maintain an open TCP/IP connection with end users' devices {{while they are}} connected to the Internet, thus know when people behind the hosted profiles are online. This is the first step to acquiring a direct <b>device-to-device</b> connection.|$|E
50|$|In 2017 Fermat {{launched}} an alpha testing {{version of the}} Profile Server, {{a key component of}} the Internet of People that enables users to discover other user's profiles and establish a <b>device-to-device</b> connection, along with the Location Based Network (responsible for Geo-localized services) and Content Address Network.|$|E

50|$|Client apps upload end users' {{profiles}} to the IoP {{and keep}} an active TCP/IP connection with the profile server hosting their profiles. End users can then search the Internet of People both for people they know and people they do not know, and use that open connection on every profile to acquire a <b>device-to-device</b> connection.|$|E
50|$|The UPnP {{architecture}} allows <b>device-to-device</b> networking {{of consumer}} electronics, mobile devices, personal computers, and networked home appliances. It is a distributed, open architecture protocol based on established standards {{such as the}} Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), HTTP, XML, and SOAP. UPnP control points (CPs) are devices which use UPnP protocols to control UPnP controlled devices (CDs).|$|E
50|$|Profile servers run {{on top of}} two {{different}} decentralized peer-to-peer networks: one used as a content delivery network, and the second one as a Geo-localized network. IoP connected client apps can use the IoP as a decentralized discovery layer and for the signaling process that ends in a <b>device-to-device</b> connection. Once connected, IoP apps can interact directly between each other without unnecessary middlemen.|$|E
50|$|The open {{social graph}} resembles a global map {{of people with}} {{embedded}} proof of how people are related.

5000|$|IoTivity is an OSS {{framework}} enabling seamless <b>device-to-device</b> connectivity {{to aid the}} Internet of Things as it grows. While Allseen Alliance and Open Connectivity Foundation merged in October 2016, the IoT {{projects of}} each (AllJoyn and IoTivity, respectively) will continue operating under The Linux Foundation. The two projects will [...] "collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification with a single IoTivity implementation." ...|$|E
50|$|Fermat {{leads the}} {{development}} of the Internet of People (IoP), a technology infrastructure consisting of interconnected peer-to-peer networks hosting people’s profiles, reputation and identity information. The Internet of People allows the discovery of both known and unknown people and, ultimately, enables direct <b>device-to-device</b> communication over the Internet and direct person-to-person interactions via person-to-person applications. The Internet of People incorporates blockchain-based native tokens, IoPs, as incentive for operators running IoP software.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} support {{the same sort of}} <b>device-to-device</b> connection, USB {{requires}} additional support in dual-role devices to emulate a host and provide similar functionality. This was only standardized years later as part of USB On-The-Go system. Another advantage of A.b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy-chain - A.b can support, but does not require, the use of hubs. This can reduce cable-clutter significantly.|$|E
50|$|STUN servers {{are used}} to {{establish}} a <b>device-to-device</b> connection while both devices are behind firewalls, that is, with no public Internet addresses and filtered Internet traffic. In certain cases, STUN servers fail to work around the firewalls. In such cases a specialized server is used to relay the information between devices: TURN servers. Unlike traditional use of STUN and TURN servers, the IoP implementation deploys them over decentralized peer-to-peer networks.|$|E
5000|$|Profile server: It hosts user {{profiles}} {{and allows}} users to find other users and establish relationships between each other. It also allows applications to determine which application services client devices are running, and agree how to proceed to establish a direct <b>device-to-device</b> connection to exchange information. The profile server runs {{on top of the}} IoP Location Based Network and also on top of the IoP Content Address Network—at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Multiple-hop networks: A {{major issue}} in systems beyond 4G {{is to make the}} high bit rates {{available}} in a larger portion of the cell, especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations. In current research, this issue is addressed by cellular repeaters and macro-diversity techniques, also known as group cooperative relay, where users also could be potential cooperative nodes, thanks to the use of direct <b>device-to-device</b> (D2D) communication.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian National Research Council {{attaches}} a [...] "relative uncertainty" [...] of 2.5 (limited by day-to-day and <b>device-to-device</b> reproducibility) {{to their}} atomic clock {{based upon the}} 127I2 molecule, and is advocating use of an 88Sr ion trap instead (relative uncertainty due to linewidth of 2.2). See magneto-optical trap and [...] Such uncertainties rival that of the NIST-F1 caesium atomic clock in the microwave region, estimated as a few parts in 1016 averaged over a day.|$|E
50|$|DASH7 {{wireless}} sensor networking {{technology is}} {{operating in the}} license-free sub GHz spectrum. Primarily relying on 433 MHz, the protocol now mostly addresses 868/915 MHz frequencies to reduce antenna size and increase throughput. DASH7 has multi-kilometer range, multi-year battery life, sensor and security support, direct <b>device-to-device</b> communications. The bitrate ranges from 9.6kbit/s up to 167kbit/s, with a latency under 15 ms to deliver a packet (including LBT). DASH7 devices operate on a single global frequency and are interoperable regardless of application and by design do not require cumbersome application profiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{network of}} community-contributed relay servers allows devices {{that are both}} behind {{different}} IPv4 NAT firewalls {{to be able to}} communicate by relaying encrypted data via a third party. The relaying performed is similar in nature to the TURN protocol, with the traffic TLS-encrypted end-to-end between devices (thus even the relay server cannot see the data, only the encrypted stream). Private relays can also be set up and configured, with or without public relays, if desired. Syncthing will automatically switch from relaying to direct <b>device-to-device</b> connections if it discovers that a direct connection has become available.|$|E
50|$|ZigBee is {{an example}} of a low power, low {{bandwidth}} wireless ad hoc network, among others.Wi-Fi ad hoc refers to the fact that wireless ad hoc networks can support higher data rates and higher mobility rates of nodes. They are suitablefor mobile computing and for <b>device-to-device</b> communications. Smart phone ad hoc refers to the use of Wi-Fi ad hoc to enable chat messaging among smart phone users without relying on 4G cellular communications. Finally, very high mobility andvery high data rates represent the top end of wireless ad hoc networks, and they are often found in military tactical ad hoc radios used in the battlefield.|$|E
5000|$|VANTAs of SWNTs with {{perfectly}} linear geometries {{are applicable}} as high-performance p- and n-channel transistors and unipolar and complementary logic gates. [...] The excellent {{properties of the}} devices derive directly from a complete absence, to within experimental uncertainties, of any defects in the arrays, as defined by tubes or segments of tubes that are misaligned or have nonlinear shapes. The large number of SWNTs enables excellent device-level performance characteristics and good <b>device-to-device</b> uniformity, even with SWNTs that are electronically heterogeneous. Measurements on p- and n-channel transistors that involve as many as about 2,100 SWNTs reveal device-level mobilities and scaled transconductance approaching about 1,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 and $3,000 S m-1, respectively, and with current outputs of up to about 1 A in devices that use interdigitated electrodes.|$|E
5000|$|The firm {{produces}} {{mobile security}} apps for iOS and Android devices. The free edition is upgradeable to a premium version {{which includes a}} phishing and malicious website blocker, privacy advisor, photo and call history backup, <b>device-to-device</b> data transfer, remote locking and wiping, and support services. The software also includes the ability to remotely snap {{a photograph of the}} phone's environment when lost or stolen, which can help to identify the thief or location of the device. In June 2014 the company released an app that produces real-time theft alerts, including a [...] "theftie"--photograph of the thief taken automatically by the device--when certain actions are taken, such as a mistyped phone code. The software bundle also comes with a utility called [...] "signal flare", which automatically flags the location of a phone once the battery starts to die, so that the device user can later ping its last known location.|$|E
50|$|A new LTE {{protocol}} named LTE Direct {{works as}} an innovative <b>device-to-device</b> technology enabling the discovery of thousands of devices in the proximity of approximately 500 meters. Pioneered by Qualcomm, {{the company has been}} leading the standardization of this new technology along with other 3GPP participants. LTE Direct offers several advantages over existing proximity solutions including but not limited to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. One of the most popular use cases for this technology was developed by a New York City based company called Compass. The core feature of proximal discovery among devices included a targeted discount voucher to a nearby device which matched specific interests. The Compass use case was featured at global conferences and events such as CES 2015, MWC 2015, and said to be extended to many other scenarios including film festivals, theme parks and sporting events. “You can think of LTE Direct as a sixth sense that is always aware of the environment around you,” said Mahesh Makhijani, technical marketing director at Qualcomm, at a session on the technology. Additionally, the protocol offers less battery drainage and extended range when compared to other proximity solutions.|$|E
