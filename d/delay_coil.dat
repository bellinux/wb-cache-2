40|$|We {{separated}} isoenzymes of {{creatine kinase}} by anion-exchange chromatography, {{with use of}} an elution gradient containing lithium acetate (0. 1 to 0. 6 mol/L). A stream splitter was used to divert a 5 % side stream of column effluent, which was subsequently mixed with the reagents necessary for bioluminescence assay of the separated isoenzymes. The use of the stream splitter greatly de-creased the rate of consumption of reagent and, when combined with a peristaltic pumping system, permitted independent control of the side-stream flow rate. Thus both the residence interval in a <b>delay</b> <b>coil</b> in which the AlP reaction product is formed and the bioluminescence re-sponse could be increased.

40|$|An active {{wide-band}} {{fiber optic}} frequency distribution system employing a thermally controlled phase compensator to stabilize phase variations induced by environmental temperature changes is described. The distribution system utilizes bidirectional dual wavelength transmission to provide optical feedback of induced phase variations of 100 MHz signals propagating along the distribution cable. The phase compensation considered differs from earlier narrow-band phase compensation designs {{in that it}} uses a thermally controlled fiber <b>delay</b> <b>coil</b> rather than a VCO or phase modulation to compensate for induced phase variations. Two advantages of the wide-band system over earlier designs are (1) that it provides phase compensation for all transmitted frequencies, and (2) the compensation is applied after the optical interface rather than electronically ahead of it as in earlier schemes.

40|$|We {{describe}} a modified stent-assisted coiling technique, named the semi-deployment technique, in the endovascular treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. Thirty-one consecutive patients with 31 wide-necked or fusiform intracranial aneurysms {{were treated with}} the semi-deployment technique. The technical feasibility of the procedure, procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcome and follow-up angiography were evaluated. In every case, the semi-deployment technique was successfully deployed. Immediate angiography demonstrated complete occlusion in 24 cases (77. 4 %), neck remnant in four cases (12. 9 %), and incomplete occlusion in three cases (9. 7 %). Procedural-related morbidity occurred in one patient (3. 2 %) but no procedural-related mortality. A favorable clinical outcome (Modified Ran-kin Scale score 0 - 2) was observed in 90. 3 % of the patients (average follow-up time, 23. 1 months). No rehemorrhage of treated aneurysms occurred. Angiography follow-up was obtained in 22 cases (71. 0 %). Three aneurysms (13. 6 % of the follow-up angiograms) demonstrated recanalization.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) is a numerical technique {{that is used}} for studying haemodynamic parameters in cerebral aneurysms. As {{it is now possible}} to represent an anatomically accurate intracranial aneurysm in a computational model, we have attempted to simulate its endosaccular occlusion with coils and demonstrate the haemodynamic changes induced. This is the first attempt to use this particular porous medium-based method for coiling simulation in a CFD model, to our knowledge. METHODS: Datasets from a rotational 3 -D digital subtraction angiogram of a recently ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm were converted into a 3 -D geometric model and the discretized data were processed using the computational technique developed. Coiling embolisation simulation was achieved by impediment of flow through a porous medium with characteristics following a series of embolisation coils. Haemodynamic parameters studied were: pressure distribution on the vessel wall, blood velocity and blood flow patterns. RESULTS: Significant haemodynamic changes were detected after deployment of the first coil. Similar, but less dramatic changes occurred during subsequent stages of coiling. The blood flow patterns became less vortical in the aneurysm sac as velocity decreased to stagnation and the wall pressure at the fundus was gradually reduced. Furthermore, the haemodynamic characteristics developed at the area of the neck remnant could form the basis for assessing the likelihood of <b>delayed</b> <b>coil</b> compaction and aneurysm regrowth. CONCLUSION: Appropriate computational techniques show great promise in simulating the haemodynamic behaviour of the various stages in coil embolisation and may be a potentially valuable tool in interventional planning and procedural decision-making...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{forebrain}} stimulation on the pulmonary vascular bed were investigated in the intact-chest cat {{under conditions of}} controlled blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. When pulmonary vascular tone was raised to a high steady level, direct electrical stimulation of the forebrain elicited a biphasic change in lobar arterial pressure. The response was charac-terized by an initial transient increase in lobar arterial pressure {{that was followed by}} a prolonged secondary decrease in pressure. When a <b>delay</b> <b>coil</b> was added to the extracorporeal perfusion circuit, the secondary vasodilator response was separated into initial brief and delayed prolonged components, suggesting that it was mediated in part by the release of a humoral factor. The entire response to forebrain stimulation was abolished by cervical cord section or freezing. The initial constrictor response and early brief dilator response were not blocked by classic pharmacological blocking agents. The delayed Immorally mediated vasodi-lator response was blocked by propranolol or ICI 118551, indicating that it was mediated by a circulating factor with ft-stimulating properties. The delayed vasodilator response was associated with a large increase in arterial epinephrine levels, and this rise in plasma epinephrine was not altered by propranolol. The present data suggest that electrical stimulatio...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{automated}} {{procedure for}} total serum cholesterol, employing a stable Liebermann-Burchard reagent, was tested. The method has good precision, and results agree well with extraction methods for total cholesterol on normal serums. Serum samples with elevated bilirubin levels gave cholesterol values which {{were too high}} and which could not always be corrected for. Lipemic serums in some instances gave results which were too low {{when compared to other}} methods. THEUSE of a stable Liebermann-Burchard reagent for a simple direct determination of serum cholesterol has been described by Huang et a! (1) and also by Ness et at (2). This method has been adapted for the AutoAnalyzer by Levine et a! (3). Besides using only one reagent, the manifold is simple; sampling time is 40 /hr, and total test time is less than 10 mm. The automated method presently in use in our laboratory is a modification of that of Block ci a! (4), which, in turn, is based on the method of Zlatkis eta! (5). Since the method of Levine ci at i 541 (liI’ect method requiring no extraction, its use would have obvious advantages. Preliminary investigation of sampling rates, sample-to-wash ratios, and time of color development with regard to good sample resolution and minimal “carry over ” from sample to sample resulted in the final choice of a 40 /hr sampling rate, 1 : 1 sample-to-wash ratio (Sampler IT), and a modified time <b>delay</b> <b>coil</b> of approximately 12 #{ 189 }ft.

40|$|Background: Large {{and giant}} aneurysms still remain a {{therapeutic}} challenge both surgically and endovascularly. Objective: The authors report their clinical experience and follow-up results using Neuroform stent, {{as an adjunct}} {{in the treatment of}} large and giant aneurysms. Materials and Methods: A total of 71 consecutive patients with 72 large or giant intracranial aneurysms were treated with the Neuroform stent-assisted coiling. Both sequential technique and parallel technique were used. In all cases, embolization was completed by packing the aneurysm sac with a variety of commercially available coils. The technical feasibility of the procedure, procedure-related complications, angiographic results, clinical outcome, and follow-up angiography were evaluated. Results: In all the patients, the Neuroform stent system was delivered and deployed accurately, and occlusion was achieved. Immediate angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the aneurysm in 59. 7 &#x 0025; of the patients, neck remnant in 26. 4 &#x 0025;, and incomplete occlusion in 13. 9 &#x 0025;. Procedure-related complication, morbidity, and mortality were 15. 3, 4. 2, and 1. 4 &#x 0025;, respectively. Favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 - 2) was observed in 83. 3 &#x 0025; of the patients (average follow-up time: 37. 1 months). None of the treated aneurysm had rebleeding.

40|$|International audienceThe {{extracellular}} {{deposition of}} insoluble amyloid fibrils {{resulting from the}} aggregation of the amyloid-beta (A beta) is a pathological feature of neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous small molecules {{have been reported to}} interfere with the process of A beta aggregation. Compounds containing aromatic structures, hydrophobic amino acids and/or the alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) as beta-sheet breaker elements have been reported to be effective inhibitors of A beta aggregation. We synthesized two peptides, one containing the Aib amino acid and the other including its trifluoromethylated analog (R) -alpha-Trifluoromethylalanine ((R) -Tfm-Alanine) and we evaluated the impact of these peptides on A beta amyloid formation. The compounds were tested by standard methods such as thioflavin-T fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy but also by circular dichroism, liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments to further characterize the effect of the two molecules on A beta structure and on the kinetics of depletion of monomeric, soluble A beta. Our results demonstrate that the peptide containing Aib reduces the quantity of aggregates containing beta-sheet structure but slightly inhibits A beta fibril formation, while the molecule including the trifluoromethyl (Tfm) group slows down the kinetics of A beta fibril formation, <b>delays</b> the random <b>coil</b> to beta-sheet structure transition and induces a change in the oligomerization pathway. These results suggest that the hydrophobic Tfm group has a better affinity with A beta than the methyl groups of the Aib and that this Tfm group is effective and important in preventing the A beta aggregation...|$|R
40|$|The soil fungus Trichoderma atroviride, a mycoparasite, {{responds}} {{to a number}} of external stimuli. In the presence of a fungal host, T. atroviride produces hydrolytic enzymes and coils around the host hyphae. In response to light or nutrient depletion, asexual sporulation is induced. In a biomimetic assay, different lectins induce coiling around nylon fibers; coiling in the absence of lectins can be induced by applying cyclic AMP (cAMP) or the heterotrimeric G-protein activator mastoparan. We isolated a T. atroviride G-protein α-subunit (Gα) gene (tga 1) belonging to the fungal subfamily with the highest similarity to the Gαi class. Generated transgenic lines that overexpress Gα show very <b>delayed</b> sporulation and <b>coil</b> at a higher frequency. Furthermore, transgenic lines that express an activated mutant protein with no GTPase activity do not sporulate and coil at a higher frequency. Lines that express an antisense version of the gene are hypersporulating and coil at a much lower frequency in the biomimetic assay. The loss of Tga 1 in these mutants correlates with the loss of GTPase activity stimulated by the peptide toxin Mas- 7. The application of Mas- 7 to growing mycelial colonies raises intracellular cAMP levels, suggesting that Tga 1 can activate adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, cAMP levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity drop when diffusible host signals are encountered and the mycoparasitism-related genes ech 42 and prb 1 are highly expressed. Mycoparasitic signaling is unlikely to be a linear pathway from host signals to increased cAMP levels. Our results demonstrate that the product of the tga 1 gene is involved in both coiling and conidiation...|$|R
6000|$|After breakfast--call it luncheon rather--we {{started for}} the lagoon. [...] We had set our hearts on seeing Manatis ('sea cows'), which are still not {{uncommon}} {{on the east coast}} of this island, though they have been exterminated {{through the rest of the}} West Indies since the days of Pere Labat. That good missionary speaks of them in his delightful journal as already rare in the year 1695; and now, as far as I am aware, none are to be found north of Trinidad and the Spanish Main, save a few round Cuba and Jamaica. We were anxious, too, to see, if not to get, a boa-constrictor of one kind or other. [...] For there are two kinds in the island, which may be seen alive at the Zoological Gardens in the same cage. The true Boa, {277a} which is here called Mahajuel, is striped as well as spotted with two patterns, one over the other. The Huillia, Anaconda, or Water-boa, {277b} bears only a few large round spots. Both are fond of the water, the Huillia living almost entirely in it; both grow to a very large size; and both are dangerous, at least to children and small animals. That there were Huillias about the place, possibly within fifty yards of the house, there was no doubt. One of our party had seen with his own eyes one of seven-and-twenty feet long killed, with a whole kid inside it, only a few miles off. The brown policeman, crossing an arm of the Guanapo only a month or two before, had been frightened by meeting one in the ford, which his excited imagination magnified so much that its head was on the one bank while its tail was on the other--a measurement which must, I think, be divided at least by three. But in the very spot in which we stood, some four years since, happened what might have been a painful tragedy. Four young ladies, whose names were mentioned to me, preferred, not wisely, a bathe in the still lagoon to one in the surf outside; and as they disported themselves, one of them felt herself seized from behind. Fancying that one of her sisters was playing tricks, she called out to her to let her alone; and looking up, saw, to her astonishment, her three sisters sitting on the bank, and herself alone. She looked back, and shrieked for help: and only just in time; for the Huillia had her. The other three girls, to their honour, dashed in to her assistance. The brute had luckily got hold, not of her poor little body, but of her bathing-dress, and held on stupidly. The girls pulled; the bathing-dress, which was, luckily, of thin cotton, was torn off; the Huillia slid back again with it in his mouth into the dark labyrinth of the mangrove-roots; and the girl was saved. Two minutes' <b>delay,</b> and his <b>coils</b> would have been round her; and all would have been over.|$|R
