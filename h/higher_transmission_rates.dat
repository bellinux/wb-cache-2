50|$|Coaxial cables {{have two}} {{different}} layers surrounding a copper core. The inner most layer has an insulator. The next layer has a conducting shield. These are both {{covered by a}} plastic jacket. Coaxial cables are used for microwaves, televisions and computers.This was the second transmission medium to be introduced (often called coax), around the mid-1920s. In {{the center of a}} coaxial cable is a copper wire that acts as a conductor, where the information travels. The copper wire in coax is thicker than that in twisted-pair, and it is also unaffected by surrounding wires that contribute to electromagnetic interference, so it can provide <b>higher</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rates</b> than the twisted-pair. The center conductor is surrounded by plastic insulation, which helps filter out extraneous interference. This insulation is covered by a return path, which is usually braided-copper shielding or aluminum foil type covering. Outer jackets form a protective covering for coax; the number and type of outer jackets depend on the intended use of the cable (e.g., whether the cable is supposed to be strung in the air or underground, whether rodent protection is required). The two most popular types of coaxial cabling are used with Ethernet networks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mobile {{devices in}} the IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} {{local area network}} (WLAN) have the ability to transmit data frames at one of four <b>transmission</b> <b>rates</b> 1 Mb/s, 2 Mb/s, 5. 5 Mb/s and 11 Mb/s. This is because the commercial WLAN transceivers are equipped with several modulation schemes. According to the characteristics of the modulation scheme, a <b>higher</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> will result in a smaller transmission range and longer time consumption on data frame transmission. If the channel environment is relatively clear and the transmission distance is short, one should choose a <b>higher</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> for data <b>transmission</b> to maximise channel utilisation. On the contrary, a lower <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> should be selected to minimise the frame loss and frame error probabilities if the bit error rate is high. Therefore, the problem of choosing a proper <b>transmission</b> <b>rate</b> to accommodate a varying environment is a new and valuable problem in the wireless LANs.
