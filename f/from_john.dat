5|$|After Batista won the WWE Championship <b>from</b> <b>John</b> Cena at Elimination Chamber, Cena {{requested}} a rematch. Mr. McMahon agreed, {{on the condition}} that Cena must defeat Batista in a non-title match that night on Raw.

5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter <b>from</b> <b>John</b> of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters <b>from</b> <b>John</b> dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again peripherally involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen is {{the final}} game in the series, {{released}} on May 30, 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision, it was created as both a sequel and homage to the series as a whole, and {{does not have an}} episode number. Id was not a major partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. The idea for a Game Boy Color Keen game came <b>from</b> <b>John</b> Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent the}} summer of 1825 as an {{apprentice}} doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, {{before going to the}} University of Edinburgh Medical School (at the time the best medical school in the UK) with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. He learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions <b>from</b> <b>John</b> Edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied Charles Waterton in the South American rainforest.|$|E

5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned once more, and although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with a storm of U.S. public protest after publication of a quote <b>from</b> <b>John</b> Lennon's remarks about Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E

5|$|Lancastrian cognatic descent <b>from</b> <b>John</b> of Gaunt and Blanche's {{daughter}} Phillipa {{continued in}} the royal houses of Spain and Portugal. The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately <b>from</b> <b>John</b> of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament {{during the reign of}} Richard II. Henry IV had tried to debar them from the succession by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne but this was of limited effect. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what some might claim a better right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.|$|E
