Nicolas had {{received}} the land as a concession from Olivier Le Tardif and built a wood house with a stone chimney on it. While that wood house, along with an addition built in 1697, was burned by the English in 1759, it is believed the two surviving stone chimneys are those of Maison Laberge. Françoise <b>Gausse</b> was the daughter of Maurice <b>Gausse</b> and Marguerite Blay of Noyon, Picardy, France. In late March 1663, Nicolas Durand had a fatal accident while clearing his fields. His widow and young daughter were left to fend for themselves.|$|E
