40|$|We study a {{continuous}} time {{model of a}} levered firm with fixed assets generating a cash flow that fluctuates with business conditions. Since external finance is costly, the firm holds a liquid (cash) reserve to help survive periods of poor business conditions. Holding liquid assets inside the firm is costly {{as some of the}} return on such assets is dissipated due to agency problems. We solve for the firms optimal <b>dividend,</b> <b>share</b> issuance, and liquid asset holding policies. The firm optimally targets a level of liquid assets which is a non-monotonic function of business conditions. In good times, the firm does not need a high liquidity reserve, but as conditions deteriorate, it will target higher reserve. In very poor conditions, the firm will declare bankruptcy, usually after it has depleted its liquidity reserve. Our model can predict liquidity holdings, leverage ratios, yield spreads, expected default probabilities, expected loss given default and equity volatilities all in line with market experience. We apply the model to examine agency conflicts associated with the liquidity reserve, and some associated debt covenants. We see that a restrictive covenant applied to the liquidity reserve will often enhance the debt value as well as the equity value. contingent claims; corporate finance; dividend policy; liquidity...|$|E

This is because; EPS and DPS {{are one of the}} investments tools to evaluate a company's performance either in the short or long term. The estimated earnings and dividends can be used to measure the financial health and prospect of a company. Therefore, in this research, an investigation and evaluation has been performed to indicate the impact of EPS and DPS on the share prices of selected listed companies in Colombo Stock Exchange. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether there is any relationship between 20 selected listed companies's EPS, DPS and share price for a relatively time period of five years. In addition, a statistical study was conducted, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software to evaluate if there is a significant level of impact on the selected companies' EPS and DPS on their share prices. In this research finding, it can be concluded that there is a positive relationship between EPS and stock prices for all sectors with the exception of Land and Property sector.

40|$|This study tackles the {{relationship}} between dividend policy and market value of companies in the UK through three empirical models. The aim of the first model was to test {{the validity of the}} Irrelevant Theory empirically by exploring {{the relationship}} between dividend type (cash <b>dividend,</b> <b>share</b> dividend and share repurchase), earnings (EPS) and investment policy (retained earnings per share) with the market value of a company. This is achieved through the use of annual and semi-annual data for 362 companies in different UK sectors by adopting Panel Data for the period extending from 1998 to 2007 (twenty periods), where the fixed-effect (within) regression model was used to examine this sample. The second model examines if companies favour the investment policy dividend policy by investigating whether or not companies follow a residual dividends policy. This has been identified by following the methodology of Baker and Smith (2006), based on the calculation of Standardized Free Cash Flow (SFCF) for 590 UK companies in different sectors for the period from 1998 to 2007 by using annual data. The third model seeks to explore managerial preferences regarding dividend type and the most important factors affecting the company management when setting dividends policy. In this respect, the importance of the following factors has been tested: the company’s market value; the financing decision; the investment decision; signaling theory; agency theory; and shareholder structure. The questionnaire methodology used for this model where it was distributed to 1319 UK companies in different sectors. The number of responses was 208 responses is equivalent to 15. 77 % of the total distributed). The study arrived at a number of important results that can be summarized as follows: 1) The invalidity of the Irrelevant Theory, as the results show that there is a relationship between dividend policy and market value of a company; 2) There is a relationship between earnings, investment policy and the market value, which indicates that the dividends policy, announced earnings and investment policy work together in affecting the market value of a company; 3) UK companies, on the whole, do not adopt a residual dividends policy, implying no preference for investment policy over dividend policy, except for the two sectors banking and insurance companies where the results showed that they follow the residuals dividends policy 4) Most UK companies’ managements prefer cash dividends to other venues choices because of its easy implementation; and 5) The most important factor affecting UK companies’ managements when they set their dividends policy is shareholder structure while the least factor listed in importance is agency theory.

40|$|As known, {{the meeting}} between the capital demand and offer takes place in an {{organized}} framework, on the capital market. There, we shall meet the title issuers and also the investors, which, as capital owners, intend to use their available capitals in a very efficient manner. If we refer at shares, these appear in form of negotiable instruments which mediate, in a very specific manner, the {{meeting between the}} reminded capital demand and offer. Therefore, through share issues, the capital users have the possibility to mobilize supplementary capitals, necessary to develop the respective business, which brings profit. In order for this thing to happen, the respective shares must sell. On the other side, for the respective shares to sell, somebody must need them; these are the investors who want to buy such titles for their available capital. When an investor takes into account such a variant of placing capital in shares, something which motivates him must exist. In this case, obviously the main motivation is the gain obtained after the respective capital placement. In such a context, one of the forms of the fain obtained after a capital placement in shares made by investors in such titles is dividend. The more the dividends afferent to its shares is, the higher the degree of attractiveness for the shares. As regards this fact, we must mention that sometimes, in certain years, such as the years of economic crisis, for example the profits earned by the issuing company may be smaller or even inexistent; consequently, obviously, the dividends will be smaller or even inexistent. Such a state of things would have negative effects on the capital market, the prices of the respective shares decreasing, which would also lead {{to the degree of}} the degree of attractiveness for the respective shares. Continuing this idea, it is easy to understand that, if the user of capitals, as share issuer, proceeded to a new share issue in order to mobilize some supplementary capitals, {{it would be difficult to}} evaluate his success. More exactly, it would be difficult to evaluate how fast the respective shares would sell, subsequent to which the issuer could mobilize new capitals, which could be found in the equity capital of the issuing company. This is a very good reason for the issuer of such titles is preoccupied by the fact that the products issued by him, such as the respective shares, to have such a degree of attractiveness which, finally, would lead to reaching the proposed purpose, meaning that the issued shares would sell, subsequent to this sale, the desired capitals would be mobilized. On this plan, one of the possibilities that the issuer has in order to reach his purpose mentioned above is to start to valorize such shares, using an adequate dividend policy. <b>dividend,</b> <b>share</b> policy, capital, demand, offer. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{synthesis}} of the literature on the changing perspectives of corporate distribution policy. Design/methodology/approach – This paper synthesizes and interprets the theoretical, empirical and survey-based research on corporate payout policy. Findings – Dividends once constituted a prominent part of an investor's total return, but this role has declined over time. Although many companies still pay cash <b>dividends,</b> <b>share</b> repurchases have risen dramatically and are now a significant component of payout. Research limitations/implications – New theories and perspectives on corporate distribution are likely to be introduced; while this paper represents an up-to-date view on the topic, it is not possible to anticipate new research developments that may affect some of the perspectives expressed herein. Practical implications – No single explanation fully accounts for the changes in distribution policy, most notably, the declining incidence of dividend-paying firms and the increasing level of repurchase activity. Factors that explain the popularity of share repurchases in the USA include the improved regulatory environment, economic conditions, and the flexibility of repurchases relative to dividends. Developing a comprehensive model that explains the choice between <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchase remains a challenge facing researchers. Originality/value – The paper adds to the body of knowledge by providing an integrated perspective on <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchase, summarizing decades of theoretical, empirical, and survey-based research.

40|$|Firms pay out cash {{using both}} <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases. In many aspects these two means are similar, but one {{important}} {{difference is that}} dividends are generally taxed more heavily than share repurchases. Nevertheless firms persist in paying out large amounts in dividends. This paper provides an explanation for this dividend puzzle by developing a class of signaling models violating the "single-crossing" property in which information {{about the quality of}} the firm is asymmetric between the management and the shareholders. In these models a high-quality firm can always signal its quality by using share repurchases only. However, in certain cases share repurchases become costlier on the margin for a high-quality firm than for a low-quality imitator. In such cases, the high-quality firm signals most cost efficiently by means of a combination of share repurchases and taxable cash dividends financed by the issuance of new <b>shares.</b> Taxable cash <b>dividends</b> financed by the issuance of new shares then can be considered a positive kind of money burning whose role is to signal a firm’s high quality. The implications of the models are consistent with several important empirical facts about <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases. Thus, this paper’s main contribution is to examine a range of new signaling models that provides a role for taxable cash <b>dividends</b> and <b>share</b> repurchases and to derive their empirical implications.

The analysis is similar in spirit to the analysis carried out by Kasa (1992).
