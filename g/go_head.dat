5|$|Super Mario Kart {{also has}} three {{multiplayer}} modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two {{players and the}} second player uses {{the bottom half of}} the screen which is used as a map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.|$|E

However, in September 1966 Rolls-Royce revealed to the world its decision to launch an Advanced Technology Engine (A.T.E) family covering thrusts ranging from 10,000lbst (RB.203) through to 60,000lbst. (RB.207). The A.T.E family introduced new scalable technologies such as the triple shaft architecture, a high pressure annular combustor and a structurally integrated power-plant (nacelle).|$|E
25|$|The {{next two}} Blues games {{would see the}} team <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head with other Premier League teams in trouble {{at the foot of}} the table. Newcastle were first up at St Andrew's, where a James McFadden goal in the first half was {{cancelled}} out by an early goal in the second half by Michael Owen. Then it was a trip to the Madejski Stadium, where Reading were able to capitalise on poor defending from set plays to earn a 2–1 victory, leaving the Blues only a point from 18th placed Bolton. The only highlight of the game was a goal for Mauro Zárate. The last game of the month saw Manchester City visit St Andrew's. Two Zárate goals and a penalty by Gary McSheffrey were enough to overcome the Manchester team, who scored with a penalty of their own from Elano.|$|E

Cohen said that Smith has [...] "matured as an artist since the first album" [...] {{and that he had}} [...] "no doubt that once again, people will be astonished and moved by her performances". Smith's father, Tony, said that the bosses at universal were hoping for the album to be more commercially successful than Faryl, but noted that the market around Christmas time is tough, due to the high volume of releases. Brian Roberts, writing for the Daily Mirror, claimed that Wonderland was [...] "tipped to <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head" [...] for the number one classical album position with releases from Il Divo and Rhydian Roberts.|$|E
500|$|The BBC has {{broadcast}} the Masters in the UK since 1986, {{and it also}} provides live radio commentary on the closing stages on Radio Five Live. With the 2007 launch of BBC HD, UK viewers can now watch the championship in that format. BBC Sport held the TV and radio rights through to 2010. The BBC's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a licence fee. From the 2011 Masters, Sky Sports began broadcasting all four days, {{as well as the}} par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time ever, in 3D. The BBC will only have highlights of the first two days' play but will <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head with Sky Sports, with full live coverage on the final two days of play.

500|$|... "Check on It" [...] is an midtempo R and hip hop song, {{which makes}} use of a heavy bassline, strings, wind instrument, and {{frequent}} [...] "swinging pelvic taunts". According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the key of G major, and is set in common time at 83 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocal range spans from the low note A3 to the high note B5. According to Bill Lamb of About.com, Beyoncé adopts smooth and alluring vocals throughout [...] "Check on It". Lyrically, the song {{takes place in a}} dance club, where the female protagonist is letting the male patrons know that they are welcome to come and look at her sexually attractive body when she is dancing. [...] "Check on It" [...] starts with a verse-rap from Slim Thug: [...] "Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas / <b>Go</b> <b>head</b> girl put some back and some neck up on it...". The rapper sounds like a 1975 Mercury Cougar turning over as he growls in his burly purr, as written by Bret McCabe of Baltimore City Paper.|$|E

2500|$|Cornel Pewewardy {{argues that}} the film {{presents}} damaging stereotypes of the Native American population. Pewewardy feels that the representation of Native characters, like Grandmother Willow, Meeko, and Flit, as animals, has a marginalizing effect. Also, Kocoum and John Smith <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head in the film fighting for Pocahontas' affection. It {{has been argued that}} Smith's victory over Kocoum in this arena is symbolic of Western Europe's domination of the Americas and the white man's domination over men of color. The lyrics of the song [...] "Savages", in which the English and the Native Americans each accuse the other culture of being evil and subhuman, has been called insensitive by Peweardy.|$|E
2500|$|... 2010's major storyline {{began in}} May at IPW Genesis, The main event at IPW's [...] "Genesis" [...] saw [...] "The One" [...] Vinny Dunn and The Samoan Silverback Alexander <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to head, but The Silverback {{failed to get}} the win. The end of the match was {{interrupted}} by Justin Lane, who stated that when Dunn put out an open challenge for the championship, Alexander wasn’t the only man to sign a contract for a title shot. He introduced that his 'monster' of a wrestler, Reuben De Jong, had responded to the challenge that would happen that night. The champion tried to retain, but the odds were against him and former heavyweight kickboxer and MMA fighter De Jong delivered a powerful double-handed chokeslam to take the win, and to be crowned new IPW champion. This being the most shocking moment of 2010 so far, would start {{one of the most}} heated feuds in IPW history.|$|E
2500|$|... 20 Y.O. is {{composed}} by eleven songs, an introduction, three interludes and an outro. It starts off with Jackson stating [...] "There's {{something to be}} said for not saying anything. I've covered a lot in my 20 years. And I've uncovered a lot" [...] in its intro. The opening song, second single [...] "So Excited" [...] featuring rapper Khia, is a hip hop track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song [...] "Rockit". In the song, Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, [...] "If you like it then I’ll do it/I’ll <b>go</b> <b>head</b> to toe" [...] and [...] "I'm-a keep your body thumping, baby". [...] "Show Me" [...] follows, with Jackson spelling its title throughout the song. The fourth song, [...] "Get It Out Me", is a dance song which was noted to feature Jackson's vocals sounding like her brother Michael's ones. [...] The following song is [...] "Do It 2 Me". It marks a return to Jackson's conversational style; in the song, She is searching for her lover: [...] "My first and only call is to you, time after time, babe, throughout my life". Its music is punctuated by handclaps and by low swoops of a string section. Sixth song [...] "This Body" [...] lyrically is about men who have appreciation with Jackson's appearances in magazines. She addresses her fans in the line [...] "Just had to buy me, had to try me, oooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine". The song brings sinuous and dark beats incorporating a rhythmic pattern of heavy breathing and the sound of a jet taking off, which was noted to be a metaphor.|$|E

60|$|The man, {{after looking}} {{at me for a}} moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.

60|$|When {{he got up}} in {{the morning}} and, with some difficulty, made his way on deck he found that, as the captain predicted, the sea was far heavier than the night before. Great ridges of water bore down upon the ship, each seeming as if it would {{overwhelm}} her; and for the first few minutes Bob expected to see the brig <b>go,</b> <b>head</b> foremost, and sink under his feet. It was not till he reflected that she had lived through it for hours that he began to view the scene with composure. Although the waves were much higher than when he had left the deck on the previous afternoon, the scene was really less terrifying.|$|E
