5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|The axioms {{of a group}} formalize the {{essential}} aspects of symmetry. Symmetries form a group: they are closed because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity {{comes from the fact}} that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.|$|E

Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode.

500|$|The pianist Pascal Rogé commented in 1999 {{that both}} sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: [...] "You must accept him as a whole. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale {{photocopy}} of what he really is." [...] Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was [...] "healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav".|$|E

Willis also stated that he is a supporter of gun rights, stating, [...] "Everyone has a right to bear arms. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys." ...|$|E

[...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. As if you had just, you know, hurled." ...|$|E

500|$|In Round the Horne, as well {{as acting}} as link man, Horne also played other {{character}} roles in the film and melodrama spoofs, but always sounded exactly like Kenneth Horne. Referring to his ability with voices, he commented that [...] "between them Betty, Ken W., Hugh and Bill Pertwee can provide at least 100 voices, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me into account the figure leaps to 101." [...] Williams reported that Horne had a card index mind, [...] "in which {{there seemed to be}} stored every funny voice, every dialect, every comedy trick, which he knew that each member of the cast was capable of", and would suggest a change in approach if a line did not work during rehearsals.|$|E

The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave you with this thought. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me, I promise you we will win a championship.

500|$|As {{the exact}} nature of Poison's status as gender-variant has been left {{deliberately}} ambiguous by Capcom, the topic has remained a popular subject for debate among fans and gaming media alike. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Eric L. Patterson described her as being a significant character to the trans community, and a perfect example of how it is [...] "so awkward when it comes to knowing how to deal with characters who aren't white, male, and heterosexual" [...] in video games. Complex pointed her out as an example of stereotypical depiction of trans hookers, listing Poison among The 15 Most Stereotypical Characters in Video Games. GamesRadar commented [...] "Poison holds a distinction as one of gaming’s first trans characters, which began as a strange choice in localization but has {{become a part of the}} character that she wears with pride. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> issue with it, that’s your problem, not hers.

500|$|Staff writer Tracy Tormé was {{not pleased}} with the [...] "1940s tribal Africa" [...] theme of the aliens, and because the combat scene {{towards the end of}} the episode resembled the Kirk versus Spock fight in [...] episode [...] "Amok Time". Fellow Star Trek writer Maurice Hurley said that it was [...] "a good idea, but the {{execution}} just fell apart. Again, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> that script and if the actors had been told to give it a different twist, that show would have been different. But it became too baroque and fell apart. But the concept of having a guy say 'I have to have somebody kill my wife and this is the person' is a good idea." [...] Some of the cast, including Jonathan Frakes, sought to prevent the episode from being re-aired. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2012, Patrick Stewart agreed with fans that considered the season 2 episode [...] "" [...] to be [...] "the first truly great episode of the series", stating that the first season [...] "had several quite weak episodes"; referring to [...] "Code of Honor" [...] in particular he said, [...] "I can think of one very early on that involved a race of black aliens that we all felt quite embarrassed about." ...|$|E
