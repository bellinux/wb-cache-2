5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a <b>foot-operated</b> equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a <b>foot-operated</b> fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous <b>foot-operated</b> pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} is fed either from a pressurised tank (whose pressure can be hand-pumped or fed from a gas cylinder). OR from a non pressurised tank with the fuel being {{drawn into the}} torch by venturi action by the pressurised oxygen flow. Another low cost approach commonly used by jewelry makers in Asia is using air bubbled through a gasoline container by a <b>foot-operated</b> air pump, and burning the fuel-air mixture in a specialized welding torch.|$|E
25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a <b>foot-operated</b> lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{guitar and}} {{electric}} bass players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an effects pedal, often called a stomp box. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty plastic housing and a <b>foot-operated</b> switch to toggle between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use {{a more expensive}} version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select reference pitches other than A440. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful for, for example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., Dropped tuning). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some Baroque musicians who play period instruments at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning {{to a range of}} different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.|$|E
500|$|Many {{challenges}} involved {{filling a}} container past a line {{with one of}} a variety of substances including water, uncooked rice, green slime, whipped cream, and milk. Others involved catching a specific number of items before time ran out. For example, during [...] "Pies in the Pants," [...] a contestant had to catch a set number of pies in a pair of oversized clown pants within the specified time limit, while their teammate launched the pies from a <b>foot-operated</b> catapult {{at the opposite end of}} the stage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{situations}} {{with limited}} water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conserving solutions, such as [...] "tippy-taps" [...] and other low-cost options. A tippy-tap {{is a simple}} technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a <b>foot-operated</b> lever to pour {{a small amount of}} water over the hands and a bar of soap.|$|E
2500|$|The Bushmaster 2000 {{featured}} significant modernisation of {{the original}} 1920s design, particularly {{in the choice of}} materials and construction techniques. It also had more powerful engines, enlarged cockpit windows, a lighter and stronger aluminum-alloy skin, a <b>foot-operated</b> hydraulic replacement of the old Trimotor's hand-operated [...] "Johnny Brake," [...] a larger stabilizer and a dorsal fin to reduce yaw, modern trim tabs and interior rather than exterior control cables.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the music}} of the world was evolving, so was the drum set. Tom-tom drums, small crash cymbals, Chinese cymbals and hi-hat cymbals were added to the drum set. The hi-hats were the primary way for the drummers of the big band era to keep time. Before 1930, while playing the New Orleans jaz and Chicago styles, drummers would choke the cymbals on the [...] "ands" [...] of eighth note figures as an {{alternative}} to playing a buzz roll, the rim of the drums, or on the woodblocks to keep time. This muting method of keeping time by choking the crash and china cymbals proved to be awkward, so the drummers of that time {{came up with the idea}} of having a <b>foot-operated</b> cymbal. This resulted in the creation of the snowshoe cymbal, a <b>foot-operated</b> cymbal. It enabled drummers to play the eighth note figures ("Boom, Chick, Boom, Chick, Boom, Chick") between the right and left foot, improving the ergonomics and facility of drumset playing and helping drummers to keep a more steady rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (low beam) {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) beams of a headlamp emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the <b>foot-operated</b> dimmer switch or dip switch was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver's side with high beam on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a <b>foot-operated</b> dimmer switch were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1954 [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] system automated the selection of high and low beams.|$|E
2500|$|For 1956, styling {{highlights}} {{included a}} new split grille {{in front and}} revised taillights and deck along with revised side chroming. Horsepower for the 324 Rocket V8 increased to 230 for 88s and 240 for Super 88s. A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new [...] "Park" [...] position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance. Inside, an oval speedometer replaced the round unit and a new <b>foot-operated</b> parking brake replaced the previous T-handle unit.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} the glass {{harmonica}} or glass armonica, Benjamin Franklin invented a musical instrument in 1761, an arrangement of glasses after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edmund Delaval in Cambridge, England. Dr. Franklin, who called his invention the [...] "armonica" [...] after the Italian word for harmony, worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world première in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies. In this version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally nested on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned {{by means of a}} <b>foot-operated</b> treadle. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note.|$|E
2500|$|The spoon brake, or plunger brake was {{probably}} the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre. Spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after {{the introduction of the}} pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle. The spoon brake consists of a pad (often leather) or metal shoe (possibly rubber faced), which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre. [...] These were almost always rod-operated by a right-hand lever. [...] In developing countries, a <b>foot-operated</b> form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters. [...] It consists of a spring-loaded flap attached {{to the back of the}} fork crown. [...] This is depressed against the front tyre by the rider's foot.|$|E
2500|$|In road vehicles, {{the parking}} brake, also called hand brake, {{emergency}} brake, [...] or e-brake, {{is used to}} keep the vehicle stationary {{and in many cases}} also perform an emergency stop. Parking brakes on older vehicles often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes at one end and the other end to a pulling mechanism which is operated with the driver's hand or foot. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, at floor level beside the driver, or a straight pull handle located near the steering column, or a (<b>foot-operated)</b> pedal located beside the drivers leg. In most automobiles the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels, which have reduced traction while braking. Some automobiles have the parking brake operate on the front wheels, for example most Citroens manufactured since the end of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} sold in the North American market, third-generation models were {{imported}} to many other countries, in left and right-hand drive configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful. Exported models wore Mercury Sable headlamps, a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding automotive lighting. Right-hand-drive versions used a hand-operated parking brake in the center console instead of a <b>foot-operated</b> parking brake as in North America. Australians tended {{to stay away from}} the cars, due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined rear-wheel drive Ford Fairmont cost around the same amount. Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the Taurus Ghia. However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. Whereas Australia only saw the 1996 model, both the sedan and station wagon models were sold in New Zealand from 1996-1998.|$|E
2500|$|Again, in 1963, the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile 98 had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase. A new body style was the Custom Sports Coupe hardtop. It {{was the only}} body style with the 345 horsepower Starfire engine. The 4-door 6-window hardtop was renamed the Luxury Sedan (often condensed to L/S). The convention of naming all hardtops Holidays would not again return until 1965. Standard equipment included die-cast grille, deep pile carpeting, 21-gallon fuel tank, full-flow oil filter, foam seat cushions, <b>foot-operated</b> parking brake, two-speed windshield wipers, special molding package, Deluxe steering wheel, map light, heavy duty air cleaner, courtesy lights, Roto Hydramatic, power brakes, power steering, special rocker panel moldings, self-regulating electric clock, dual rear seat cigarette lighters and special headliner. Interiors were leather, vinyl or cloth. Standard tire size was 8.50 x 14inches. Ninety-Eights were now made only in Lansing, Linden, Kansas City, Southgate and Wilmington.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall {{began to}} see more {{competition}} from American amplifier companies such as Mesa Boogie and Soldano. Marshall then updated the JCM800 range with additional models and new features such as [...] "channel switching", which meant that players could switch between clean and distorted tones with {{the push of a}} <b>foot-operated</b> switch. This feature debuted in the 2205 (50 watt) and 2210 (100 watt) series and these amps contained more pre-amp gain than ever thanks to a new innovation; diode clipping. This meant a solid-state diode added additional distortion to the signal path, akin to adding a distortion pedal. As such the split channel JCM800s were the highest gain Marshalls yet built – [...] "When they were first released, many players were shocked (some were even put off) by its bright, intense distortion – far more than any other amp of the day." [...] While hotly criticised today among valve purists, these amps were more popular than ever, finding mass acceptance within the hard rock community and still in use today by many. The split-channel JCM800s are still used by Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and were played exclusively by Michael Schenker (UFO) for many years.|$|E
