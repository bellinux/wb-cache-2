5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are <b>interlocks</b> on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an adductor muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that <b>interlocks</b> with the premaxilla.|$|E

30|$|Apart from that, {{looking at}} the {{differences}} between {{inside and outside the}} political system, constructing cross-administrative <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks should be much easier than constructing cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks because the former belongs to connections within the system whereas the latter belongs to cross-system connections. Due to this consideration, we can further categorize four types of <b>interlocking</b> networks: within-system <b>interlocking</b> whose controllers are at the same administrative level, within-system and cross-administrative-level <b>interlocking,</b> cross-system and cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> relations, and <b>interlocking</b> relations outside of the system. The distribution and evolution of these four types of <b>interlocking</b> relations are worthy of in-depth investigation. Overall, Table  5 supports hypothesis 2; i.e., two companies in the same category of ownership are more likely to constitute <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks.|$|R

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe <b>interlocks</b> to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

40|$|<b>Interlocking</b> puzzles {{are very}} {{challenging}} geometric {{problems with the}} fascinating property that once we solve one by putting together the puzzle pieces, the puzzle pieces <b>interlock</b> with one another, preventing the assembly from falling apart. Though <b>interlocking</b> puzzles have been known for hundreds of years, very {{little is known about}} the governing mechanics. Thus, designing new <b>interlocking</b> geometries is basically accomplished with extensive manual effort or expensive exhaustive search with computers. In this paper, we revisit the notion of <b>interlocking</b> in greater depth, and devise a formal method of the <b>interlocking</b> mechanics. From this, we can develop a constructive approach for devising new <b>interlocking</b> geometries that directly guarantees the validity of the <b>interlocking</b> instead of exhaustively testing it. In particular, we focus on an interesting subclass of <b>interlocking</b> puzzles that are recursive in the sense that the assembly of puzzle pieces can remain an <b>interlocking</b> puzzle also after sequential removal of pieces; there is only one specific sequence of assembling, or disassembling, such a puzzle. Our proposed method can allow efficient generation of recursive <b>interlocking</b> geometries of various complexities, and by further realizing it with LEGO bricks, we can enable the hand-built creation of custom puzzle games...|$|R

How cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks come about, how their constitutive motivation differs from that of mono-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks, and what different influences cross-ownership and mono-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks have on firm performance are questions in need of detailed discussion when looking at the constitutive nature of interfirm networks.|$|R

500|$|Family, {{gender and}} {{sexuality}} form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A {{family is a}} group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an institution and unit of socialization, with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles. The notion of [...] "childhood" [...] is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. Feminist sociology, on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. Feminist sociology also analyses how gender <b>interlocks</b> with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities. [...] "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" [...] is also a concern. Social psychology of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.|$|E
500|$|The tight {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty raised many challenges and required difficult compromises {{if they were to}} be met. To avoid the class being outgunned by the new ships of foreign navies, especially as by the mid-1930s the Treaty had been renounced by Japan and Italy, Churchill wrote to the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1936, voicing strong objections to the proposed armament of 10 14-inch guns. His proposal was for nine 16-inch guns. However, when completed King George V mounted ten [...] guns. They were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets, one forward and one aft. They could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees. Training arcs were: [...] "A" [...] turret, 286 degrees; [...] "B" [...] turret, 270 degrees and [...] "Y" [...] turret, 270 degrees. Training and elevating was achieved through a hydraulic drive, with rates of two and eight degrees per second, respectively. A full gun broadside weighed 15,950 pounds; a salvo could be fired every 30 seconds. The quadruple turrets weighed 1,582 tons, the twin turret 915 tons. The turrets were designed by the Vickers Armstrong's Elswick Works, but sets of each type of equipment were manufactured by Vickers Armstrongs in Barrow. A considerable amount of design effort was expended to make the turrets as flashtight as possible. This complicated the mechanical design of the turrets, particularly the quadruple mountings. Due to insufficient clearances and slightly distorted link mechanisms, failures in the intricate safety <b>interlocks</b> in the loading sequence for antiflash precautions caused jams during drills and practice firing. During the summer of 1941 the King George V-class battleships, had their main armament turrets and turret linkages modified to correct the operational faults revealed during the hunt and destruction of Bismarck. HMS King George V used an Admiralty Fire Control Table Mark IX to control her main armament.|$|E
