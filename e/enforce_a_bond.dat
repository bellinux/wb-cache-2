60|$|The {{failure of}} this horde {{did not in}} the least check the {{proceedings}} of Sharp or Lauderdale or their like-minded colleagues. They kept the regular troops and militia moving about the land, enforcing their idiotical and wicked laws at the point of the sword. We say idiotical advisedly, for what could give stronger evidence of mental incapacity than the attempt to <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> upon all landed proprietors, obliging themselves and their wives, children, and servants, as well as all their tenants and cottars, with their wives, children, and servants, to abstain from conventicles, and not to receive, assist, or even speak to, any forfeited persons, intercommuned ministers, or vagrant preachers, but to use their utmost endeavours to apprehend all such? Those who took this bond were to receive an assurance that the troops should not be quartered on their lands--a matter of considerable importance--for this quartering involved great expense and much destruction of property in most cases, and absolute ruin in some.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reported case}} on the rule {{is believed to be}} Attorney General v Lutwydge (1729) Bumb 280, 145 ER 674. In that case the English courts refused to <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> for Scottish tobacco duties. In 1775 Lord Mansfield CJ famously pronounced in Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341 at 343, 98 ER 1120 at 1121 that [...] "no country ever takes notice of the revenue laws of another." [...] In 1779 he repeated that position in Planche v Fletcher (1779) 1 Douglas 251, 99 ER 164.|$|E
50|$|Building {{societies}} {{exist in}} Britain, Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They {{are similar to}} credit unions in organisation, though few <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> common <b>bond.</b> However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, their purpose is to provide home mortgages for members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. In the United Kingdom, regulations permit {{up to half of}} their lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages. The world's largest building society is Britain's Nationwide Building Society.|$|R

Noah, on the {{treatment}} she received from her own species, her own nation:"They {{knew what they were}} doing to me, and yet it never occurred to them not to do it." [...] Butler, [...] "Amnesty," [...] 181. [...] Noah explains to James Adio, one of the recruits, why she is working for the aliens and apparently against her own species:"No payback. Just what I said earlier. Jobs. We get to live and so do they. I don't need payback." [...] Butler, [...] "Amnesty," [...] 181. In [...] "Amnesty," [...] Noah, the main character, meets with prospective human employees for the Communities, an alien species that has taken over Earth's desert areas. Noah, who was abducted by the Communities when she was a child, attempts to convince the humans to overcome their fear of the aliens so they can prosper alongside them. During her pitch, Noah compares her experiences with both the Communities and the humans. Despite being treated as a lab experiment by the aliens, Noah stated that she never once faced as much cruelty as she did once her own government captured her after being released by the Communities. As a result of her experiences with both aliens and humans, Noah has become one of thirty “translators” to participate in the enfolding process which allows communication with the Communities and also <b>enforces</b> <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> between humans and aliens.|$|R
2500|$|A {{building}} {{society is a}} financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially savings and mortgage lending.

40|$|The orbital {{dependence}} of closed-shell wavefunction energies is investigated by performing doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) calculations, representing the most general class of these wavefunctions. Different local minima are examined for planar hydrogen clusters containing two, four, and six electrons applying (spin) symmetry-broken restricted, unrestricted, and generalised orbitals with real and complex coefficients. Contrary to Hartree-Fock (HF), restricted DOCI {{is found to}} properly break bonds and thus unrestricted orbitals, while providing a quantitative improvement of the energy, are not needed to <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> qualitatively correct <b>bond</b> dissociation. For the beryllium atom and the BH diatomic, the lowest possible HF energy requests symmetry-broken generalised orbitals, whereas accurate results for DOCI can be obtained within a restricted formalism. Complex orbital coefficients are shown to increase the accuracy of HF and DOCI results in certain cases. The computationally inexpensive AP 1 roG geminal wavefunction is proven to agree very well with all DOCI results of this study...|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} impact of such {{covenants}} {{on the cost of}} debt. A high bankruptcy threshold <b>enforces</b> <b>an</b> earlier redemption of debt. However, this is only beneficial for bondholders if bankruptcy costs are sufficiently low. Otherwise, they get an early redemption with high probability, but the redemption amount may be quite low. Whether <b>a</b> <b>bond</b> covenant, given by a bankruptcy threshold, provides an additional value to bondholders, therefore, crucially depends on the bankruptcy costs α.|$|R
