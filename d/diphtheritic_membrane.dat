50|$|Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, head shaking, lethargy, {{discharge}} from the eyes and nostrils (sometimes bloody), and difficulty breathing. The name comes from the severe inflammation of the larynx and trachea. A <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membrane</b> may form in the trachea, causing obstruction.|$|E
50|$|Fowlpox is the {{worldwide}} disease of poultry caused by viruses {{of the family}} Poxviridae and the genus Avipoxvirus. The viruses causing fowlpox are distinct from one another but antigenically similar, possible hosts including chickens, turkeys, quail, canaries, pigeons, and many other species of birds. There are two forms of the disease. The first is spread by biting insects (especially mosquitoes) and wound contamination and causes lesions on the comb, wattles, and beak. Birds affected by this form usually recover within a few weeks. The second form is spread by inhalation of the virus and causes a <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membrane</b> to form in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and sometimes the trachea. The prognosis for this form is poor.|$|E
40|$|Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The name of the disease {{is derived from the}} Greek diphthera, meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5 th century BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the 6 th century AD by Aetius. The bacterium was first observed in <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membranes</b> by Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by Löffler in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in the late 19 th century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920 s. 5 Corynebacterium diphtheriae C. diphtheriae is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene) ...|$|R
40|$|Eight male holstein calves, four to {{six weeks}} of age, were {{infected}} with 100, 000 sporulated oocysts of a culture containing Eimeria bovis. The calves were injected with steroids on days 13, 14 and 15 and killed on days 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24 and 26 postinfection. The lesions caused by experimental E. bovis infection in the small and large intestines are characterized by a diphtheritic typhilitis and colitis. Severe lesions were also seen in the last metre of the ileum in a calf killed 19 days after infection. Most of the damage of the intestinal mucosa is caused by the sexual stages. There is destruction and loss of epithelial cells with subsequent exposure of lamina propria and formation of <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Between May 2007 and October 2008, 34 {{outbreaks}} of {{mild to moderate}} forms of infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) occurred in commercial broiler flocks in Italy. Affected birds showed watery eyes, conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, reduction of feed and water consumption, and gasping with expectoration of blood-stained mucus. The mortality rate was < 10 %. Gross lesions consisted of conjunctivitis, excess of mucus, blood, or presence of <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membranes</b> in trachea. A real-time PCR assay was performed to confirm the presence of ILT virus (ILTV) DNA in tracheal tissue homogenates. Twenty-three ILTV isolates were propagated on the chorion-allantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs showing typical plaques. PCR combined with {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and gene sequencing of isolates showed a high genetic correlation between field strains and chicken embryo origin vaccines...|$|R
5000|$|Lesions of {{the skin}} and <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membrane</b> of the {{respiratory}} tract are common when domesticated and wild birds are infected with the avipoxvirus. There are two common forms of clinical signs. Cutaneous pox are most common. They appear as wart-like growths around the eyes and other apterylae (feather-free) areas, sometimes in large clusters. Pock lesions can be concentrated or spread out. [...] The size and number of growths depend on {{the severity of the}} infection. Diphtheritic, or wet, pox are characterized as raised yellow blemishes on mucus membranes of the mouth, esophagus, trachea, and lungs. These can lead to difficulty breathing or swallowing. In both cases, birds may appear weak and emaciated.|$|E

Three patients showed the rarely reported finding of a labial <b>diphtheritic</b> <b>membrane</b> unassociated with involvement of either the nose or throat. In two patients, the membrane covered the floor of the mouth and in a third patient also the in-ferior surface of the tongue. The fourth child had a membrane {{on the floor of the}} mouth as well as in the tonsillopharyngeal region. This extended membrane was accompanied by severe cervical oedema giving the classi-cal 'bull-neck ' appearance...|$|E

40|$|Three Oriental Turtle-doves (Streptopelia orientalis) exhibiting lethargy, dyspnea, poor {{physical}} condition, {{and poor}} flight endurance, were rescued {{and referred to}} the Animal Health Center, Seoul Zoo, Korea. The doves had wart-like lesions on the legs and head. All of them died the following day after arrival, {{with the exception of}} one that survived for 6 days. <b>Diphtheritic</b> <b>membranes</b> on the tongue and oral mucosa were apparent at necropsy. Avian pox virus infection was suspected based on the proliferative skin lesions and oral diphtheritic lesions. Infection of the avian pox virus was confirmed by PCR using primers specific to the 4 b core protein gene of avian pox virus. All cases were diagnosed with avian pox virus infection. This is believed to be the first description on natural infection of avian pox in Oriental Turtle-doves in Korea...|$|R
