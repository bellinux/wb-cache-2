50|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> {{begins with}} a known position, or fix, which is then advanced, mathematically or {{directly}} on the chart, by means of recorded heading, speed, and time. Speed can be determined by many methods. Before modern instrumentation, it was determined aboard ship using a chip log. More modern methods include pit log referencing engine speed (e.g. in rpm) against a table of total displacement (for ships) or referencing one's indicated airspeed fed by the pressure from a pitot tube. This measurement is converted to an equivalent airspeed based upon known atmospheric conditions and measured errors in the indicated airspeed system. A naval vessel uses a device called a pit sword (rodmeter), which uses two sensors on a metal rod to measure the electromagnetic variance caused by the ship moving through water. This change is then converted to ship's speed. Distance is determined by multiplying the speed and the time. This initial position can then be adjusted resulting in an estimated position by {{taking into account the}} current (known as set and drift in marine navigation). If there is no positional information available, a new <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> plot may start from an estimated position.

The measurement of attitude of a mobile platform is necessary for correct navigation, especially in autonomous vehicles, which use <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> between <b>position</b> updates from external sources.

At that time radio navigation aids were new and not completely trusted. The USS Delphy was equipped with a radio navigation receiver, but her navigator and captain ignored its indicated bearings, believing them to be erroneous. No effort was made to take soundings of water depths due to the necessity of slowing the ships down to take the measurements. The ships were performing an exercise that simulated wartime conditions, hence the decision was made not to slow down. In this case, the <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> was wrong, and the mistakes were fatal. Despite the heavy fog, Commodore Watson ordered all ships to travel in close formation and, turning too soon, went aground. Six others followed and sank.

50|$|Radio waves cannot {{penetrate}} water very far, so {{as soon as}} an AUV dives {{it loses}} its GPS signal. Therefore, a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning.</b> Navigation can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system. When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation. When a surface reference such as a support ship is available, ultra-short baseline (USBL) or short-baseline (SBL) positioning is used to calculate where the sub-sea vehicle is relative to the known (GPS) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements. To improve estimation of its position, and reduce errors in <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> (which grow over time), the AUV can also surface and take its own GPS fix. Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering, an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> the AUV <b>position,</b> acceleration, and velocity. Estimates can be made using data from a Inertial Measurement Unit, and can be improved by adding a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor. Typically, a pressure sensor measures the vertical position (vehicle depth), although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements. These observations are filtered to determine a final navigation solution.|$|R

Channel State Information (CSI) as a fine-grained physical layer information has been recently proposed to achieve high positioning accuracy by using range-based methods, e. g., trilateration. In this work, we propose to fuse the CSI-based ranges and velocity estimated from inertial sensors by an enhanced particle filter to achieve highly accurate tracking. The algorithm relies on some enhanced ranging methods and further mitigates the remaining ranging errors by a weighting technique. Additionally, we provide an efficient method to estimate the velocity based on inertial sensors. The algorithms are designed in a network-based system, which uses rather cheap commercial devices as anchor nodes. We evaluate our system in a complex environment along three different moving paths.

In this paper, we present an indoor positioning system based on foot-mounted pedestrian <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> (PDR) with an efficient map matching, received signal strength (RSS) measurements, and an improved motion model that includes the estimation of the turn rate bias. The system was implemented using a two-level structure with a low-level PDR filter and a high-level particle filter (PF) to include all the measurements. After studying the effect of the step displacement on the PFs proposed in the literature, we concluded that a new state with the turn rate bias (a nonobservable state in PDR) is needed to correctly estimate the error growth and, in the long term, correct the position and heading estimation. Additionally, the wall crossing detection of map matching was optimized as matrix operations, and a room grouping algorithm was proposed as a way to accelerate the process, achieving real-time execution with more than 100 000 particles in a building with more than 600 wall segments. We also include a basic path-loss model to use RSS measurements that allows a better initialization of the filter, fewer particles, and faster convergence, without the need for an extensive calibration.

By monitoring an operator's exposure to noise, vibration and harmful gases, {{short and long term}} damages can be avoided. In addition, a localization system would provide employees with a higher degree of safety in case of emergency. The aim of this thesis is to develop a prototype system for localizing people indoors as well as outdoors with use of an inertial measurement unit. As a consequence, challenges such as drift and signal noise, as well as magnetic interference are directed. Since the IMU is subject to drift, investigations on different sensor configurations must be conducted. Collected sensor data from the hip-mounted IMU are used for step detection, step length estimation and heading determination. By combining the results from these three approaches, a positioning estimate for the human operator is calculated using <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning.</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> is a <b>positioning</b> method for determining an objects location based on a former position, velocity and direction.
