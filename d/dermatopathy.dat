Median basal TT 4 and median TT 4 concentrations at 4 h post-TSH administration were not significantly different (P < 0. 0001) between healthy dogs and euthyroid dogs with <b>dermatopathies,</b> but were significantly higher than those in hypothyroid dogs. In healthy dogs, the median TT 4 concentrations at 4 and 6 h post-TSH administration were not significantly different. Median basal FT 4 and median FT 4 concentrations at 4 h post-TSH administration in healthy dogs were significantly lower (P < 0. 0001) than those in euthyroid dogs with <b>dermatopathies,</b> but significantly higher than the same parameters in hypothyroid dogs.

Thus, although complications are reportedly rare, availability of a precise diagnostic tool to detect cutaneous filler deposits could help clarify the association between the procedure and the underlying pathology. Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate cutaneous sonography in the detection and identification of cosmetic fillers deposits and, describe dermatological abnormalities found associated with the presence of those agents. Methods We used ultrasound in a porcine skin model to determine the sonographic characteristics of commonly available filler agents, and subsequently applied the analysis to detect and identify cosmetic fillers among patients referred for skin disorders. Results Fillers are recognizable on ultrasound and generate different patterns of echogenicity and posterior acoustic artefacts. Cosmetic fillers were identified in 118 dermatological patients; most commonly hyaluronic acid among degradable agents and silicone oil among non-degradable. Fillers deposits were loosely scattered throughout the subcutaneous tissue, with occasional infiltration of local muscles and loco-regional lymph nodes. Accompanying <b>dermatopathies</b> were represented by highly localized inflammatory processes unresponsive to conventional treatment, morphea-like reactions, necrosis of fatty tissue and epidermal cysts; in the case of non-degradable agents, the associated <b>dermatopathies</b> were transient, resolving upon disappearance of the filler. Conclusions Cosmetic filler agents may be detected and identified during routine ultrasound of dermatological lesions; the latter appear to be pathologically related to the cosmetic procedure...|$|R

40|$|Canine {{endocrine}} <b>dermatopathies</b> {{account for}} 8. 6 % of the dermatological appointments, frequently presenting classic signs of non- pruritic bilaterally symmetrical alopecia that develops chronically. The most common are hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) and hyperestrogenism. Hypothyroidism {{is the most}} observed endocrine disease in dogs and it {{is characterized by a}} structural and / or functional abnormality in the gland, which leads to a deficient production of thyroid hormones. Clinical signs caused by insufficient thyroid hormones are commonly observed in the skin. Hormones produced by the thyroid are important in maintaining cutaneous function, once they perform a regulatory role in epidermal differentiation. Diagnosis of canine hypothyroidism is based on clinical and historical findings that are suggestive of the disease associated with supporting laboratory findings. The most frequently measured thyroid hormones are total tiroxine (TT 4), total triiodothyronine (TT 3) and free T 4 (fT 4). Skin biopsy may reveal histopathological findings highly suggestive of hypothyroidism such as vacuolization and arrector pili muscle hypertrophy. The combination of those knowledge is essential to the veterinarian when confronted with a chronic case of dermatological disorders, he or she may think about hypothyroidism as a possible diagnosis...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess parasitism of the skin (intact and ulcerated) among dogs that were naturally infected by Leishmania spp., through immunohistochemical analysis. Skin fragments (intact and ulcerated) were collected from 13 dogs with positive parasitological (bone marrow aspiration and exfoliative skin) and serological examinations (ELISA S 7 ® Biogene) forLeishmania spp. These samples were processed using the immunohistochemical technique, involving the streptavidin-peroxidase complex. Ulcerative lesions were mainly observed on the elbows (53. 84 %; 7 / 13), nostrils (15. 38 %; 2 / 13), ears (23. 07 %; 3 / 13) and wings of the ilium (7. 69 %; 1 / 13). A severe parasite load was detected in 46. 15 % and 76. 92 % of the intact and ulcerated skin samples tested, respectively. The parasite load on ulcerated skin was statistically higher than on intact skin (p = 0. 0221). These results indicate that the intact and ulcerated skin may host a high parasite load of amastigote forms of Leishmania spp., which can favor the transmission of the parasite...|$|R

40|$|Leishmaniosis are zoonoses {{that present}} several {{clinical}} manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir {{in the urban}} environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in São Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded {{for the first time}} in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPP® and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83 % (250 / 300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58 % (175 / 300) were female, 78 % (238 / 300) slept outdoors, and 61 % (183 / 300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90 % (270 / 300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70 % (210 / 300) had <b>dermatopathies,</b> 24 % (72 / 300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22 % (65 / 300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100 % concordant for the three seropositive samples (1 %), and the remaining 297 (99 %) were negative for both tests. We conclude that despite the low prevalence of L. infantum seropositive dogs, conditions in the region are favorable for CVL transmission, creating a risk of VL for the human population in the city of Porto Alegre...|$|R

Also, to compare the results obtained with a non-alcoholic control group and with the data found in medical literature. METHODS: the dermatologic conditions of 278 alcoholic patients (250 men, 28 women) were studied {{over a period of}} 4 years, and compared to those of a control group of 271 non-alcoholic individuals (249 men, 22 women), members of the Military Police Force. The individuals in both groups were between 20 and 60 years old. RESULTS: Pellagra, nummular eczema, purpura pigmentosa chronica (also known as pigmented purpuric dermatosis) and psoriasis were more frequent in the group of alcoholics and, apparently, occurred in parallel with alcoholism that seems {{to play a role in}} the evolution of these dermatoses. The <b>dermatopathies</b> were more frequent before the age of forty, regardless of factors such as profession, race or gender. CONCLUSION: the association of dermatoses and alcoholism was extremely significant according to the statistical data. Alcoholism can be considered a risk factor for pellagra, psoriasis, nummular eczema and purpura pigmentosa chronica dermatoses, which can, as well, be considered alcoholism indicators. FUNDAMENTOS: A rela&# 231;&# 227;o direta entre o alcoolismo e as dermatoses vem sendo avaliada em recentes pesquisas. No entanto s&# 227;o poucos os estudos objetivos que demonstram e comprovam uma rela&# 231;&# 227;o direta entre o &# 225;lcool e uma determinada dermatose. OBJETIVOS: Verificar a preval&# 234;ncia de dermatoses em alcoolistas, avaliar as altera&# 231;&# 245;es dermatol&# 243;gicas encontradas nesses doentes e sua evolu&# 231;&# 227;o frente abstin&# 234;ncia alco&# 243;lica. Comparar os resultados obtidos com um grupo controle n&# 227;o alcoolista e com os resultados encontrados na literatura mundial. M&# 201;TODO: Foram estudados, durante 4 anos, sob o ponto de vista dermatol&# 243;gico, 278 doentes alcoolistas (250 homens, 28 mulheres) comparativamente a 271 indiv&# 237;duos (249 homens, 22 mulheres) n&# 227;o alcoolistas integrantes da Policia Militar, que constitu&# 237;ram o grupo controle, ambos com idades entre 20 e 60 anos. RESULTADOS: As dermatoses pelagra, eczema numular, p&# 250;rpura pigmentosa cr&# 244;nica e psor&# 237;ase foram mais frequentes no grupo dos alcoolistas e aparentemente surgiram paralelamente ao alcoolismo, que parece interferir na evolu&# 231;&# 227;o destas dermatoses. As dermatopatias foram mais frequentes antes dos quarenta anos, n&# 227;o sendo significativos os fatores profiss&# 227;o, cor e sexo. CONCLUS&# 195;O: a associa&# 231;&# 227;o das dermatoses com alcoolismo foi altamente significativa, como indicaram os dados estat&# 237;sticos. O alcoolismo pode ser considerado fator de risco para as dermatoses pelagra, psor&# 237;ase, eczema numular e p&# 250;rpura pigmentar cr&# 244;nica, podendo estas serem consideradas indicadoras de alcoolism...|$|R
40|$|The Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca is {{a common}} ophthalmopathy among dogs and can be {{accompanied}} by periocular alopecia resulting from the extension of inflammation and concomitant eyelid. In the study, medical records of dogs with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and blepharitis treated at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Londrina State University between the years 2008 and 2012 were analyzed, seeking patients with periocular alopecia and checking the frequency of these diseases in the population in relation to gender, age, breed, affected eye, other concomitant ophthalmic disorders, possible etiologies {{and the presence of}} systemic diseases. From the analysis of data it was intended to discuss the relationship between the occurrence of periocular alopecia and decreased tear production and possible causes, ocular present, systemic illnesses, affected breeds, gender and age. The Schirmer Tear Test was the method used to measure the tear production. 187 dogs were studied, 147 of which had keratoconjunctivitis sicca and 71 had blepharitis. 31 dogs showed associated diseases. There were 41 cases of alopecia periocular with no difference in the frequency of involvement in relation to gender. In regard to the affected eye, 95 % of cases were bilateral. The breeds with higher prevalence were Poodle, Lhasa Apso, English Cocker Spaniel and mixed breed dogs. The ages with higher occurrence were two years, with 19 % of the animals, four and twelve years with 12 %. Among the 32 animals with periocular alopecia who had systemic diseases, 22 had <b>dermatopathies.</b> It was concluded that keratoconjunctivitis sicca and blepharitis are not frequently associated and the occurrence of periocular alopecia occurs in most cases of blepharitis, although it may less frequently present itself in the CCS. Despite the decreased tear production displayed in some patients with periocular alopecia, one cannot say that it is always present in these cases. A Ceratoconjuntivite Seca é uma oftalmopatia frequente entre os cães e pode estar acompanhada de alopecia periocular, decorrente da extensão ou concomitância da inflamação palpebral. No estudo foram analisados prontuários de cães com Ceratoconjuntivite Seca e Blefarites atendidos no Hospital Veterinário da Universidade Estadual de Londrina entre os anos de 2008 e 2012, para buscar pacientes com alopecia periocular, verificando a frequência destas enfermidades na população em relação ao gênero, idade, raça, olho acometido, outras afecções oftálmicas concomitantes, possíveis etiologias e presença de doenças sistêmicas nestes cães. A partir da análise dos dados dos animais com as oftalmopatias referidas, pretendeu-se discutir a relação entre a ocorrência de alopecia periocular e diminuição da produção lacrimal, além de possíveis causas, alterações oculares presentes, enfermidades sistêmicas, raças acometidas, gênero e idade. O Teste Lacrimal de Schirmer foi o método utilizado para aferição da produção lacrimal. Foram encontrados 187 cães, dos quais 147 apresentaram ceratoconjuntivite seca e 71 blefarite. Em 31 cães as enfermidades apresentaram-se associadas. Ocorreram 41 casos de alopecia periocular sem diferença na frequência de acometimento em relação ao gênero dos pacientes. Quanto ao olho acometido, 95 % dos casos mostram-se bilateral. As raças que tiveram maior prevalência foram Poodle, Lhasa Apso, Cocker Spaniel Inglês e cães sem raça definida. As idades mais frequentes foram dois anos, com 19 % dos animais, quatro e 12 anos com 12 %. Dos 32 animais com alopecia periocular que apresentaram doenças sistêmicas, 22 tinham dermatopatias. Concluiu-se que a ceratoconjuntivite seca e a blefarite não aparecem associadas com tanta frequência e que a ocorrência de alopecia periocular se dá na maior parte, em casos de blefarite, embora possa, com menor frequência, apresentar-se na CCS. Apesar da produção de lágrima exibir-se diminuída em alguns pacientes com alopecia periocular, não se pode dizer que sempre esteja presente nestes casos...|$|R
