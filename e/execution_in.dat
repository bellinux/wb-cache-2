5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto {{was subject to}} Aktions, selections of people for deportation and <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> Ponary. Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and <b>execution.</b> <b>In</b> October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was also}} {{completed}} on the tunnels during 2005/06, {{and the main}} cell block was restored with an eighteen month, $1.9 million project in 2006 and 2007. The gallows room was restored in 2013 to conditions {{at the time of}} the last <b>execution,</b> <b>in</b> 1964.|$|E

5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with gallows was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|At Sparrow's <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> Port Royal, Will saves Sparrow, {{but they}} are quickly captured. Elizabeth intervenes, declaring her love for Will who is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by {{tumbling}} off a sea wall. The Black Pearl and her new crew arrive in time to retrieve him, and he becomes captain once more. Impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows him one day's head start before giving chase.|$|E

5|$|Leicester having {{returned}} to England, in February 1587 Elizabeth signed Mary's death warrant, {{with the proviso}} that it be not carried out until she gave her approval. As {{there was no sign of}} her doing so, Burghley, Leicester, and a handful of other privy councillors decided to proceed with Mary's <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> the interest of the state. Leicester went to Bath and Bristol for his health; unlike the other privy councillors involved, he escaped Elizabeth's severe wrath on hearing the news of Mary's death.|$|E
5|$|The English Earl of Northumberland {{was also}} held here, after fleeing to Scotland {{following}} {{the failure of}} the Catholic Rising of the North in 1570. He was captured by the Earl of Morton, and confined at Loch Leven before being sent back to England for <b>execution.</b> <b>In</b> 1588, Sir William Douglas of Lochleven succeeded to the earldom of Morton, as the 6th earl. With the title he inherited other properties, including Aberdour Castle in Fife, and Loch Leven Castle became less frequently used.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{reinstatement}} of {{the death}} penalty in 1976 there have been 1077 <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> the United States (as of May 23, 2007). There were 53 <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> 2006. Texas overwhelmingly leads the United States <b>in</b> <b>executions,</b> with 379 executions from 1976 to 2006; the second-highest ranking state is Virginia, with 98 executions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Executions</b> <b>in</b> Utah are {{currently}} {{performed at the}} Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. Because the ethics standards of the American Medical Association forbid physician involvement <b>in</b> <b>executions,</b> other healthcare professionals including paramedics and nurses perform <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> Utah. Paramedics and nurses, however, are also forbidden from participation <b>in</b> <b>executions</b> by their own professional organizations' ethics codes. The prison protects the anonymity of professionals involved <b>in</b> <b>executions,</b> {{making it impossible for}} professional organizations to impose sanctions.|$|R

Finally, an analysis of the operation of semipublic <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> Queensland during the 1860 s and 1870 shighlights the influence of racial tensions upon the mode of implementing capital punishment in the colony...|$|R
5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless they told him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in royal hands {{until it was}} given to John Dudley in 1553. Dudley came to prominence under Henry VIII and became the leading political figure under Edward VI. Dudley was a patron of John Shute, an early exponent of classical architecture in England, and began the process of modernising Kenilworth. Before his <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> 1553 by Queen Mary for attempting to place Lady Jane Grey on the throne, Dudley had built the new stable block and widened the tiltyard to its current form.|$|E
5|$|The costumes were {{designed}} by Anthony Mendleson, who matched Louis's rise through the social ranks with his changing costumes. When employed as a shop assistant, Louis's suit was ill-fitting and drab; he is later seen in tailored suits with satin lapels, wearing a brocade dressing gown and waiting for his <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> a quilted-collar velvet jacket. Mendleson later recounted that to dress Guinness in his many roles, the costumes were of less importance than make-up and the actor's nuances.|$|E

5|$|The first {{military}} <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> the war's western theater {{occurred on}} March 27, 1863, at Camp Burnside (Burnside Barracks). Robert Gay, a 27-year-old schoolteacher from Clay County, Indiana, was executed by a 20-man firing squad. After his capture by Confederates at Richmond, Kentucky, Gay declared {{allegiance to the}} Confederate States of America to escape further army service. After his return to Indiana, Gay was convicted of treason and executed, but not before he apologized {{for what he had}} done. Other executions took place in 1864, when three bounty jumpers were executed at Burnside Barracks.|$|E
5|$|The north wing (now the Bishop's House) {{was added}} in the 15th century by Bishop Beckington, with further {{modifications}} in the 18th century, and in 1810 by Bishop Beadon. It was restored, divided, and the upper storey added by Benjamin Ferrey between 1846 and 1854. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1548, Bishop Barlow sold Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset the palace and grounds. These were recovered after the Duke's <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> 1552.|$|E
5|$|The {{personal}} {{reign of}} the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots (1561â€“67) eventually ended in civil war, deposition, imprisonment and <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> England. Her infant son James VI was crowned King of Scots in 1567. He was brought up as a Protestant, while the country was run {{by a series of}} regents. After he asserted his personal rule from 1583 he favoured doctrinal Calvinism, but also episcopacy.|$|E

5|$|The six {{judges of}} the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled {{unanimously}} that all {{issues raised by}} Abu-Jamal, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, were without merit. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for certiorari against that decision on October 4, 1999, enabling Ridge to sign a second death warrant on October 13, 1999. Its <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> turn was stayed as Abu-Jamal commenced his pursuit of federal habeas corpus review.|$|E
5|$|While Morton was in prison, his lands {{were given}} to his nephew, Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, but were granted to the Earl of Lennox after Morton's <b>execution.</b> <b>In</b> 1587, Lennox {{returned}} the Morton lands to Angus, who was now acknowledged as the 5th Earl of Morton. On Angus' death, in 1588, the earldom of Morton passed to another kinsman, William Douglas of Lochleven (d. 1606). William's son predeceased his father, but his widow, Jean Lyon, continued to live at Aberdour with her third husband, Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie (d. 1607).|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial <b>execution</b> <b>in</b> some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E

50|$|By the {{confirmed}} numbers, {{the rate}} of <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> China {{is higher than the}} United States and Pakistan, though Iran executes more prisoners per capita. The number of executions has dropped significantly since the Supreme Peopleâ€™s Court regained the power to review all death sentences in 2007; for instance, the Dui Hua Foundation estimates that China executed 12,000 people in 2002, 6,500 people in 2007, and roughly 2,400 in 2013 and 2014. Given conservative and variable estimates of <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> China, <b>executions</b> <b>in</b> China account for more than 58% in 2009 and 65% in 2010 of that worldwide.|$|R
