5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something <b>empirical</b> and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the <b>empirical</b> manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{sociologist}} {{and historian}} of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: {{the founding of}} sociology in Poland; his work in <b>empirical</b> sociology; and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between <b>empirical</b> sociology and more theoretical approaches; between objectivity and subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>empirical</b> {{rejection}} of the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. <b>Empirical</b> evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future spot rate is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating <b>empirical</b> failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future spot rate.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{represents the}} unbiasedness hypothesis, {{which states that}} the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot exchange rate. Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and spot rate to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future spot rate, is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both <b>empirical</b> support and <b>empirical</b> failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the <b>empirical</b> and logical, arguing that geometry was originally <b>empirical,</b> but Euclid constructed a logical, deductive theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the <b>empirical</b> copula {{can be seen}} as the <b>empirical</b> {{distribution}} of the rank transformed data.|$|E
25|$|A {{scientific}} theory {{cannot be}} more probable, {{in relation to}} the <b>empirical</b> evidence for it, than it is a priori, or in the absence of all <b>empirical</b> evidence.|$|E

25|$|Mathematics, {{which is}} {{classified}} as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the <b>empirical</b> sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to <b>empirical</b> sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than <b>empirical</b> methods. The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the <b>empirical</b> sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the <b>empirical</b> sciences. The formal sciences are essential {{in the formation of}} hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} have developed various eye-movement simulation models {{in order to}} support, explain, and guide <b>empirical</b> research (the studies that collect data from experiments on human reading behaviours). Computational models can help test existing hypothesis, and also generate further predictions for <b>empirical</b> research to investigate. Building a reading model based on <b>empirical</b> data allows researchers to inspect and manipulate various assumptions of cognitive processes within the model, {{and see how the}} interactions between these elements influence the simulated reading behaviours, and hence informs further <b>empirical</b> studies. On the other hand, <b>empirical</b> research in eye-movements using eye-tracking {{is one of the most}} delicate measurement of human behaviours, which serves as a productive test bed for computer models of cognition. Below is a brief summary of these reading models as classified by Nuthmann (2014).|$|E
25|$|Large {{synthetic}} {{traces of}} vectors and stationary time series {{can be generated}} using <b>empirical</b> copula while preserving the entire dependence structure of small datasets. Such <b>empirical</b> traces are useful in various simulation-based performance studies.|$|E
25|$|Brahman is {{the sole}} metaphysical truth in Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is true in {{epistemological}} and <b>empirical</b> sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is <b>empirical</b> truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both Vyavaharika (<b>empirical)</b> and Paramarthika (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics, {{first of}} all known as The Science of numbers which is {{classified}} in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the <b>empirical</b> sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to <b>empirical</b> sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than <b>empirical</b> methods.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all <b>empirical</b> thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different <b>empirical</b> thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable <b>empirical</b> thermometer can still support notions of <b>empirical,</b> non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The Tolman {{cone angle}} method assumes <b>empirical</b> bond data and defines the {{perimeter}} as the maximum possible circumscription of an idealized free-spinning substituent. In contrast, the solid-angle concept derives both bond length and the perimeter from <b>empirical</b> solid state crystal structures. There are advantages to each system.|$|E
25|$|Aftershocks {{rates and}} {{magnitudes}} follow several well-established <b>empirical</b> laws.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{had argued}} the <b>empirical</b> world {{is merely a}} complex of {{appearances}} whose existence and connection occur only in our representations. Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: “The world is my representation.” We do not draw <b>empirical</b> laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper stated it is {{insufficient}} to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from metaphysics, by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the <b>empirical</b> method, which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation. He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine <b>empirical,</b> nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing <b>empirical</b> evidence based on observation, on horoscopes and biographies, it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards. Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.|$|E

25|$|In <b>empirical</b> formulas, these {{proportions}} {{begin with}} a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the <b>empirical</b> formula of ethanol may be written C2H6O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number <b>empirical</b> formulas. An example is boron carbide, whose formula of CBn is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} criticism of <b>empirical</b> views of mathematics is {{approximately the same}} as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as <b>empirical</b> as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the <b>empirical</b> justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is incredibly central, {{and that it would be}} extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of biology {{can be seen}} as following an <b>empirical</b> tradition, favoring naturalism.|$|E
25|$|At {{the present}} stage of CFE theory development, it is {{important}} to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an <b>empirical</b> CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An <b>empirical</b> CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on voltage V.|$|E
25|$|The Baconian method {{introduced}} the <b>empirical</b> scientific method. Natural theology sought evidence in nature supporting Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{scholarship}} {{had inherited}} Aristotelian physics from the Greeks {{and during the}} Islamic Golden Age developed it further. However the Islamic world had a greater respect for knowledge gained from <b>empirical</b> observation, and believed {{that the universe is}} governed by a single set of laws. Their use of <b>empirical</b> observation {{led to the formation of}} crude forms of the scientific method.|$|E

25|$|Semi-empirical {{potentials}} {{make use}} of the matrix representation from quantum mechanics. However, the values of the matrix elements are found through <b>empirical</b> formulae that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals. The matrix is then diagonalized to determine the occupancy of the different atomic orbitals, and <b>empirical</b> formulae are used once again to determine the energy contributions of the orbitals.|$|E
25|$|Semi-empirical quantum {{chemistry}} methods {{are based on}} the Hartree–Fock method formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from <b>empirical</b> data. They are very important in computational chemistry for treating large molecules where the full Hartree–Fock method without the approximations is too costly. The use of <b>empirical</b> parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other {{sciences}}, {{the formal}} sciences are {{not concerned with}} the validity of theories based on observations {{in the real world}} (<b>empirical</b> knowledge), but rather with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of scientific models dealing with observable reality, and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the <b>empirical</b> sciences.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} mystical experience {{has shifted from}} an experiential, privatized and perennialist approach to a contextual and <b>empirical</b> approach. The experientalist approach sees mystical experience as a private expression of perennial truths, separate from its historical and cultural context. The contextual approach, which also includes constructionism and attribution theory, {{takes into account the}} historical and cultural context. Neurological research takes an <b>empirical</b> approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} the {{psychological}} propensities {{for male and female}} entrepreneurs are more similar than different. <b>Empirical</b> studies suggest that female entrepreneurs possess strong negotiating skills and consensus-forming abilities. Asa Hansson, who looked at <b>empirical</b> evidence from Sweden, found that the probability of becoming self-employed decreases with age for women, but increases with age for men. She also found that marriage increased the probability of a person becoming an entrepreneur.|$|E
