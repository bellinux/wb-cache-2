40|$|An acidic {{intravenous}} {{source of}} phosphorus (Addiphos) was compared with <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> in 25 preterm infants to study acid-base state. Eight infants were given either Addiphos or <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> alternately for 48 hour periods and similar amounts of calcium and phosphorus were delivered. There {{were no significant}} differences in calcium and phosphorus intake, calcium and phosphate plasma concentrations, or acid-base state between study periods on the two solutions. Seventeen infants were given the two solutions alternately for 72 hour periods; Addiphos was used to increase the amounts of calcium and phosphorus being delivered. Calcium and phosphorus intake was decreased on <b>dipotassium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate,</b> but Addiphos significantly increased calcium and phosphorus intake and plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations. It also lowered the pH of the urine and raised the titratable acidity. Acid-base state, however, was not significantly different.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the crystal growth of strontium phosphates via different methods due to the bioactivity and biocompatibility of these materials with bone tissue. Here, we use a biomimetic method to synthesize strontium hydrogen phosphate/gelatin composites via single diffusion in gelatin. We compare the composite crystals with analytical-grade strontium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> using infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis, and X-ray diffraction.
