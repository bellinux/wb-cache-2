This refers to each Nebraska school district 2 ̆ 7 s standards accountability and reporting process. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the perceptions of Nebraska second <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> (a non-reporting <b>grade</b> for state accountability) with the perceptions of Nebraska fourth <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> (a reporting <b>grade</b> for state accountability) regarding the effects of STARS on school improvement. The study was not intended to provide a judgment on the effectiveness of the STARS process. In fact, the perceptions studied would be relevant to any accountability system that included some grades and not others for reporting. ^ This quantitative study surveyed public school teachers in Nebraska second and fourth grades. The research questions investigated if there was a difference in perceptions of second <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> and fourth <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> as to whether or not the implementation of the STARS process has impacted the following school improvement practices: student achievement, improved school curriculum, improved school climate, improved classroom instruction, improved assessment practice, improved image of the teaching profession. ^ The results of the study found no statistically significant differences between the responses of the second <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> and the fourth <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> in the research questions. Teachers responding to the survey perceive STARS as a component of school improvement. The response to the research questions would indicate that a common perception of STARS might not be universal in all classrooms, buildings, or districts. The findings of this study would indicate STARS has caused teachers to perceive accountability as a school improvement practice. ...|$|R

Effects of teaching experience and educational background were examined. The Transitional Curriculum Questionnaire for Teachers was developed by the researcher and mailed to 189 elementary schools with transitional classrooms. Respondents included 156 kindergarten <b>teachers,</b> 104 transitional <b>grade</b> <b>teachers,</b> and 263 first <b>grade</b> <b>teachers.</b> The majority of the teachers reported educational backgrounds in elementary education. Teaching experience ranged from 1 to 44 years. Through the use of a checklist, responding teachers identified goals, content, learning activities, and evaluation procedures which they considered "important" for a transitional program. A chi-square test at the. 05 level of significance was used to analyze the data. Results 1. Kindergarten <b>teachers,</b> transitional <b>grade</b> <b>teachers,</b> and first <b>grade</b> <b>teachers</b> agreed on the importance of 10 of the 16 goals, 6 of the 16 content areas, 6 of the 16 learning activities, and 11 of the 16 evaluation procedures for a transitional program. 2. Teachers with backgrounds in early childhood education and teachers with backgrounds in elementary education agreed on the importance of all 16 goals, 14 of the 16 content areas, 13 of the 16 learning activities, and all 16 evaluation procedures for a transitional program. 3.

25|$|The defense {{arguments}} {{began on}} October 20 with Barbra Schultz, the hotel's General Manager, taking the stand. Tinker asked if Selena had actually screamed {{out to them}} to lock the doors. She replied that Selena had never asked for the doors to be locked and was only moaning on the floor. Schultz further stated that her former employee, Vela, was not trustworthy. Schultz also said that all the employees began formulating different opinions on what happened on March 31 when the prosecution called on them to testify. Motel staff maid, Gloria Magaña, doubted the validity of Espinoza and Martinez's accounts. She told the jury {{that it was impossible}} for both employees to have seen Saldívar chasing Selena because their work {{was on the other side}} of the motel building. Magaña claimed to have seen Selena running through the parking lot, but did not see Saldívar chasing after her. Tinker called Marilyn Greer, Selena's seventh <b>grade</b> <b>teacher,</b> to the stand. She told the jury that Selena had had the ability to graduate with honors and could have easily obtained a college scholarship. Greer then spoke about how Quintanilla, Jr. had taken away the possibility of college for Selena, wasting her youth by forcing her to sing at nightclubs and bars for money; something that was unhealthy for a thirteen-year-old girl.|$|E
