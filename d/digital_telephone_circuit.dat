40|$|Abstract-A maximum-likelihood {{sequence}} estimator for {{a digital}} pulse-amplitude-modulated sequence {{in the presence}} of finite intersymbol interference and white Gaussian noise is developed. The structure cbm-prises a sampled linear filter, called a whitened matched filter, and a recursive nonlinear processor, called the Viterbi algorithm. The outputs of the whitened matched filter, sampled once for each input symbol, are shown to form a set of suillcient statistics for estimation of the input sequence, a fact that makes obvious some earlier results on optimum linear processors. The Viterbi algorithm is easier to implement than earlier optimum nonlinear processors and its performance can be straight-forwardly and accurately estimated. It is shown that performance (by whatever criterion) is effectively as good as could be attained by any receiver structure and in many cases is as good as if intersymbol inter-ference were absent. Finally, a simplified but effectively optimum algorithm suitable for the most popular partial-response schemes is described. G. DAVID FORNEY, JR., MEMBER, IEEE is corrupted by white Gaussian noise n(t) to give a received signal r(t) = s(t) + n(t). (2) In this paper we shall restrict ourselves to finite impulse responses h(t). This model dates back to Nyquist and is so simple that it would seem unlikely that at this late date anything new could be said about it. However, no serious attention seems to have been given to this problem until the last decade, when practical requirements for high-speed <b>digital</b> transmission over <b>telephone</b> <b>circuits</b> have begun to become important.
