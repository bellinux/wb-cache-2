40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cancer detection rate and the pathologic findings of biopsy in men at low and intermediate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in an Asian population. Methods: Patients between 40 and 79 years were entered into a study and 755 patients with serum PSA level of 2. 0 – 10. 0 ng/ml underwent trus-guided systematic biopsy. Patients were divided to low (PSA 2. 0 – 4. 0 ng/ml, n = 144) and intermediate (PSA 4. 1 – 10. 0 ng/ml, n = 611) PSA groups. Results: Patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low <b>PSA</b> group had significantly smaller prostates (P = 0. 003) and lower PSA density (P < 0. 001). The rate of cancer detection was 16. 7 % (24 of 144) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low <b>PSA</b> group and 23. 7 % (145 of 611) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intermediate <b>PSA</b> group (P = 0. 067). In men with normal digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate cancer was diagnosed in 14 (13. 3 %) of <b>the</b> 105 men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low <b>PSA</b> group and 99 (19. 5 %) of <b>the</b> 508 men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intermediate <b>PSA</b> group (P = 0. 139). In all patients and patients with normal DRE, no statistically significant differences were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathologic findings of biopsy between the two groups. Conclusions: Our findings provide a rationale to recommend prostate biopsy at lower PSA threshold in this population. At present, however, it is not clear that men who are treated when their cancers are detected at lower PSA levels have better outcomes than those who are treated when <b>the</b> <b>PSA</b> is higher than 4. 0 ng/ml.
