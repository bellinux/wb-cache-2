40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the macular morphologic features that correlate best with visual outcome in eyes with surgically closed idiopathic macular hole. Methods: Transversal observational case series of 24 eyes (22 subjects) imaged postoperatively using high-resolution Fourier domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FDOCT). Total and <b>inner</b> macular <b>volume</b> for central 3 mm area, central foveal thickness, and size of foveal inner segment-outer segment junction abnormality were correlated with bestcorrected visual acuity. Microperimetry (MP- 1) test was performed in a subset of 18 eyes. Results: Mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 36 (range, 20 / 25 - 20 / 70). Postoperative follow-up mean was 32. 97 ± 24. 68 months (range, 5 - 96 months). Eighteen eyes underwent internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling. Among FD-OCT parameters, logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity and mean total microperimetry- 1 sensitivity correlated best with <b>inner</b> macular <b>volume</b> in all eyes and ILMpeeled eyes (P < 0. 05). Macular surface irregularities were noted in 12 eyes (66. 7 %) with ILM peeling but in none of the non-ILM-peeled eyes (P = 0. 02). No significant correlation was found between microperimetry- 1 sensitivity and other FD-OCT parameters. Conclusion: Because <b>inner</b> macular <b>volume</b> strongly correlated with visual outcome in eyes with surgically closed macular hole, the possible effect of ILM peeling on visual outcome needs to be further investigated. © by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc...|$|R

50|$|The {{detector}} {{allows for}} a full 3-D position determination of the particle interaction. Electrons in liquid xenon have a uniform drift velocity. This allows the interaction depth of the event {{to be determined by}} measuring the time delay between the S1 and S2 signal.

The full 3-D position allows for the fiducialization of the detector, in which a low-background region is defined in the <b>inner</b> <b>volume</b> of the TPC. This fiducial volume has a greatly reduced rate of background events as compared to regions of the detector {{at the edge of the}} TPC, due to the self-shielding properties of liquid xenon.

50|$|Drug {{delivery}} is {{a rapidly growing}} area that is now taking advantage of nanotube technology. Systems being used currently for drug delivery include dendrimers, polymers, and liposomes, but carbon nanotubes present {{the opportunity to work}} with effective structures that have high drug loading capacities and good cell penetration qualities. These nanotubes function with a larger <b>inner</b> <b>volume</b> to be used as the drug container, large aspect ratios for numerous functionalization attachments, and the ability to be readily taken up by the cell. Because of their tube structure, carbon nanotubes can be made with or without end caps, meaning that without end caps the inside where the drug is held would be more accessible. Right now with carbon nanotube drug delivery systems, problems arise like the lack of solubility, clumping occurrences, and half-life. However, these are all issues that are currently being addressed and altered for further advancements in the carbon nanotube field. The advantages of carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for drug delivery remain where cell uptake of these structures was demonstrated efficiently where the effects were prominent, showing the particular nanotubes can be less harmful as nenovehicles for drugs. Also, drug encapsulation has been shown to enhance water dispersibility, better bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. Encapsulation of molecules also provides a material storage application as well as protection and controlled release of loaded molecules. All of these result in a good drug delivery basis where further research and understanding could improve upon numerous other advancements, like increased water solubility, decreased toxicity, sustained half-life, increased cell penetration and uptake, all of which are currently novel but undeveloped ideas.|$|E
