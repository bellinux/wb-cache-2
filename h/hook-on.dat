60|$|The {{surface of}} the waters was a sheet of glancing foam, while the air {{was filled with the}} blended sounds of the wash of the element, and the roar of the winds. Still there was nothing {{chilling}} or repulsive in the temperature of the air, which was charged with the freshness of the sea, and was bracing and animating, bringing with it the flavour that a seaman loves. After fully fifteen minutes' severe tugging at the oars, the barge drew near enough to permit the black mass of the CÃ¦sar to be seen. For some time, Lord Geoffrey, who had seated himself at the tiller,--yoke-lines were not used a century since,--steered by the top-light of the rear-admiral; but now the maze of hamper was seen waving slowly to and fro in the lurid heavens, and the huge hull became visible, heaving and setting, as if the ocean groaned with the labour of lifting such a pile of wood and iron. A light gleamed from the cabin-windows, and ever and anon, one glanced athwart an open gun-room port. In all other respects, the ship presented but one hue of blackness. Nor was it an easy undertaking, even after the barge was under the lee of the ship, for those in it, to quit its uneasy support and get a firm footing on the cleets that lined the vessel's side like a ladder. This was done, however, and all ascended to the deck but two of the crew, who remained to <b>hook-on</b> the yard and stay-tackles. This effected, the shrill whistle gave the word, and that large boat, built to carry at need some twenty souls, was raised from the raging water, as it were by some gigantic effort of the ship herself, and safely deposited in her bosom.|$|E
50|$|Soon thereafter, Akron {{returned}} to Lakehurst for local operations which were {{interrupted by a}} two-week overhaul and poor weather. In March, she carried out intensive training with an aviation unit of F9C-2s, honing <b>hook-on</b> skills. During the course of these operations, an overfly of Washington DC was made 4 March 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt first took {{the oath of office}} as President of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The D-1 {{burned the}} day of its first flight in the Goodyear hangar at Wingfoot Lake, Ohio. The D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5 were {{transferred}} to the United States Army which the Air Ship Board had given the primary role of operating non-rigid airships after World War I. D-3 participated as an observation and photography aircraft at the famed [...] "Mitchell" [...] bombing test of 1921. D-3 also participated in the Mitchell bombing trials and tested experimental mooring masts. D-3 also participated in early [...] "hook-on" [...] experiments {{to see if it}} was possible for an airplane to fly up to and hook onto a trapeze hanging from an airship. No actual <b>hook-ons</b> were achieved, but approaches were practiced. D-4 also participated in the Mitchell trials, for observation and photography. The D-5 was never operated by the Army with that designation. After the loss of D-2, the D-5 was erected with more powerful 180 hp Wright V engines and flown as the D-2 (no. 2) D-2 (no 2 is a designation created by historian James Shock, never used by the Army). There is no evidence the airship flew for the Army with the designation [...] "D-5". D-5 is believed to have been renumbered [...] "D-2" [...] after the loss of that airship.|$|R

40|$|In {{the photo}} at bottom right, a U. S. Park Police officer is demonstrating a {{battery-powered}} communications system, sufficiently compact to be packed in a briefcase-size container, which can {{send and receive}} signals over great distances by means of satellite relay. Key to the system's efficacy is the high-powered transmitting and receiving equipment aboard such NASA satellites as the Applications Technology Satellite 6 (ATS- 6) and the joint U. S. -Canadian Communications Technology Satellite (CTS); this enables the briefcase communicator to pick up satellite-relayed signals {{by means of the}} small <b>hook-on</b> antenna shown instead of the more elaborate-ground equipment customarily needed. Developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the communicator is intended for use in emergency situations. It has utility, for example, in disasters, such as floods and hurricanes, where power failure disrupts conventional communications; for on-the-spot transmissions from major accident sites; or in remote areas where no other means of communication exist...|$|E
40|$|The {{adenovirus}} single-stranded DNA binding protein (Ad DBP) is a multifunctional protein required, amongst other things, for DNA replication and transcription control. It binds to single- and double-stranded DNA, {{as well as}} to RNA, in a sequence-independent manner. Like other single-stranded DNA binding proteins, it binds ssDNA, cooperatively. We {{report the}} crystal structure, at 2. 6 A resolution, of the nucleic acid binding domain. This domain is active in DNA replication. The protein contains two zinc atoms in different, novel coordinations. The zinc atoms appear to be required for the stability of the protein fold rather than being involved in direct contacts with the DNA. The crystal structure shows that the protein contains a 17 amino acid C-terminal extension which hooks onto a second molecule, thereby forming a protein chain. Deletion of this C-terminal arm reduces cooperativity in DNA binding, suggesting a <b>hook-on</b> model for cooperativity. Based on this structural work and mutant studies, we propose that DBP forms a protein core around which the single-stranded DNA winds...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} how vehicle features contribute to CRS installation errors. Thirty-two subjects were recruited based on their education level (low or high) and experience with installing CRS (none or experienced). Each subject was asked to perform four child restraint installations in three vehicles. Each subject first performed a CRS installation with a seatbelt in one vehicle, followed by three CRS installations using LATCH, one in each of three vehicles. One child restraint with a <b>hook-on</b> LATCH connector and one with a push-on LATCH connector were used. All installations were forward-facing, using an 18 -month-old CRABI anthropomorphic test device (ATD). Six vehicles were used in testing, with half of subjects testing with each vehicle. Conditions were selected to provide a range of LATCH locations (visible, above seating surface, buried in bight), buckle stalk types (webbing vs. rigid), and tether locations (package shelf vs. seatback). After each installation, the experimenter evaluated 28 factors for each installation (such as tightness of installation, tether tightness, and LATCH belt attached correctly). Analyses used linear mixed models to identify the CRS installation outcomes associated with vehicle features. For LATCH installations, vehicles requiring higher forces to attach connectors to lower anchorages {{were more likely to}} be attached incorrectly. Vehicle seats with a bightline waterfall (which places the lower anchorage above the seating surface) increased rates of tight CRS installation for both seatbelt and LATCH installs. Seatbelt installations were tight (and locked) more frequently when the buckle stalk was located close to the bight rather than further forward. Subjects used the tether correctly in 30 % of installations. Subjects used the tether more frequently during LATCH installations compared to seatbelt installations. The tether was used more frequently in sedans (with anchorage locations on the package shelf) than in vehicles with the tether anchorage located on the seatback. However, when the tether was used, it was routed correctly more often in vehicles with the tether anchorage on the seatback. A tether wrap around distance of 210 mm was sufficient to allow tightening of the tether with the two CRS tested, but additional testing showed that 5 / 16 CRS could not be tightened sufficiently with this wrap around distance. Installation time decreased with successive trials, but installation time was longer when subjects used the vehicle or CRS manuals. Subjects used the vehicle manual in 38 % of installations, and were more likely to do so when the tether anchorage was located on the vehicle seatback. Subjects used the CRS manual in 88 % of installations. In questionnaire responses, subjects indicated that the head restraints affected installations, and vehicle manuals varied in their ease of understanding. They also noted that tether anchorages on seatbacks were more difficult to locate than those on the package shelf. Results from this study do not fully support SAE and ISO recommendations for LATCH usability in vehicles. Recommendations ar...|$|E
