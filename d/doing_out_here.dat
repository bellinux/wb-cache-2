[...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E

In spite of Tippoo's vauntings, they will have Mysore before many years are over. The Sultan seems to have forgotten the lesson they taught him, {{six or seven years}} back.

5000|$|Ormond was {{involved}} in a notable piece of sledging; when, in a Test match against Australia in 2001, Mark Waugh asked him, [...] "Mate, what are you <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>here?</b> There's no way you're good enough to play for England." [...] Ormond replied [...] "Maybe not, but at least I'm the best player in my own family", a reference to Waugh's brother Steve, who was the captain of the Australian team.|$|E
5000|$|The encores {{began with}} Springsteen's {{signature}} song, [...] "Born to Run", recast completely, slowly played solo by Springsteen on acoustic guitar and harmonica {{and with a}} melancholy feel, albeit with the band standing behind him, sometimes with an audience sing-along of [...] "whoa-whoa's" [...] at the end. Springsteen prefaced these performances with an introduction {{along the same lines}} every night: [...] "Before we came out on tour, I was sitting around home trying to decide what we were gonna be <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> this time. What I felt I wanted to sing and say to you." [...] After detailing how he came to write [...] "Born to Run" [...] {{a decade and a half}} earlier, he would say that its overt theme of escapism had concealed a deeper search for connection and for a place its protagonists could call home. That, now, to Springsteen meant a place deep within oneself. [...] He concluded by saying, [...] "I wanna do this song tonight for all of you, wishing with all my heart that you have a safe trip to home." ...|$|E
5000|$|David Nathan of Soulmusic.com also {{reviewed}} the album. [...] "Fortunately, the year 2004 {{brought about a}} change: the release of father Donny’s “These Songs For You, Live” (which I had the honor of producing along with my good friend A. Scott Galloway) was an omen of things to come. Some months later came “Outrun The Sky” and says Lalah, “I’ve {{been trying to make}} a record for ten years and no matter how many people buy it, it’s already a success for me. I recorded it for the people who love my music and who love my Daddy so whatever happens now, it’s all a bonus. You see, I’ve been blessed {{to be able to play}} with people like the late Grover Washington Jr. and Joe Sample even without having a record out there myself. That’s what kept me going as a musician, reminding me of what I’m supposed to be <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> <b>here.</b> And I’ve always been very blessed: my peers have always been very complimentary so it’s never been a question for me and I know music is my life’s purpose. It’s in my blood.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The non-interference {{directive}} {{seems to}} have originated with the Vulcans. In Star Trek: First Contact, it is stated that but for Zefram Cochrane's historic warp flight, a passing Vulcan ship would have deemed Earth unready for contact and ignored the planet, and in the Enterprise episode [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] T'Pol makes reference to a Vulcan policy of non-interference. However, the policy was not implemented immediately, and did not exist on pre-Federation Earth: in the Enterprise episode [...] "Civilization", Charles [...] "Trip" [...] Tucker III notes that the prohibition is a Vulcan policy, not human. In another episode, [...] "Dear Doctor", Jonathan Archer says [...] "Some day, my people are gonna {{come up with some}} sort of a doctrine, something that says what we can and can't <b>do</b> <b>out</b> <b>here,</b> should and shouldn't do. But until someone tells me that they've drafted that directive, I'm gonna have to remind myself every day that we didn't come <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to play God." ...|$|R

The girl, unconscious of his stealthy regalement, was letting her clear eyes rest, in turn, on each figure that passed, on the movements of birds and dogs, watching the sunlight glisten on the grass, burnish the copper beeches, the lime-trees, and those tall poplars down there by the water. The doctor at Mildenham, once consulted on a bout of headache, had called her eyes [...] "perfect organs," [...] and certainly no eyes could take things in more swiftly or completely. She was attractive to dogs, {{and every now and}} then one would stop, in two minds whether or no to put his nose into this foreign girl's hand. From a flirtation of eyes with a great Dane, she looked up and saw Fiorsen passing, in company with a shorter, square man, having very fashionable trousers and a corseted waist. The violinist's tall, thin, loping figure was tightly buttoned into a brownish-grey frock-coat suit; he wore a rather broad-brimmed, grey, velvety hat; in his buttonhole was a white flower; his cloth-topped boots were of patent leather; his tie was bunched out at the ends over a soft white-linen shirt--altogether quite a dandy! His most strange eyes suddenly swept down on hers, and he made a movement as if to put his hand to his hat.|$|R
