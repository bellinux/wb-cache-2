5000|$|The Pantah {{was first}} {{shown at the}} Milan Bike Show in December 1979. The {{prototype}} was different again to Ducati’s earlier bikes: it had a trellis <b>frame,</b> with the <b>suspended</b> <b>motor</b> acting as a stressed member, and the swingarm pivoted on {{the rear of the}} crankcase. The single overhead camshaft was driven by toothed rubber belt and primary transmission was via Morse chain [...] The front disc brake was a Campagnolo Hydroconico. The Pantah's performance was impressive: 500 cc, 50 hp (36.5 kW) @ 8500 rpm, 180 kg, 1450 mm of wheelbase, significantly better from the earlier bevel-head V twins which were too long, bulky and stable for racing. The Pantah's performance easily surpassed that of the ill-conceived 1976 parallel twins.|$|R

50|$|After {{the first}} {{production}} hall was completed there in 1954, the company headquarters {{were moved to}} the Etzelstrasse in Bietigheim (now Bietigheim-Bissingen). In 1955, the first mobile suction pump came onto the market. The pump provides more ergonomic working for the dentist. From 1956, oil-lubricated compressors were produced. The offer was expanded by small treatment units as well as polishing and <b>suspended</b> <b>motors</b> from 1957. Gechinger Motoren Werke (now Dürr Optronik) was founded in 1959 as the production facility for motors, assemblies and devices in the Swabian Gechingen in Calw in the Schwarzwald.|$|R
40|$|Space mission {{requirements}} for the 70 's have established a 50, 000 -hour-lifetime challenge for the mechanisms designer. This challenge may be met by two approaches: (1) development of new materials for wear-prone elements, and (2) design innovation of new electromechanical devices that do not include mechanical wear-prone components. Present state-of-the-art materials require restricted operation regarding load, speed, and power for gears, bearings, and brush-slipring components. These restrictions are discussed, and methods of improvement are suggested. The design-innovations approach is discussed and {{is illustrated by the}} design of an experimental magnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} monomotor bogies, each {{powered by a}} {{longitudinally}} <b>suspended</b> <b>motor</b> driving both axles. The power supply is 750 volts DC from overhead lines using a pantograph (the Brecknell Willis High Reach pantograph). Speed is controlled from the cab by a joystick controller with a which must be continually held in place to keep the track brakes off. No other vigilance control is fitted, because of the perceived safety {{of a system of}} street-running trams. Drivers are seated on sprung seats for comfort and a PA system allows them to communicate with passengers.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel {{integrated}} {{structure is}} proposed {{in order to}} reduce the axial length of the high speed of a magnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>motor</b> (HSMSM) to ensure the maximum speed, which combines radial displacement sensor probes and the permanent magnet biased radial magnetic bearing in HSMSM. The sensor probes are integrated in the magnetic bearing, and the sensor preamplifiers are placed in the control system of the HSMSM, separate from the sensor probes. The proposed integrated structure can save space in HSMSMs, improve the working frequency, reduce the influence of temperature on the sensor circuit, and improve the stability of HSMSMs...|$|R
50|$|Palanquins vary in {{size and}} grandeur. The {{smallest}} and simplest, a cot or <b>frame</b> <b>suspended</b> by the four corners from a bamboo pole and borne by two bearers, is called a doli. Larger palanquins are rectangular wooden boxes eight feet long, four feet wide, and four feet high, with openings on either side screened by curtains or shutters. Interiors are furnished with bedding and pillows. Ornamentation reflects the social status of the traveller. The most ornate palanquins have lacquer paintwork and cast bronze finials {{at the ends of}} the poles. Designs include foliage, animals, and geometric patterns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} for {{reducing}} unspring mass as well as improving safety and ride properties of vehicles driven by in-wheel motors will be provided. To begin with, the advantages of vehicles armed with in-wheel motors will be described, after which some drawbacks of this idea will be studied. Then, to getting a better analysis, quarter car model will be studied in frequency domain. Gain of body acceleration and wheel dynamic load, which can be equal to ride property and safety performance respectively, will be compared. Finally, an idea that makes the drive <b>motor</b> <b>suspend</b> will be proposed for enhancing the two properties and then a LQG controller will be provided for further optimization. Through the comparison in time domain and frequency domain, one can {{come to a conclusion}} that vehicles driven by <b>suspended</b> <b>motors</b> not only simplified the structures but also can be used as an absorber for vibration reduction...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{disturbances}} of the machine tool frame is caused by operation of motion axis. Movement of high dynamic motion axis is connected with powerful force strokes that excite machine tool frame vibration and deteriorate machining surface quality and productivity. There are several possibilities how to suppress this vibration. One possibility is to use <b>suspended</b> <b>motor,</b> where the motor is connected with the machine body by spring and damper. This paper deals with new more advanced conception where the main motor is connected with the frame by an active element, that is controlled by intelligent control technique. The active element represents another linear motor, therefore the conception is shortly called “motor on motor”...|$|R

50|$|The {{assembly}} hall formed {{the heart of}} the building - it was enclosed by offices, cloakrooms and toilets on the ground floor, with teaching rooms above. This unit was linked to a science block and a handicraft block with the gymnasium added later. The building has an exposed reinforced concrete <b>frame.</b> <b>Suspended</b> floors have prestressed concrete beams with foam slag infill panels. Roofs were timber units with cork and three layers of felt. The windows had varnished Columbian pine frames with metal projector opening lights.

50|$|Another {{recently}} built {{building is}} East Croydon station, {{one of the}} busiest in Greater London. The present East Croydon station building was opened on 19 August 1992. It consists of a large steel and glass <b>frame</b> <b>suspended</b> from a lightweight steel structure that straddles the track and platforms to a much greater extent than was possible with its Victorian predecessor. Four steel ladder masts anchor the glass box and the whole gives the impression of a suspension bridge that stretches into the distance. External canopies cover the entrances, a cafes open-air seating area and the approaches to the tram station. 440 m² of glass were used in the roof and 800 m² for the wall glazing. The architects were Alan Brookes Associates, who also made the close by NLA Tower, and the structural engineers YRM Anthony Hunt Associates.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The bogie {{technology}} of the 350 km/h EMU train {{is one of the}} key parts for China high speed railways. Through analysis of the high speed bogy for CRH 3 EMU train, the design conceptions and methodologies of the bogy structure and suspension systems are better understood. Technical procedures for the bogie design are carefully investigated, which includes the wheel/rail interaction, helical spring and high property rubber pad used in primary suspension, high flexible and large convolution bellows type air spring, anti-roll bar and two point control of air springs used in secondary suspension, and the elastic <b>frame</b> <b>suspended</b> structure used for traction motor. Comparison between different bogy techniques are carried out by using the dynamic simulation, roller rig test and field test, and the efficient way to raise the bogie running safety and reliability is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the control and}} ergonomic evaluation of a ceiling mounted (or support <b>frame</b> <b>suspended)</b> 7 -axis surgical robot (HISAR) for laparoscopic camera navigation. A key feature of the robot is that it incorporates a passive wrist for natural compliance with the port of entry into the patient. The use of a previously reported constrained Cartesian controller is motivated and demonstrated, {{and the results of}} successfuIly applying this control methodology to the manipulator are presented. The significance of the control strategy is the ease with which control of passive axes, the fulcrum constraint, and the motion inversion effect created by the fulcrum are accommodated. We also report on the results of laboratory evaluations of the arm in terms of its work volume, ergonomic factors, ease of control, and overall design within the context of laparoscopic camera control. ...|$|R
