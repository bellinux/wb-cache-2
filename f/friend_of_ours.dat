500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours,</b> we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{thing that}} makes it {{resemble}} our earlier records, especially our first record, is that it's really personal. A couple of us have gone through some pretty serious life changes. We had a good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours</b> pass away since the last record. There's a song on the record, [...] "Dorothy", that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it's a metaphor for someone and something else. Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us {{and we tried to}} communicate that in the songs.|$|E
2500|$|We made [...] (in 10 days) {{and before}} it was even released, our label had started getting radio airplay for [...] "Disconnected." [...] It was on an EP we called Over It that Victory Music had put out to [...] "test" [...] the waters. Since the song was really working at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours</b> at the label called me one day and politely {{let me know that}} we were making a lot of mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to get off of Victory Music.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, we {{did have}} a little conversation, {{hypothetical}} of course, about some <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours</b> who found themselves similarly situated, and I regret to say without result." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Egyptian {{government}} had given PLO officials in Tunisia 48 hours {{to take control}} of the four hijackers by Egypt. Arafat had told the Egyptians that he needed time to find a nation that they could take the four for trial. If the PLO couldn't find a cooperative nation, Egypt would release the men or turn them over to Italy. The PLO did not feel anxious about the agreement, one of its officials saying [...] "Italy is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours,</b> so it's no problem." [...] The PLO also asserted that the four were not PLO members but only a part of the PLF. Some in the International community, such as the USA, held that this was a common tactic by Arafat. Holding that when one of the PLO's constituent groups committed an act of violence, he would claim that the group was rebelling from PLO control and beyond his control or influence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} the {{negative}} reviews was written by William Hazlitt, literary critic and Romantic writer. He reviewed the collection of poems for the 2 June 1816 Examiner, and, in his analysis, he attacked the fragmentary {{nature of the work}} and argued, [...] "The fault of Mr Coleridge is, that he comes to no conclusion ... from an excess of capacity, he does little or nothing" [...] and that the poem revealed that [...] "Mr Coleridge can write better nonsense verse than any man in English." [...] In conclusion, Hazlitt admitted, [...] "We could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing the meaning of them." [...] Following in the June 1816 Eclectic Review, Josiah Conder dismissed the poem: [...] "As to 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Pains of Sleep', we can only regret the publication of them, as affording a proof that the Author over-rates the importance of his name. With regard to the former, which is professedly published as a psychological curiosity, it having been composed during sleep, there appears to us nothing in the quality of the lines to render this circumstance extraordinary." [...] He then continued by focusing on {{the manner in which the}} poem was composed, 'We could have informed Mr. Coleridge of a reverend <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>ours,</b> who actually wrote down two sermons on a passage in the Apocalypse, from the recollection of the spontaneous exercise of his faculties in sleep. To persons who are in the habit of poetical composition, a similar phenomenon would not be a stranger occurrence, than the spirited dialogues in prose which take place in dreams of persons of duller invention than our poet, and which not unfrequently leave behind a very vivid impression." ...|$|E
