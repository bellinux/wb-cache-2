40|$|In Europe {{almost all}} {{countries}} have implemented {{some form of}} e-government, {{not to mention the}} UK and Norway which are now both well into their sixth year of e-government implementation. These six years have seen various strategic plans formulated, implemented and also intermittently postponed in the two countries. Although time may result in the amplification of e-government experience for Norway and the UK, the postponement of <b>implementation</b> <b>deadlines</b> indicates that not only political and social issues, but also strategic and organisational issues need to be addressed when formulating plans for deploying e-government. Using empirical research this paper examines the strategies adopted by the UK and Norway in the context of aligning central and local government plans for implementing e-government services. While technical, political and social issues are considered as key areas to be addressed in any e-government exploitation plan; this paper examines how different perspectives on e-government definition, strategy, awareness and related organisational change influence implementation. The need to align central and local e-government plans, guidelines for local level implementation, user centred solutions, strong leadership and a common understanding of the definition of e-government are highlighted in the paper as some of the key components of good e-government implementation practice. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{hypermedia}} systems, links {{are used}} to connect related information in different types of media, for example: text, images, sound, etc. In this way, authors and users have means of accessing the information in a non-sequential manner, {{in the way they}} prefer, by following links that may be visualised as highlighted text or by other means. However, when simply following links while seeking information, users may become disoriented and frustrated at their lack of ability to find specific or useful pieces of information. This is why the integration of information-retrieval techniques into such systems makes sense. The search for information can then be as well satisfied by specifying an information-retrieval query. Some systems already show this integration between hypermedia and information-retrieval systems. However they are usually only capable of text retrieval (Frei et al, 1995) or, when they have real content based multimedia information-retrieval capabilities (Lewis et al., 1996), the efficiency and effectiveness are very low. To overcome this problem we have developed a hypermedia information-retrieval integration solution that uses automatically created text descriptors to achieve multimedia information-retrieval using text retrieval techniques (Dunlop et al., 1993). In this work, there were two main aspects under consideration: - The automatic creation of text descriptors for multimedia documents, using information taken from the hypermedia network both at the document level and the abstract classification level. The type of information considered as part of this process includes link types, link descriptions, link anchors, keywords and logical classification concepts. -The integration of open hypermedia systems, in this case the Microcosm system (Davis et al., 1992), with text information-retrieval tools to allow multimedia retrieval using text descriptors for non-text media. After the implementation of this solution we presented some results and conclusions about the effectiveness of such a system. Supported by the conclusions and after further suggestions found on research where navigation through concepts was possible (Crouch, 1989, Cunliffe, 1997) we then present the skeleton of a model. For this model major concern is placed on the integration between structure information from hypermedia and content information from information retrieval systems, both at the document level or at the abstract level of navigation. This will allow {{the creation of a new}} system where there is no clear distinction between navigation and querying, which ever the media is considered. <b>Implementation</b> <b>deadlines</b> and testing suggestions are given at the end before overall we point out some conclusions about the research that we develop...|$|R

40|$|Resource {{constraints}} {{are commonly}} found in classification tasks. For example, {{there could be a}} budget limit on <b>implementation</b> and a <b>deadline</b> for finishing the classification task. Applying the top-down approach for tree induction in this situation may have significant drawbacks. In particular, it is difficult, especially in an early stage of tree induction, to assess an attribute’s contribution to improving the total implementation cost and its impact on attribute selection in later stages because of the deadline constraint. To address this problem, we propose an innovative algorithm, namely, the Cost-Sensitive Associative Tree (CAT) algorithm. Essentially, the algorithm first extracts and retains association classification rules from the training data which satisfy resource constraints, and then uses the rules to construct the final decision tree. The approach has advantages over the traditional top-down approach, first because only feasible classification rules are considered in the tree induction and, second, because their costs and resource use are known. In contrast, in the top-down approach, the information is not available for selecting splitting attributes. The experiment results show that the CAT algorithm significantly outperforms the top-down approach and adapts very well to available resources.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to air traffic control (ATC) using an enhanced SIMD machine model called an Associative Processor (AP). Our solution differs from previous ATC systems that are designed for MIMD computers {{and have a great}} deal of difficulty meeting the predictability requirements for ATC, which are critical for meeting the strict certification standards required for safety critical software components. The proposed AP solution supports accurate predictions of worst case execution times and guarantees all deadlines are met. Furthermore, the software developed based on the AP model is much simpler and smaller in size than the current corresponding ATC software. As the associative processor is built from SIMD hardware, it is considerably cheaper and simpler than the MIMD hardware currently used to support ATC. We have designed a prototype for eight ATC real-time tasks on ClearSpeed CSX 600 accelerator that is used to emulate AP. Performance is evaluated in terms of execution time and predictability and is compared to the fastest host-only version implemented using OpenMP on an 8 -core multiprocessor (MIMD). Our extensive experiments show that the AP <b>implementation</b> meets all <b>deadlines</b> that can be statically scheduled.

40|$|This {{paper has}} two {{complementary}} focuses. The {{first is the}} system design and algorithmic development for air traffic control (ATC) using an associative SIMD processor (AP). The second is the comparison of this implementation with a multiprocessor implementation {{and the implications of}} these comparisons. This paper demonstrates how one application, ATC, can more easily, more simply, and more efficiently be implemented on an AP than is generally possible on other types of traditional hardware. The AP implementation of ATC will take advantage of its deterministic hardware to use static scheduling. The software will be dramatically smaller and cheaper to create and maintain. Likewise, a large AP system will be considerably simpler and cheaper than the MIMD hardware currently used. While APs were used for ATC-type applications earlier, these are no longer available. We use a Clear-Speed CSX 600 accelerator to emulate the AP solutions of ATC on an ATC prototype consisting of eight data-intensive ATC real-time tasks. Its performance is compared with an 8 -core multiprocessor (MP) using OpenMP. Our extensive experiments show that the AP <b>implementation</b> meets all <b>deadlines</b> while the MP will regularly miss a large number of deadlines. The AP code will be similar in size to sequential code for the same tasks and will avoid all of the additional support software needed with an MP to handle dynamic scheduling, load balancing, shared resource management, race conditions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{civil service}} reform in Ireland from independence to 2012. Following independence, inexperienced and over-burdened Ministers gave the civil service, which {{was dominated by}} the Department of Finance, considerable autonomy. This creation of an impartial civil service {{remains one of the}} great achievements of the Irish State. The thesis finds that progress on administrative reform has been uneven and limited due to a combination of lack of political will and obstacles within the administration. Efforts to reform the civil service began with the 1935 Brennan Commission, and continued with the Devlin Report, 1969. This work examines the challenges faced by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald and by John Boland, first Minister for the Public Service, in reforming the civil service. Later initiatives to reform the civil service are also analysed. The thesis finds that both political will and administrative support are required for administrative reform. Ireland’s economic collapse in 2008 transformed the approach to administrative reform through the Troika of the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. Administrative reform was a key element of the strategic response to economic crisis for the government which came to office in 2011. Reforms were therefore driven by external financiers who required that Ireland modernise its public administration. The establishment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011 highlighted this. Uniquely, this new department combined both expenditure and reform elements. Earlier lessons in relation to poor implementation of reform were learned, with a strong focus on implementation and delivery. The Public Service Reform Plan of November 2011 set out 70 recommendations and 200 actions across five areas. This plan emphasised ownership within departments, with dedicated reform teams working under a Cabinet committee. The plan also highlighted the importance of <b>implementation</b> with <b>deadlines,</b> dates and ownership. The Irish civil service made good progress in recent years in reducing costs, improving productivity, the online delivery of services, developing shared services and putting in place administrative reforms. By drawing on the lessons learned since independence, particularly from the most recent economic crisis, governments and policy-makers may be better prepared to implement future administrative reforms...|$|R

The TMDL strategy {{can be broken}} into two basic phases; first is the detailed calculation of a permissible load that will attain state water quality standards. Second is the creation and execution {{of a plan to}} achieve load reductions identified in phase 1. Currently, most states are focused on the first phase in order to meet court ordered <b>deadlines.</b> <b>Implementation</b> is usually deferred pending completion of the court’s decree, which will make more resources available for phase 2. However, determining TMDL targets has proved problematic in wildland forest environments when applied to non-point source pollutants such as sediment, because discerning between anthropogenic and natural sediment is difficult, and because a reliable quantification of instream loads is complex. Natural sediment discharge is highly variable as a result of various watershed interactions driven by stochastic disturbance events (fire, drought, flood, wind, insects, disease, and others). The expense of data collection needed to reliably establish numeric targets can easily exceed the cost of simply fixing the obvious problems. July 2004 Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] guidance states that where an existing regulatory program, such as watershed restoration and implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs), is expected to achieve water quality standards, a TMDL is not required (Category 4 B) (USEPA 2004 a).
