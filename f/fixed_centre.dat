60|$|There {{was much}} stir and commotion {{on the night}} of Thursday, January the 14th, 1874, in the Gideonite Apostolic Church, number 47, Walworth Lane, Peckham, S.E. Anybody could see at a glance that some {{important}} business was under consideration; for the Apostle was there himself, in his chair of presidency, and the twelve Episcops were there, and the forty-eight Presbyters, and a large and earnest gathering of the Gideonite laity. It was only a small bare school-room, fitted with wooden benches, was that headquarters station of the young Church; but you could not look around it once without seeing that its occupants were of the sort by whom great religious revolutions may be made or marred. For the Gideonites were one of those strange enthusiastic hole-and-corner sects that spring up naturally in the outlying suburbs of great thinking centres. They gather around the marked personality of some one ardent, vigorous, half-educated visionary; and they consist for the most part of intelligent, half-reasoning people, who are bold enough to cast overboard the dogmatic beliefs of their fathers, but not so bold as to exercise their logical faculty upon the fundamental basis on which the dogmas originally rested. The Gideonites had thus collected around the <b>fixed</b> <b>centre</b> of their Apostle, a retired attorney, Murgess by name, whose teaching commended itself to their groping reason as the pure outcome of faithful Biblical research; and they had chosen their name because, though they were but three hundred in number, they had full confidence that when the time came they would blow their trumpets, and all the host of Midian would be scattered before them. In fact, they divided the world generally into Gideonite and Midianite, for they knew that he that was not with them was against them. And no wonder, for the people of Peckham did not love the struggling Church. Its chief doctrine was one of absolute celibacy, like the Shakers of America; and to this doctrine the Church had testified in the Old Kent Road and elsewhere after a vigorous practical fashion that roused the spirit of South-eastern London into the fiercest opposition. The young men and maidens, said the Apostle, must no longer marry or be given in marriage; the wives and husbands must dwell asunder; and the earth must be made as an image of heaven. These were heterodox opinions, indeed, which South-eastern London could only receive with a strenuous counterblast of orthodox brickbats and sound Anglican road metal.|$|E
60|$|Every sun {{and every}} star thus formed is for ever {{gathering}} in the hem of its outer robe upon itself, for ever radiating off its light and heat into surrounding space, and for ever growing denser and colder as it sets slowly towards its centre of gravity. Our own sun and solar system may be taken as good typical working examples of how the stars thus constantly shrink into smaller and ever smaller dimensions around their own <b>fixed</b> <b>centre.</b> Naturally, we know more about our own solar system than about any other in our own universe, and it also possesses for us a greater practical and personal interest than any outside portion of the galaxy. Nobody can pretend to be profoundly immersed {{in the internal affairs}} of Sirius or of Alpha Centauri. A fiery revolution in the belt of Orion would affect us less than a passing finger-ache in a certain single terrestrial baby of our own household. Therefore I shall not apologise in any way for leaving the remainder of the sidereal universe to its unknown fate, and concentrating my attention mainly on the affairs of that solitary little, out-of-the-way, second-rate system, whereof we form an inappreciable portion. The matter which now composes the sun and its attendant bodies (the satellites included) was once spread out, according to Laplace, to at least the furthest orbit of the outermost planet--that is to say, so far as our present knowledge goes, the planet Neptune. Of course, when it was expanded to that immense distance, it must have been very thin indeed, thinner than our clumsy human senses can even conceive of. An American would say, too thin; but I put Americans out of court at once as mere irreverent scoffers. From the orbit of Neptune, or something outside it, the faint and cloud-like mass which bore within it Cæsar and his fortunes, not to mention the remainder of the earth and the solar system, began slowly to converge and gather itself in, growing denser and denser but smaller and smaller as it gradually neared its existing dimensions. How long a time it took to do it is for our present purpose relatively unimportant: the cruel physicists will only let us have a beggarly hundred million years or so for the process, while the grasping and extravagant evolutionary geologists beg with tears for at least double or even ten times that limited period. But at any rate it has taken a good long while, and, as far as most of us are personally concerned, the difference of one or two hundred millions, if it comes to that, is not really at all an appreciable one.|$|E

50|$|The fixed bogies {{which are}} used by most 100% low floor trams {{increase}} track wear and decrease {{the speed at which}} a tram can drive through a curve (usually 4 - 15 km/h in 20 m radius curve). The 15 T is designed to cope with these issues through Jacobs bogies under the articulations and pivoting bogies at the tram's ends. For a time it was said to be the only true 100% low floor tram with pivoting bogies in production. However, the Alstom Citadis X04, an experimental 100% low floor tram currently being developed with pivoting bogies (but with sections of high floor seating over the bogies), has made an initial production appearance as a modified Citadis 301 (with a <b>fixed</b> <b>centre</b> bogie) in Istanbul, and for Helsinki, a tram with similar interior solution and all pivoting bogies is undergoing trials as of 2015. With the same length of tramcar, the Škoda 15 T has also four bogies compared to the predecessor Škoda 14 T's three (same on most other 100% low floor trams) (fixed) bogies, which decreases the load each wheel puts on the track. The most of the tram floor is at height of 350 mm above rail; the height over the bogies is 450 mm above rail; the transition is inclined, without interior steps. The corridor above the central bogies is 700 mm wide. The bogies may be all driven, or some of them may be idle ones, depending on the customer's preferences. The bogies have two axles and two-level springing. The mounted wheels are made of rubber-sprung wheels with integrated brake-discs and axle bearing. On the axle bearings there is a combined, dynamically resistant, primary rubber-bonded-metal-sprung bogie framework. This bogie framework supports four traction motors and one (in outer bogies) or two (in inner bogies) sprung swing bolsters. The secondary springing of the swing bolsters is secured by steel coil springs with parallel hydraulic rotating dampers. On the swing bolsters there are pivot bearings, which facilitate full rotation of the bogie below the body without any limitations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This work {{addresses}} a nonlinear Lyapunov-like feedback control {{to establish and}} maintain a given relative orbit. Traditional feed-back of cartesian position and velocity tracking error vectors results in an accurate, but expensive, control action. Working with orbit elements eventually allows to reduce such cost by accomplishing corrective manoeuvres on particularly convenient conditions. Moreover it allows to define convenient target relative motions. Hence, by pursuing this approach, here errors in Euler orbit elements are fed-back, thus joining to the previously mentioned benefits the intrinsic more exhaustive exploitation of the dynamics that the Euler set carries with him. These elements, in fact, arise from the solution of the Generalized Problem of Two <b>Fixed</b> <b>Centres,</b> hence already take into account the contributions of J 2, J 3 and partially J 4 zonal harmonics.
