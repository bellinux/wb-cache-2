Not all; for before them, overlooked at first, lay a chasm covering half an acre, in which the whole of the original edifice--tower turrets, walls, and battlements--had been apparently cast, <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> and mingled at different depths and angles, with here and there, like mushrooms from a dust-heap, a score of trees upspringing.|$|R

Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word necessitates human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.|$|R

In spite of difficulties, 'the activity of the young parliament' registered much progress and the constitutional experiment was confirmed a real success. However, friction arose where local and metropolitan interests conflicted, for the Imperial side of the dyarchy jealously guarded reserved matters against possible encroachment. The Imperial Government would not divest itself of any power in an island where internal security, which naturally impinged on domestic concerns, was <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> with defence interests. Therefore, during the period of responsible government the Imperial Government remained the sole arbiter of what was and what was not necessary in most spheres of Maltese life. However, the core of the problem was the Imperial attitude towards political parties, for it was certainly not impartial and made a distinction between a Nationalist and a Constitutional administration.

The original and unifying systematization of the crossovers between the different polaron behaviors, usually considered in the literature, is obtained in terms of quantum to classical, weak coupling to strong coupling, adiabatic to nonadiabatic, itinerant to self-trapped polarons and large to small polarons. It is argued {{that the relationship between}} various aspects of polaron states can be specified by five regimes: the weak-coupling regime, the regime of large adiabatic polarons, the regime of small adiabatic polarons, the regime of small nonadiabatic (Lang-Firsov) polarons, and the transitory regime of small pinned polarons for which the adiabatic and nonadiabatic contributions are <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> in the polaron dispersion properties.

40|$|Abstract A {{rapid and}} {{reliable}} method of dolphinfish species identification was designed based on PCR ampli-fication of diagnostic DNA fragments from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. It consisted in a tetra-plex reaction producing a positive control amplicon and species-specific fragments in Coryphaena hippurus and C. equiselis. It was successfully tested in specimens of known identity and in nominal C. hippurus samples among which two C. equiselis were discovered. This approach has significant advantages over other molecular species iden-tification methods and may help in determining species composition of <b>mixed</b> <b>catches,</b> and in forensic and food control applications of dolphinfish specimens or products...|$|R

500|$|A {{distributed}} element filter is {{an electronic}} filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the {{elements of the}} circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors {{as they are in}} conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others.

That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate [...] "lumped" [...] capacitors and inductors.

40|$|Cities 1 {{always have}} been the locus of power and social organisation. They were also places of social and {{technological}} innovation, accompanying an increasingly complex division of labour and growing economic accumulation. In the history of societies, cities emerged at different moments on {{different parts of the}} earth, several thousand years ago, but always after agricultural techniques had been invented (about 3000 years later) and coinciding with new forms of political organisation in society (Bairoch, 1985). The maximum city size increased through history, following demographic and economic growth and technological progress. As recalled by Michael Batty in the preceding chapter, “there are always many more smaller cities than larger ones”. A less known fact is that all through historical times, as well as today in every country, in wider regions such as Europe or even in the entire world, city sizes differentiate in a surprising regular manner: the number of cities follows an inverse geometric progression in relation to their size. It is therefore not surprising if the notion of hierarchy seems almost intrinsic in urban systems, and in the two acceptations mentioned in the introduction to this book. The hierarchy of cities is a complex architecture of social relations of power or influence, <b>inextricably</b> <b>mixed</b> within a huge variety of political, economic o...|$|R

After his fight on the spur, on which stood the Sandbag Battery, Lieutenant Bellairs, with the remnants of his three companies, found himself {{at the head of the}} Quarry Ravine. Including scattered groups from other battalions, there were about one hundred and fifty men there. Somewhere about 9 a.m. they were preparing to resist the advance of a Russian column moving up the ravine against them when they received repeated orders, from an unidentified field officer, to retire and were compelled to do so, though Bellairs and other officers kept the retreat to a walk. Additions, as they retired, raised the 150 to 200 men. Presently, they found that they were retiring on the French 7th Leger, which was drawn up in good order. This battalion advanced at first, but never charged home and fell back again, the right of it in disorder.|$|R

Having expanded the front line to 14 miles, the 2nd Canadian Corps, with the 2nd and 3rd Divisions and the 4th Armoured Division, became responsible for the drive along the Rhine to Kalkar and Xanten.
