5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.|$|E

5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the War of the Polish Succession, but {{the discovery of the}} printed text showed that it was not related.

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E

5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the war.

5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E

5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} rapprochement between the Congolese factions.

An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 {{led to the formation of}} a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E
