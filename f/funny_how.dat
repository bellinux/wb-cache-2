500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{introduced}} the subplot of restoring the parks department budget through a harvest festival, which {{continued to be}} a major story arc throughout the first seven episodes of the season. It also marked a major development in the romantic subplot between Ann and Chris. Rashida Jones said of her character: [...] "I think women over-correct from their last boyfriends, and Chris is very much the opposite from Mark," [...] a reference to Mark Brendanawicz, a character eliminated the previous season. During one scene at Ann's house, Leslie suggests outlandish and inappropriate ways for Ann to try to seduce Chris into increasing the parks department budget, including wearing a sleeveless tuxedo dress that suddenly bursts open. Amy Poehler said she and Jones improvised much of the scene. Poehler said of the scene, [...] "I think it's really <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> little game (Leslie) has with guys. She's not a fool, it's just not her expertise, so when she talks about how to be sexy or hot to get someone's attention, it's always really crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Mustaine, {{who went}} on to found Megadeth, has {{expressed}} his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett [...] "stole" [...] his job. Mustaine was [...] "pissed off" [...] because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine himself had written. In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, [...] "it's real <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.1 guitarist in your magazine". On Megadeth's debut album Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song [...] "Mechanix", which Metallica reworked and retitled [...] "The Four Horsemen" [...] on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to [...] "straighten Metallica up" [...] because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar. Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey called The Showplace; the support act was Anthrax's original line-up, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin. This {{was the first time the}} two bands performed live together.|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E

500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> I only see the two of you here. It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2011 {{documentary}} The Other F Word, Flea {{discussed the}} joys of being a father by saying [...] "It's <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> you always hear people saying that classic parent attitude of, 'I brought you into this world, I gave you life!' You know, it's just, I think, completely the opposite. My kids gave me life. They gave me a reason." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, the LCSC's {{expansion}} from a 70 to a 165-camera network attracted national attention, {{including a}} front-page {{article in the}} Los Angeles Times: [...] "Lancaster, Pa., keeps {{a close eye on}} itself". The article quoted city police chief Keith Sadler as saying, [...] "Years ago, there's no way we could do this... It brings to mind Big Brother, George Orwell and 1984. It's just <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> Americans have softened on these issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the 2010 film Inception, Zimmer used {{electronic}} {{manipulation of}} the song [...] "Non, je ne regrette rien". The horn sound in the score, described by Zimmer as [...] "like huge foghorns over a city" [...] became a popular feature in film trailers, with Zimmer commenting [...] "It's <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> {{that sort of thing}} becomes part of the zeitgeist. But I suppose that's exactly what trailers are looking for: something iconic lasts less than a second, and shakes the seats in the theater." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sweet's {{first full}} LP album, <b>Funny</b> <b>How</b> Sweet Co-Co Can Be, was {{released}} in November 1971. A collection of the band's recent singles supplemented by some new Chinn/Chapman tunes (including [...] "Chop Chop" [...] and [...] "Tom Tom Turnaround") and pop covers (such as the Lovin' Spoonful's [...] "Daydream" [...] and the Supremes' [...] "Reflections"), the album, recorded at Nova Studios in London, was produced by Phil Wainman and engineered by Richard Dodd and Eric Holland. It was not a serious contender on the charts. Their albums' failure to match {{the success of their}} singles was a problem that would plague the band throughout their career.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL, Game confirmed the album's featured guests would be included a fellow rappers Lil Wayne, Pharrell Williams, Gucci Mane and Kanye West, and also stating he desired to work with pop singer Lady Gaga, stating {{he was trying to}} get Interscope Records executive Jimmy Iovine to allow this collaboration to come to fruition. On October 3, 2009, Snoop Dogg posted a picture on the social networking website Twitter where it features himself, along with Dr. Dre and Game in the studio working together. The picture was taken a day earlier, and it marked the first time Game had worked with Dr. Dre for some years since the beef with former fellow G-Unit labelmate 50 Cent caused him to lose his record deal at Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records, and release his two following albums on Geffen Records. In January 2010, Game posted a picture of himself wearing several chains, all with the Aftermath Entertainment logo attached to them, with the caption reading [...] "It's <b>funny</b> <b>how</b> things come Full Circle" [...] to his own Twitter page, suggesting that he had returned to the record label: this was later officially confirmed.|$|E
