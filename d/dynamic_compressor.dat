The compressor of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell for automotive application requires severe dynamic performance under normal operating conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Surge is a {{dangerous}} instability that can occur in compressors. It is avoided using a valve that reduces the compressor pressure. The control of this valve {{is important for the}} compressor safety but it also has a direct influence on the acceleration performance. Compressor surge control is investigated by first studying the surge phenomenon in detail. Experimental data from a <b>dynamic</b> <b>compressor</b> flow test bench and surge cycles measured on an engine is used to tune and validate a model capable of describing surge. A concept named time to surge is introduced and a sensitivity analysis is performed to isolate the important characteristics that influence surge transients in an engine. It is pointed out that the controller clearly benefits from a feed-forward term due to the small time frames associated with the transition to surge. In the next step this knowledge is used in the design of a novel surge controller. This surge controller is then compared to two other controllers and it is shown that it avoids surge and improves the acceleration performance by delivering both higher engine torque and turbo shaft speed after a gear change...|$|E

Compressed air on mines is traditionally distributed via compressed air ring networks where multiple shafts are supplied with compressed air from an integral system.

Test procedures and data acquisition {{methods used to}} obtain the dynamic stalling and quasi-steady in-stall data are explained. Unstalled and in-stall time-averaged data obtained from the compressor operating at five different shaft speeds and one off-schedule variable vane condition are presented. The effects of compressor speed and variable geometry on overall compressor in-stall pressure rise and hysteresis extent are illustrated {{through the use of}} quasi-steady stage temperature rise and pressure rise characteristics. The results indicate that individual stage performance during overall compressor rotating stall operation varies considerably throughout the length of the compressor. Time-resolved in-stall data acquired at two different shaft speeds are presented in support of the notion that stage operation varies significantly from entrance to exit of the compressor. Both time-averaged and time-resolved individual stage results suggest that stage matching is important, not only for unstalled performance but also for in-stall performance and recoverability from stall;The measured high-speed 10 -stage test compressor individual stage pressure and temperature characteristics were input into a stage-by-stage <b>dynamic</b> <b>compressor</b> performance model.

It is interesting to remark how momentum equation has been taken into account in all compressor parts and the possibility to solve parallel paths, resonators, etc. Effective flow areas are evaluated considering multidimensional models based on modal analysis of fluid interaction in the valve. Then, second and third order vibration models of valve are also considered. The possibility to use compound bound has been also implemented.

Furthermore, two commercial hermetic reciprocating compressor have been instrumented in detail to obtain the thermal temperatures map and the pressure fluid evolutions along compressor for different working conditions. It is interesting to remark as a novelty, the use of very small absolute pressure transducers, instead of the standard relative transducers. They allow to know instantaneous absolute pressure inside compressor chamber, without the necessity of measurement an absolute pressure outside the compression chamber (as is usual in this kind of experimental works).

DCS takes all of the compressors and end-users into consideration while doing the calculations. This dissertation focuses on the DCS implementation process and on the problems encountered by previous authors while implementing the DCS technology. Additional problems were encountered while the DCS technology was implemented. DCS was however still successfully implemented.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} refrigeration {{is one of}} {{the more}} promising alternatives to conventional electronics cooling techniques, especially at high ambient temperature. For the use of refrigeration in electronics cooling, a miniature-scale, low cost, and reliable refrigerant compressor is needed. ^ An electrostatically actuated diaphragm compressor is a promising concept for this application. The compressor consists of a flexible circular diaphragm clamped at its circumference inside a conformal chamber. The membrane and the chamber surfaces are coated with metallic electrodes. A potential difference applied between the diaphragm and the chamber pulls the diaphragm towards the chamber surface progressively from the outer circumference towards the center. This zipping actuation reduces the volume available to the refrigerant gas, thereby increasing its pressure. ^ A segmentation technique is proposed for analysis of the compressor by which the domain is divided into multiple segments for each of which the forces acting on the diaphragm are estimated. The pull-down voltage to completely zip each individual segment is thus obtained. The required voltage for obtaining a specific pressure rise in the chamber can thus be determined. Predictions from the model compare well with other simulation results from the literature, as well as to experimental measurements of the diaphragm displacement and chamber pressure rise in a custom-built setup. ^ A <b>dynamic</b> <b>compressor</b> model is also developed in which the dynamic forces induced due to the finite-time deflection of the diaphragm are taken into consideration using the segmentation approach developed in the quasi-static model. Results from the analytical model compare favorably with those from a detailed numerical simulation as well as with experimental measurements available in the literature. A finite element quasi-static model is also developed for further validation of the analytical model. ^ Based on the simulation model predictions, the design of the diaphragm compressor is optimized for the maximum performance. Since the desired cooling performance is not possible with a single compressor unit, a 3 -D array for boosting the pressure rise and the volume flow rate is proposed. Finally, suggested future work on diaphragm compressors is outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is a large user of turbomachinery. The demand for oil and gas is consistently growing, and changing market conditions require innovative solutions. Operation and optimization of turbomachinery in a variety of applications is therefore of great interest. Moreover, potentially extreme environmental procedures mean that innovative design and operational attributes must be used. The development and implementation of new subsea technology is an important focus area to increase petroleum production and recovery from existing fields. The technology will contribute to the exploitation of small and remote fields and access to fields in very deep water. A traditional centrifugal compressor may not be applicable for wet gas compression, because the liquid may cause mechanical damage due to erosion and corrosion of the compressor components; in addition, the design is not optimized for multiphase flow. In this research, particular emphasis is given to the wet gas compressor as a more fundamental knowledge of the impact of liquid is essential with regard to the understanding of aerodynamic and fluid <b>dynamic</b> <b>compressor</b> behaviour. It is also of vital importance to identify the mechanisms leading to unsteadiness, like surge and rotating stall. A key element is the investigation of the machine performance and working range when a liquid phase is present. In the present work, attention has been given to the experimental validation of an advanced facility, equipped with special windows designed for flow inspection. The experimental tests were performed on an air-water multiphase open-loop test rig, which consists of a single-stage centrifugal compressor, with a standard three-dimensional impeller that was tested in dry and multiphase conditions. The main objective of this research is the study of the stability and the range of the wet gas compressor at a low mass flow rate. Focus of interest is on the effect of the presence of a liquid phase. Thus the performance evaluation from dry to wet operating conditions is fundamental. Moreover the study of the flow path inside the impeller and the diffuser has great importance in order to clarify the impact of the liquid. In this case the visualization of the fluid has a central role. The analysis of the working range has been supplemented by the investigation at off‒design conditions, in particular in the area characterized by low mass flow rate. An accurate examination of the dynamic pressure trends from dry to wet working conditions is carried out. The results show the performance deterioration owing to the content of liquid with respect to dry working conditions. However the presence of a liquid has a positive influence on the machine stability and operating range. Through a fast Fourier transform analysis, the stabilizing effect on instabilities onset is highlighted, compared to normal operations. In addition, the flow evolution inside the impeller and diffuser is studied. The main flow patterns, typical of a centrifugal compressor, are revealed also in wet conditions: the impeller flow presents a jet-wake structure, while in the diffuser a logarithmic spiral path is observed. Also the characteristic behaviour, like reverse flow that creates a “doughnut” formation, towards the suction pipe, is documented. The outcomes that improve the knowledge about the wet gas compressor are a baseline to define a method in order to conduct multiphase tests and provide a starting point to design a wet tolerant system...|$|E
