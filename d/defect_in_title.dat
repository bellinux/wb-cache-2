5000|$|Iusta causa (alternatively [...] "iustus titulus") is a requirement, in essence, {{that the}} {{transfer}} {{would have been}} valid if not {{for one of the}} two cases mentioned above. This will be a recognised method of transfer [...] - [...] for example, gift or sale. This has to be in fact; it cannot rest on a mistaken belief in there being a sale or gift, which is the main difference between iusta causa and good faith in practice. Good faith is not easily defined, despite being a common concept in the Roman law. In the case of sale by a non-owner (or another <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> <b>title),</b> then it probably meant that the claimant believed he was becoming owner. However, the receiver of a res mancipi by traditio must surely realise the problem, but this does not prevent usucapio. The burden of proof was on anyone disputing the usucapio to show bad faith. The bad faith had to be shown at the point of the iusta causa [...] - [...] it was insufficient to show that the claimant later realised that the item had come from a non-owner.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} land {{contracts in}} Queensland require a seller {{of land to}} disclose to a buyer not only registered encumbrances, but also statutory encumbrances affecting the land. Whether a statute creates a statutory encumbrance over the title to the property is therefore a key question for a seller when completing a contract. This article examines relevant case law and provides some guidelines for when a statute creates a statutory encumbrance that should be disclosed to a buyer as a <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> <b>title...</b>|$|E

40|$|The seller must {{deliver the}} goods which are free from any right or claim {{of a third}} party. If the seller fails to do so he will be liable for the breach of the contract. However, the buyer loses the right {{to rely on the}} {{provisions}} regulating seller's liability for <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> if he does not give notice to the seller specifying the nature of the right or claim of the third party.

40|$|A Professional Project Report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Water Resources, University of New Mexico. Demand for water is growing in New Mexico. One potential solution to extend future supplies may be transferring water rights. Water rights transfers occur when existing water rights are {{moved to a new}} location or use. Because water transfers are becoming an increasingly popular way to re-allocate water, water rights holders should become familiar with the transfer process and the administrative bodies and policies governing their movement. The transfer process can be complex, influenced by many variables. Parties interested transferring water rights may be unaware of these variables and lack a basic understanding of what constitutes a water right, how water rights are determined, transaction costs, and common pitfalls in the transfer process that can lead to the denial a transfer. Pitfalls identified in this paper include initial validity of the right, continuous beneficial use, <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> or ownership of the right, type of water right, and protests. Water right holders that can overcome these pitfalls may increase their chances of a successful transfer. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a “roadmap” or “guide” to right holders interested in transferring water rights. A discussion of water rights, their administration, and the transfer process will be given to explain this relationship. Next, the five pitfalls identified will be explained to show why they are important in the transfer process. Finally, recommendations will be given on what right holders should do before transferring their water rights...|$|R

2500|$|Adverse {{possession}} {{exists to}} cure potential or actual <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> real estate <b>titles</b> {{by putting a}} {{statute of limitations on}} possible litigation over ownership and possession. Because of the doctrine of adverse possession, a landowner can be secure <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to his land. [...] Otherwise, long-lost heirs of any former owner, possessor or lien holder of centuries past could come forward with a legal claim on the property. The doctrine of adverse possession prevents this. This means the law may be used to reward a person who possesses the land of another for a requisite period of time. Failure of a landowner to exercise and defend his property rights for a certain period may result in the permanent loss of the landowner's interest in the property. In economic terms, adverse possession encourages and rewards productive use of land.|$|R
40|$|Electron spin {{resonance}} (ESR) and magnetic-susceptibility {{measurements on}} the Li 1 +xTi 2 -xO 4 spinel system (0 ≤ x ≤ 1 3) {{indicate the presence}} of two types of localized moments in this material. In both cases, an unpaired electron is trapped as a Ti 3 + ion in a crystal field that is predominantly octahedral, but with a strong tetragonal component. This type of crystal field cannot arise in the stoichiometric spinel. We propose two types of <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> the <b>title</b> spinel system: an oxygen vacancy and a hydroxyl ion. Unpaired electrons are trapped as Ti 3 + ions adjacent to these defects, and {{it is argued that}} the strong tetragonal field is associated with the formation of a static (TiO) + ion by a displacement of the titanium ion from the defect. Spin relaxation occurs via a thermal ionization of the trapped electron that appears to be associated with a static-dynamic transition in the titanium-ion displacement. © 1984...|$|R

25|$|<b>Title</b> {{insurance}} differs <b>in</b> several respects {{from other}} types of insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>title</b> to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the <b>title</b> policy. <b>In</b> the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. <b>In</b> some states <b>title</b> plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} conveyancing risks which cannot be cured {{under the present}} legal regime for land registration in Nigeria. Two fundamental issues motivated this study. The first is that, in Nigeria, registration of title to land is mandatory and meant to assure certainty of registered title amongst other reasons. However, it is settled law that registration of title per se cannot cure any <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> the <b>title</b> or confer validity which it does not possess. This phenomenon not only exposed registered title holders to hidden conveyancing risks, but also threatened the effectiveness and public trust <b>in</b> registration of <b>title</b> regime. The second problem {{is the lack of}} appropriate risk control measures that are specifically designed for registered <b>title</b> holders <b>in</b> country. Consequently, this paper evaluates the existing conveyancing risks in the particular context of the extant rules on land registration. Although the paper commends legal efforts aim at strengthening land registration in Nigeria, it demonstrates that there is enormity of conveying perils which largely defeats the benefits of registering <b>title</b> to land. <b>In</b> that regard, the study proposes the establishment of title insurance as new commercial model that will be tailored for conveyancing risks control in the country. It concludes that since insurance regulation is the exclusive preserve of the Federal government, the National Insurance Commission should pioneer the reform suggested in this paper by invoking section 101 of the Insurance Act 2003...|$|R
