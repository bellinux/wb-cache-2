5|$|In {{addition}} to complex structures and systems, among the phenomena that critics variously claim evolution cannot explain are consciousness, <b>hominid</b> intelligence, instincts, emotions, metamorphosis, photosynthesis, homosexuality, music, language, religion, morality, and altruism (see altruism in animals). Most of these, such as <b>hominid</b> intelligence, instinct, emotion, photosynthesis, language, and altruism, have been well-explained by evolution, while others remain mysterious, or only have preliminary explanations. Supporters of evolution further contend that no alternative explanation {{has been able}} to adequately explain the biological origin of these phenomena either.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{traces of}} <b>hominid</b> {{existence}} in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years. The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which {{were found at}} Gächlingen, have been dated to around 5300 BC.|$|E
5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) <b>hominid</b> from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone hominids. Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with <b>hominid</b> specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average life span of <b>hominids</b> on the African savanna between 4,000,000 and 200,000 years ago was 20 years. This means that the population would be completely renewed about five times per century, [...] assuming that infant mortality has already been accounted for. It is further estimated that the population of <b>hominids</b> in Africa fluctuated between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals, thus averaging about 50,000 individuals. Roughly multiplying 40,000 centuries by 50,000 to 500,000 individuals per century, yields a total of 2 billion to 20 billion <b>hominids,</b> or an average estimate of about 10 billion <b>hominids</b> that lived during that approximately 4,000,000 year time span.|$|R
50|$|Many extinct <b>hominids</b> {{have been}} studied to help {{understand}} the relationship between modern humans and the other extant <b>hominids.</b> Some of the extinct members of this family include Gigantopithecus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Kenyanthropus, and the australopithecines Australopithecus and Paranthropus.|$|R
5|$|<b>Hominid</b> {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book stems from the underlying grotesque scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow hominids, the mentioning of artifacts which {{have not yet been}} invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hominid</b> {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African {{transitional}} region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling <b>hominid</b> that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran {{orangutan}} genome was sequenced in January 2011. Following {{humans and}} chimpanzees, the Sumatran orangutan became the third species of <b>hominid</b> {{to have its}} genome sequenced. Subsequently, the Bornean species had its genome sequenced. Genetic diversity {{was found to be}} lower in Bornean orangutans (P.pygmaeus) than in Sumatran ones (P.abelii), despite the fact that Borneo is home to six or seven times as many orangutans as Sumatra.|$|E
50|$|Morphological and {{molecular}} data suggest Taenia divergence as specialize human parasites has been directly associated with earlier <b>hominids</b> and {{prior to the}} existence of modern Homo sapiens. Direct predator-prey relationships between humans and the original definitive and intermediate hosts of Taenia resulted in this host switch. Ecological evidence showed early <b>hominids</b> heavily preyed on one of the intermediate hosts, antelope, of Taenia, thus resulting in earlier colonization by the parasite prior to mammalian domestication. The early <b>hominids</b> had an omnivorous diet; they were hunters and scavengers. The abundance of antelope in sub-Saharan Africa savannah in the Late Pliocene resulted in a vast food resource for <b>hominids</b> and other carnivorous animals such as felids, canids, and hyaenids. <b>Hominids</b> who hunted antelopes or scavenged killed antelopes bridged the beginning of a host-parasite relationship between <b>hominids</b> and Taenia. During this time, <b>hominids</b> may not have had the means of cooking their food. This would have greatly increased their chances of catching the cysticerci as a result of eating uncooked meat. Also, transmission of the parasite may have been enhanced by directly consuming the definitive host. Parasitological data support the foraging of antelope by Homo species during the Late Pliocene and Pleistocene periods. This corresponds to the initial contact of the ancestral Taenia and specialize into T. solium, T. saginata, and T. asiatica, thus resulting in colonization of the early homonids as definitive hosts.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s Brunet and Pilbeam matched {{together}} {{and moved to}} Africa. Their idea was to verify the theory of Yves Coppens that <b>hominids</b> had first rose in the savannas of Eastern Africa. The two paleontologists idea was that the shores of Lake Chad were particularly indicated {{to work as a}} magnet for mammals, and maybe also <b>hominids.</b> In 1984 searching begun in Cameroon, but the nine field seasons spent there were discouraging, with no <b>hominids</b> found.|$|R
50|$|Attempting {{to explain}} the {{evolutionary}} advent of bipedalism among <b>hominids,</b> McHenry and Peter Rodman have advanced the Efficient Walker theory, based on energetic analysis. The scientists compared the efficiency of chimpanzees walking on two versus four legs, finding two legged locomotion was far more efficient. They concluded bipedalism was selected simply because it allowed for a further range of travel for <b>hominids.</b> As Miocene forests decreased and <b>hominids</b> were forced into the savannas, the scientists reason, bipedalism enabled greater access to resources.|$|R
5|$|The <b>hominid</b> Australopithecus afarensis {{represents}} an evolutionary transition between modern bipedal humans and their quadrupedal ape ancestors. A number of traits of the A. afarensis skeleton strongly reflect bipedalism, {{to the extent}} that some researchers have suggested that bipedality evolved long before A. afarensis. In overall anatomy, the pelvis is far more human-like than ape-like. The iliac blades are short and wide, the sacrum is wide and positioned directly behind the hip joint, and there is clear evidence of a strong attachment for the knee extensors, implying an upright posture.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>hominid</b> brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E
5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest <b>hominid</b> remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other great apes. This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E
40|$|Following {{the recent}} {{availability}} of high-coverage genomes for Denisovan and Neanderthal <b>hominids,</b> {{we conducted a}} screen for endogenized retroviruses, identifying six novel, previously unreported HERV-K(HML 2) elements (HERV-K is human endogenous retrovirus K). These elements are absent from the human genome (hg 38) and appear to be unique to archaic <b>hominids.</b> These findings provide further evidence supporting the recent activity of the HERV-K(HML 2) group, which has been implicated in human disease. They will also provide insights into the evolution of archaic <b>hominids...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{protection from the}} weather, the discovery of fire allowed for innovations in hunting. Initially, early <b>hominids</b> used grass fires to hunt and control the population of pests in the surrounding areas. Evidence shows that early <b>hominids</b> were able to corral and trap animals by means of fire and proceed to cook the meat. Cooked meat was a large step in protection, because the early <b>hominids</b> were no longer exposed to the various bacteria they ingested when consuming raw meat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} of fire came {{to provide a}} wide variety of uses for early <b>hominids.</b> It acted as a source of warmth, making it easier to get through cold nighttime temperatures and allowing <b>hominids</b> to survive in colder environments, through which geographic expansion from tropical and subtropical climates to areas of temperate climates containing colder winters began to occur. [...] The use of fire continued to aid <b>hominids</b> at night by also acting as a means by which to ward off predatory animals. [...] This allowed <b>hominids</b> to sleep on the ground and in caves instead of trees and led to more time being spent on the ground. This {{may have contributed to the}} evolution of bipedalism as such an ability became increasingly necessary for human activity.|$|R
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the <b>hominid</b> species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her review that the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the advent}} of {{anatomical}} physical modernity cannot confidently be linked with palaeoneurological change, it does seem probable that <b>hominid</b> brains evolved through the same selection processes as other body parts. Genes that promoted a capacity for symbolism may have been selected for, suggesting that the foundations for symbolic culture may well be grounded in biology. However, behavior that was mediated by symbolism may have only come later, even though this physical capacity was already in place much earlier. Skoyles and Sagan, for example, argue that human brain expansion by increasing the prefrontal cortex would have created a brain capable of symbolizing its previously non-symbolic cognition, and that this process, slow to begin with, increasingly accelerated during the last 100,000 years. Symbolically mediated behavior may then feed back upon this process by creating a greater ability to manufacture symbolic artifacts and social networks. According to the research team in Jebel Irhoud, the discovery means that Homo sapiens — not members of a rival or ancestor species (Homo heidelbergensis, Homo naledi) — {{were the ones who}} left behind Middle Stone Age hand tools that have since been unearthed all over Africa.|$|E
25|$|However, archeological {{finds in}} 2007 have {{suggested}} that a <b>hominid</b> population, probably modern Homo sapiens, survived in Jwalapuram, Southern India.
