According to Schön-Quinlivan [...] the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, did not appreciate Ripa di Meana’s political style and their relationship became strained. Ripa di Meana was eventually replaced by Karel Van Miert for a period of six months until a full-time replacement could be found. Yet Van Miert supported what had been done before him and described environmental policy as ‘one of our most successful policies, and one of the best understood’.|$|E

40|$|Urban and {{regional}} planning {{is regarded as}} a possible tool for a limited but precious resource use control, and as a means to assure a better environmental air quality. It now refers to new problems involved in the concept of sustainability. Actually, it’s a common practice to found planning on a strong sense of responsibility towards the natural environment to avoid a further crisis of the settlement system. The research presented is founded on this premise. Its objective is to build a GIS platform based data processing framework in order to quantify emission and diffusion phenomena caused by public and private car traffic in Bologna Province. The starting point is the reconstruction of the entire mobility cycle from the quantification of generated or attracted trips by the census districts in which the provincial territory is divided. The system uses cascade models for traffic flows assignment, for the corresponding emissions estimate and for the evaluation of air pollutant transportation, diffusion and effects on air quality. On the basis of work and school trips dated to 1991 census and of data regarding road network structure and traffic load, the traffic flows was calculated. The model system created is useful both for diagnostic information and for the possibility to envisage- {{at least in terms of}} relative changes- the effects of measures and of particular weather conditions. In accordance with ACI (Italian Automobiles Club) traffic surveys and extrapolations, vehicles have been divided into classes in classes taking account of categories, running conditions and maintenance as stated by the CORINAIR methodology (a project to estimate air pollutant emissions promoted by UE <b>XI</b> <b>DG)</b> ...|$|R

On {{the basis of}} the available evidence, approaches are presented for the exposure assessment to be used for estimation of risks in authorization procedures under the recently accepted Directive 98 / 8 /EC. Gaps in knowledge are indicated, making it possible to study the issues involved in a comprehensive and cost-effective way. Some recommendations are given on how to best do this.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore how the concept of {{administrative}} culture {{might be used to}} help us to understand better the internal dynamics of the European Commission. It does this, in part, from the perspective of two comparable though very different case studies. In the case of Directorate-General Four (DG IV) of the Commission, which administers the Community's antitrust/competition and state aid control, it is possible to identify a distinctive set of beliefs linked to a commitment to neo-liberal values and a legalistic way of working. By contrast, Directorate-General Eleven (<b>DG</b> <b>XI),</b> the environment DG, has adopted a very specific world view based on the relationship between trade and ecological concerns. However, before looking specifically at these individual examples, this paper tentatively suggests ways in which administrative culture might be defined and used to explain certain elements of life within an institutional setting...|$|E

Starting points for discussions were the recommendations from OSPARs working group on nutrients (NUT) as regard key issues/main elements to be included in HARP. The workshop gave further clasification on which elements were to be included in HARP in order to achieve co-ordination between international organisations and to harmonise national calculation methods and reporting procedures. Further, the Workshop gave additional viewpoints on the use of harmonised information for reporting on the 50 % reduction target for the North Sea, other reporting requirements/targets today and the future, assessment of effects of measures and development of abatement strategies/action plans on catchment levels. strategies/action plans on catchment levels. The Workshop resulted in recommendations and ideas for the further development of the various elements in HARP as regard catchment approach, quantification of agricultural nutrient losses to surface water, quantification of point sources, background load, normalisation of data, retention and riverine monitoring.

The main objective {{of the project was}} the collection and collation of already existing and newly acquired fishery and biological data needed for preliminary assessment of two hake species occurring in the study area. In addition to this basic remit, additional objectives included the creation of a common database, study of spawning seasons and areas, discard pattern and length-frequency composition of target and non-target species, estimation of annual by-catch rates, analysis of trophic relationships, marine mammals by-catch and sightings, morphometric analysis for stock differentiation, and developing GIS applications for analysis of the data collected. Historical fishery and biological data series available from IEO and FIGFD (since 1988 and 1987 respectively) were provided to the project. New fishery and biological data were collected by scientific observers provided by IEO, ANAMER and FIGFD, and placed on board Spanish fishing vessels operating in the study area during the project period. Data on fishing activity included effort, catches and discards of target and non-target species on a haul-by-haul basis. Biological information (size, sex, maturity stage, etc) of target and non-target species was recorded on a daily basis. Data on landings and effort were provided by ANAMER to its subcontractor (MG OTERO) for processing and estimation of total catch and effort of the whole Spanish fishing fleet in the area; MG OTERO was also responsible for organisation of observers in collaboration with ANAMER staff in Vigo and Port Stanley. Ancillary data on location, time of fishing, depth, SST, SBT, sea roughness, wind, etc, was recorded on a haul-by-haul basis. This type of information was essential for development of GIS at AU to relate the species distribution to physical and environmental factors. Other information collected was about by-catches and sightings of small cetaceans and seabirds, and biological samples such as otoliths, stomachs and whole specimens of hakes for subsequent studies on growth (IEO, FIGFD), diet and morphometrics (AU). All the historical and new data collected during the project were collated and integrated into a common database designed by all participants and built at IEO. The information was used for preliminary assessment of two hake populations co-ordinated by RRAG during a workshop held in London in July 2001. All these data will be analysed and written up for future publications. Discard rates of target species were generally low in all areas and seasons with the highest discard rate for Notothen sp. (around 100 % of the catch). Illex squid was found to be the major by-catch for hake fishery in the 46 S area. IEO observers reported data on incidental catches of marine mammals and sea birds since 1993 and the analysis of this information was made by AU. The observed mortality in the fishing gears comprised small numbers of black-browed albatross, gentoo penguin and the hourglass dolphin. The species most frequently sighted was the Peale’s dolphin, although this species did not appear in by-catches, followed by the hourglass dolphin. The project provided an opportunity to collect and integrate {{for the first time at}} European level the necessary fishery and biological data for the development of partial stock assessment for the future rational management of the fisheries in the area. Such management is needed for the sustainability of the commercial fisheries, the conservation of the onshore and offshore jobs and the supply of fish to the most important markets worldwide.
