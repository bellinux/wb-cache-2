40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{presents}} {{new information}} regarding emissions of CFC 12 {{used to make}} extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> products. Earlier reports identified {{a significant difference in}} emission rates from extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> that are used to estimate the amount of the chlorofluorocarbon yet to be released from these materials – the banked amount. Since the estimated atmospheric lifetime of CFC 12 is 100 years, {{it is very important to}} use an accurate release rate from extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> in actual use to corroborate laboratory measurements. This report will provide evidence that CFC 12 is emitted from extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> more than an order of magnitude slower than some earlier reported rates, resulting in a bank of CFC 12, yet to be released from the foam, potentially larger than previously estimated.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{experiments}} were performed {{for the study}} of combustion characteristics of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS). The ignition temperature of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS) was studied by two different means in the fire laboratory of China University of mining and technology. Ignition temperature of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS) was measured by DW- 02 type ignition point detector produced in the instrument analysis factory of jiang ning in Nan Jing. Ignition temperature with different heating power was measured by the radiation ignition instrument of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS). Results show that the ignition point of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS) measured by DW- 02 type ignition point detector produced in the instrument analysis factory of jiang ning in Nan Jing was approximately 355 °C. Ignition point of extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> (XPS) insulation board with 2. 2 cm thickness was located approximately at 365 °C ∼ 370 °C, what's more, Ignition time of extruded polystyrene insulation boar (XPS) was gradually shortened as heating power increased.

Conclusions have a guiding role in setting material pyrolysis parameters during the FDS simulation of extruded polystyrene board (XPS) and have an important reference value in the selection of suitable external insulation materials in the practical engineering...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} is shipped across the oceans in large marine {{carriers}}. The carriers house the LNG using several different insulation systems. One of these systems involves large aluminum spheres insulated with <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam.</b> <b>Polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> is very susceptible to heat degradation. This raised issues as {{to the extent of}} possible insulation failure caused by a large ship fire. Experiments were done investigating the nature of polystyrene’s thermal degradation, notably by Brauman, Chen, and Matzinger and Butler. A large scale investigation was also performed by Sandia National Laboratory. However, computational modeling of the degradation was lacking. This work set out to build comprehensive models of the experiments performed by BCM, Butler, and Sandia. The models were created using COMSOL Multiphysics, a complex finite element method computational software. The thermal degradation of polystyrene is a complex process involving moving boundaries, phase transitions, and temperature dependent physical properties. The BCM and Butler experiments provided the most amount of detail and were used to test the accuracy of the models and methods used within them. The value of principal interest was the overall regression rate of the material, a variable that could be calculated by the models and compared directly with experimentally measured values. Modeling started with an extensive literature review of the physical properties of dense and <b>foam</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> The BCM experiments were first considered as they were the least complex. Both a transient and a steady-state model of the BCM experiments were built. Although detail of the transient heat up phase was lost, the steady-state model provided a better fit with experiment. With a good fit of the BCM experiments, the techniques were carried forward and adapted to the more complex Butler <b>foam</b> <b>polystyrene</b> experiments. Again, regression rates for the model were reasonably close to those measured by experiment. Next, the Sandia experiment was investigated. Here, the values of interest were no longer regression rates but insulation failure times and cargo tank heat fluxes. The Sandia experiment presented a new complication in the form of necessary information not being available, notably the surface emissivity of the aluminum scrim used. With the model, it was found that a very low surface emissivity, one near the lowest commercially available, was required to match the experimental results...|$|R
