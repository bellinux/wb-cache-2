40|$|The common <b>dichotomized</b> <b>classification</b> of Islam in the Caucasus (“traditional” versus “fundamentalist”) {{does not}} take into account all major {{processes}} taking place in the region. The Sufi-Wahhabi discourse simplifies the social interactions between Muslims and suggests homogeneity of each of these categories. In this paper I would show how the term “Wahhabi” has been employed by the local community of Muslims who live in the Georgian Pankisi gorge to express their resistance towards new and radical ideas and practices. In this social conflict, Sufi brotherhoods assume the role of the defenders of traditional order, while the reformists attempt at changing not only religious but also social structures...|$|E

Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) with 95  % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using <b>dichotomized</b> <b>classification</b> scores (lesions classified as BI-RADS 1 – 3 were considered benign, and the ones classified as 4 – 5 were considered malignant). The same scores were used to calculate inter-reader agreement of BI-RADS classification assessed with κ statistics. Histopathology was the reference standard. Sizes of malignant masses and CENRs were compared between field strengths using Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. All analyses {{were performed}} using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., NY, USA).|$|E
40|$|Intentional and unintentional {{injury is}} the leading cause of death and {{potential}} years of life lost in the first four decades of life in North America and around the world. Despite surgical innovations and improved access to emergency care, research has shown that certain populations remain particularly vulnerable to the risks and consequences of injury. In particular, recent integration of geographic information systems (GIS) is beginning to demonstrate the power of mapping and spatial analysis for better understanding these determinants. This dissertation demonstrates the utility of GIS for better understanding incidence patterns of injury using five different case studies. Each case study is an independent investigation, however all five studies converge on three research questions. First, is there a relationship between geographic scale, socio-economic status, and incidence patterns of intentional injury? Second, would information from this analysis possibly go unnoticed if spatial analysis and mapping are not used to analyze the data? Third, can GIS be used to better explain relationships between incidence patterns of injury and social and demographic data over and above non-spatial surveillance practices? To answer question one, multilevel modeling and scale and zoning restructuring analysis of iii Census boundaries were employed. Data were analyzed for the following injuries: assault, suicide, motor vehicle collisions, falls, and pedestrian. To answer question two, a spatial autocorrelation test was used and analyzed against intentional injuries. Finally, to answer question three Poisson probability mapping was applied using a <b>dichotomized</b> <b>classification</b> of intentional and unintentional injury. All data are inclusive to populations living in the province of British Columbia between 2001 and 2006. Secondary data sources included 2001 Census spatial and socio-economic records, British Columbia Trauma Registry data, and provincial Coroner records. Results indicate that severe injury morbidity and mortality in British Columbia follows a social gradient. However, this relationship is not universal and can vary according to the Census indicator, the injury, as well as the size and scope of the administrative boundaries used to assess the relationship. Further commitment by injury preventionists and Geographic Information Scientists is necessary to yield new knowledge about social and spatial determinants of injury...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{systematic}} review was to detect {{the reliability of the}} currently available magnetic resonance imaging measurements used in the evaluation of repaired rotator cuff. METHODS: Search was performed using major electronic databases from their inception to February 2014. All studies reporting post-operative magnetic resonance assessment after rotator cuff repair were included. After the identification of available magnetic resonance criteria, reliability studies were further analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize findings. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies checklist. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty studies were included in the review. Twenty-six different criteria were identified. Ten studies reported inter-observer reliability, and only two assessed intra-observer reliability of some of the identified criteria. Structural integrity was the most investigated criterion. The <b>dichotomized</b> Sugaya's <b>classification</b> showed the highest reliability (k = 0. 80 - 0. 91). All other criteria showed moderate to low inter-observer reliability. Tendon signal intensity and footprint coverage showed a complete discordance. Intra-observer reliability was high for the presence of structural integrity, and moderate to low for all other criteria. Methodological quality was high only for one study and moderate for three studies. CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six different criteria described by multiple classification systems have been identified for the magnetic resonance assessment of rotator cuff after repair. Reliability of most of them has not been analysed yet. With the data available, only the presence of structural integrity showed good intra- and inter-observer agreement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Systematic review of descriptive and qualitative studies, Level IV...|$|R
40|$|Importance Presently, the {{clinical}} standard for reporting {{the results of}} an amyloid positron emission tomography scan is to assign a dichotomous rating of positive or negative for the presence of amyloid. In a 4 -year longitudinal study, we investigated whether using a continuous measure of the magnitude of baseline amyloid burden would provide valuable information about the rate of future cognitive decline over the subsequent 4 years compared with a dichotomous measure in middle-aged and older adults. Objective To examine whether a continuous, dose-response relationship between amyloid burden and cognitive decline was present among middle-aged and older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included 174 participants from the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study who were 40 to 89 years old {{at the beginning of the}} study, were cognitively normal at baseline (a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 26 or higher) with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, and had completed amyloid imaging ([18 F]-florbetapir) at baseline and cognitive assessments at baseline and a 4 -year follow-up. Continuous amyloid burden was measured as the mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) at baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures Linear mixed models assessed the effect of increasing baseline amyloid over time (SUVR[*]×[*]time interaction) on episodic memory, reasoning, processing speed, vocabulary, and Mini-Mental State Examination performance. Age, sex, education, apolipoprotein ε 4, and the random effect of intercepts were included as covariates. Results The mean (SD) age for all participants (n[*]=[*] 174) was 66. 44 (11. 74) years, and 65 participants (37 %) were men. The primary analyses yielded significant SUVR[*]×[*]time interactions in episodic memory, processing speed, vocabulary, and Mini-Mental State Examination performance, but not in reasoning performance. Higher baseline SUVR projected greater cognitive decline over 4 years. When controlling for variance related to a <b>dichotomized</b> positive/negative <b>classification,</b> most effects on cognition remained. Dichotomized amyloid status alone yielded fewer significant effects of amyloid on cognitive decline than continuous SUVR. Among amyloid-positive participants, increasing baseline SUVR predicted an increasing decline in episodic memory, but other effects on cognition were more limited. Finally, higher baseline amyloid burden among middle-aged adults was related to changes in vocabulary, with the effect driven by 3 apolipoprotein ε 4 homozygotes. Conclusions and Relevance These results suggest that the magnitude of amyloid burden at baseline is associated with the rate of cognitive decline over 4 years and potentially provides important information about the rate of future cognitive decline that is not available from a dichotomous positive/negative categorization...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} predictors of sexual arousal to erotic, rape, and non-sexual violent videotaped stimuli {{in a sample}} of 82 undergraduate men. Questionnaire self-report measures of observed parental conflict, conflict tactics practiced in interpersonal relations, coercive sexual behavior, variety of sexual experiences, and frequency of using various forms of pornography, {{as well as a number}} of relevant demographic measures like fraternity affiliation, athletic participation, frequency of intercourse, and number of sexual partners, were assessed. These measures were used in analyses that tested relationships among these variables and determined group differences based on <b>dichotomized</b> <b>classification</b> of high and low scores. ^ Subsequently, in the experimental segment of the study, videotaped excerpts from commercial films were presented depicting images of erotica, rape, and non-sexual violence while participants provided a continuous lever-adjusted rating of their perceived sexual arousal and simultaneous continuous physiological measurements were recorded of their penile tumescence. ^ Statistical analyses confirmed the prediction of association between observed aggression and violence and practiced aggression and violence, especially at higher levels. In terms of coercive sexual behavior, one man in five admitted using such tactics to gain sexual access to reluctant partners, and, in fact, this sample included a sizeable number of admitted rapists. When the particular order of presentation of the stimuli was examined, it seemed that prior exposure to both erotic and rape videos seriously degraded the participant 2 ̆ 7 s arousal to the violent video that followed. Arousal was most enhanced by prior exposure to the erotic video alone, but collectively, either order of presentation that began with the violent video, without any other sexual or sexually aggressive stimulus prime, resulted in the greatest arousal. ^ Sexual arousal to the rape stimulus was best predicted by the single element of athletic involvement, i. e., membership in varsity teams, especially football or basketball. For non-sexual violent images, the strongest combination of predictors for sexual arousal was the combination of being a varsity athlete, having observed more frequent severe violence between parents, and being younger than the average participant. ^ Implications are evident not only for rape prevention and batterers 2 ̆ 7 programs, but also for the design of family intervention strategies. ...|$|E
