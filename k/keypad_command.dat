In screen mode, the default {{action for the}} user is to directly update text {{as he or she}} types, with special commands available by pressing <b>keypad</b> <b>commands.</b> Arrow keys allow for simple navigation, while <b>keypad</b> <b>commands</b> allow for more complex navigation and searches. As with many user interfaces developed around this time, EDT uses the [...] "Gold Key" [...] style of input first developed for the WPS-8 word processing system.

5000|$|EDT recognizes an {{additional}} usage for the Gold key, {{to enter a}} repeat count. For example, the keystrokes [...] enter a line of twenty equals signs. Repeat counts also apply to <b>keypad</b> editing <b>commands,</b> but if such a command itself requires the Gold key, the Gold key must be pressed again before the command key. For example, assuming a VT100 keypad, [...] perform the PASTE editing command (once), while [...] performs PASTE four times. For editing commands which are directional, such as moving the cursor, negative repeat counts {{may be used to}} indicate reverse direction.|$|R

Audible commands for each menu item are provided once a headset is connected and the proper sequence is keyed through the <b>keypad.</b> All non-visual <b>commands</b> are then entered via the keypad instead of the touch screen.|$|R
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} Web search, mobile local search {{requires}} more immediacy and street-smart knowledge and information, local events and driving directions. The technical difference from web-based search is that, whether using the <b>keypad</b> or voice <b>commands,</b> the caller has limited 'bandwidth'. They {{do not want}} to hear or scroll through long lists of results. They want to [...] "quickly and unobtrusively" [...] zero in on the type of local information they are looking for, due to privacy, safety and time pressure.|$|R
30|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a {{technology}} that allows automatic human-computer interactions, via a telephone <b>keypad</b> or voice <b>commands.</b> Its key function is to provide end-users with self-service voice information [1]. IVR systems are widely used in many industries, including telecommunications and banking, to improve customer satisfaction, reduce cost, and ensure uninterrupted service. Examples of IVR applications include automated attendants, automated meter readers and IVR banking. The automated attendant transfers callers to the appropriate extensions automatically, without intervention by a receptionist; using automated meter readers, utilities customers can remotely enter their meter readings, while IVR banking allows end-users to consult their bank balance or last transactions, for instance.|$|R
40|$|Telepathology {{enables a}} {{pathologist}} to examine physically distant tissue samples by microscope operation over a communication link. Communication links can impose time delays which cause difficulties in controlling the remote device. Such difficulties {{were found in}} a microscope teleoperation system. Since the user interface is critical to pathologist's acceptance of telepathology, we redesigned the user interface for this system, built two different versions (a <b>keypad</b> whose movement <b>commands</b> operated by specifying a start command followed by a stop command and a trackball interface whose movement commands were incremental and directly proportional to {{the rotation of the}} trackball). We then conducted a pilot study to determine the effect of time delays on the new user interfaces. In our experiment, the keypad was the faster interface when the time delay is short. There was no evidence to favor either the keypad or trackball when the time delay was longer. Inexperienced participants bene [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{security}} challenges being {{encountered in}} many places require electronic means of controlling access to communities, recreational centres, offices, and homes. The electronically controlled automated security access gate being proposed in this work helps to prevent an unwanted access to controlled environments. This is achieved mainly {{through the use of}} a Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter-receiver pair. In the design a microcontroller is programmed to decode a given sequence of keys that is entered on a <b>keypad</b> and <b>commands</b> a transmitter module to send out this code as signal at a given radio frequency. Upon reception of this RF signal by the receiver module, another microcontroller activates a driver circuitry to operate the gate automatically. The codes for the microcontrollers were written in C language and were debugged and compiled using the KEIL Micro vision 4 integrated development environment. The resultant Hex files were programmed into the memories of the microcontrollers with the aid of a universal programmer. Software simulation was carried out using the Proteus Virtual System Modeling (VSM) version 7. 7. A scaled-down prototype of the system was built and tested. The electronically controlled automated security access gate can be useful in providing security for homes, organizations, and automobile terminals. The four-character password required to operate the gate gives the system an increased level of security. Due to its standalone nature of operation the system is cheaper to maintain in comparison with a manually operated type...|$|R
30|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a {{technology}} that allows automatic human-computer interactions, via a telephone <b>keypad</b> or voice <b>commands.</b> The systems are widely used in many industries, including telecommunications and banking. Virtualization is a potential technology that can enable the easy development of IVR applications and their deployment on the cloud. IVR virtualization will enable efficient resource usage by allowing IVR applications to share different IVR substrate components such as the key detector, the voice recorder and the dialog manager. Resource management {{is part and parcel}} of IVR virtualization and poses a challenge in virtualized environments where both processing and network constraints must be considered. Considering several objectives to optimize the resource usage makes it even more challenging. This paper proposes IVR virtualization task scheduling and computational resource sharing (among different IVR applications) strategies based on genetic algorithms, in which different objectives are optimized. The algorithms used by both strategies are simulated and the performance measured and analyzed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: This report {{describes}} the design, development, {{and testing of}} a novel compact surgical assistant robot to control the orientation and insertion depth of a laparoscopic endoscope during minimally invasive abdominal surgery. In contrast to typical endoscope manipulators, the described robot is particularly compact and lightweight, is simple {{to set up and}} use, occupies no floor or operating table space, and does not limit access to the patient in any way. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sterilizable endoscope manipulator is sufficiently small and lightweight at 625 g and 110 mm in diameter that it can be placed directly on the abdomen of the patient without interfering with other handheld instruments during minimally invasive surgery. It consists of an annular base, a clamp to hold an endoscope trocar, and two joints which enable azimuth rotation and inclination of the endoscope about a pivot point at the incision. The endoscope insertion depth is controlled by a cable winding acting against a compression spring on the endoscope shaft. Voice recognition and miniature <b>keypad</b> user <b>command</b> interfaces are provided, and the manipulator motors are backdriveable for manual repositioning. RESULTS: Endoscope camera trajectory-following accuracy and response-time results were measured using an optical localizer. Experimental results are given comparing the current prototype with the previous cable-driven prototype. The endoscope manipulator and its user interface were tested and evaluated by several surgeons during a series of minimally invasive surgical training procedures on cadavers and animals. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscope manipulator described {{has been shown to be}} a viable, practical device with performance and functionality equivalent to those of commercially available models, yet with greatly reduced size, weight, and cost...|$|R
40|$|Interactive Voice Response (IVR) {{applications}} are ubiquitous nowadays. IVR is a telephony technology that allows interactions {{with a wide}} range of automated information systems via a telephone <b>keypad</b> or voice <b>commands.</b> Cloud computing is a newly emerging paradigm that hosts and provides services over the Internet with many inherent benefits. It has three major service models: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing is based on the virtualization technology that enables the co-existence of entities in general on the same substrates. These entities may be operating systems co-existing on the same hardware, applications co-existing on the same operating system, or even full-blown networks co-existing on the same routers. The key benefit is efficiency through the sharing of physical resources. Several multimedia {{applications are}} provided in cloud environments nowadays. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no architecture that creates and manages IVR applications in cloud environment. Therefore, we propose to develop a new virtualized architecture that can create, deploy and manage IVR applications in cloud environment. We also propose two new algorithms for resources management and task scheduling as an essential part of resource sharing in such environment...|$|R
