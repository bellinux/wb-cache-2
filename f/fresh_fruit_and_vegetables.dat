25|$|While the {{earliest}} documented case of scurvy {{was described by}} Hippocrates around 400 BC, the first attempt to give scientific basis {{for the cause of}} this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the British Royal Navy, James Lind. Scurvy was common among those with poor access to <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> such as remote, isolated sailors and soldiers. While at sea in May 1747, Lind provided some crew members with two oranges and one lemon per day, in addition to normal rations, while others continued on cider, vinegar, sulfuric acid or seawater, along with their normal rations. In the history of science, this is considered to be the first occurrence of a controlled experiment. The results conclusively showed that citrus fruits prevented the disease. Lind published his work in 1753 in his Treatise on the Scurvy.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} {{a program that}} has now {{become part of the}} World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E

There is evidence, however, that between 60 and 80% of pome, stone and soft fruits were grown, controlled and marketed according to “Integrated Production Guidelines” in 1999 already in Germany for example.

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are {{important}} parts of the human diet. The consumer demand for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> is increasing due to their rich nutritional value, appealing taste, and healthy perception. However, due to their highly perishable nature, appropriate preservation technologies must be developed to meet the consumer&# 039;s demand for healthy, additive-free, microbiologically safe, <b>and</b> high quality <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The preservation technologies based on modification or control of pressure alters the normal atmospheric pressure of the preservation environment.

Drinks are provided as dehydrated powder that is mixed with water before consumption. Drinks and soups are sipped from plastic bags with straws. Solid food is eaten with a knife and fork attached to a tray with magnets to prevent them from floating away. Any food that floats away, including crumbs, must be collected to prevent it from clogging the station's air filters and other equipment.|$|E

Wheat, the grain primarily used in English bread, was almost impossible to grow in the North, and imports of wheat were expensive. Substitutes included corn (maize) in the form of cornmeal.

500|$|Hitler {{followed}} a vegetarian diet. At social events he sometimes gave graphic {{accounts of the}} slaughter of animals {{in an effort to}} make his guests shun meat. Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> for Hitler. Hitler publicly avoided alcohol. He occasionally drank beer and wine in private, but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943. He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit [...] "a waste of money". He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit. Hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942. Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler's increasingly erratic behavior and inflexible decision making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).|$|E
