The selected air inlet velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the air inlet velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the air <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the air inlet velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the air inlet temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The air inlet temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the air <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar air <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition.

40|$|The main {{parameters}} {{evaluated with}} a conventional thermal response test (TRT) are the subsurface thermal conductivity surrounding the borehole and the effective borehole thermal resistance, when averaging the <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>temperature</b> of a ground heat exchanger with the arithmetic mean. This effective resistance depends on two resistances: the 2 D borehole resistance (Rb) and the 2 D internal resistance (Ra) which is associated to the short-circuit effect between pipes in the borehole. This paper presents a field method to evaluate these two components separately. Two approaches are proposed. In the first case, the temperature {{at the bottom}} of the borehole is measured at the same time as the <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>temperatures</b> as done in a conventional TRT. In the second case, different flow rates are used during the experiment to infer the internal resistance. Both approaches assumed a predefined temperature profile inside the borehole. The methods were applied to real experimental tests and compared with numerical simulations. Interesting results were found by comparison with theoretical resistances calculated with the multipole method. The motivation for this work is evidenced by analyzing the impact of the internal resistance on a typical geothermal system design. It is shown to be important to know both resistance components to predict the variation of the effective resistance when the flow rate and the height of the boreholes are changed during the design process...|$|R

In the first 10  m, the temperature gradient was lower than that in the other layers (thermal conductivity of layers two to six in W m− 1  K− 1 : 2.6, 2.83, 3.01, 2.87, and 2.92) due to the smaller thermal conductivity of 1.2  W m− 1  K− 1. At a depth of approximately 80 – 90  m, the EGRT (enhanced geothermal response test) provided unexpectedly high apparent thermal conductivities of 3.4  W m− 1  K− 1. As they exceed the values measured in samples from this depth range, we assume that groundwater flow has occurred in this region, which has contributed to the high apparent thermal conductivity by advective heat transport. Therefore, we used our first model to obtain the <b>inlet</b> and <b>outlet</b> tube <b>temperatures</b> at this depth range.
