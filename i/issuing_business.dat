40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the price and}} volume effects of underlying stocks around the announcement date of derivative warrants issued in Hong Kong. In general, {{the results indicate that}} underlying stocks are subject to extra buying pressure {{a few days before the}} new derivative warrant issuance, which is consistent with our hypothesis about the hedging effect created by the merchant banks that initiate the warrant issuance. Since the prices of underlying stocks peak on the first day after the warrant announcement and are stable thereafter, the information effect associated with the warrant issuance appears to be weak and does not last long. In addition, we find that underlying stocks have abnormal increases in price and volume during the last 5 minutes of trading on the warrant issuance day. This might be due to investors' buying behavior precipitated by information leakage about the successful warrant issuance and/or to the price manipulation by merchant banks in order to attain a better payoff from the warrant <b>issuing</b> <b>business.</b> (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Traditional core-banking system {{not only}} has high {{development}} cost but also acts like an information island and lacks a more flexible business model where its subsystems are independently established and hard to share data with each other. In this study we adopt Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to the core-banking system using foreign exchange import business as example and focusing on the SOA solution for {{the integration of the}} L/C (letter of credit) business process. The Service-Oriented Modeling and Architecture (SOMA) approach is used to analyze the <b>issuing</b> <b>business</b> process of the import L/C. The web services in the process are identified and then realized that enable reusability of the existing services through the exercise of service orchestration and composition. According to the established SOA layered architecture of the L/C management, we then implemented a new foreign exchange import system. With the features of service reusability and service composability, the system development time and costs are reduced and the integration can be easily achieved. The SOA solution of this study improves the use of our case bank's internal information system and the developed prototype should be able to serve as a reference for other banks...|$|E

40|$|Offshoring of {{business}} process services (BPS) {{and information technology}} services (ITS) – whether through international insourcing or international outsourcing – is transforming the way many companies do business. This paper looks at the expansion of international supply chains {{and the rise of}} China, the Czech Republic, India and the Philippines as exporters of BPS and ITS. It also analyses the nature of and factors behind this trade and identifies major business- and trade-related challenges arising. In this context it presents some of the labour market implications resulting from increasing trade between OECD and non-OECD economies. The analysis shows that the BPS and ITS sectors in the four emerging economies are very differently structured: Chinese and Czech companies are predominantly supplying their domestic markets while Indian and Philippine companies are focused mainly on supplying foreign markets. In terms of exports, they also supply different geographies: China is mainly exporting to Japan; the Czech Republic to the European Union; the Philippines to the United States; and India to the United States and UK. Several of the larger home-grown companies in the four countries are establishing significant presence in foreign markets, in particular in other emerging markets, to build capacity and leverage local comparative advantage. This highlights the fact that different geographies have different strengths and BPS and ITS-related FDI between emerging economies is likely to expand rapidly in the future. All four countries are facing supply side constraints. The low supply of senior personnel with industry-relevant experience in China, the Czech Republic and the Philippines acts as a break on growth. Many companies are also struggling to manage high levels of staff attrition and salary inflation. Regulatory restrictions are relatively few but still affect some companies. In the ITS sector, temporary movement of personnel can pose a significant challenge for home-grown exporters. The issue is most relevant for the Indian ITS sector that is dependent on sending professionals for longer visits to client premises. Slow and unpredictable procedures for <b>issuing</b> <b>business</b> visas and work permits, and quota limitations for work permits, give rise to operational challenges. In the BPS sector, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the ITS sector, data privacy and security legislation can have a negative effect on international outsourcing. But new regulations have also created entirely new business opportunities, including the medical transcription sector. ...|$|E
