50|$|Almost all {{countries}} {{from the former}} Soviet Union lack <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama.</b> <b>Exceptions</b> are three countries whose copyright laws were amended recently. The first was Republic of Moldova in July 2010, when the law in question was approximated to EU standards. Armenia followed in April 2013 with an updated Armenian law on copyright. <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> was partially adopted in Russia on October 1, 2014; from this day, one is allowed to take photos of buildings and gardens visible from public places, {{but that does not}} include sculptures and other 3-dimensional works.|$|R
40|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama,</b> an <b>exception</b> to {{copyright}} law, is {{the legal}} right, in some countries, to publish pictures of artworks which are in public space.

40|$|Making an {{unauthorised}} copy of {{a copyright}}-protected work is a copyright infringement, as is making an adaptation or a derivative work without gaining prior consent from the author or authors of the copyright-protected work. It was once questioned {{at one of the}} Berne Convention amendment meetings whether to take photographs of copyright-protected literary works was to make copies of them. The meeting concluded that taking photographs of literary works meant making copies of them, and, therefore, photographs should not be taken without gaining the prior consent of the author or authors. However, there was no discussion about photographs of other type of works, such as buildings and sculptures. Taking photographs of architectural and sculptural works permanently situated in public places is protected under “freedom of panorama”, a provision of copyright laws that permits the taking of photographs of those works, which is applied differently in some countries. This paper discusses copyright protection for those photographs, though there are not many cases available in this issue as the terminology of “freedom of panorama” was only recently coined. The discussion is based on the Berne Convention, and copyright law in the United States, New Zealand, and Indonesia. <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> may seem to limit the exclusive rights for architects and sculptors to authorise any acts to be done over their works. However, photographers also have the need to be sure that their photographs are protected, including photographs that are taken under the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama.</b> Therefore, this paper argues that the photographers who take photographs under the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> should be able to exercise exclusive and moral rights over their photographs. Although the three countries mentioned provide protection for the “freedom of panorama”, it is protected differently and, therefore, {{there is a need to}} include the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> in an international copyright treaty to avoid a possible conflict of laws...|$|R
50|$|The {{limits to}} <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> in France have a drastic effect on Wikipedia {{articles}} about French architecture. Wikimedia Commons editors routinely delete any images of recent French architecture, despite {{the changes in}} the law. For example, on February 1, 2017 the image of the new Philharmonie de Paris concert hall by architect Jean Nouvel, opened in 2015, was deleted as a violation <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama.</b> There is no clear image of the Louis Vuitton Foundation building by Frank Gehry, opened in Paris in 2016; only a poor quality image where the building is unidentifiable, and another where it mostly hidden by trees. There is no image of the Le Corbusier Foundation building by French architect Le Corbusier, and no clear image of the Centre Pompidou Museum.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> (FOP) is a {{provision}} in the copyright laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking photographs and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and other art works which are permanently located in a public place, without infringing on any copyright that may otherwise subsist in such works, and the publishing <b>of</b> such images. <b>Panorama</b> <b>freedom</b> statutes or case law limit the right of the copyright owner to take action for breach of copyright against the creators and distributors of such images.

In the same year, Spinelli's reporting on a security bill promoted by the Government caused its correction during the Council of Ministers of Italy.

5000|$|Copyright law: Very few {{works are}} exempt from {{copyright}} under Danish law {{and the number of}} images available from third-party sources is much lower than for the English and German Wikipedias. Images excepted from copyright due to laws in the country of origin are accepted. Works by the Danish government are protected by copyright like other texts with the exception of laws and legal texts. However this exception does not apply to accompanying illustrations since these can be considered [...] "works appearing as independent contributions" [...] in these texts. Government publications and Danish insignia are consequently protected by copyright similar to ordinary works. It is likely that the text of heraldic blazons is free provided that they were printed in the National Gazette, Statstidende (though the text may be free, an accompanying illustration is not). Composite works and joint works are protected until 70 years after the death of the last-living contributor. All photos are protected by copyright for at least 50 years and this protection is considered to also apply to photographs of works of art otherwise in the public domain. Photos with artistic merit are protected for 70 years p.m.a. No equivalent of Bridgeman v. Corel exists, but a similar situation exists for pre-1970 images since simple photos published before 1 January 1970 are still regulated by the pre-1995 rules which operated with a short protection span for such works. <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>panorama</b> can be applied for images of buildings, but images of permanently installed works of art in public spaces are only exempt from copyright provided that such use is non-commercial. Photos of statues can consequently only be used on the Danish Wikipedia provided that the sculptor died more than 70 years ago. A notable work of art with this problem is the Little Mermaid statue.|$|R
