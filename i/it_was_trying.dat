5|$|In June 1941, the 7thDivision {{fought in}} the Syria–Lebanon Campaign. One of its {{problems}} was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to fight three battles with only two brigades, because the 18thInfantry Brigade that was normally part of the division was engaged in the Siege of Tobruk. Accordingly, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade headquarters {{was brought in to}} provide the 7thDivision with a third brigade headquarters. Savige was given three battalions that had never worked together before—the 2/3rd and 2/5thInfantry Battalions and 2/2ndPioneer Battalion. He scored a notable success in the Battle of Damour, which he rated as his most successful battle of the war, although his conduct was not above criticism by Berryman, who felt that Savige had located his headquarters too far back, resulting in failure to seize an important opportunity. Ultimately, though, this had no significant impact on the battle.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{protected}} János Kádár's {{economic reforms}} and {{his position as}} leader of the People's Republic of Hungary from intervention by the Soviet leadership. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalise the economy of the People's Republic of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy programme in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. During the discussions within the Soviet leadership of a possible Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia Kosygin reminded leaders of the consequences of the Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Kosygin's stance became more aggressive later on when he understood that the reforms in Czechoslovakia could be turned against his 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet leadership's {{policy towards}} the Eastern Bloc {{did not change}} much with Khrushchev's replacement, as the states of Eastern Europe were seen as a buffer zone {{essential}} to placing distance between NATO and the Soviet Union's borders. The Brezhnev regime inherited a skeptical attitude towards reform policies which became more radical in tone following the Prague Spring in 1968. János Kádár, the leader of Hungary, initiated a couple of reforms similar to Alexei Kosygin's 1965 economic reform. The reform measures, named the New Economic Mechanism, were introduced in Hungary during Khrushchev's rule, and were protected by Kosygin in the post-Khrushchev era. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalize the economy of Poland by borrowing money from the First World.
