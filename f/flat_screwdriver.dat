25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a <b>flat</b> <b>screwdriver</b> being required for this change.|$|E
50|$|The Contender, first {{introduced}} in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle {{with a number}} of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a <b>flat</b> <b>screwdriver</b> being required for change-out.|$|E
40|$|An optical {{profilometer}} {{has been used}} to obtain 3 -dimensional data for use in two research projects concerning toolmark quantification and identification. In the first study quantitative comparisons between toolmarks made using data from the optical system proved superior to similar data obtained using a stylus profilometer. In the second study the ability of the instrument to obtain accurate data from two surfaces intersecting at a high angle (approximately 90 degrees) is demonstrated by obtaining measurements from the tip of a <b>flat</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> The data obtained was used to produce a computer generated 2 ̆ 2 virtual tool, 2 ̆ 2 which was then employed to create 2 ̆ 2 virtual tool marks. 2 ̆ 2 How these experiments were conducted and the results obtained will be presented and discussed...|$|E
50|$|Leatherman {{currently}} produces folding knives {{under the}} Crater name. Models range from two tools (knife blade and carabiner/bottle opener) to four (blade, carabiner/bottle opener, <b>flat</b> and Phillips <b>screwdrivers).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a <b>flat</b> head <b>screwdriver.</b> However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in blind holes. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|R
2500|$|The Boss 302 {{takes the}} Mustang GT’s {{suspension}} and adds higher-rate coil springs, stiffer bushings, {{and a larger}} diameter rear stabilizer bar. The body is lowered [...] up front and just [...] in the rear {{to give it a}} more raked stance designed to recall the original. The shocks are adjustable at the shock tower by using a <b>flat</b> head <b>screwdriver.</b> The standard Mustang traction and stability control programs have been altered with a new intermediate sport mode designed to allow for more flexibility on the track.|$|R
5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and hex head and are screwed {{in with a}} <b>Flat</b> Blade <b>Screwdriver</b> or an Allen wrench. The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|R
50|$|The Boss 302 {{takes the}} Mustang GT’s {{suspension}} and adds higher-rate coil springs, stiffer bushings, {{and a larger}} diameter rear stabilizer bar. The body is lowered 11 mm up front and just 1 mm in the rear {{to give it a}} more raked stance designed to recall the original. The shock absorbers are adjustable at the shock tower by using a <b>flat</b> head <b>screwdriver.</b> The standard Mustang traction control system and electronic stability control programs have been altered with a new intermediate sport mode designed to allow for more flexibility on the track.|$|R
50|$|The I-Line {{series of}} {{distribution}} panelboards is favored by many electricians for its ease {{and safety of}} adding new breakers. The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a <b>flat</b> blade <b>screwdriver</b> contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the breakers and panel require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Leatherman’s primary {{products}} are multi-tools and knives. Most Leatherman multi-tools are {{built around a}} pair of pliers, with up to 21 additional tools stored in the handles, including knives (straight and serrated blades), <b>screwdrivers</b> (<b>flat,</b> Phillips), saws, wire cutters and strippers, electrical crimper, bottle opener and can opener. Most models have a built-in safety mechanism that locks the active tool {{in the open position}} when fully unfolded. Models range in weight from the 12.5 ounce (335 g) Surge to 0.81 ounce (23 g) Style.|$|R
