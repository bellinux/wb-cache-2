40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{degradation of}} bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after infection of Escherichia coli with T 4 D, ultraviolet-irradiated T 4 D, and two amber mutants, N 122 and N 94, was studied by zone sedimentation through linear glycerol gradients. Within 5 min after infection {{with any of}} the bacteriophages, breakdown of host genome was evident. The first product was a high-molecular-weight material (50 S to 70 S) and further degradation appeared to occur in discrete steps. Rapid and extensive breakdown of bacterial DNA was seen after infection with am N 122 and T 4 D. Infection with ultraviolet-irradiated phage or with am N 94 resulted in an accumulation of high-molecular-weight material. These results suggest that the observed degradation of host DNA begins early and requires sequential action of several phage-induced endo- as well as <b>exodeoxyribonucleases...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, exonuclease VII ( [...] , Escherichia coli exonuclease VII, E. coli exonuclease VII, endodeoxyribonuclease VII, <b>Exodeoxyribonuclease</b> VII) is {{a bacterial}} exonuclease enzyme. It {{is composed of}} two nonidentical subunits; one large subunit and 4 small ones. Exonuclease VII catalyses exonucleolytic cleavage in either 5'-3' or 3'-5' direction to yield 5'-phosphomononucleotides. The large subunit also contains an N-terminal OB-fold domain that binds to nucleic acids.|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{bacterial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after infection with T 4 bacteriophage was studied in an endonuclease I-deficient host. The kinetics of degradation {{were similar to}} those seen in other hosts with a normal level of this enzyme. Irradiation of extracellular phage with ultraviolet (UV) destroyed the capacity of the infecting virus to induce extensive breakdown of host DNA, which was, however, converted to high-molecular-weight material. Addition of chloramphenicol to T 4 -infected cells provided data which can be interpreted to indicate the involvement of at least two endodeoxyribonucleases and one <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> having a high degree of specificity. A model is proposed showing the sequential action of two endodeoxyribonucleases followed by an <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> in the degradation of host DNA. The appearance of these hydrolytic enzymes requires protein synthesis. Infections leading to partial degradation only (UV-irradiated phages, gene 46 mutants) effectively inhibited the synthesis {{of bacterial}} messenger ribonucleic acid and of β-galactosidase...|$|E
40|$|The flap endonucleases (FENs) {{participate}} {{in a wide range}} of processes involving the structure-specific cleavage of branched nucleic acids. They are also able to hydrolyse DNA and RNA substrates from the 5 ′-end, liberating mono-, di- and polynucleotides terminating with a 5 ′ phosphate. Exonuclease IX is a paralogue of the small fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, a FEN with which it shares 66 % similarity. Here we show that both glutathione-S-transferase-tagged and native recombinant ExoIX are able to interact with the E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein, SSB. Immobilized ExoIX was able to recover SSB from E. coli lysates both in the presence and absence of DNA. In vitro cross-linking studies carried out in the absence of DNA showed that the SSB tetramer appears to bind up to two molecules of ExoIX. Furthermore, we found that a 3 ′– 5 ′ <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> activity previously associated with ExoIX can be separated from it by extensive liquid chromatography. The associated 3 ′– 5 ′ <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> activity was excised from a 2 D gel and identified as exonuclease III using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find temperature-regulated genes in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. They might {{contribute}} to its virulence. A library of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains with the luxCDABE operon added to different promoter regions was screened. First, we calculated a correction factor of 3. 1 for the luxCDABE-coded luciferase enzyme between room (25 degrees C) and body temperature (37 degrees C). For the screening the different strains of bacteria were grown at these temperatures. We then compared the luminescence to find the strains that showed at least a three-fold difference in light emission. The temperature-regulated promoters were identified. Up-regulated ones coded a glycoside hydroxylase and a hypothetical operon. Down-regulated were ribosomal proteins, a glycoprotease, a methyltransferase, an <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> and an abortive infection protein. These results are preliminary and can be validated by further research...|$|E
40|$|DNA helicase B {{is a major}} DNA helicase in mouse FM 3 A cells. A {{temperature-sensitive mutant}} {{defective}} in DNA replication, tsFT 848, isolated from FM 3 A cells, has a heat-labile DNA helicase B. In this study, we purified DNA helicase B from mouse FM 3 A cells and determined partial amino acid sequences of the purified protein. By using a DNA probe synthesized {{according to one of}} the partial amino acid sequences, a cDNA was isolated, which encoded a 121. 5 kDa protein containing seven conserved motifs for DNA/RNA helicase superfamily members. A database search revealed similarity between DNA helicase B and the α subunit of <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> V of a number of prokaryotes including Escherichia coli RecD protein, but no homologous protein was found in yeast. The cDNA encoding DNA helicase B from tsFT 848 was sequenced and a mutation was found between DNA/RNA helicase motifs IV and V...|$|E
40|$|Innate immune {{recognition}} {{is crucial for}} host responses against viral infections, including infection by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1). Human cells detect such invading pathogens {{with a collection of}} pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that activate the production of antiviral proteins, such as the cytokine interferon-type I, to initiate antiviral responses immediately as well as the adaptive immune response for long-term protection. To establish infection in the host, many viruses have thus evolved strategies for subversion of these mechanisms of innate immunity. For example, acute infection by HIV- 1 and other retroviruses have long been thought to be non-immunogenic, signifying suppression of host defenses by these pathogens. Studies {{in the past few years}} have begun to uncover a multifaceted scheme of how HIV- 1 evades innate immune detection, especially of its DNA, by exploiting host proteins. This review will discuss the host mechanisms of HIV- 1 DNA sensing and viral immune evasion, with a particular focus on TREX 1, a host 3 ’ to 5 ’ <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> (also known as DNase III) ...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli ribonucleases (RNases) HII, III, II, PH and D {{have been}} used to characterise new and known viral, bacterial, archaeal and {{eucaryotic}} sequences similar to these endo- (HII and III) and exoribonucleases (II, PH and D). Statistical models, hidden Markov models (HMMs), were created for the RNase HII, III, II and PH and D families as well as a double-stranded RNA binding domain present in RNase III. Results suggest that the RNase D family, which includes Werner syndrome protein and the 100 kDa antigenic component of the human polymyositis scleroderma (PMSCL) autoantigen, is a 3 ' [...] > 5 ' exoribonuclease structurally and functionally related to the 3 ' [...] > 5 ' <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> domain of DNA polymerases.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the preferential <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> activity of exonuclease III {{in combination with the}} difference in diffusivity between an oligonucleotide and a mononucleotide toward a negatively charged ITO electrode, a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical molecular beacon (eMB) -based DNA sensor has been developed. This sensor realizes electrochemical detection of DNA in a homogeneous solution, with sensing signals amplified by an exonuclease III-based target recycling strategy. A hairpin-shaped oligonucleotide containing the target DNA recognition sequence, with a methylene blue tag close to the 3 ' terminus, is designed as the signaling probe. Hybridization with the target DNA transforms the probe's exonuclease III-inactive protruding 3 ' terminus into an exonuclease III-active blunt end, triggering the digestion of the probe into mononucleotides including a methylene blue-labeled electroactive mononucleotide (eNT). The released eNT, due to its less negative charge and small size, diffuses easily to the negative ITO electrode, resulting in an increased electrochemical signal. Meanwhile, the intact target DNA returns freely to the solution and hybridizes with other probes, releasing multiple eNTs and thereby further amplifies the electrochemical signal. This new immobilization-free, signal-amplified electrochemical DNA detection strategy shows great potential to be integrated in portable and cost-effective DNA sensing devices...|$|E
40|$|Real-time surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) imaging {{measurements of}} surface enzymatic reactions on DNA microarrays are analyzed using a kinetics model that couples {{the contributions of}} both enzyme adsorption and surface enzyme reaction kinetics. For {{the case of a}} 1 : 1 binding of an enzyme molecule (E) to a surface-immobilized substrate (S), the overall enzymatic reaction can be described in terms of classical Langmuir adsorption and Michaelis−Menten concepts and three rate constants:[*] enzyme adsorption (ka), enzyme desorption (kd) and enzyme catalysis (kcat). In contrast to solution enzyme kinetics, the amount of enzyme in solution is in excess as compared to the amount of substrate on the surface. Moreover, the surface concentration of the intermediary enzyme−substrate complex (ES) is not constant with time, but goes to zero as the reaction is completed. However, kinetic simulations show that the fractional surface coverage of ES on the remaining unreacted sites does reach a steady-state value throughout the course of the surface reaction. This steady-state value approaches the Langmuir equilibrium value for cases where ka[E] kcat. Experiments using the 3 ‘ → 5 ‘ <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> activity of Exonuclease III on double-stranded DNA microarrays as a function of temperature and enzyme concentration are used to demonstrate how this model can be applied to quantitatively analyze the SPR imaging data...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} devised for the purification of intact DNA polymerase alpha from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. The purified enzyme consists {{of at least}} three polypeptides with Mrs of 182, 000, 60, 000, and 50, 000. These are related antigenically to the alpha (Mr 148, 000), beta (Mr 58, 000), and gamma (Mr 46, 000) subunits, respectively, of the DNA polymerase described previously [Banks, G. R., Boezi, J. A. & Lehman, I. R. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9886 - 9892]. The alpha subunit (Mr 182, 000) has a molecular weight indistinguishable from that observed in extracts of freshly harvested embryos and presumably present in vivo. As in the previous preparation, the alpha subunit is required for DNA polymerase activity and is very likely the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The ratio of primase to polymerase remains constant throughout the purification. Thus, the primase is very likely an integral component of the Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha. The purified DNA polymerase-primase contains no detectable endo- or <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> and has pH, MgCl 2, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and NaCl optima identical to those reported previously. In contrast, the Km for dTTP is 3. 7 microM as compared with 17. 5 microM for the previous enzyme. Sensitivities to aphidicolin and N-ethylmaleiimide and resistance to dideoxy TTP are unchanged...|$|E
40|$|Group B {{streptococcus}} (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae) is {{a leading}} cause of meningitis and sepsis in newborns and an etiological agent of meningitis, endocarditis, osteoarticular and soft tissue infections in adults. GBS isolates are routinely clustered in serotypes and in genotypes. At present one GBS sequence type (i. e. ST 17) is considered to be closely associated with bacterial invasiveness and novel proteomic biomarkers could make a valuable contribution to currently available GBS typing data. For that purpose we analyzed the protein profiles of 170 genotyped GBS isolates by Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI). Univariate statistical analysis of the SELDI profiles identified four protein biomarkers significantly discriminating ST 17 isolates from those of the other sequence types. Two of these biomarkers (MW of 7878 Da and 12200 Da) were overexpressed and the other two (MW of 6258 Da and 10463 Da) were underexpressed in ST 17. The four proteins were isolated by mass spectrometry-assisted purification and their tryptic peptides analyzed by LC-MS/MS. They were thereby identified as the small subunit of <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> VII, the 50 S ribosomal protein L 7 /L 12, a CsbD-like protein and thioredoxin, respectively. In conclusion, we identified four candidate biomarkers of ST 17 by SELDI for high-throughput screening. These markers may serve as a basis for further studies on the pathophysiology of GBS infection, and for the development of novel vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{demonstrate}} the bioinformatics capabilities of a low-cost computer, the Raspberry Pi, {{we present a}} comparison of the protein-coding gene content of two species in phylum Chlamydiae: Chlamydia trachomatis, a common sexually transmitted infection of humans, and Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila, a recently discovered amoebal endosymbiont. Identifying species-specific proteins and differences in protein families could provide insights into the unique phenotypes of the two species. Findings: Using a Raspberry Pi computer, sequence similarity-based protein families were predicted across the two species, Chlamydia trachomatis and Protochlamydia amoebophila, and their members counted. Examples include nine multi-protein families unique to C. trachomatis, 132 multi-protein families unique to P. amoebophila and one family with multiple copies in both. Most families unique to C. trachomatis were polymorphic outer-membrane proteins. Additionally, multiple protein families lacking functional annotation were found. Predicted functional interactions suggest one of these families is involved with the <b>exodeoxyribonuclease</b> V complex. Conclusion: The Raspberry Pi computer is adequate for a comparative genomics project of this scope. The protein families unique to P. amoebophila may provide a basis for investigating the host-endosymbiont interaction. However, additional species should be included; and further laboratory research is required to identify the functions of unknown or putative proteins. Multiple outer membrane proteins were found in C. trachomatis, suggesting importance for host evasion. The tyrosine transport protein family is shared between both species, with four proteins in C. trachomatis and two in P. amoebophila. Shared protein families could provide a starting point for discovery of wide-spectrum drugs against Chlamydiae. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes AVO 110 was {{selected}} as an efficient avocado root tip colonizer, displaying antagonism towards Rosellinia necatrix, the causal agent of avocado white root rot. The most likely biocontrol mechanisms used by this strain is competition for niches and nutrients. In fact, AVO 110 is able to colonise competitively the surface of fungal hyphae, using fungal exudates. In a previous study, we used signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) to screen a library of AVO 110 transposon mutants {{for their ability to}} grow in Rosellinia exudates (BM-RE medium). A pool of 26 growth-attenuated mutants (GAM) was identified. In this work, we used the recently obtained draft genome sequence of AVO 110 to analyse the genetic context of the genes affected by the transposon in seven GAM mutants. Among the traits affected, we have identified homologs of an <b>exodeoxyribonuclease,</b> a GGDEF/EAL/PAS protein, a transcriptional regulator, a histidine kinase, a putative enterotoxin, a peptidase and a putative small RNA. Phenotypic characteristics such as biofilm formation, persistence and colonisation of avocado roots and colonisation of fungal hyphae were studied. Mutants affected in the transcriptional regulator and the GGDEF/EAL/PAS proteins were altered in all features analysed when compared to the wild type strain. The remaining mutants presented variations in persistence and colonisation of fungal and root surfaces, except for that affected in a putative enterotoxin, which was only altered in fungal colonisation. Finally, quantitative RT-PCR experiments were performed in BM-RE to evaluate the expression dynamics of these genes {{in the presence of the}} fungal metabolites along the time. Results showed no evident correlation between gene expression and phenotypic behaviour. Comunicación en póster. Universidad de Málaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech.
