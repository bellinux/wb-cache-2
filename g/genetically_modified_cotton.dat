5|$|The governments led by Patel and Modi {{supported}} NGOs {{and communities}} {{in the creation of}} groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cotton</b> increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.|$|E

50|$|Strains of the {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis produce over 200 different Bt toxins, each harmful to different insects. Most notably, Bt toxins are insecticidal to the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, cotton bollworms and ghtu flies but are harmless to {{other forms of}} life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton as a transgene, causing it to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cotton</b> they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|E

40|$|Cotton {{production}} worldwide {{has been}} often criticised for {{excessive use of}} pesticides, especially insecticides. Consumption of insecticides (in value) from 1998 to 2008 in cotton crops has, however, only increased by 7 % compared to 50 % in all other crops. Furthermore, many papers recently reported significant reduction of insecticide use in cotton crops worldwide. This has been mainly due to the wide-scale adoption of insect-resistant <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cotton</b> cultivars especially in the USA, China and India. Elsewhere the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes and Insect Resistance Management (IRM) strategies has influenced pesticide use.
