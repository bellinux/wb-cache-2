5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his {{dissatisfaction with the}} position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's <b>education</b> <b>would</b> be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He left office on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E

Along with post-secondary education the new department would be responsible for apprentices, advanced studies and take over much of the responsibilities of the former Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment.

5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch <b>education</b> <b>would</b> attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage {{is to be used}} for social mobility.|$|E

5|$|During dialogue, diction is {{dependent}} on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little <b>education</b> <b>would,</b> and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|The Albanian government, in {{agreement}} with the Commission, had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper rank officials, taking into account the demographic composition of the local religious communities. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie, and the prohibition of military levies from non-indigenous people of the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, except for grades one through three. However, religious <b>education</b> <b>would</b> be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.|$|E
5|$|After 1935, {{the mines}} were reopened {{and there was}} steady growth in the region. According to David M. Gordon, the unrest gave missionaries {{a chance to respond}} to the Watchtower {{movement}} in a coordinated fashion. The London Missionary Society and the Church of Scotland worked together after the strike, saying that the lack of education and religious instruction were contributing factors. The missionaries and the mining companies said that a Christian <b>education</b> <b>would</b> create a disciplined workforce, a belief which was called the spiritual wing of industrial capitalism. The region's Protestant mission established the United Mission of Copperbelt (UMCB), which led to the establishment of Protestant bodies such as the Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (CCAR) in 1945 and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia in 1958 (which became the United Church of Zambia in 1965).|$|E

5|$|Higher {{education}} {{first arrived}} at Pichilemu in 1970, when the Centro Medio Profesional de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Secondary-Professional Centre) was created; however, it was discontinued the next year. In 2002, thirty-one {{years after the}} Centro Medio Profesional was discontinued, the Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano (Academy of Christian Humanism University) began to give classes of Engineering in Public Gesture Management, and Engineering in Environment Gesture Management. The university worked at the dependencies of Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards until 2008. At least ten people obtained their professional titles, while other ten {{are still in the}} process of obtaining their titles, as of December 2011. In November 2011, Governor of Cardenal Caro Province Julio Ibarra announced that an institute of higher <b>education</b> <b>would</b> be brought to the province, whose name, Instituto Profesional IPG (IPG Professional Institute), was disclosed one month later.

5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of the}} novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch <b>education</b> <b>would</b> attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E

He also accused that protesters had “little understanding” of law. Yin Yin Nwe, a member of the President Education Advisory Group, remarked that complete decentralization of <b>education</b> <b>would</b> be impossible. The advisory group also stated that government committees that would be established as mentioned in the law were not designed to control universities but just to allocate budget.|$|E

40|$|Gender disproportionality {{in special}} {{education}} has been an issue for many years. This disproportionality is most apparent among students with emotional or behavioral disorders, where males make up approximately 75 % of the population. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine referral decisions of secondary regular education and special education teachers based on externalizing and internalizing behaviors associated with emotional/behavioral disorders. Results from two schools, urban and suburban, were compared based on teacher gender and area of expertise (regular education vs. special education). The hypotheses were: Externalizing behaviors would elicit more referrals; Females would refer more; Regular <b>education</b> teachers <b>would</b> refer more for externalizing behaviors; and Special <b>education</b> teachers <b>would</b> refer more for internalizing behaviors. In the urban school, the only hypothesis supported was that regular <b>education</b> teachers <b>would</b> be more likely to refer for externalizing behaviors. In the suburban school, the only hypothesis not supported was that special <b>education</b> teachers <b>would</b> be more likely to refer for internalizing behaviors. The urban and suburban characters of the schools, along with the differences in teacher' perceptions, ages, and years of experience, likely affect referral decisions. Given the implications of referral decisions, more research ofthese variables should be conducted.

In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.|$|E
25|$|Lucrezia Borgia {{was born}} at Subiaco, near Rome. Her mother was Vannozza dei Cattanei, one of the mistresses of Lucrezia's father, Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI). Lucrezia Borgia's {{education}} was entrusted to Adriana Orsini de Milan, a close confidant of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) during her early life. Her <b>education</b> <b>would</b> primarily {{take place in the}} Piazza Pizzo de Merlo, a building adjacent to her fathers residence. Her education is common for a woman of her social stature, but uncommon for someone of her gender. Unlike educated women of her time her ascension came from within the sphere of intellectuals in court and close relatives. For most women who wanted to be educated, convents were the primary source for knowledge. Her upbringing would differentiate to others due to the inclusion of Humanities, which the Catholic Church at the time considered detrimental to the foundations of piety and obedience. This <b>education</b> <b>would</b> be successful in teaching Lucrezia; Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and some dominance of Latin and Greek. She would also become proficient in the lute, poetry, and oration. The biggest testament is her capability in administration, as later on in life she would take care of Vatican City correspondence and governance of Ferrara.|$|E
