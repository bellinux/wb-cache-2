50|$|Hide glue {{is used in}} woodworking. It may be {{supplied}} as granules, flakes, or flat sheets, which have an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. It is dissolved in water, heated and applied warm, typically around 60°C (140°F). Warmer temperatures quickly destroy the strength of hide glue. Commercial glue pots, simple water baths or double boilers {{may be used to}} keep the glue hot while in use. As hide glue cools, it gels quickly. At room temperature, prepared hide glue has the consistency of stiff gelatin, which is in fact a similar composition. Gelled hide glue does not have significant strength, so it is vital to apply the glue, fit the pieces, and hold them steady before the glue temperature drops much below 50°C (120°F). All glues have an open time, the amount of time the <b>glue</b> <b>remains</b> liquid and workable. Joining parts after the open time is expired results in a weak bond. Hide glue's open time is usually a minute or less. In practice, this often means having to heat the pieces to be glued, and gluing in a very warm room, though these steps can be dispensed with if the glue and clamp operation can be carried out quickly.|$|E

States of related systems are linked through a so called <b>gluing</b> invariant which <b>remains</b> always true during the synchronous execution of both systems. Refinement is a sufficient condition for this property. Retrenchment is a generalization of refinement which relax the constraints between both systems.

2500|$|German climber Wolfgang Güllich's {{ascent of}} Punks in the Gym in April 1985 was major achievement. [...] The route blasts {{up the middle}} of a blank, {{attractive}} orange wall and gave Arapiles (and Australia) international exposure. At the time it was graded 32 and was the hardest climb in the world, setting a new benchmark for difficulty. Following Güllich's triumph, a number of routes of similar difficulty have been put up, though none take the [...] "easiest way up" [...] such an impressive feature. The fact that 'Punks' is chipped rarely makes it into most histories. In the early 90's a climber who was unable to do the climb added a <b>glue</b> hold which <b>remains</b> to this day.|$|R
40|$|The use of glues for stone tool hafting is an {{important}} innovation in human evolution. Compared to other organic <b>remains,</b> <b>glues</b> are preserved more frequently, though mainly in small spots. Reliable identification requires chemical molecular characterization, which is traditionally performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Current methods of extraction and derivatization prior to GC-MS are destructive and require relatively large samples, which is problematic for prehistoric glue residues. In this paper, we discuss {{the results of an}} experimental study using a new method (HS-SPME-GC×GC-HRTOFMS) that proves effective for identifying small quantities of compound glues. The method is non-destructive with an improved sensitivity in comparison to traditional GC-MS, and it has a high potential for prehistoric samples. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Korea Session 195 : Collaboration, Co-operation, and Co-production in South Korea's East Asian CinemaHong Kong cinema’s kung fu films {{attained}} international success when Chong Ch’ang-hwa’s King Boxer: Five Fingers of Death (Tian xia di yi quan, 1972) {{spearheaded the}} launch of what David Desser identifies as the “kung fu craze. ” While this secured the Shaw Brothers Studio’s international marketing strategy with its cross-over appeal, it did so {{due in large part}} to the participation of a South Korean film director working in a Chinese film genre for the Hong Kong film industry. Many of the historical accounts of Chong Ch’ang-hwa’s prominence in the success of this film, the kung fu craze that followed, and his transformative input of Hong Kong cinema’s action aesthetics for both Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest remain tangential since he is not an ethnic Han Chinese. Law Kar takes this fact to label Chong as a “mercenary director. ” Despite the ethnic divide separating the Han Korean Chong from his Han Chinese peers, he <b>remains</b> <b>glued</b> to the shared promotion of Confucianism that has long linked the two people together throughout history. This paper undertakes an ideological analysis centered on Confucian notions of martial virtue to reposition Chong as an integral contributor to the reassertion of Confucian values as a continuing “civilizing mission” of its own for a Cold War Asia facing the Communist rejection of the Confucian past. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purge dams {{are used}} to form {{barriers}} inside stainless steel pipe so that the atmosphere inside the pipe can be purged with argon before the pipe is welded. The early purge dams were made with Elmer's Glue-All, which is relatively insoluble, and Dissolvo paper. The more soluble Elmer's School Glue and Dissolvo paper are now being used. When the purge dam is placed {{too close to the}} weld, the solubility of both glues is significantly reduced by-reaction to the heat of the weld. Purge dams have been used extensively throughout the stainless steel systems. The flushing of these systems to the surface cleanness criteria and the strainer evaluation particulate criteria of ANSI N 45. 2. 1 - 1973 (less than 1 / 32 -inch by 1 / 16 -inch) has not been practical. Flushing has been done with demineralized water and also with 5 -percent acetic acid. In both cases some adherent purge dam residue (both glue and <b>glue</b> impregnated paper) <b>remains</b> on the pipe interior at the purge dam location. Also, purge dam particulates up to approximately 1 / 8 inch continue to be occasionally caught on the flush strainer (or equivalent) after months of flushing on a single flow path, indicating that 1 / 8 inch is an end point for flushing this material. Continuing to flush past this point does not materially improve removal of purge dam residues. - 2 II.
