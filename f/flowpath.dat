We applied the dye Acid Blue 9 to unsaturated and saturated soil profiles at a boreal forest hillslope consisting of glacial sandy till, and determined the soil physical properties from soil samples. The {{objective was to}} characterize preferential <b>flowpaths,</b> investigate their porosity, extent and connectivity, and complement earlier findings on subsurface flow formation at the site. According to the results, preferential <b>flowpaths</b> were formed by roots, erosion related to soil water flow, freezing thawing cycles, and soil fauna. The role of roots and stones {{in the formation of}} preferential <b>flowpaths</b> was emphasized. Porosity of preferential <b>flowpaths</b> was 5. 1 +/- 1. 8 %, and they extended to a depth of about 55 cm from the soil surface; the deepest roots reached the same depth. When the soil saturated, individual preferential <b>flowpaths</b> self-organized into continuous and well-connected lateral flow systems along the slope. At the slope shoulder, preferential flow network covering the entire soil profile, as well as preferential <b>flowpaths</b> on the underlying bedrock surface, were considered crucial for runoff generation. In the midslope area, runoff generation was characterized by lateral preferential flow and the transmissivity feedback phenomenon. At the slope foot, preferential <b>flowpaths</b> in soil below the eluvial horizon were the major runoff contributors. A full saturation of the soil profile at the slope is unlikely under natural conditions. However, lateral flow was found to occur also in unsaturated soil. 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A typical {{hardware}} {{system can be}} segmented into components that each define a specific task. Components could be divided among a design team for creation, acquired from another source {{in the form of}} legacy work, or an IP core. A finalized system could be composed of several heterogeneous components. Proper integration of these components can often be complex and time consuming for designers. Available tools to aid in rapid hardware design often lack in this area and require confusing pre-compilation procedures.

A further performance penalty results from the loadexecute-store paradigm {{associated with the use}} of local variables in most high-level languages. Implementing a software algorithm directly in hardware such as on an FPGA can alleviate these performance penalties. Such implementations are normally developed in a hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog. Previous work has been completed to create a compiler for converting high-level stack-based languages to VHDL for use on an FPGA or ASIC. This allowed for special-purpose processors to be generated efficiently from high-level algorithms with minimal design time. Introduced in this paper is a significant optimization to the original <b>flowpaths</b> – we have completely eliminated the controller and modified all operations to control themselves. These new self-propagating <b>flowpaths</b> execute faster and are less resource intensive.

Analyses of the physico-chemical parameters, and comparisons of multichemical and characteristic ratios in space and time, and subsequent statistical analyses, permitted a characterisation of the hydrogeology. At the regional scale, groundwater flows from recharge areas to the springs located at the aquifer boundaries, with a gradual increase of mineralisation and temperature along its <b>flowpaths.</b> However, the parameters of each group of springs may significantly deviate from the regional trend owing to fast flows and to the geological setting of the discharge spring areas, as corroborated by statistical data. Along regional <b>flowpaths,</b> the effects of seasonal recharge and lowering of the water table clearly cause changes in ion concentrations over time. This conceptual model was validated by {{an analysis of the}} 222 Rn content in groundwater. 222 Rn content, for which temporal variability depends on seasonal fluctuations of the water table, local lithology and the fracture network at the spring discharge areas, was considered as a tracer of the final stages of groundwater <b>flowpaths...</b>|$|R

Weanalyzed near infrared aerial photos of melting snowusing a moving window analysis which can characterize correlation lengths in the reflectance of the snowsurface. Near infrared is sensitive tosnowgrain size, which in turn may indicate higher amounts of melt water; the grains growfaster if the liquid water content is higher. Correlation lengths were 5 - 7 m and the probability of finding such correlation lengths increased from 0. 22 in May, 1997 when the melt had just started to 0. 68 by late June when melt was well established. Liquid water content at the snowsurface was sampled with a dielectric sensor at 0. 5 m intervals on 100 -m 2 and 75 -m 2 grids. Semi-variograms showed a sill at 5 to 6 meters. The liquid water measurements at the snowsurface suggest that the correlation lengths derivedfrom the infrared aerial photos represent surface expressions of higher flowdensity through the melting snowpack.

40|$|Modeling {{groundwater}} flow in a karst environment is both numerically challenging and highly uncertain because of potentially complex <b>flowpaths</b> {{and a lack}} of site-specific information. This study presents the results of MODFLOW numerical modeling in which drain cells in a finite-difference model are used as analogs for preferential <b>flowpaths</b> or conduits in karst environments. In this study, conduits in mixed-flow systems are simulated by assigning connected pathways of drain cells from the locations of tracer releases, sinkholes, or other karst features to outlet springs along inferred <b>flowpaths.</b> These paths are determined by the locations of losing stream segments, ephemeral stream beds, geophysical surveys, fracture lineaments, or other surficial characteristics, combined with the results of dye traces. The elevations of the drains at the discharge ends of the inferred <b>flowpaths</b> are estimated from field data and are adjusted when necessary during model calibration. To simulate flow in a free-flowing conduit, a high conductance is assigned to each drain to eliminate the need for drain-specific information that {{would be very difficult to}} obtain. Calculations were performed for a site near Hohenfels, Germany. The potentiometric surface produced by the simulations agreed well with field data. The head contours in the vicinity of the karst features behaved in a manner consistent with a flow system having both diffuse and conduit components, and the sum of the volumetric flow out of the drain cells agreed closely with spring discharges and stream flows. Because of the success of this approach, it is recommended for regional studies in which little site-specific information (e. g., location, number, size, and conductivity of fractures and conduits) is available, and general flow characteristics are desired...|$|R
