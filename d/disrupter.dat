5|$|The {{final section}} of Brood War sees the player helping Sarah Kerrigan defeat the UED. With the Overmind falling under the United Earth Directorate's command, all {{operations}} amongst native factions in the sector are damaged, including Kerrigan's forces. To begin {{the campaign against}} the Directorate forces, Kerrigan and Samir Duran form a reluctant alliance with Jim Raynor, Protoss praetor Fenix, and Arcturus Mengsk to destroy the psi <b>disrupter.</b> After destroying the psi <b>disrupter,</b> the player leads Kerrigan's forces in a full-scale assault on Korhal, quickly breaking the UED's hold over the planet. In the aftermath, Kerrigan betrays her allies, destroying {{a large number of}} Dominion forces and killing both Fenix and Mengsk's right-hand man, Edmund Duke. Angry at Kerrigan's betrayal, Raynor promises that he will kill her one-day and then retreats. Kerrigan travels with Duran to Shakuras and abducts Raszagal, who she uses to blackmail Zeratul into killing the Overmind on Char, thus bringing all Zerg forces under Kerrigan's control. Zeratul attempts to rescue Raszagal, but the player prevents their escape, and Zeratul eventually kills Raszagal when it becomes clear she has been irreversibly brainwashed by Kerrigan. At that moment it becomes clear that Aldaris's uprising in the first episode was an attempt to stop the brainwashed Raszagal from betraying her people any further. Upon leaving Char in search of Artanis, Zeratul stumbles upon a genetics facility run by Duran without Kerrigan's knowledge where a Protoss/Zerg hybrid is being developed. At the same time, Kerrigan is attacked on Char by the Dominion, the UED, and a vengeful fleet commanded by Artanis. Despite being outnumbered, Kerrigan defeats all three fleets and eradicates the surviving UED fleet, leaving her the dominant power in the sector. Before the UED fleet is wiped out, Admiral DuGalle sends a final message back to his family before committing suicide with his pistol.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} episode, the player leads the United Earth Directorate's initial incursions against the Terran Dominion. Upon meeting Samir Duran, the fleet's vice-admiral Alexei Stukov conscripts Duran {{as a special}} advisor. The UED soon discovers a [...] "psi disrupter"—a device capable of disrupting Zerg communications—on the former Confederate capital Tarsonis. Although Duran persuades admiral Gerard DuGalle to have the anti-Zerg device destroyed, Stukov's forces relieve Duran at the last moment. The UED {{proceeds}} to the Dominion throne world Korhal IV where the player defeats Arcturus Mengsk's armies, although Mengsk is rescued when a Protoss fleet commanded by Jim Raynor arrives. The UED tracks Raynor and Mengsk to the Protoss homeworld of Aiur, but the two escape the massive UED assault when Duran inexplicably moves his forces out of position and allows the Zerg {{to interfere with the}} operation. Having understood that the UED invasion had caused Mengsk, Raynor, and the Protoss to band together against a common foe, Stukov realizes that Duran's actions and the Zerg attack were too much to be a coincidence—the Zerg were also allied with the Terran Dominion and the Protoss, and Duran had been working to undermine the UED. While Stukov takes a contingent of troops and reconstructs the psi <b>disrupter</b> on Braxis, DuGalle is unaware of his intentions and becomes convinced that he is a traitor. The player helps Duran hunt down Stukov inside the psi <b>disrupter,</b> but before he dies, Stukov reveals to DuGalle that Duran is the real enemy. [...] Duran flees after the player foils his attempt to sabotage the psi <b>disrupter.</b> Using the psi disrupter's capabilities, DuGalle and the UED are able to assault the Zerg world Char and take control of the new Overmind growing there.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, the British {{biochemist}} Edward Charles Dodds tested BPA as an artificial estrogen, but {{found it to}} be 37,000 times less effective than estradiol. Dodds eventually developed a structurally similar compound, diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was used as a synthetic estrogen drug in women and animals until it was banned due to its risk of causing cancer; the ban on use of DES in humans came in 1971 and in animals, in 1979. [...] BPA was never used as a drug. [...] BPA's ability to mimic the effects of natural estrogen derive from the similarity of phenol groups on both BPA and estradiol, which enable this synthetic molecule to trigger estrogenic pathways in the body. Typically phenol-containing molecules similar to BPA are known to exert weak oestrogenic activities, thus it is also considered an endocrine <b>disrupter</b> (ED) and oestrogenic chemical. Xenoestrogens is another category the chemical BPA fits under because of its capability to interrupt the network that regulates the signals which control the reproductive development in humans and animals.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{extremely}} high blood thrombogenicity {{has been reported}} in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it has not been clarified if the increased blood thrombogenicity is a cause of acute myocardial infarction or a mere result induced by thrombus formation at the <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Therefore, we examined if blood thrombogenicity is extremely increased as in acute myocardial infarction patients when <b>disrupted</b> plaque is present in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Methods and resultsConsecutive patients (n= 38) with stable coronary artery disease who received angioscopic examination were included. Patients were divided into two groups according to presence or absence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque that accompanied thrombus. Blood thrombogenicity was evaluated by blood vulnerability index and compared between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque. Among 38 study patients, 16 had <b>disrupted</b> plaque and 22 did not. Blood vulnerability index was not different between the patients with and without <b>disrupted</b> plaque (2395 ± 612 vs. 3013 ± 1476, p= 0. 12). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant association between blood vulnerability index and the presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque. ConclusionThe presence of <b>disrupted</b> plaque, in comparison with its absence, was not associated with higher blood thrombogenicity evaluated by blood vulnerability index...|$|R

Additional rating scales were developed to correspond to the 5 dimensions of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior outlined by E. Bronfman, E. Parsons, and K. Lyons-Ruth (1999). A robust association was observed between <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior and disorganized attachment. Ratings of <b>disrupted</b> maternal behavior revealed that disorganized attachment relationships were strongly related to ratings of fearful/disoriented behavior. Moreover, mothers who were unresolved were more likely than not-unresolved mothers to show <b>disrupted</b> patterns of interaction with their infants. Regression analyses suggested that <b>disrupted</b> behavior statistically mediated the association between unresolved status and disorganized attachment relationships...|$|R

50|$|Whereas the {{material}} of normal armour is always a compromise between hardness and ductility, spaced armour can also comprise plates with different material properties to increase its effectiveness against kinetic energy penetrators. An example for this construction is the armour of the Leopard 2 tank, which provides a slanted first armour stage (disturber), a specially hardened second stage (<b>disrupter)</b> and a softer third stage with high ductility (absorber). The disturber is to ideally deflect or at least manipulate the direction of incoming kinetic energy penetrators, which are then shattered and fragmented when hitting the <b>disrupter.</b> The absorber stage finally erodes and contains spalls and fragments.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, {{we argue that}} the neighborhood-level of <b>disrupted</b> family {{processes}} (weak social ties to parents and coercive family interaction) should have a contextual effect on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), because adolescents living in neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are prevalent should {{be more likely to}} associate with deviant (substance using) peers. We use nested data on 5491 Icelandic adolescents aged 15 and 16 years in 83 neighborhoods to examine the neighborhood-contextual effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on adolescent substance use (cigarette smoking, heavy drinking, and lifetime cannabis use), that is, whether neighborhoods in which <b>disrupted</b> family processes are common have more adolescent substance use, even after partialling out the individual-level effects of <b>disrupted</b> family processes on substance use. As predicted, we find that the neighborhood-levels of <b>disrupted</b> family processes have significant, contextual effects on all the indicators of substance use, and that association with substance using peers mediates a part of these contextual effects. The findings illustrate the limitation of an individual-level approach to adolescent substance use.

40|$|ABSTRACT: â-Amyloid (Aâ), {{the primary}} protein {{component}} of Alzheimer’s plaques, is neurotoxic when aggregated into fibrils. We have devised a modular strategy for generating compounds that inhibit Aâ toxicity. These compounds contain a recognition element, designed to bind to Aâ, {{linked to a}} <b>disrupting</b> element, designed to interfere with Aâ aggregation. On {{the basis of this}} strategy, a hybrid peptide was synthesized with the sequence KLVFF (residues 16 - 20 of Aâ) as the recognition element and a lysine hexamer as the <b>disrupting</b> element; this compound protects cells in vitro from Aâ toxicity [Pallitto, M. M., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 3570]. To determine if the length of the <b>disrupting</b> element could be reduced, peptides were synthesized that contained the KLVFF recognition element and a sequence of one to six lysines as <b>disrupting</b> elements. All compounds enhanced the rate of aggregation of Aâ, with the magnitude of the effect increasing as the number of lysines in the <b>disrupting</b> element increased. The greatest level of protection against Aâ toxicity was achieved with compounds containing <b>disrupting</b> elements of three or more lysines in sequence. A peptide with an anionic <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFEEEE, had activity similar to that of KLVFFKKKK, in both cellular toxicity and biophysical assays, whereas a peptide with a neutral polar <b>disrupting</b> element, KLVFFSSSS, was ineffective. Protective compounds retained activity even at an inhibitor:Aâ molar ratio of 1 : 100, making these some of the most effective inhibitor...|$|R
