5000|$|The 14CUX {{is capable}} of storing {{diagnostic}} trouble codes in a 32-byte segment of its internal memory that is maintained (even while vehicle ignition is off) by applying 5VDC (regulated down from 12VDC from the vehicle's battery.)

50|$|The DDEC {{system was}} {{particularly}} easy to operate, and diagnostic functions {{were able to}} be displayed to the driver. Typically there are two indicator lights, one in yellow and one in red. The red indicator represents a significant engine fault, {{and in most cases}} the engine will automatically shut down to protect the engine from damage. The yellow light represents a minor fault, and was more of a cautionary function to alert the operator to a fault that might not be dangerous, or represent immediate damage to the engine. The operator is able to gain basic diagnostic functions via these two lights also. Accompanying the two lights there generally is a switch; when pressed in specific circumstances, the red and yellow lights will flash in a specific order and the operator is able to calculate a <b>fault</b> <b>code,</b> and know the specific problem with the engine.|$|E
5000|$|On March 8, 2010, Toyota held a live {{news conference}} where its {{engineers}} demonstrated the same short circuit method on Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, and BMW vehicles. In each case, engineers {{were able to}} induce the same dramatic acceleration with no ECU <b>fault</b> <b>code.</b> Stanfords Center for Automotive Research stated that ABC News demo was unrealistic and misleading. A study by Exponent Inc. finding that the short circuit [...] "would be highly unlikely to occur naturally” and could “only be contrived in the laboratory" [...] was also issued. Toyota further demonstrated how Gilbert had allegedly shaved away wiring insulation, cut wires in the ETC, re-spliced them in a particular sequence, and added a control switch. Gilberts financial motive, being paid by Sean Kane, was also questioned. AutoWeek, Edmunds.com, and other automotive sources saw the conference as debunking ABC News claims. On March 11, 2010, ABC News further admitted to faking part of its report after tachometer screenshots were posted online. The freeze-frames showed the parking brake, open-door, and seat belt warning lights on while the car was allegedly [...] "accelerating" [...] to 6,000 RPM, indicating that the car was actually not moving. [...] Media blog Gawker.com posted the photos and stated, [...] "the tachometer footage is faked". ABC News claimed that it was [...] "impossible {{to get a good}} picture of the tachometer" [...] during the actual test, and re-edited the footage. Gawker.com responded that the edited video was even more [...] "staged". The Associated Press added that the falsified footage [...] "created ethical questions".|$|E
5000|$|On February 22, 2010, ABC News {{broadcast}} a report which apparently demonstrated how unintended acceleration could {{be caused by}} inducing a short circuit in the throttle control. In the segment, Dave Gilbert, a PhD engineer and professor of automotive technology at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, was shown in a late-model Avalon with ABC News reporter Brian Ross. By [...] "inducing a short" [...] in an unspecified circuit, Gilbert was able to cause the Avalon to accelerate dramatically. After the car was stopped, a diagnostic tool connected to the cars ECU displayed no <b>fault</b> <b>code.</b> According to Dr. Gilbert, proper design of the ETC should not have permitted a short like the one he induced to open the throttle; the ECU should have detected a fault and cut the throttle. Tests on GM vehicles, Gilbert said, did not expose a similar flaw. Autoblogs analysis queried the tests real-world accuracy, noting that the short circuit method was not disclosed outside of wiring normally independent sensors together, the ECU could {{not be expected to}} detect unrealistic scenarios, and questioning ABC News and Brian Rosss objectivity. Autoblog also uncovered that Gilbert was being paid by parties in lawsuits against Toyota. Automotive analyst John McElroy on Autoline Detroit pointed to network news history of [...] "rigged" [...] car demonstrations, including the 60 Minutes acceleration demo and the Dateline NBC exploding truck scandal, and noted that BBC News report did not include opposing views or disclose interviewees financial ties. Toyota responded by inviting ABC News to be present at its evaluation of the test.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} of the World Wide Web architecture into the product is important to understand, as all decisions for manufacturing of spare parts, scheduling for flights, and other factory OEM and airline operator functions, are driven primarily by {{what happens to the}} product in the field (rate of wear and impending failure, primarily). Predicting the rate of wear, and hence the impact on operations and forecasting for producing spare parts in the future, is critical for optimizing operations for all involved. Managing a complex system such as a fleet of aircraft, vehicles or fixed location products can be accomplished in this manner. For example, coupled with technologies such as RFID, the system could track parts from the factory to the aircraft on board, then continue to read the configuration of the subsystem’s replaceable tagged parts, map their configuration to hours run and duty cycles, then process/communicate the projected wear rate through the World Wide Web back to the operator or factory. In this way mechanical wear rates and future failures can be predicted more accurately and the forecasting of spare parts manufacturing and shipment can be significantly improved. This is called Prognostics Health Monitoring (PHM), which has become possible in recent years with the advent of electronic controllers, and is a recent evolutionary step in aircraft support and maintenance management that began as individual processes prior to World War II and solidified into a manual tracking system to support aircraft fleets in the Korean War. Support for the mechanic comes in local wireless access to technical information stored and remotely updated on board the micro-webserver component relevant to that product, such as service bulletins, factory updates, <b>fault</b> <b>code</b> driven, intelligent 3D computer game-like maintenance procedures, and social media applications for sharing of product issues and maintenance procedure improvements in the field to include collaborative 2-way voice, text and image communications. Note that this architecture can be utilized on any system that requires monitoring and trending, to include mobile medical applications for monitoring functionality of human systems when the subject is equipped with data sensors.|$|E

40|$|Scania’s {{vehicles}} are market leaders {{when it comes}} to quality. Despite this, more or less serious errors occasionally occur in the vehicles. These errors generate the so called fault codes. The more you know about the errors the easier it is to prevent them and fix them. It would therefore be an advantage to know the position of the vehicles when the fault codes (DTCs) are created. The purpose of this master thesis is to create a method to determine the position of DTCs and then use these positions to present information about the environment in which the DTCs are created. This is then visualized in a demonstrator. DTCs and positions are gathered from two separate systems which are used by different departments at Scania. The two closest positions are taken for a chosen <b>fault</b> <b>code.</b> Linear interpolation is used to determine the DTC’s position from these positions. However, some complement cases were used {{due to the lack of}} data and bad matching in data, in addition to the interpolation method. Data were collected from both internal (Scania) and external sources. The data includes operational data from the vehicles, weather and traffic data, UV and altitude data. A demonstrator was created in form of two interfaces. One focuses on a specific occurrence of a DTC and presents it in form of a geographical plot. The other one focuses on all occurrences of a DTC and presents them in form of data tables and statistics. Whether the method for determining the position of a DTC is accurate enough depends on how and for what purpose the position is used. A more accurate determination of DTCs positions requires better map data and a more sophisticated interpolation method. However, the used environmental data and created demonstrator are to be considered as a good start for the useage of <b>fault</b> <b>code</b> positioning. There are possibilities to continue with this thesis work, yet again depending on what the purpose is. Some approaches for future work are suggested.  fault code, <b>fault</b> <b>code</b> positioning, demonstrator, environmental dat...|$|E
