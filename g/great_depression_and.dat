5|$|In 1925, Kimball and Joseph W. Greenhalgh, a Latter-day Saint {{businessman}} {{who served as}} a bishop in one of the local wards, began a small securities business making and purchasing loans from local businesses and individuals. By 1927, the business became independent, and after investing $150 of his own money in the business, Kimball began running it full-time in Safford, Arizona, as the KimballGreenhalgh Agency, dealing in local insurance, real estate, debt collection, and bonds. The business suffered greatly during the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> lost much of its capital between 1930 and 1933. Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball's initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> the rise of fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, {{and there was no}} estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} World War II was over, the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into disrepair. They had been {{neglected}} throughout the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> wartime.

5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> the Dust Bowl dealt {{a double}} {{blow to the}} state's economy, which had {{significantly}} improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years.

In 1940, Texas was 74 percent Anglo, 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.|$|E

On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide Prohibition. However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and prohibition of sales on Sunday.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|Hoover Dam is a {{concrete}} arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, {{on the border}} between the U.S. states of Nevada and Arizona. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the <b>Great</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> was dedicated on September 30, 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Boulder Dam from 1933, it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress in 1947.

5|$|In 1921, the {{battalion}} was re-raised {{as a part-time}} unit of the Citizens Forces based in Newcastle, New South Wales, drawing lineage {{from a number of}} previously existing infantry units.
