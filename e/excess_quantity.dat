50|$|Many of the country's typical {{pastries}} {{were created}} in the Middle Ages monasteries by nuns and monks and sold {{as a means of}} supplementing their incomes. The main ingredient for these pastries was egg yolks. It is a common belief that the medieval nuns used vast quantities of egg whites to stiffen their habits, and developed endless dessert recipes to use all the surplus yolks. However, it is also known that Portugal had a big egg production, mainly between the 18th and 19th centuries, and that most of the egg whites were exported {{to be used as a}} purifier in white wine production or to iron suits. The <b>excess</b> <b>quantity</b> of yolks, combined with plenty of sugar coming from the Portuguese colonies, was the inspiration for the creation of recipes made from egg yolk. The names of these desserts are usually related to monastic life and to the Catholic faith. Examples are, among others, barriga de freira (nun's belly), papos de anjo (angel's chests), and toucinho do céu (bacon from heaven). Other common ingredients in Portuguese convent confectionery are almonds, doce de chila/gila (made from squash), wafer paper, and candied egg threads called fios de ovos.|$|E

40|$|A {{theory for}} the {{thermodynamic}} properties of steps on faceted crystalline surfaces is presented. The formalism {{leads to the}} definition of step <b>excess</b> <b>quantities,</b> including an <b>excess</b> step stress that is the step analogy of surface stress. The approach is used to develop a relationship between the temperature dependence of the step free energy (γ^st) and step <b>excess</b> <b>quantities</b> for energy and stress that can be readily calculated by atomistic simulations. We demonstrate the application of this formalism in thermodynamic-integration (TI) calculations of the step free energy, based on molecular-dynamics simulations, considering steps on the { 111 } surface of a classical potential model for elemental Cu. In this application we employ the Frenkel-Ladd approach to compute the reference value of γ^st for the TI calculations. Calculated results for excess energy and stress show relatively weak temperature dependencies up to a homologous temperature of approximately 0. 6, above which these quantities increase strongly and the step stress becomes more isotropic. From the calculated <b>excess</b> <b>quantities</b> we compute γ^st over the temperature range from zero up to the melting point (T_m). We find that γ^st remains finite up to T_m, indicating the absence of a roughening temperature for this { 111 } surface facet, but decreases by roughly fifty percent from the zero-temperature value. The strongest temperature dependence occurs above homologous temperatures of approximately 0. 6, where the step becomes configurationally disordered due to the formation of point defects and appreciable capillary fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} speeds, refractive indices, and {{densities of}} binary mixtures dimethoxymethane + aliphatic alcohols (C- 1 -C- 4) were determined. The <b>excess</b> <b>quantities</b> for the binary mixtures are fitted to the Redlich-Kister polynomials.

The intermolecular forces are discussed using accepted theories and the more recent conductor-like screening model (COSMO). The extended real associating solution (ERAS) model is also utilized in the analysis of excess molar volumes. The a-profile of dimethoxymethane and alcohols are computed with COSMO-RS and interpreted to be not supportive of earlier interpretations of hydrogen bonds in the energetics. Sign changes in excess molar volume and excess isentropic compressibility are discussed and rationalized in detail quantitatively.
