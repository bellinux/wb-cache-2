40|$|AbstractGas venting is an {{important}} step in the emergency repair of natural gas pipeline accidents. Accurately estimating the <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> time is of great significance for arranging gas pipeline emergency repair process. Therefore, the venting model is built with Stoner Pipeline Simulator (SPS), and the influencing factors of venting time are studied by SPS dynamic simulation. The results show that pipe length, pipe pressure, pipe diameter and diameter of <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> pipe can affect the <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> time. And then a empirical law of natural <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> time and pipe parameters is summed up, which can provide theoretical support for the organization of emergency repair...|$|R
40|$|To make {{inside of}} the {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) landfill aerobic {{as much as possible}} is thought to be preferable for promoting waste stabilization, reducing pollutant's load in leachate, minimizing greenhouse gas emission and shortening post-closure-care period. In Japan, installation of semi-aerobic landfill structure has widely spread in order to promote waste stabilization in MSW landfill from 1980 s. In semi-aerobic landfill structure, outlet of main leachate collection pipe is opened to atmosphere. Heat generated by aerobic degradation of waste causes natural convection and natural aeration arises from the outlet of leachate collection pipe to the <b>gas</b> <b>vents.</b> It is so-called stack effect. This air flow is thought to be effective for purifying leachate flowing through drainage layer and leachate collection pipes. And it is also thought to be contributing to expanding aerobic region in waste layer in landfill. Recently, measures attempting the promotion of waste stabilization are taken at several landfills at where stabilization of waste delays, in which many vertical <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are newly installed and close structure to semi-aerobic landfill is created. However, in many cases, these <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are not connected to leachate collection pipes. Many vertical <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are just installed without scientific proof regarding whether they can contribute for waste stabilization. In this study, how such installation of <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> is effective for waste stabilization and aerobization of waste layer was discussed by numerical analysis. In numerical analysis, heat transfer, gas movement by pressure, gas diffusion, biological degradation of organic matter, and heat generation by biodegradation were taken into account. Simulations were carried out by using the general purpose simulator of finite element method. Three types of landfill structure were assumed. As the results, the following information were obtained. In dig-down type landfill, installation of <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> has no effect for changing air flow. On the other hand, in pile-up type landfill, installation of vertical <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> can accelerate air invasion and significantly promote waste stabilization, if it has high permeable horizontal layer...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution multibeam {{bathymetry}} {{data collected}} with an {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) complemented by compressed high-intensity radar pulse (Chirp) profiles and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) observations and sediment sampling reveal a distinctive rough topography associated with seafloor <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> and/or near-subsurface <b>gas</b> hydrate accumulations. The surveys provide 1 m bathymetric grids of deep-water <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> sites along the best-known <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> areas along the Pacific margin of North America, which is an unprecedented level of resolution. Patches of conspicuously rough seafloor that are tens of meters to hundreds of meters across and occur on larger seafloor topographic highs characterize seepage areas. Some patches are composed of multiple depressions that range from 1 to 100 m in diameter and are commonly up to 10 m deeper than the adjacent seafloor. Elevated mounds with relief of > 10 m and fractured surfaces suggest that seafloor expansion also occurs. Ground truth observations show that these areas contain broken pavements of methane-derived authigenic carbonates with intervening topographic lows. Patterns seen in Chirp profiles, ROV observations, and core {{data suggest that the}} rough topography is produced by a combination of diagenetic alteration, focused erosion, and inflation of the seafloor. This characteristic texture allows previously unknown <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> areas to be identified within these surveys. A conceptual model for the evolution of these features suggests that these morphologies develop slowly over protracted periods of slow seepage and shows the impact of <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> and <b>gas</b> hydrate development on the seafloor morphology...|$|R

40|$|Hydrates are {{crystallizing}} {{near and}} at the seafloor from <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> on shelves where the sedimentation rate is high and hydrocarbons are being generated. When seafloor temperature, vent rate, or <b>vent</b> <b>gas</b> composition changes, these hydrates may become unstable and decompose. We have constructed a compositional kinetic model of hydrate crystallization and dissolution that can address these issues. The model crystallizes hydrate in compositional bins and allows each to dissolve at either a kinetically or compositionally controlled rate if <b>vent</b> <b>gas</b> composition or temperature causes it to become unstable. We empirically calibrate the model to venting at the Bush Hill hydrate mound in the offshore Louisiana Gulf of Mexico, show how variations in venting rate crystallize hydrate of diverse composition in the subsurface, and investigate how bottom water temperature variations similar to those measured could increase the rate of <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> by destabilizing hydrates within a few meters of the seafloor. We show that increases in bottom water temperature can cause <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> rates to increase similar to 100 %, as suggested by recent measurements, only if the dissolution kinetics are fast compared to the empirically calibrated crystallization kinetics and dissolution gases are removed rapidly enough {{that they do not}} thermodynamically inhibit the rate of dissolution.

40|$|A {{sand and}} gravel quarry at Great Sunnings near Upminster in Essex was backfilled with {{industrial}} and commercial waste (non-household municipal waste) {{in the process of}} restoration to agriculture. These waste types contain significantly less putrescible materials than domestic waste, nevertheless previous experience of farming such refilled land has resulted in crop damage and lowering of yields in early years following restoration due to the adverse effects of landfill gases. These effects may be two-fold: (a) removal of oxygen from the soil and (b) toxic effects of the gases, e. g. carbon dioxide and ethylene.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{modeling}} of post-combustion CO 2 capture has {{gained increasing attention}} the recent years. One of the main motivations behind this drive is the current limited knowledge of the operational flexibility of carbon capture units integrated with power stations. The present work presents an evaluation of various flexible operating modes through dynamic simulations of the Brindisi CO 2 capture pilot plant using the K-SpiceÂ® general simulation tool. The evaluated modes are; load following, exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>venting,</b> varying solvent regeneration and solvent storage. Solvent storage gives a large potential for flexible operation {{with the possibility of}} maintaining 90 % instantaneous CO 2 capture rate over the whole 24 h simulated period. Two large solvent storage tanks are however required as part of the process configuration in order to realize flexible operation by solvent storage. Exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>venting</b> and varying solvent regeneration does not require any additional process installations or modification, but their potential is limited by the maximum CO 2 capture capacity during off-peak electricity price periods in order to reach a time average CO 2 capture rate of 90 %.
