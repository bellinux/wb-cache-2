5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw {{the ball to the}} plate. The Mets front office supported Humber, telling him to pitch <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable.|$|E
5|$|On the February 16 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H made an {{appearance}} aiding Stephanie and Shane McMahon, {{after they were}} attacked by Randy Orton. On the February 20 episode of SmackDown, Triple H was interviewed by Jim Ross; in the interview, footage was shown highlighting the events that occurred on the February 16 episode of Raw. Ross asked Triple H <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> seeing that footage, in response, he broke character (after 5 years of marriage) by admitting that Vince McMahon is his father-in-law, that Shane is his brother-in-law, and that Stephanie is his wife, thus creating a rivalry between Triple H and Orton. On the February 23 episode of Raw, Triple H confronted Orton, before attacking him, Ted DiBiase, and Cody Rhodes (a group known as The Legacy) with a sledgehammer and chasing them from the arena. At WrestleMania XXV, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the title. He teamed with Shane McMahon and Batista against Orton and The Legacy in a six-man tag match for the WWE Championship at Backlash, which they lost after Orton pinned Triple H following a Punt Kick. After six weeks off of TV, selling the injury, he lost a Three Stages of Hell title match to Orton at The Bash. At Night of Champions, he again lost a title match to Orton in a triple threat match also involving John Cena.|$|E

25|$|Cotton Mather's The Wonders of the Invisible World {{was written}} {{with the purpose}} to show how careful the court was in {{managing}} the trials. Unfortunately the work did not get released until after the trials had already ended. In his book, Mather explained <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> spectral evidence was presumptive and that it alone {{was not enough to}} warrant a conviction. Robert Calef, a strong critic of Cotton Mather, stated in his own book titled More Wonders of the Invisible World that by confessing an accused would not be brought to trial, such in the cases of Tituba and Dorcas Good.|$|E
25|$|Balakirev's {{eventual}} undoing was his {{demand that}} his students' musical tastes coincide exactly with his own, with the slightest deviation prohibited. Whenever {{one of them}} played {{one of his own}} compositions for Balakirev, Balakirev would seat himself at the piano and show, through improvisation, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the composition should be changed. Passages in other people's works came out sounding like his music, not their own. By the late 1860s, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov stopped accepting what they now considered his high-handed meddling with their work, and Stasov began to distance himself from Balakirev. The other members of The Five also became interested in writing opera, a genre Balakirev did not consider highly, after the success of Alexander Serov's opera Judith in 1863, and gravitated toward Alexander Dargomyzhsky as a mentor in this field.|$|E

500|$|The game's setting {{garnered}} mixed reactions. IGN labeled Persona 4 as [...] "a {{murder mystery}} {{set against the}} backdrop of familiar Persona 3 elements", and while this element adds [...] "an interesting twist" [...] to the dungeon crawl and social simulation gameplay, it also causes the plot to [...] "slow down or suffer". Hypers Tim Henderson commended the game for [...] "willfully embellish absurd urban legends and other ideas with such assured consistency that the resulting whole is unshakabl coherent". However, he criticized it for the narrative's sluggish pace and for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the game is [...] "lacking in elaborate set-pieces". 1UP.com called Persona 4 a [...] "stylish murder mystery", the comparison given being a [...] "small-town Scooby-Doo" [...] adventure.|$|E

This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on The Simpsons for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria guest star as their Simpsons characters, but Harry Shearer, the final main cast member of The Simpsons, was unavailable.

500|$|Despite his {{successful}} media career, Icke wrote that 1989 {{was a time}} of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him.

[...] Days later, in a newsagent's in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.|$|E

He lauded Soyinka's [...] "stupendous display of energy and vitality", {{and said he was}} [...] "most eminently deserving of any prize".
