5000|$|The 106th Cavalry Group's {{purpose was}} to act as the [...] "eyes and ears" [...] of a field army or army group, {{scouting}} ahead of slower and heavier-equipped armored and infantry formations to locate the enemy and shield friendly units from <b>ground</b> <b>detection.</b> Whenever enemy forces were found, the cavalry was designed to determine opposing size and positions using reconnaissance-by-fire tactics, and report this information to higher command. The group was too lightly armed to engage in sustained combat, and regular infantry or armor was utilized if the opposition proved beyond cavalry-group capabilities. Another routine aspect of its reconnaissance duties involved employment of the cavalry group to fill measurable gaps separating frontline Allied units. The cavalry group was also assigned missions requiring rapid movement to bypass enemy forces, if opportune weaknesses or uncovered terrain was discovered by mechanized reconnaissance methods.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust method {{to solve the}} two coupled problems: <b>ground</b> layer <b>detection</b> and vehicle egomotion estimation, which appear in visual navigation. We virtually rotate the camera to the downward-looking pose in order to exploit {{the fact that the}} vehicle motion is roughly constrained to be planar motion on the ground. This camera geometry transformation, together with planar motion constraint, will: 1) eliminate the ambiguity between rotational and translational ego-motion parameters, and 2) improve the Hessian matrix condition in the direct motion estimation process. The virtual downward-looking camera enables us to estimate the planar ego-motions even for small image patches. Such local measurements are then combined together, by a robust weighting scheme based on both ground plane geometry and motion compensated intensity residuals, for a global ego-motion estimation and <b>ground</b> plane <b>detection.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by experiments on both synthetic and real data. ...|$|R

Waveform digitization and processing allow for both an improved accuracy and a higher <b>ground</b> <b>detection</b> rate compared to discrete return systems. Nevertheless, the quality of the ground peak estimation, based on last return extraction, strongly depends on the algorithm used. Bestperforming methods are too computationally intensive to be used on large datasets. We used Bayesian inference to develop a new ground extraction method whose most original feature is predictive uncertainty computation. It is also fast, and robust to ringing and peak overlaps. Obtaining consistent ranging uncertainties is essential for determining the spatial distribution of error on the final product, point cloud or DEM. The robustness is achieved by a partial deconvolution followed by a Bayesian Gaussian function regression on optimally truncated data, which helps reduce the impact of overlapping peaks from low vegetation. Results from real data are presented, and the gain with respect to classical Gaussian peak fitting is assessed and illustrated...|$|E
