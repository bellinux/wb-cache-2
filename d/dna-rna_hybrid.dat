2500|$|Rho-independent {{transcription}} termination is {{the termination}} of transcription {{without the aid of}} the rho protein. [...] Transcription of a palindromic region of DNA causes the formation of a [...] "hairpin" [...] structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself. [...] This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> itself. [...] As a result, the 8 bp <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.

2500|$|Bacteria use two {{different}} strategies for transcription termination – Rho-independent termination and Rho-dependent termination. In Rho-independent transcription termination, RNA transcription stops when the newly synthesized RNA molecule forms a G-C-rich hairpin loop {{followed by a}} run of Us.

50|$|The {{magnetic}} beads are washed {{to remove}} any gDNA not bound to the beads {{by a series of}} washes and <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> are recovered by elution. To remove the antibody bound to the nucleic acid hybrids, proteinase K treatment is performed followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.

The final removal of acid-labile DMT and MTHP groups could be effected by 1 h treatment with 80 % acetic acid of the otherwise unprotected <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The same acidic hydrolysis {{did not result in}} complete removal of the 2 '-O-MTHP group from the ara-C unit.

5000|$|Although {{its primary}} {{substrate}} is single-stranded, {{it can also}} occasionally introduce single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA or RNA, or <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The enzyme hydrolyses single stranded region in duplex DNA such as loops or gaps.|$|R
40|$|Bleomycin (BLM) binding and {{chemistry}} are apparently sensitive {{to differences in}} nucleic acid conformation and could conceivably be developed as a probe for se-quence-dependent elements of conformation. We report {{on the development of}} a new methodology to synthesize heterogeneous <b>DNA–RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> of defined sequence and present the results of our comparative studies on the cleavage of DNA and <b>DNA–RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> by four drugs: BLM, neocarzinostatin and esperamicins A 1 and C. In the case of BLM with duplex DNA, purine– pyrimidine steps such as GT and GC, are consistently hit, as previously observed.

40|$|Highly {{purified}} DNA polymerase {{of chicken}} embryo {{was used to}} investigate the mechanism of DNA replication. The templates used included synthetic homopolymer pairs, as well as DNA of bacteriophage f 1 and <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> prepared by partial or complete transcription of f 1 DNA. The {{evidence suggests that the}} DNA synthesized is complementary either to the DNA or the RNA strand of the hybrid, depending on the relative lengths of the two strands, with the longer serving as the template and the shorter as the primer. While f 1 DNA itself lacks template properties, the f 1 <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> are efficient templates; and composition studies show the DNA synthesized to be complementary to the DNA strand of the hybrid. These observations suggest a mechanism of DNA replication in which the initial synthesis of a stable primer by RNA polymerase plays a pivotal role...|$|R
50|$|Crab duplex-specific {{nuclease}} is a nuclease {{derived from}} kamchatka crab hepatopancreas that displays a strong preference for cleaving double-stranded DNA and DNA in <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> duplexes, compared to single-stranded DNA. Moreover, the cleavage rate of short, perfectly matched DNA duplexes by this enzyme is essentially {{higher than that}} for non-perfectly matched duplexes of the same length. It {{has been applied to}} SNP detection and RNA normalization.|$|E
50|$|RNAI is a counter-transcript to {{a section}} of RNAII and so binds to its 5' end. This alters the folding of RNAII so that the <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> is not {{stabilized}} and cleavage does not occur. This ensures that at high copy numbers (and so high RNAI concentration), replication is slowed down. Rop is a secondary replication repressor, it stabilizes the RNAI-RNAII hybrid. Rop may be especially important at preventing runaway replication at slow growth rates.|$|E
50|$|An R-loop is a three-stranded {{nucleic acid}} structure, which {{consists}} of a <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> duplex and a displaced single stranded DNA (ssDNA). R-loops are predominantly formed in cytosine-rich genomic regions during transcription and {{are known to be}} involved with gene expression and immunoglobulin class switching. They have been found in a variety of species, ranging from bacteria to mammals. They are preferentially localized at CpG island promoters in human cells and highly transcribed regions in yeast.|$|E

S9.6 mAb was first created and characterized in 1986 and is currently used for the selective immunoprecipitation of R-loops. Since then, it was used in diverse immunoprecipitation methods for R-loop characterization. The concept behind DRIP-seq is similar to ChIP-sequencing; R-loop fragments are the main immunoprecipitated material in DRIP-seq.|$|R

50|$|A-DNA {{is one of}} the {{possible}} double helical structures which DNA can adopt. A-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with B-DNA and Z-DNA. It is a right-handed double helix fairly similar to the more common B-DNA form, but with a shorter, more compact helical structure whose base pairs are not perpendicular to the helix-axis as in B-DNA. It was discovered by Rosalind Franklin, who also named the A and B forms. She showed that DNA is driven into the A form when under dehydrating conditions. Such conditions are commonly used to form crystals, and many DNA crystal structures are in the A form. The same helical conformation occurs in double-stranded RNAs, and in <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> double helices.|$|E
50|$|Nuclease {{protection}} assay is {{a laboratory}} technique used in biochemistry and genetics to identify individual RNA molecules in a heterogeneous RNA sample extracted from cells. The technique can identify {{one or more}} RNA molecules of known sequence even at low total concentration. The extracted RNA is first mixed with antisense RNA or DNA probes that are complementary to the sequence or sequences of interest and the complementary strands are hybridized to form double-stranded RNA (or a <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid).</b> The mixture is then exposed to ribonucleases that specifically cleave only single-stranded RNA but have no activity against double-stranded RNA. When the reaction runs to completion, susceptible RNA regions are degraded to very short oligomers or to individual nucleotides; the surviving RNA fragments are those that were complementary to the added antisense strand and thus contained the sequence of interest.|$|E
50|$|Fragmented gDNA is {{incubated}} {{with the}} DNA-RNA structure-specific S9.6 mAb. This step is unique for the DRIP-seq protocol, since it entirely {{relies on the}} high specificity and affinity of the S9.6 mAb for <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The antibody will recognize and bind these regions dispersed across the genome and {{will be used for}} immunoprecipitation. The S9.6 antibodies are bound to magnetic beads by interacting with specific ligands (i.e. protein A or protein G) {{on the surface of the}} beads. Thus, the DNA-RNA containing fragments will bind to the beads by means of the antibody.|$|R
50|$|Under {{abnormal}} conditions, namely elevated {{production of}} <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids,</b> R-loops can cause genome instability by exposing single-stranded DNA to endogenous damages exerted by {{the action of}} enzymes such as AID and APOBEC, or overexposure to chemically reactive species. Therefore, understanding where and in what circumstances R-loops are formed across the genome is crucial for the better understanding of genome instability. R-loop characterization was initially limited to locus specific approaches. However, upon the arrival of massive parallel sequencing technologies and thereafter derivatives like DRIP-seq, the possibility to investigate entire genomes for R-loops has opened up.|$|R
40|$|A gene {{amplification}} method that combines PCR with an enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) for quantitation of amplified DNA {{was developed for}} the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV). Samples were amplified with consensus primers MY 09 and MY 11. Amplified DNA products were reacted in solution with type-specific nested RNA probes labelled with digoxigenin- 11 -UTP. Hybrids were captured on a microtiter plate coated with an antidigoxigenin antibody. Bound <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> were quantitated by the addition of an alkaline phosphatase-labelled monoclonal antibody directed against <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> and a fluorogenic substrate. The detection limit of PCR-EIA was six copies of HPV type 18 DNA in the original specimen. The assay was used to assess HPV infection of the uterine cervixes of 65 women referred to a colposcopy clinic. In 66 cervicovaginal lavage specimens, all 23 HPV strains detected by a standard isotopic PCR assay were also detected by the PCR-EIA (sensitivity, 100 %; 95 % confidence interval, 85. 2 to 100 %). Forty-two of the 43 samples that did not contain HPV types 6 / 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, and 45 were also negative by PCR-EIA, for a specificity of 97. 7 %. Low-level cross-reactivity was encountered between HPV types 18 and 45 as well as between types 33 and 58. PCR-EIA provides a convenient means of objectively measuring PCR-amplified HPV DNA from common genital HPV types...|$|R
50|$|The {{primosome}} {{consists of}} seven proteins: DnaG primase, DnaB helicase, DnaC helicase assistant, DnaT, PriA, Pri B, and PriC. At each replication fork, the primosome is utilized {{once on the}} leading strand of DNA and repeatedly, initiating each Okazaki fragment, on the lagging DNA strand. Initially the complex formed by PriA, PriB, and PriC binds to DNA. Then the DnaB-DnaC helicase complex attaches along with DnaT. This structure {{is referred to as}} the pre-primosome. Finally, DnaG will bind to the pre-primosome forming a complete primosome. The primosome attaches 1-10 RNA nucleotides to the single stranded DNA creating a <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid.</b> This sequence of RNA is used as a primer to initiate DNA polymerase III. The RNA bases are ultimately replaced with DNA bases by RNase H nuclease (eukaryotes) or DNA polymerase I nuclease (prokaryotes). DNA Ligase then acts to join the two ends together.|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the domains}} in TFIIB interacts with {{different}} parts of RNA polymerase II. The amino terminal B ribbon is located on dock domain of RNA polymerase II and extends in to the cleft towards the active site. Extending the B ribbon is the B reader that extends via the RNA exit tunnel to the binding site of the <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> and towards the active site. The B linker is the region between the B reader and the B core that {{is found in the}} cleft of RNA polymerase II and continues by the rudder and the clamp coiled-coil until it reaches the C terminal B core that is found above the wall of RNA polymerase II.The B reader and the B linker consist of highly conserved residues that are positioned through the RNA polymerase II tunnel towards the active site and ensure tight binding, without these key residues dissociation would occur. These two domains are also thought to adjust the position of some of the more flexible areas of RNA polymerase II to allow for the precise positioning of the DNA and allowing the addition of the new NTPs onto the nascent RNA chain.Upon binding RNA polymerase II, the B reader and B linker cause slight repositioning of the protrusion domain of RNA polymerase II which allows an essential second magnesium ion to bind in the active site. It forms a beta sheet and an ordered loop that helps with the stability of the structure when transcription is initiated.|$|E
40|$|A <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{oligonucleotide}} duplex, dC(pA) 5 pG:rC(pU) 5 pG, {{which contains}} a (dA:rU) 5 sequence, {{is at least}} 200 times less stable at room temperature than the corresponding duplex containing an (rA:dT) 5 sequence, rC(pA) 5 pG:dC(pT) 5 pG. This result provides {{an explanation for the}} finding that most primary RNA transcripts terminate in several consecutive rU residues, but not rA residues. It strongly supports the idea that instability of the <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> at the growing point of transcription plays a role in termination of transcription...|$|E
40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} assay procedure for <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> {{is described in}} which exhaustive digestion of unhybridized DNA with S 1 nuclease is followed by binding of hybrids to filter discs of DEAE-cellulose. The digested DNA can be efficiently washed from the filters so that background levels of 0. 1 - 0. 2 % of input tracer DNA can be achieved, {{in contrast to the}} much higher (approximately 1 - 5 %) backgrounds obtained using TCA precipitation procedures. Short duplexes, as small as 36 nucleotides in length, which are inefficiently bound to hydroxyapatite, are quantitatively bound to the DEAE-cellulose filters...|$|R

In this approach {{the connection between}} rank-deficient polymer and rank-determinant oligonucleotide parameter, sets for DNA duplexes is transparent.

The probe is a DNA oligomer that is a complementary to the RNA of the target. The <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> are measured in a luminometer. The 40 -min assay requires one reaction tube {{and the addition of}} three reagents. When two colonies were used to add a sample of the reaction tube, 325 of 327 isolates were detected by the probe.

40|$|The {{transcription}} activator-like (TAL) effector targets specific host promoter {{through its}} central DNA-binding domain, which comprises multiple tandem repeats (TALE repeats). Recent structural {{analyses revealed that}} the TALE repeats form a superhelical structure that tracks along the forward strand of the DNA duplex. Here, we demonstrate that TALE repeats specifically recognize a <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> where the DNA strand determines the binding specificity. The crystal structure of a designed TALE in complex with the <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> was determined at a resolution of 2. 5  Å. Although TALE repeats are {{in direct contact with}} only the DNA strand, the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA strand is inaccessible by macromolecules such as RNases. Consistent with this observation, sequence-specific recognition of an HIV-derived <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> by an engineered TALE efficiently blocked RNase H-mediated degradation of the RNA strand. Our study broadens the utility of TALE repeats and suggests potential applications in processes involving DNA replication and retroviral infections...|$|E

40|$|A general {{review of}} the methods of hybrid {{formation}} is presented. The properties of an enzyme necessary for the purification of a <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> are outlined and {{the properties of the}} endonuclease of Neurospora crassa conidia is presented. The purified enzyme degrades single-stranded denatured DNA 50 - 60 times faster than native DNA and after ageing 6 - 8 weeks, the enzyme degrades denatured DNA 200 times faster than native DNA. <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrid</b> is synthesized using denatured DNA as template and the four nucleoside triphosphates as substrate and then the endonuclease is used to purify the hybrid. Methylated albumin kieselguhr chromatography is used to separate hybrid from degraded DNA. The hybrids were found to be 75 % pure. The possibility of using this method for the isolation of specific ribosomal RNA-DNA and- transfer RNA-DNA hybrids is discussed...|$|E

The hybrids had the thermal stability and other characteristics expected of non-repetitive <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids,</b> and DNA recovered from them reassociated {{at the rate of}} non-repetitive DNA. By saturating the non-repetitive DNA with Oocyte RNA a direct minimum estimate was obtained of the amount of non-repetitive sequence in the oocyte RNA, i. e. its genomic information content. The oocyte RNA contains about 20 × 10 ^ 6 nucleotide pairs of diverse sequence, which is 4. 5 times the total genomic information present in the Escherichia coli chromosome...|$|R

In PCR-EIA, a fragment of the HIV- 1 gag gene from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was first amplified with primer pair SK 38 /SK 39 or O 1 /O 2. PCR-amplified material was reacted in solution with a biotinylated RNA probe. Biotinylated hybrids were measured in a microtiter-plate EIA with antibiotin antibody and a beta-D-galactosidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody to <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids.</b> Ten copies of HIV- 1 DNA could be detected by PCR-EIA by using two different sets of primers. HIV- 1 DNA was detected in 104 of 108 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples by using SK 38 / 39 and oligomer hybridization, in 104 of 108 samples by using SK 38 /SK 39 and PCR-EIA, and in 104 of 108 samples by using O 1 /O 2 and PCR-EIA. HIV- 1 provirus was detected in 107 of 108 samples by using a combination of two sets of primers. One sample from a seropositive patient was negative in all three PCR assays, and six samples gave discordant results between primer pairs. Six of the latter samples scored negative in a PCR for beta-globin but became positive when the sample was diluted before amplification. When applied to clinical samples, PCR-EIA generated results similar to those of an isotopic assay for detection of amplified DNA...|$|R

Pulse-labeled nuclear RNA was hybridized with a single-stranded polyomavirus DNA fragment which spans the transcription initiation region.

The ratio of full-length to less-than-full-length <b>DNA-RNA</b> <b>hybrids</b> was used to calculate transcription termination frequency.
