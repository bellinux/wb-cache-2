This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing service interaction for multiplatform operations {{and is based on}} a qualitative study of the services offered by a large retail Portuguese bank in four channels: bank branches, telephone, ATM, and Internet. The functionality of bank services across such channels was captured with <b>essential</b> <b>use</b> cases, which are technology free. When customers are free to decide in which channel {{they are going to get}} the service they need, customer experience (non-functional) requirements becoming ever more important. <b>Essential</b> <b>use</b> cases were extended to take account of such customer experience re quirements. This additional information in <b>essential</b> <b>use</b> cases is very helpful, as it provides concrete and objective guidelines regarding the most suitable channel for implementing and offering each particular service. Doing <b>essential</b> <b>use</b> case modeling for multiplatform service interaction helps service providers allocate resources to the most likely channels that customers will use. It also allows them to identify areas of interaction experience that need to be improved if services offered are likely to be effectively used in the platform...|$|R

The {{goal is to}} more fully characterize those entering treatment with and without active use of their primary drug {{in order to better}} understand associated treatment needs and resilience factors. Methods We examined baseline data from a NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) study (Web-delivery of Treatment for Substance Use) with an all-comers sample of patients (N[*]=[*] 494) entering 10 outpatient treatment centers. Patients were categorized according to self-identified primary drug of abuse (alcohol, cocaine/stimulants, opioids, marijuana) and by baseline drug <b>use</b> <b>status</b> (positive/negative) based on urine testing or self-reports of recent use (alcohol). Characteristics were examined by primary drug and early <b>use</b> <b>status.</b> Results Classified as drug-negative were 84 %, 76 %, 62 %, and 33 % of primary opioid, stimulant, alcohol, and marijuana users; respectively. Drug-positive versus -negative patients did not differ on demographics or rates of substance abuse/dependence diagnoses. However, those negative for active use had better physical and mental health profiles, {{were less likely to be}} using a secondary drug, and were more likely to be attending 12 -step self-help meetings. Conclusions Early treatment drug abstinence is common among substance users entering outpatient psychosocial counseling programs, regardless of primary abused drug. Abstinence (by negative UA) is associated with better health and mental health profiles, less secondary drug use, and more days of 12 -step attendance.
