5000|$|In [...] <b>Extrusion</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of <b>Extrusion</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding.</b> In Continuous <b>Extrusion</b> <b>Blow</b> <b>Molding</b> the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The accumulator head or reciprocating screw methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.|$|E
50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection <b>molding,</b> <b>extrusion,</b> rotational <b>molding,</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume.

Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding has high equipment and tooling cost.

40|$|Recycled PET/organo-modified {{montmorillonite}} nanocomposites {{were prepared}} via melt compounding as a promising {{possibility of the}} used beverage bottles recovery. According to our previous work, the three suitable commercial organoclays Cloisite 25 A, 10 A, and 30 B were additionally modified with [3 -(glycidyloxy) propyl]trimethoxysilane, hexadecyltrimethoxysilane and (3 -aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane. The selected organoclays were compounded in the concentration 5 wt % and their degree of intercalation/delamination was determined by wide-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Modification of Cloisite 25 A with [3 -(glycidyloxy) propyl]trimethoxysilane increased homogeneity of silicate layers in recycled PET. Additional modification of Cloisite 10 A and Cloisite 30 B led to lower level of delamination concomitant with melt viscosity reduction. However, flow characteristics of all studied organoclay nanocomposites showed solid-like behavior at low frequencies. Silanization of commercial organoclays had remarkable impact on crystallinity and melt temperature decrease accompanied by faster formation of crystalline nuclei during injection molding. Thermogravimetric analysis showed enhancement of thermal stability of modified organoclays.

40|$|The {{sanitizing}} {{industry has}} had a growing importance in the Brazilian industrial sector. One {{of the most important}} steps for most of the sanitizing industries is the production processes of bottles. The production of these bottles is usually carried out through polymer processing methods such as <b>extrusion</b> and <b>blow</b> <b>molding.</b> In order to increase the industrial production safely, it is necessary to use methods to reduce the occurrence of failures. The study of production systems reliability {{can be used as a}} tool to understand and predict the behavior of industrial units’ failures. This paper studies the reliability behavior of a sanitizing industry with the focus on the bottles production. This study was based on three modeling methodologies: Global Life Distribution (GLD), Composite Life Distribution (CDL) and Optimum Composite Life Distribution (OCDL). The distributions used were: exponential, Weibull, normal, lognormal, q-exponential and q- Weibull. The reliability behaviors found by these three methodologies were compared with the reliability obtained experimentally. The OCLD methodology overcomes the limitations of both GLD and CLD methodologies, but inherits their strengths. The OCDL methodology resulted in a good representation of the subsystems as well as the overall system behavior.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} tool life {{durability}} when performing end-milling operation on modified AISI P 20 tool steel using TiN coated inserts. The objectives of this thesis {{is to develop}} the 1 st and 2 nd order tool life model when machining modified AISI P 20 tool steel and to investigate the relationship between cutting parameters; cutting speed, feedrate, axial depth, radial depth with tool life. This prediction model was then compared with the results obtained experimentally. By using Response Surface Method (RSM) of experiment, first and second order models were developed with 95 % confidence level. The 1 st order and 2 nd order tool life prediction model was developed {{with the aid of}} MINITAB software. Modified AISI P 20 tool steel were selected as the material in this thesis which commonly used to make plastic injection mold, zinc die-casting, <b>extrusion</b> dies, <b>blow</b> <b>molds,</b> and other structural components. From the results, it is observed that the 2 nd order tool life model gives less error percentage compared to the 1 st order.

From both generated regression equation, the relationship between the four cutting parameters with tool life for 1 st and 2 nd order model are, the tool life increase with reduction of cutting speed, feedrate, and radial depth excluding the axial depth. For end-milling of P 20 tool steel, the optimum conditions that is required to maximize the coated carbide tool life are as follow: cutting speed of 140 m/s, federate of 0. 1 mm/rev, axial depth of 1. 5 mm and radial depth of 2 mm.

Parison formation is the most critical stage in the process, as the dimensions of the blow-molded part are directly related to the dimensions of the parison.

A model for parison swell is proposed where the parameters of the model can be tuned from cycle to cycle to match the experimental parison dimensions. The technique was tested on a real intermittent <b>extrusion</b> <b>blow</b> <b>molding</b> machine where a target parison length was achieved by either adjusting the flow rate of the polymer or the die gap opening.
