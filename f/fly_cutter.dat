5000|$|Most <b>fly</b> <b>cutters</b> {{simply have}} a {{cylindrical}} center body that holds one tool bit.

The latter name reflects that they often {{take the form of}} a bar of steel with a tool bit fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.|$|R

50|$|Inserts {{generally}} {{refers to}} any cutting tool where {{the cutting edge}} consists of a separate piece of material, either brazed, welded or clamped on to a separate body.

5000|$|Regular <b>fly</b> <b>cutters</b> (one tool bit, swept {{diameter}} usually {{less than}} 100 mm) are widely sold in machinists' tooling catalogs. Fly bars are rarely sold commercially; {{they are usually}} made by the user. Fly bars are perhaps a bit more dangerous to use than endmills and regular <b>fly</b> <b>cutters</b> because of their larger swing. As one machinist put it, running a fly bar is like [...] "running a lawn mower without the deck", that is, the exposed swinging cutter is a rather large opportunity to take in nearby hand tools, rags, fingers, and so on. However, given that a machinist can never be careless with impunity around rotating cutters or workpieces, this just means using the same care as always except with slightly higher stakes. Well-made fly bars in conscientious hands give years of trouble-free, cost-effective service for the facing off of large polygonal workpieces such as die/mold blocks.|$|R

50|$|A <b>fly</b> <b>cutter</b> is {{composed}} of a body into which one or two tool bits are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the tool bits take broad, shallow facing cuts. Fly cutters are analogous to face mills in that their purpose is face milling and their individual cutters are replaceable. Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.|$|E

50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it.

The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} ″ to ″ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle.

40|$|A {{coherent}} artificial neural network, ANN, {{software program}} capable of real time analysis and decision-making is utilized {{in this work}} for the automatic detection and diagnostics of tool wear during a surfacing milling operation using a <b>fly</b> <b>cutter.</b> Several sensors were utilized to collect data indirectly related to wear: current measurements from the spindle and two (x, y) drive motors, three (x, y, z) components of cutting force, and acoustic emission. Furthermore, direct wear measurements were collected using image capturing and dimensional measurements of the worn location (not performed in real-time).

40|$|Optical {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} crucial {{to the development of}} complex and optical-electromechanical devices used in many photonics products. The fabrication of high-quality freeform lens is based on ultra-precision freeform machining technology which allows direct machining of freeform surfaces with submicrometric form accuracy and nanometric surface finish. In this paper, the application of ultra-precision freeform machining to the fabrication of an optical freeform surface is addressed. The methodology {{for the development of the}} tool path generator for a progressive lens is discussed. According to the model of the freeform surface, which is represented by a double cubic B-spline surface, the method of changing parameters is used to calculate the numerically controlled (NC) machining tool path. The formula for calculating cutter location data, which considers the compensation of both the tool nose radius and tool swing radius of the <b>fly</b> <b>cutter,</b> is deduced. The cutting experiment of machining a freeform progressive optics lens by a multiaxis ultra-precision machine tool shows that the developed tool path generator can perform its function successfully.

The contact stress and transmission errors under load were examined. First, a mesh generation program was developed according to the mathematical model of a curvilinear gear generated using a male <b>fly</b> <b>cutter.</b> A finite element model containing one contacting tooth pair was built, and the mesh density at the contact-sensitive area was adjusted to attain a reasonable finite element model for estimating the contact pressure. Adequate mesh density at the possible contact region predicted by tooth contact analysis was defined based on the theoretical Hertzian contact stress and the calculated contact ellipse. A finite element model containing five tooth pairs was developed and applied to examine the contact stress and transmission errors under load of the modified curvilinear gear set. Finally, numerical examples were provided to demonstrate the contact stress and transmission errors under load for various design parameters and loads...|$|E
