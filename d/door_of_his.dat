5|$|On 30 November 1974, an {{assassination}} attempt was made on Kiep, during which a man fired three shots at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sauna, though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself.|$|E

On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} and meetings for No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995) began in 1993 between members Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young, and musician Gary Angle. The material produced with Angle was hugely rejected by Interscope Records' officials, {{and had the}} members work with producer Matthew Wilder instead. Upset with working with someone outside the band, Eric eventually stopped recording with the band, and encouraged the remaining members to write the group's songs, as he felt threatened when he did so. After Kanal broke off his seven-year relationship with Gwen, both of them wrote several more songs, until there was enough material for an album. The single's inspiration came when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, his then-girlfriend, through the bathroom <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parents' house in Yorba Linda, California; Stefani later revamped the lyrics to discuss her breakup with Kanal.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's tomb reliefs and {{the false}} <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tomb {{indicate}} his wealth and power. Seneb {{is described as}} the owner of several thousand cattle and is shown in various scenes of domestic life – being carried in a litter, sailing in a boat in the Nile Delta, or receiving his children. The false door shows Seneb carrying out the standard activities of a high-ranking courtier such as inspecting his linen and cattle, receiving accounts and overseeing his retainers. He is shown wearing kilts and a priestly robe made of panther skin, and carrying symbols of his office such as a sceptre and staff. One relief shows him accompanied by two pet dogs, each captioned with a name. He is depicted using what were evidently custom-made items of furniture, such as low stools and a specially adapted litter with a low back and large side-panels to conceal his legs.|$|E

His next stop was at the Vrubliauskas farm, where he killed Vytautas Vrubliauskas and wounded his mother Jadvyga and sister Zofija. Zofija Vrubliauskaitė, who lived in Širvintos and came to visit the family on the weekend, died the same night in Širvintos hospital while undergoing surgery. Jadvyga Vrubliauskienė died a week later in Vilnius Red Cross Hospital.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized that something was wrong and decided to head to the bridge. However, when he got to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window. The rising water column carried the chief officer upwards in the staircase until, only seconds from drowning, he arrived at the corridor next to the ship's sauna, which was below the main deck and thus above the surface.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 November 1995 (12th of Heshvan on the Hebrew Calendar), Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist who opposed {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords. Rabin had been {{attending}} a mass rally at the Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv, held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards the open <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital with considerable delay, where he died on the operating table less than 40 minutes later due to blood loss and a punctured lung. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres, was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Peter Herdic {{used his}} wealth to gain {{political}} power in Williamsport and Lycoming County, and led the drive to have Williamsport chartered as a city in 1866. He spent $20,000 to get elected mayor of Williamsport in 1869. Local saloon keepers reported that Herdic would leave $10 and $20 bills among the bottles of their taverns for anybody that would vote {{for him in the}} election. Prior to Herdic's arrival, the Newberry section of Williamsport was known as Jaysburg and had vied with Williamsport to be the county seat of Lycoming County. Herdic saw to it that the rival community on the west bank of Lycoming Creek would no longer compete with Williamsport by leading the cause to annex the community to Williamsport. Herdic had such influence {{that he was able to}} have the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad move their passenger station from the Pine Street area to his Herdic Hotel on West Fourth Street. Herdic was able to profit from this since the trains would now deposit their passengers at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opulent hotel.|$|E

25|$|Craig Lowndes {{left the}} first {{event of the}} {{championship}} leading the points standings ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Shane Van Gisbergen. Lowndes' teammate Jamie Whincup won the first race of the weekend ahead of Lowndes and Van Gisbergen. Lowndes then won the second race ahead of Scott McLaughlin—in a strong début for the Volvo S60—and Whincup. James Courtney lost the passenger-side front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car after contact with Lee Holdsworth. Courtney recovered to take the win in the third race ahead of Lowndes and Van Gisbergen. The third race saw a number of incidents occur. Will Davison made heavy contact with the wall at turn eight after a touch from James Moffat, sustaining significant damage to his car. After the safety car period to recover Davison's car, Jason Bright rolled at the Senna Chicane following contact with Garth Tander and Tim Slade with Holdsworth, Scott Pye and Chaz Mostert also suffering significant damage. Nick Percat also crashed at turn eight while running third in the closing stages. Controversial penalties were awarded to Van Gisbergen and Rick Kelly, who were alleged to be travelling too quickly at the first safety car restart, and to Whincup, whose car controller was deemed to have worked on the car during his second pit stop. Whincup made contact with Michael Caruso while making his way back through the field, forcing both cars to pit for a lengthy period.|$|E

500|$|Rosas {{failed to}} realize that discontent was {{steadily}} growing throughout the country. Throughout the 1840s he became increasingly secluded in his country house in Palermo, some miles away from Buenos Aires. There he ruled and lived under heavy protection provided by guards and patrols. He declined to meet with his ministers and relied solely on secretaries. His daughter Manuela replaced his wife at {{his right hand and}} became the link between Rosas and the outside world. The reason for Rosas's increasing isolation was given by a member of his secretariat: [...] "The dictator is not stupid: he knows the people hate him; he goes in constant fear and always has one eye on the chance to rob and abuse them and the other on making a getaway. He has a horse ready saddled at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office day and night".|$|E

500|$|Anthony Cave Brown, {{author of}} Bodyguard of Lies, wrote [...] "Soon, Bazna had ingratiated {{himself to the}} extent that Sir Hughe {{elevated}} him from purely household duties to a position of some power within the residency and embassy. He dressed him in an imposing blue uniform, gave him a peaked cap, and used him as a guard to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> study; Bazna excluded visitors when Sir Hughe was thinking or napping. For ceremonial occasions, Sir Hughe dressed him in richly embroidered brocade, shoes with turned up toes, a fez with a tassel, gave him an immense scimitar, and placed him on the main door. Sir Hughe also paid him more than the 100 Turkish lira that was standard for a valet, and quietly {{turned a blind eye to}} the fact that Bazna was having an affair with Lady Knatchbull-Hugessen's handmaiden in the servants' quarters." [...] Bazna often sang German Lieder after lunch while Knatchbull-Hugessen played the piano, much to the ambassador's enjoyment.|$|E

[...] was released as the seventh and final single from Tragic Kingdom; it peaked at number 51 on the Dutch Single Top 100. Despite being a Dutch-only single, a music video (directed by Sophie Muller) was made to promote the single.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> beloved.|$|E
