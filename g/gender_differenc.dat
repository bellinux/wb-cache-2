40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis entitled "The gender {{aspects of}} homelessness" is about {{men and women}} without their home. The bachelor thesis {{is focused on the}} difference of perception of women and men without their home regarding their situation. The theoretical part deals with the issue of the homelessness, history, division, gender aspects. The thesis explains the concept of gender, social congnition, gender stereotypes in the society and in homelessness. The aim of the research is to answer the research question "How homeless women and homeless men perceive their situation given their gender?

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} affect a person’s choice {{to work in a}} specific sector, looking at both aspects of utility maximization and availability of alternatives in sector choice. In this study, the sector choice of prime-age salaried workers is viewed as a three-way choice among for-profit, nonprofit, and public sectors. The analysis results using 2003 - 2007 Current Population Survey September supplement data indicate that people working in education and health industries are more likely to work in the nonprofit sector, and that one’s industry is in fact the most determining factor in sector choice. The findings also suggest that women holding managerial and professional positions and those with more education are more likely to work for nonprofits implying a brain drain of the female workforce into the nonprofit sector.

40|$|After oral ingestion, {{alcohol is}} slowly {{absorbed by the}} stomach, but is rapidly absorbed by simple {{diffusion}} once it passes into the small intestine. The oral pharmacokinetics of ethanol is subject to large interindividual variation in blood alcohol concentrations, even when the dose of ethanol is adjusted for gender and given to subjects who have fasted or have received a standardized meal before the dose (O’Connor et al., 1998). Total volumes of body water and liver per unit of lean body mass {{should be taken into}} consideration as factors that influence the results of metabolic studies of ethanol. Since women have more fat and less body water per unit of lean body mass, they have higher blood alcohol concentrations than men after a dose of ethanol based on total body weight. Men and women have nearly identical peak blood alcohol concentrations after the same dose of alcohol per unit of total body water (Goist & Sutker, 1985). Some studies still found higher alcohol elimination rates in women, despite adjustment of the dose for total body water (Thomasson et al., 1995). Women have a proportionately larger volume of liver per unit of lean body mass than men. When alcohol elimination rates were obtained by the intravenous steady-state infusion method, no <b>gender</b> <b>differenc...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to investigate the vocabulary learning strategies employed by the undergraduate students of Sardar Bahadur Khan Women’s University (SBKWU) and University of Balochistan (UOB), Quetta, Pakistan. A quantitative design was employed in this study to answer the two research questions of the present study. The quantitative data was obtained from the responses of 180 undergraduates in a questionnaire adapted from the study by Noor and Amir (2009) on vocabulary learning strategies proposed by Gu and Johnson (1996). The questionnaire comprised of 45 close-ended items on four broad vocabulary learning strategies, metacognitive regulation strategy, cognitive strategy, memory strategy, and activation strategy. Descriptive statistics was run in SPSS to obtain the results. The independent-samples t-test was run to test for statistically significant differences if any in the use of vocabulary learning strategies across the undergraduates of two universities. However, cognitive regulation strategy, and activation strategy emerged as the most influential source of learning new English words. The findings also revealed that there were no statistically significant differences found in practicing vocabulary learning strategies between undergraduates of SBKWU and UOB. The findings of the study have implications on enhancing teaching and learning by acquainting students with vocabulary learning strategies that can enhance their vocabulary in English language and can result to boost up their proficiency in this language.

To date, no study has compared {{the age of}} peak performance between AF and NAF runners. The present research is {{an analysis of the}} age and running {{performance of}} top AF and NAF athletes, using the hypothesis that AF athletes were younger and faster than NAF athletes. Methods: Age and performance of male and female AF and NAF athletes in half-marathons and marathons held in Switzerland in 2000 – 2010 were investigated using single and multilevel hierarchical regression analyses. Results: For half-marathons, male NAF runners were older than male AF runners (P = 0. 02; NAF, 31. 1 years ± 6. 4 years versus AF, 26. 2 years ± 4. 9 years), and their running time was longer (P = 0. 02; NAF, 65. 3 minutes ± 1. 7 minutes versus AF, 64. 1 minutes ± 0. 9 minutes). In marathons, differences between NAF and AF male runners in age (NAF, 33. 0 years ± 4. 8 years versus AF, 28. 6 years ± 3. 8 years; P 0. 05) or running time (NAF, 75. 0 minutes ± 3. 7 minutes versus AF, 75. 6 minutes ± 5. 3 minutes; P > 0. 05) between NAF and AF female half-marathoners. For marathoners, NAF women were older than AF female runners (P = 0. 03; NAF, 31. 6 years ± 4. 8 years versus AF, 27. 8 years ± 5. 3 years), but their running times were similar (NAF, 162. 4 minutes ± 7. 2 minutes versus AF, 163. 0 minutes ± 7. 0 minutes; P > 0. 05). Conclusion: In Switzerland, the best AF male half-marathoners and marathoners were younger and faster than the NAF counterpart runners. In contrast to the results seen in men, AF and NAF female runners had similar performances. Future studies need to investigate performance and age of AF and NAF marathoners in the World Marathon Majors Series.
