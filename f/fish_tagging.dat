50|$|Some {{well known}} tagging {{programs}} in the United States are the South Carolina Marine Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program and the Virginia Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program. The South Carolina Marine Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program began in 1974 {{and it is now}} the largest public tagging program in the Southeastern United States. Anglers are trained and then receive a tag kit with tags, applicator, and instructions. When they tag a fish, anglers use a reply postcard they receive in advance to send the information on the tag number, tag date, location, species, and size. This program issues anglers who tag and release 30 or more eligible species within a year a conservation award. When an angler recaptures a tagged fish, he then should report the recapture. If possible the tag number and the mailing address should be reported along with the location and date of the recapture as well with the measurement of the fish. The objective is to provide biologists with the necessary information to determine growth rate through an accurate measurement. The Virginia Game <b>Fish</b> <b>Tagging</b> Program started operations in 1995 and keeps records on recaptured fish since then. This is an annual program that starts in January and it is limited to 160 anglers. Anglers receive training workshops in February and March.|$|E

50|$|To allow migratory {{salmon and}} sea trout to {{negotiate}} the barrage a fish pass with fish counter and viewing area is installed next to the north bank pavilion.Some angling groups argue that the progress of migratory fish is delayed below the barrier as fish have difficulty finding the very narrow entrance to the fish pass and that excessive numbers of foraging seals {{are taking advantage of}} this delay and are predating these fish and thus damaging the recovery of salmonids on the Tees.The fish pass still only has provisional approval from the Environment Agency and as an interim measure fish pen stocks are being used on the river and the barrage lock is being operated {{in such a way as}} to allow fish to pass.Starting in April 2008 British Waterways commissioned a three-year electronic <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> survey to help understand the interactions and relationships between various wildlife at the barrage focusing on seal numbers and salmonid migration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [...] A tag was {{developed}} and tested for the long-term marking of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). The tag is retained without corrosion and with minor skin abrasion. They have not been lost from fish held in captivity for up to 3 years. Most recoveries were in the immediate release area, but some fish were recovered 250 to 7, 000 km from the release area. The greatest distance travelled (7, 000 km) was by a <b>fish</b> <b>tagged</b> in June 1980 in Queen Charlotte Sound and recovered in November 1982 off the northeast coast of Japan. The recovery rate for <b>fish</b> <b>tagged</b> and released in the Strait of Georgia and standardized for catch suggested that movement of spiny dogfish throughout heir range is {{an important aspect of}} their biology. Less movement was exhibited by <b>fish</b> <b>tagged</b> in the Hecate Strait region. However, of the fish that did move, the majority were recaptured off Washington and the west coast of Vancouver Island and not in the Strait of Georgia. Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) have been an important commercial species off the west coast of Canada and are perceived by fishermen to be a serious predator of other commercially important species.

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} factors that {{influence}} a recreational fisherman 2 ̆ 7 s choice to participate in citizen <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> programs by identifying factors that influence participation in these programs and by exploring three alternative causal models for explaining participation in <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> projects: a values-beliefs-norms (VBN) model, a values-attitudes-behavior (VAB) model, and a full theoretical model including socio-demographic and explanatory variables. One hundred recreational fishermen in Plum Island, Massachusetts were given a written survey designed to investigate their experiences with tagging programs, along with their attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs regarding such programs. Responses to the survey were compared between participants and non-participants. Survey items were then used to create behavioral variable indexes and were correlated to a willingness-to-participate index. Three psycho-social behavioral models (VBN, VAB, and the full model) were built and compared to determine which model best fits the data. Although few variables distinguished participants from non-participants in volunteer <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> programs, several important factors strongly influenced willingness to participate. Subjective norms, personal obligation, and personal commitment all strongly correlated with willingness to participate. A comparison of three alternative causal models showed that the use of a full theoretical model, including different psycho-social variables as well as demographic and situational factors, provided the best fit for this behavior. Additionally, the modeled data showed that the strongest direct influence of willingness to participate in a volunteer <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> program was personal commitment; while perceptions of positive outcomes were a result, rather than a determinant of participation. This suggests that attempting to increase fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge regarding <b>fish</b> <b>tagging</b> program through educational programs, as is commonly suggested in public engagement literature, is not an optimal strategy. Program scientists and managers could increase participation by reaching out through social networks in order to find fishermen who share a strong sense of personal commitment to their fishery and the areas in which they fish. ...|$|E

In efforts to assist the hydraulic and biological communities in managing this hydroelectric project, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was applied to the spillway, stilling basin, and tailrace zones downstream of the dam. To simulate the highly transient and turbulent flow conditions in this region, a free-surface computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical model has been applied. This model is based on the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method, and is capable of simulating sudden discontinuities in the free surface, including wave breakup. The model solves the non-hydrostatic Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations over variable-sized hexahedral cells. To validate the ability of the numerical model to simulate flows downstream of the spillway, the model was validated against data from three different physical models at scales of 1 : 36, 1 : 40, and 1 : 80. Results from these physical models allow for validation of the numerical model at various scales of motion from the small scale highly dynamic variations near the baffle blocks (1 : 36 and 1 : 40 scale) to the larger scale general circulation patterns that encompass the tailrace (1 : 80 scale) ...|$|E
