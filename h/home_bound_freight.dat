40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is to demonstrate that <b>home</b> <b>bound</b> art-therapy with the elderly is feasible, and to explore the effect of its practice on the symptoms of depression. This research was conducted {{during the course of a}} Master's degree practicum in a psychogeriatric clinic of a French hospital in Montreal. This pilot study explore four main aspects: (1) the pragmatic dimension of the <b>home</b> <b>bound</b> art-therapy practice; (2) the exploratory study of the effects of art-therapy on the incidence of depressive symptoms, according to Beck's (1961) Depression Scale; (3) the analysis of the graphic elements of the image based on an observation scale inspired from the Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale (Gantt, 1998) and finally; (4) the presentation of case studies (clinical case) of elderly people that have benefited from individual in home art-therapy sessions during the practicum. Four subjects participated in this study, which used a mix-method investigation (qualitative and quantitative). Although the results cannot be generalised, this study tend to indicate that <b>home</b> <b>bound</b> art-therapy is a feasible practice that could positively affect the depressive symptoms of the elderly...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Object: Identification and {{selection}} of patients suffering from terminal stage in bed ridden condition upto village level {{and to determine}} the type of palliative care need. Also to asses {{the effectiveness of the}} palliative care provided at the bed side. Materials: All registered patients under palliative care of Regional Cancer Centre, Agartala from 2014 April to 2016 March. Methods: A retrospective study. Ten teams comprising of doctors, nurses, pharmacists & Social Workers were trained and engaged in this study for symptom assessment and pain relief of palliative patients. Results: It is highly beneficial for the bed ridden & <b>home</b> <b>bound</b> cancer patients with improved quality of life due to regular home visits and medicine distribution by trained medical personnel. Short term benefits in symptom like pain, nausea & vomiting, retention of urine, constipation, bloating, fever etc. was dramatic after medication by palliative team. Patients also get relief as a result of repeated visit of palliative care team. Conclusion: Home based palliative care is beneficial for the bed ridden and <b>home</b> <b>bound</b> chronically ill patients including cancer patients. Bed ridden patients should be cared by palliative care team at least in every week...|$|R
