5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees {{marriage as a}} unique bond between {{two people who are}} in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light.</b> There are often political or other non-romantic functions that must be served and the relative wealth and power of the potential spouses may be considered. Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light.</b> The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E
5|$|While later {{reviews of}} the album saw It Was Written <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light</b> than {{previous}} reviews had, the subject matter was still seen as a major flaw of the album. Music critics perceived Nas' violent, fantastical mafioso stories as lacking the emotion and truthfulness of his debut album. While Illmatic is often held as Nas's magnum opus, It Was Written was not only perceived by critics {{as part of a}} sophomore jinx, but was also the first of Nas's subsequent work to be heavily judged and compared to the former. However, It Was Written has been noted as his commercial breakthrough by critics, as it boosted the rapper's image in the mainstream and helped attract a much larger fan-base.|$|E

5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light</b> than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new {{historical}} content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, {{and a number of}} medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E

25|$|The {{basis of}} the {{correspondence}} theory {{is that there is}} a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to Neoplatonism and the philosopher Plotinus in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light,</b> claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning. Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.|$|E

The debates in other dialogues, for example, the Timaeus and the Philebus, can then be understood in new ways and incorporated into the Tübingen reconstruction. Allusions to the unwritten doctrines can even be found, it is argued, in Plato's early dialogues.|$|E

25|$|Horney {{looked at}} {{neurosis}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light</b> from other psychoanalysts of the time. Her expansive {{interest in the}} subject led her to compile a detailed theory of neurosis, with data from her patients. Horney believed neurosis to be a continuous process—with neuroses commonly occurring sporadically in one's lifetime. This was in contrast to the opinions of her contemporaries who believed neurosis was, like more severe mental conditions, a negative malfunction of the mind in response to external stimuli, such as bereavement, divorce or negative experiences during childhood and adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Théoden's {{decisions}} {{leading up}} to the battle at Helm's Deep are also portrayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light</b> than in the novels. His decision to take his people to the relative safety of the mountain stronghold rather than confront Saruman's army in open battle is presented as a grave strategic misjudgement that is only rectified when Gandalf arrives with Éomer's army and the Huorns to save the day. In the books, Théoden rides forth intending to meet the army of Saruman on the plains of Rohan but reluctantly reroutes to Helm's Deep at the urging of Gandalf after receiving reports that the approaching foes were a vastly superior force. When the fortress seems on the verge of falling after a night of overwhelming attacks, Théoden is near despair in the film until Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) convinces him to mount his horse and lead a charge out of the Hornburg at sunrise. In the book, this recklessly valiant counter-attack is made at Théoden's initiative.|$|E

25|$|In the 1821 Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, both Mexico and Central America {{declared}} {{their independence}} after three centuries of Spanish rule and formed the First Mexican Empire, although Central America quickly rejected the union. After priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's 1810 Grito de Dolores (call for independence), the insurgent army began an eleven-year war. At first, the Criollo class {{fought against the}} rebels. But in 1820, a military coup in Spain forced Ferdinand VII to accept {{the authority of the}} liberal Spanish Constitution. The specter of liberalism that could undermine the authority and autonomy of the Roman Catholic Church made the Church hierarchy in New Spain view independence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light.</b> In an independent nation, the Church anticipated retaining its power. Royalist military officer Agustín de Iturbide proposed uniting with the insurgents with whom he had battled, and gained the alliance of Vicente Guerrero, leader of the insurgents in a region now bearing his name. Royal government collapsed in New Spain and the Army of the Three Guarantees marched triumphantly into Mexico City in 1821.|$|E

500|$|Visages, his 1999 {{piece for}} 2 tubas and 2 euphoniums, was {{described}} as [...] "astringent, often whimsical but well written for these instruments". Puw {{said that in the}} piece [...] "Freedom is granted to the performers to make any subtle facial expressions that add to the musical interpretation". Puw describes [...] (a piece for solo piano, composed for the 2000 Bangor New Music Festival) as an [...] "intimate reflection" [...] upon the music of, and a tribute to, Robert Schumann, his [...] "intricate compositional style" [...] and [...] "world of delicate expression". The music becomes [...] "simpler and softer" [...] throughout the piece, moving from the [...] "rhythmic complexity" [...] of the opening bars through to slow quavers transforming into triplets. An ensemble piece, different light (for clarinet, violin, cello and piano) was [...] "inspired by the idea of moving a picture from one place to another, be it to another house, or from one room to the next, or even from one wall to another." [...] As the picture is moved, it looks the same but is perceived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light.</b> Puw attempts to convey this in musical terms by having each instrument enter separately with its own musical phrase {{in the first part of}} the piece. Then, in the second part of the piece, all the thematic material is repeated with the instruments playing simultaneously, so that the music is similarly perceived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>light.</b> different light was featured at the 2001 UKwithNY festival at the Angel Orensanz Center in New York City. His 2005 composition for the Bangor New Music Festival, Stereo Type, was written for amplified typewriters and tape.
