50|$|There {{was more}} media {{coverage}} for the 1996 Paralympics in Australia than there was for previous Paralympic Games. The Australian Paralympic Federation set a goal {{prior to the start}} of the Games to do just this, with a focus on attaining coverage in sections other than the sport pages of newspapers. Media outlets that covered Australia at the Paralympics included Who Weekly, ABC Radio National, Nine Network's Today Show, Channel Seven's AM and Witness programs, and coverage in all the national newspapers. Channel Seven, an Australian commercial station, sent a crew to Atlanta to cover the Games. The crew did live interviews, and helped provide coverage of the Games. This coverage included several segments of fifteen minutes during the station's news programs. Media coverage of the Games was aided by the time difference: Event results came in live during morning shows on Australian radio.

This success was largely accomplished through agricultural policy and trade reform, food market liberalization, and public investment in agricultural infra-structure and agricultural research.

At the same time, increased urbanization and the rising middle class are changing the demand for food in China.

40|$|Objective: Most {{youth in}} Sub-Saharan Africa are not {{enrolled}} in school. Although more youth are enrolling in school, they are increasingly {{less likely to}} complete their primary and secondary schooling. Similarly to many other African nations, Tanzania has an estimated out-of-school population of 49 % of youth despite massive post-millennium investments which have significantly raised enrollment rates. Due to a high unemployment rate, rural youth commonly opt to pursue employment in cities or carry out agricultural work at home. However, their ability to procure formal employment is hindered by competition due to a high youth population density. This study sought to understand how youth with different levels of formal educational attainment (no schooling, primary schooling, secondary schooling) learn information in their community and formal schooling to improve their livelihoods and develop sustainable practices for generating income.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the discussions on the nexus between migration and development by assessing the effects of remittances on human development. We do so first through a quantitative approach, and second, by elaborating the findings of our quantitative analysis within a broader theoretical and policy framework. By using OLS, we measure the impact of remittances on human development and compare it with the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) and official development assistance (ODA). The findings indicate that remittances have a positive correlation with the human development level and are indeed {{an effective way to}} enhance human development in countries with medium income, especially in the medium run. We demonstrate that remittances show divergent developmental effects in countries with different government approaches to migration. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we discuss different hypotheses about the causes of the problems that our findings reveal and compare different actual policy solutions found in the developing world.

40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>boosting</b> the e#ectiveness of backtrack style search methods. In addition, during the last decade, a much better understanding of problem hardness, typical case complexity, and backtrack search behavior has been obtained. One example of a recent insight into backtrack search concerns so-called heavy-tailed behavior in randomized versions of backtrack search. Such heavy-tails explain the large variance in runtime often observed in practice. However, heavy-tailed behavior does certainly not occur on all instances. This has led to a need for a more precise characterization of when heavy-tailedness does and when it does not occur in backtrack search. In this paper, we provide such a characterization. We identify di#erent statistical regimes of the tail of the runtime distributions of randomized backtrack search methods and show how they are correlated with the "sophistication" of the search procedure combined with the inherent hardness of the instances. We also show that the runtime distribution regime is highly correlated with the distribution of the depth of inconsistent subtrees discovered during the search. In particular, we show that an exponential distribution of the depth of inconsistent subtrees combined with a search space that grows exponentially with the depth of the inconsistent subtrees implies heavy-tailed behavior...|$|E

However, {{despite the fact that}} both the electromagnetic field and the equations of motion are purely real, the resulting 4 -velocity is seemingly due to a complex electromagnetic field.
