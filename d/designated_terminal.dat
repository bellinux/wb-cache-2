40|$|The {{relationship}} between fruit {{development and the}} proliferative capacities of inflorescence meristems has been examined in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) line, flower production ceases coordinately on all inflorescence branches by a process we have designated global proliferative arrest (GPA). Morphological studies indicate that GPA involves a cessation of proliferative activity at the meristems, but a retention of the structural characteristics of the proliferating meristems. GPA does not occur in the male-sterile (ms 1 - 1) line, nor in wild-type Ler when fruits are surgically removed. In these cases, inflorescence meristems continue to proliferate, ultimately terminating by a different process, <b>designated</b> <b>terminal</b> differentiation, in which disruptions in patterning at the apex are followed {{by the loss of}} the inflorescence meristem.

40|$|Optimizing energy {{efficiency}} is a fundamentally important issue in modern communication networks. In this thesis we study {{the objective of}} optimal energy usage on two general classes of wireless network optimization problems, namely network lifetime maximization and OFDMA scheduling. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has become an increasingly popular technology {{in the area of}} broadband communication. In one of the associated fundamental scheduling problems, data has to be sent from a base station to a collection of terminals using a given set of communication channels where, however, each channel can be assigned to at most one <b>designated</b> <b>terminal.</b> Aside from determining an appropriate feasible assignment, each channel needs to be allocated a communication rate such that - summing over all channels assigned to a single terminal - the total data rate satisfies at least the demand of that terminal. In order to guarantee a successful transmission of data at a certain rate, the transmission power on the corresponding channel has to be large enough. The objective is to minimize the total sum of energy requirements while satisfying the demands of each terminal. This and related problems (called OFDMA scheduling problems) have been intensively studied by the engineering sciences; however, we are the first to conduct a theoretical worst-case analysis of this practically relevant class of network optimization problems for which no lower nor upper bounds on the approximability were known before. While we will show that - already on a very restricted subclass - the problem of minimizing the required transmission power for given data rate demands can not be approximated by any (polynomial time computable) factor, we will also see that the dual objective of proportionally maximizing the data rates for a given total transmission power is approximable arbitrarily close to the optimum on this subclass. On general instances, OFDMA rate-maximization will be shown to be inapproximable by any factor better than 1 / 2. Complementarily, a simple matching-based 1 /m-approximation algorithm will be derived (with m denoting the number of channels). Also a more involved convex programming approach is considered that (aside from its usefulness to derive better performance guarantees for special subclasses) can be used to compute 1 / 2 -approximate half-integral solutions in the general~case. In the second part of this dissertation, we continue with our theoretical study of energy minimization in a more implicit context: Motivated by the behavior of battery depletion in wireless sensor networks we introduce and analyze a novel online model for general linear packing problems, applicable to a broad class of network lifetime maximization problems. Network lifetime maximization aims at sustaining a prespecified communication requirement as long as possible in a given communication network with limited power supplies. Though there exists a vast number of approximation approaches for a large variety of lifetime maximization problems, all previous formulations of network lifetime optimization assume perfect a priori knowledge about the status and future behavior of the energy supplies of each single network node. We relax this assumption by introducing an appropriate multiplicative uncertainty parameter which initially allows only a rough estimation of the energy capacities that becomes more and more accurate when exhausting the corresponding resources. The definition of the online model and the competitive online algorithms developed in this work are independent of the underlying problem structure as long as the corresponding optimization problem can be formulated in terms of a general linear packing program. An advantageous property of the proposed online algorithms is that they do not require any explicit linear programming formulation; hence, they are also suited when algorithmic efficiency is an issue. As the algorithms additionally are approximation factor preserving they {{can be used as a}} framework for algorithmically intractable problem classes by applying appropriate offline approximation algorithms. The proven competitive factors of the more sophisticated algorithms outperform naive online algorithms by at least a logarithmic factor with respect to the fixed uncertainty parameter. Complementarily, we show bounds on the competitiveness of arbitrary deterministic or randomized online algorithms in this online model...|$|E

In order to better understand why airport operators have come onboard with the concept in the first place, this paper considered existing cases of London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Tokyo Narita Airport. These airports were selected for the qualitative case analysis primarily because of the relevance of their operating environment (i. e. alliance network hubs) and their early implementation of alliance terminal co-location.

For computer sys-tems to be effective, they must be secure so that infor-mation stored in them is accessible only to authorized users. Computer security usually involves several compo-nents: l physical security of the computer installations so that unauthorized persons may not enter the installations. l identification, authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that persons accessing the computers remotely are allowed access to the systems only if they are authorized to have such access.
