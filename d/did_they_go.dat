5|$|As late {{as in the}} Tudor and Stuart {{periods in}} Britain, herbals often still {{classified}} plants {{in the same way}} as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had. Only when European botanists like Matthias de l'Obel, Andrea Cesalpino and Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> further and create new classification systems based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.|$|E

2500|$|... "As men, {{being unable}} to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, {{pursuing}} a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed {{to be treated like}} women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them" [...] (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).|$|E

Tell me {{all about}} it,' cried the old hag, holding him closer yet, patting the hand that was drawn through his arm against her other hand, and searching every line in his face with her bleared eyes. 'Come! Begin! I want to be told all about it. What, Rob, boy! You and me can keep a secret together, eh? We've done so before now. Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> first, Rob?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is enough}} to drive one insane," [...] he reasoned. [...] "Where in the world <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to? I'd give a {{thousand}} dollars to know." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was easier}} said than <b>done.</b> <b>They</b> <b>went</b> on once more, and soon, without warning, stepped into water up to their knees.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'm wishing my love to you, Misses Brown,' {{returned}} the false Rob, seeking consolation in the glass. 'Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to first was it? Him and her, do you mean?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman! Of {{course there}} is. We know that without you!" [...] He gave the tame monster a push. [...] "Git! Vamos! Waddle! Get back and cook the dinner. Which way <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go,</b> then?" ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the train}} ran into Bologna Station, {{they were still}} in the {{restaurant}} car. Nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> at once to their seats. Angus had paid the bill. There was three-quarters-of-an-hour's wait in Bologna.|$|E
60|$|But <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not <b>go.</b> <b>They</b> stood there, irresolute, looking towards Ely.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{not that}} I wonder at, Peter; it's the putting of such splendid work in such dark narrow lanes that surprises me. Why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{to so much}} expense {{in such a place}} as this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, sir, if {{they are}} that sort of men why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> and enlist in the army instead of {{becoming}} sailors. It {{stands to reason that}} it is because they know that <b>they</b> cannot <b>do</b> work.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes! yes!” {{the boys}} heard him say. Then {{followed}} a pause. “You don’t mean it! When, just now? Was that the noise we heard? Where <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to?

60|$|George {{reflected}} that the Squire had forgotten that not {{an hour before}} he himself had been vowing that they were ruined, while he, George, had stoutly sworn that something would turn up to help them.

6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{said the}} young man; [...] "I command thee to tell me, O Zadok! Why {{are the people}} all gone mad this morning, and why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> weep and wail, and why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> crazy when I do but ask them why they are so afflicted?" ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{this was}} <b>done</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> down to the beach, and superintended the landing {{of the men and}} stores, which was carried on until nightfall. Then, when the last boat load was landed, they came up to dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's Michael,' she said, and she {{stretched}} {{out her arms}} for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped {{out of bed and}} run to her.|$|R
60|$|So quickly, so deftly and methodically, <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{about making}} a {{temporary}} camp, that Joy, watching with jealous eyes, admitted to herself that the old-timers could not do it better.

6000|$|Before {{he could}} {{complete}} the sentence, a sudden movement of Miss Garth's interrupted him. She started violently, and looked round toward the window. [...] "Only the wind among the leaves," [...] she said, faintly. [...] "My nerves are so shaken, the least thing startles me. Speak out, for God's sake! When Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left this house, tell me in plain words, why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{course of}} dinner-parties could not hinder her ladyship from finding Chantry House insufferably dull, 'always like Sunday;' and, {{when she found}} that we were given to Saints' Day services, her pity and astonishment knew no bounds.

6000|$|... "And {{who will}} {{look after the}} other part?" [...] said Aunt Viney grimly. [...] "That {{will have to be}} kept tidy, too; and the {{servants}} for such a house, where in heaven are they to come from? Or <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> with it?" ...|$|R

60|$|This time, as before, when {{he found}} his {{attendant}} not to be shaken off, Bradley suddenly turned back. This time, as before, Riderhood turned back along with him. But, not this time, as before, <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> into the Lock House, for Bradley came to a stand on the snow-covered turf by the Lock, looking up the river and down the river. Navigation was impeded by the frost, and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert.|$|E
6000|$|At {{all other}} times {{she was the}} pet of the whole house, and loved her five companions in return with a child's tenderest and most ingenuous attachment; but now, the five companions put on ugly colours, and {{appeared}} {{for the first time}} under a sullen cloud. There they were, all at their homes that day, being made much of, being taken out, being spoilt and made disagreeable, and caring nothing for her. It was like their artful selfishness always to tell her when they came back, under pretence of confidence and friendship, all those details about where they had been, and what they had done and seen, and how often they had said, [...] "O! If we had only darling little Kitty here!" [...] Here indeed! I dare say! When they came back after the holidays, they were used to being received by Kitty, and to saying that coming to Kitty was like coming to another home. Very well then, why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> away? If the meant it, why <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> away? Let them answer that. But they didn't mean it, and couldn't answer that, and they didn't tell the truth, and people who didn't tell the truth were hateful. When they came back next time, they should be received in a new manner; they should be avoided and shunned.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} the Spaniards were lodged {{in one of the}} palaces. The crowd of people {{proceeding}} in that direction was a sufficient index to its position; and Roger and his companion, joining the throng, were soon in front of the palace. Some Spanish soldiers were standing as sentries at its gate, but none came out or mixed with the people--Cortez having given the strictest orders that they should remain in their quarters, as he feared that, <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> abroad, some brawl might arise between them and the inhabitants, and so break the newly-formed alliance, which was of the most extreme importance to them.|$|E
