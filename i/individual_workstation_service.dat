40|$|International audienceThe {{implementation}} of flow processing {{is essential to}} the successful application of lean manufacturing practices since it provides the infrastructure for both pull production to take place and the focussed elimination of waste. With the adoption of lean practices into a broader range of production environments there is an increasing need for flow processing to operate under a wider range of conditions particularly with respect to the sources and levels of variability that exist. In order to ensure efficient flow processing under such conditions a range of methods has been developed for both reducing levels of variability and for managing the effects of variability. However, ensuring the effective use of each of these methods requires detailed knowledge of the effects this variability has on the resource requirements of <b>individual</b> <b>workstations.</b> The paper presents a methodology for developing predictive models {{that can be used to}} quantitatively estimate the levels of blocking and waiting that occur on <b>individual</b> <b>workstations</b> along a flow processing line.

40|$|Tandem mass spectrometry, {{also known}} as MS/MS, is an {{analytical}} technique to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of charged ions and widely used in genomics, proteomics and metabolomics areas. There {{are two types of}} automatic ways to interpret tandem mass spectra: de novo methods and database searching methods. Both of them need to use massive computational resources and complicated comparison algorithms. The real-time peptide-spectrum matching (RT-PSM) algorithm is a database searching method to interpret tandem mass spectra with strict time constraints. Restricted by the hardware and architecture of an <b>individual</b> <b>workstation</b> the RT-PSM algorithm has to sacrifice the level of accuracy in order to provide prerequisite processing speed. The peptide-spectrum similarity scoring module is the most time-consuming part out of four modules in the RT-PSM algorithm, which is also the core of the algorithm. In this study, a multi-core computing algorithm is developed for <b>individual</b> <b>workstations.</b> Moreover, a distributed computing algorithm is designed for a cluster. The improved algorithms can achieve the speed requirement of RT-PSM without sacrificing the accuracy. With some expansion, this distributed computing algorithm can also support different PSM algorithms. Simulation results show that compared with the original RT-PSM, the parallelization version achieves 25 to 34 times speed-up based on different <b>individual</b> <b>workstations.</b> A cluster with 240 CPU cores could accelerate the similarity score module 210 times compare with the single-thread similarity score module and the whole peptide identification process 85 times compare with the single-thread peptide identification process...|$|R
