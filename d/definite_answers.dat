25|$|As {{with all}} social {{classes in the}} United States, there are no <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> {{as to what is}} and what is not middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided into two {{sections}} that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes {{the upper end of the}} middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class – called either lower middle class or just middle class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and <b>definite</b> <b>answers,</b> you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
2500|$|Although widely {{recognized}} by the architectural community as embodying important new ideas, the Richards Laboratories had significant shortcomings {{from the viewpoint of}} the scientists who worked there. [...] Part of the problem was Kahn's lack of experience with the design of research laboratories. [...] Kahn hoped the scientists who were to occupy the new labs would provide him some direction during exploratory meetings, but he noted that they seemed more interested in asking him questions than in giving <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> to the questions he asked them. Komendant recalled that Kahn's first question to him during this project was, [...] "Doctor, what is a medical laboratory? [...] Have you had any experience in this field?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success story}} of the Western Shield program has been {{tarnished}} by more recent developments. [...] The woylie has been added back to WA’s list of threatened fauna due to the sharp declines since 2002, with some places having {{as much as a}} 95% decrease (including that locality near the Upper Warren in Manjimup, where the original sevenfold increase occurred). The woylies' population across all of Australia has declined, especially the P managed lands of the south-west forests. Wild populations that were replenished through [...] translocations in South Australia have also mysteriously declined. In fact, quite a few other species of the southwest forests have also declined and with no <b>definite</b> <b>answers,</b> despite many studies being undertaken, including through Parks and Wildlife’s new initiative, [...] "Saving our Species". Possible explanations include: disease, global warming, ground water losses, introduced predators building up a resistance to the poison in the baits, a natural population fluctuation, or an increase in predation by native enemies such as carpet pythons and chuditches, which are surviving well. A search for the cause is under way.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{to sum up}} our {{discussion}} {{of the value of}} philosophy; Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> to its questions, since no <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> can, as a rule, be known to be true, but rather {{for the sake of the}} questions themselves; because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic assurance which closes the mind against speculation; but above all because, through the greatness of the universe which philosophy contemplates, the mind also is rendered great, and becomes capable of that union with the universe which constitutes its highest good.|$|E
60|$|Philosophy, {{like all}} other studies, aims {{primarily}} at knowledge. The knowledge it aims at {{is the kind of}} knowledge which gives unity and system to the body of the sciences, and the kind which results from a critical examination of the grounds of our convictions, prejudices, and beliefs. But it cannot be maintained that philosophy has had any very great measure of success in its attempts to provide <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> to its questions. If you ask a mathematician, a mineralogist, a historian, or any other man of learning, what definite body of truths has been ascertained by his science, his answer will last {{as long as you are}} willing to listen. But if you put the same question to a philosopher, he will, if he is candid, have to confess that his study has not achieved positive results such as have been achieved by other sciences. It is true that this is partly accounted for by the fact that, as soon as definite knowledge concerning any subject becomes possible, this subject ceases to be called philosophy, and becomes a separate science. The whole study of the heavens, which now belongs to astronomy, was once included in philosophy; Newton's great work was called 'the mathematical principles of natural philosophy'. Similarly, the study of the human mind, which was a part of philosophy, has now been separated from philosophy and has become the science of psychology. Thus, to a great extent, the uncertainty of philosophy is more apparent than real: those questions which are already capable of <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> are placed in the sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy.|$|E

60|$|Dorcas, in the {{simplicity}} of the olden time, watched by the bedside of her wounded lover, and administered all those comforts that are in the sole gift of woman's heart and hand. During several days Reuben's recollection strayed drowsily among the perils and hardships through which he had passed, and he was incapable of returning <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> to the inquiries with which many were eager to harass him. No authentic particulars of the battle had yet been circulated; nor could mothers, wives, and children tell whether their loved ones were detained by captivity or by the stronger chain of death. Dorcas nourished her apprehensions in silence till one afternoon when Reuben awoke from an unquiet sleep, and seemed to recognize her more perfectly than at any previous time. She saw that his intellect had become composed, and she could no longer restrain her filial anxiety.|$|E
60|$|A European lately {{arrived in}} China, {{if he is}} of a {{receptive}} and reflective disposition, finds himself confronted {{with a number of}} very puzzling questions, for many of which the problems of Western Europe will not have prepared him. Russian problems, it is true, have important affinities with those of China, but they have also important differences; moreover they are decidedly less complex. Chinese problems, even if they affected no one outside China, would be of vast importance, since the Chinese are estimated to constitute {{about a quarter of the}} human race. In fact, however, all the world will be vitally affected by the development of Chinese affairs, which may well prove a decisive factor, for good or evil, during the next two centuries. This makes it important, to Europe and America almost as much as to Asia, that there should be an intelligent understanding of the questions raised by China, even if, as yet, <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> are difficult to give.|$|E
60|$|Through {{friends in}} America I asked some questions, {{and in some}} cases got {{definite}} and informing answers; in other cases the answers were not definite and not valuable. From the <b>definite</b> <b>answers</b> I gather than the 'capitation-tax' is compulsory, and that the sum is one dollar. To the question, 'Does any of the money go to charities?' the answer from an authoritative source was: 'No, not in the sense usually conveyed by this word*.' (The italics are mine.) That answer is cautious. But definite, I think--utterly and unassailably definite--although quite Christian-scientifically foggy in its phrasing. Christian Science is generally foggy, generally diffuse, generally garrulous. The writer was aware that the first word in his phrase answered the question which I was asking, but he could not help adding nine dark words. Meaningless ones, unless explained by him. It is quite likely--as intimated by him--that Christian Science has invented a new class of objects to apply the word charity to, but without an explanation we cannot know what they are. We quite easily and naturally and confidently guess that they are in all cases objects which will return five hundred per cent. on the Trust's investment in them, but guessing is not knowledge; it is merely, in this case, a sort of nine-tenths certainty deducible from what we think we know of the Trust's trade principles and its sly and furtive and shifty ways.|$|E

5000|$|According to a {{characteristic}} paragraph by Russell:Modern analytical empiricism ... {{differs from that}} of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique.

It has the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of science.|$|E
