5|$|A more <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> {{would be}} that the {{contracted}} s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E

5|$|Another <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the boom}} was the growth of {{gambling}} and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> of {{circumventing}} or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
5|$|Woodriff's {{resistance}} had {{an important}} <b>indirect</b> <b>effect</b> on Allemand's cruise. In drawing the squadron southwards, Woodriff had pulled {{them out of the}} line travelled by the Illustrious convoy. In the aftermath of the engagement, it took two days to repair the battered Calcutta and in that time the convoy had safely passed Allemand's former position without sighting the French force. With his object frustrated, Allemand completed the repairs to Calcutta and crewed her with men drawn {{from the rest of the}} squadron, adding the ship to his force. Aware that news of his presence would rapidly spread, Allemand subsequently turned southwards, sailing from the North Atlantic to the coast of North Africa to avoid pursuing British forces. There Allemand anchored for a time at the Spanish island of Tenerife, where he was able to repair and resupply his squadron before embarking on a lengthy cruise against the British convoys that regularly crossed the region.|$|E
40|$|Classic {{models of}} {{apparent}} competition predict negative <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> between prey with a shared enemy. If predator per capita growth rates are nonlinear, then endogenously generated periodic cycles are predicted to generate less negative or even positive <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> between prey. Here I determine how exogenous mechanisms such as environmental variation could modify <b>indirect</b> <b>effects.</b> I find that exogenous variation {{can have a}} broader range of <b>effects</b> on <b>indirect</b> interactions than endogenously generated cycles. <b>Indirect</b> <b>effects</b> are altered by environmental variation even in simple models for which the per capita growth rate of the predator species is a linear function of population densities. Temporal variation that affects the predator attack rate or the conversion efficiency can lead to large increases or decreases in the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> between prey, dependent on how prey populations co-vary with the environmental variation. Positive <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> can occur when the period of environmental variation is close to the natural period of the biological system and shifts in subharmonic resonance occur with the addition of the second prey. Models that include nonlinear numerical responses generally lead to <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> that are sensitive to environmental variation in more parameters and across a wider range of frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{long-term}} investigations on biomanipulation {{show that}} <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> {{are at least}} as important as direct effects are for the stability of biomanipulation. Three types of <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> can be distinguished: (1) a change in quantity or quality of the resource base, (2) behavioural change of the prey, and (3) development of anti-predator traits. Although <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of type (2), (e. g. a change in the pattern of vertical migration of zooplankton), and type (3), (e. g. development of helmets and neck teeth in Daphnia), are important mechanisms, the most essential <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> regarding biomanipulation belong to type (1). An example of the latter will be demonstrated: the complex of <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of enhanced grazing by large herbivores on the phosphorus metabolism of the lake. It is concluded that control of the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> is absolutely necessary to stabilize biomanipulation measures, but this is much more difficult than the control of direct effects and needs deeper insights into the structuring mechanisms of food webs. Proper management of fish stocks, in combination with the control of phosphorus load and/or the physical conditions, seems to be the most promising way of controlling the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of biomanipulation...|$|R

Finally, the path analyses predicting OCB-I and OCB-O offered further support for the general hypothesis that these 2 constructs are distinct.

40|$|A {{mediation}} model {{explores the}} direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> between an independent variable and a dependent variable by including other variables (or mediators). Mediation analysis has recently been used to dissect {{the direct and}} <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of genetic variants on complex diseases using case-control studies. However, bias could arise in the estimations of the genetic variant-mediator association because {{the presence or absence}} of the mediator in the study samples is not sampled following the principles of case-control study design. In this case, the mediation analysis using data from case-control studies might lead to biased estimates of coefficients and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects.</b> In this article, we investigated a multiple-mediation model involving a three-path mediating effect through two mediators using case-control study data. We propose an approach to correct bias in coefficients and provide accurate estimates of the specific <b>indirect</b> <b>effects.</b> Our approach can also be used when the original case-control study is frequency matched on one of the mediators.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the concept of {{equivalence}} between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of a treatment on a response using two sets of intermediate variables and covariates.

These results enable us to judge whether different sets of variables can yield the same direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> and thus help us select appropriate variables to estimate direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> with cost reduction or estimation accuracy.

40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{effectiveness}} of investments in public infrastructure initiated by Aschauer suggests that there may be substantial discrepancies between the results of conventional cost-benefit analysis and the ultimate effects of such investments on welfare. This paper takes a closer look at this issue by investigating the existence of secondary or <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> under conditions of monopolistic competition. We find that such effects will in general exist, and that they are potentially large, but that they can also be negative, depending on the specification of the model. With linear demand curves, <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> can be positive, zero or negative, with Dixit-Stiglitz they are always nonnegative and closely related to the taste for diversity, while with the logit model they are always identically zero. Free entry reinforces the positive <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> in the Dixit-Stiglitz model, and causes negative <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> in the logit model. Given this variety of results, robust empirical measurement of the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> appears to be difficult. ...|$|R

25|$|An {{example of}} a cascade in a complex, open-ocean {{ecosystem}} occurred in the northwest Atlantic during the 1980s and 1990s. The removal of cod (Gadus morhua) and other ground fishes by sustained overfishing resulted in increases in the abundance of the prey species for these ground fishes, particularly smaller forage fishes and invertebrates such as the northern snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). The increased abundance of these prey species altered the community of zooplankton that serve as food for smaller fishes and invertebrates as an <b>indirect</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

For this estimation, the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> were considered to be the changes in cloud cover due to different aerosol conditions. However, this is not simply a sum of the first and second indirect effects; it involves many effects related to changes in the aerosol conditions, so we cannot estimate only the <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of aerosols.|$|R

Here we estimate negative frequency dependence, a proxy for niche differences, and quantify the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> of climate change on each species. Consistent with theory, in four of five communities <b>indirect</b> <b>effects</b> are strongest for species showing weak negative frequency dependence. <b>Indirect</b> <b>effects</b> are also stronger in communities where there is greater variation in direct effects.
