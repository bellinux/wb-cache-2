Menzies pointed out that Jan Smuts already had. The War Office then claimed that Blamey could not be promoted to <b>field</b> <b>marshal</b> because he was a retired officer, which was not true. Menzies then restored Blamey to active duty. Blamey was duly promoted to <b>field</b> <b>marshal</b> in the King's Birthday Honours of 8 June 1950.|$|E

5|$|Following Andriamihaja's death, the {{influence}} of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew ever closer to the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead <b>Field</b> <b>Marshal</b> Rainiharo (also called Ravoninahitriniarivo) of Ilafy in 1833. Rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father, Andriantsilavonandriana, a hova (commoner) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining King Andrianampoinimerina's inner circle of noble advisers. <b>Field</b> <b>Marshal</b> Rainiharo served as the queen's First Minister from 1830 to 1832, then Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief from 1832 to 1852.
