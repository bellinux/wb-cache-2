5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heinous that standard punishments like beheading or to be broken on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised.

5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, {{it would not have been}} able to be released before November 2011, and likely would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E

5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> eager to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem. His grief is said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the lower right depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico. The former ruins of Jerusalem are alluded to by the broken arches and columns on the left.|$|E
5|$|After Ecgric {{had been}} ruling alone for two years, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army, led by Penda. The date of the invasion is usually given as around 636, although Kirby suggests it could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> late as 641. Ecgric was sufficiently forewarned as {{to be able to}} gather an army, described by Bede as opimus or splendid. Realising that they would be inferior in battle to the war-hardened Mercians and remembering that Sigeberht was once their most vigorous and distinguished leader, the East Anglians urged him to lead them in battle, hoping that his presence would encourage them not to flee from the Mercians. After he refused, on account of his religious calling, he was borne off against his will to the battlefield. He refused to bear weapons and so was killed. Ecgric was also slain during the battle and many of his countrymen either perished or were put to flight. The location of the site of the battle in which the East Anglians were routed and their king was killed is unknown, but it can be presumed to have been close to the kingdom’s western border with the Middle Angles.|$|E

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), South American Oreocallis, and Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predate the splitting of Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest they are bird-pollinated, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> since the Eocene radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.flammeum and A.brachycarpum to be sister species, with A.wickhamii as their next closest relative. A.flammeum has yellow pollen grains, like A.brachycarpum and A.wickhamii but unlike all other members of the Embothriinae.|$|E
5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was felt for about 10minutes {{and was so}} violent that all chimneys in the city collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive damage to buildings, only four deaths were reported: a Jewish woman and her baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, and one other victim. The death toll may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
5|$|A. pinnatum and {{the other}} three tree waratah species lie in the {{subtribe}} Embothriinae, along with the true waratahs (Telopea), Oreocallis and the Chilean firetree (Embothrium coccineum) from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising at the ends of branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent Gondwana into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> since the radiation of nectar-feeding birds such as honeyeaters in the Eocene. Triporopollenites ambiguus is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah (Telopea truncata), A. pinnatum and Oreocallis grandiflora. Cladistic analysis of morphological features within the Embothriinae showed A.pinnatum to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and sister to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, A.pinnatum has crimson pollen, while the other three Alloxylon species have yellow pollen. Hence {{it is likely that the}} ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus Alloxylon, yet changed to yellow after the divergence of A.pinnatum.|$|E
