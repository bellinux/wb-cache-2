5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a <b>demon,</b> they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a <b>demon.</b> Once a <b>demon</b> is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one <b>demon</b> can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that <b>demon</b> follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a <b>demon</b> is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new <b>demon</b> in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new <b>demon</b> can inherit different skills from its <b>demon</b> parents. The skills a <b>demon</b> possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a <b>demon,</b> the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the <b>demon</b> into a room imbued with virtue. However, the <b>demon</b> offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the <b>demon</b> inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed <b>demon</b> – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The <b>demon</b> tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The <b>demon</b> praises Rama, who purified the <b>demon</b> by his sword. The <b>demon</b> urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the <b>demon</b> transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the truth}} and plunges into the sky.|$|E

50|$|Johann Weyer, in his Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (1583), after a {{complicated}} system of hierarchies and calculations, estimated {{the number of}} <b>demons</b> as 4,439,622, divided into 666 s, each legion composed by 6,666 <b>demons,</b> {{and all of them}} ruled by 66 hellish dukes, princes, kings, etc. The Lesser Key of Solomon (17th century) copied the division in legions from Pseudomonarchia Daemonum but added more <b>demons,</b> and so more legions. It is suggestive that both Spina and Weyer used 666 and other numbers composed by more than one 6 to calculate the number of <b>demons</b> (133,316,666 <b>demons,</b> 666 legions, 6,666 <b>demons</b> in each legion, 66 rulers). Gregory of Nyssa, in the 4th century, believed in the existence of male and female <b>demons</b> and supported the idea that <b>demons</b> procreated with other <b>demons</b> and with human women. Other scholars supported the idea that they could not procreate and that the number of <b>demons</b> was constant.|$|R
50|$|<b>Demons</b> are chaotic evil fiends {{native to}} the Abyss.

Other <b>demons</b> include the Obyriths, ancient <b>demons</b> whose hideous appearance induces madness, and Loumara, a relatively young race of incorporeal <b>demons</b> capable of possessing living creatures, both were introduced in 3.5 edition, and, , neither have been covered in 4th edition, there are also miscellaneous <b>demons</b> which don't fit into any more specific category, such as Quasits.

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another <b>demon</b> who {{is unable to}} have a baby <b>demon</b> unless another <b>demon</b> impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a <b>demon,</b> she could recognize her husband as a <b>demon</b> in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her <b>demon</b> husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new <b>demon</b> baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is <b>demon</b> negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a <b>demon,</b> which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's <b>demon</b> roster is full, or if another enemy <b>demon</b> interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E

5|$|As {{they return}} to the human world, Yusuke is {{stripped}} of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's <b>demon</b> blood could cause him {{to go on a}} rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the <b>Demon</b> Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the <b>Demon</b> Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the <b>Demon</b> Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held every so often to determine the <b>Demon</b> Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the <b>Demon</b> Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world after several years to be with Keiko.|$|E
5|$|Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa {{at the top}} of the mountain, and {{informs the}} pair that the vampires have already summoned a {{powerful}} <b>demon</b> that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the <b>demon.</b> Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the <b>demon</b> before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the <b>demon,</b> it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the <b>demon</b> and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Diermot {{enters the}} dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, {{revealing}} that Turnvale was {{the domain of}} a <b>demon</b> long before humans came to the area. This <b>demon</b> should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because {{it was able to}} feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The <b>demon</b> was driven out by the great Gethryn, but the young sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the <b>demon,</b> and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses the Eye of Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn {{at the time of his}} death. The stone contains the power to defeat the <b>demon,</b> and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle in a barrel. Diermot defeats Selena with the Eye of Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.|$|E
500|$|Battles are turn-based, and {{consist of}} players letting the {{characters}} in their party attack with swords or guns, summon <b>demons,</b> or cast magic spells; both <b>demons</b> and humans, {{with the exception of}} the player character, are able to use magic. By participating in battles, human characters in the player's party receive experience points; by accumulating these points, the characters' levels rise and new abilities are randomly learned. Players can choose to talk to <b>demons</b> instead of fighting them; they can ask the <b>demons</b> for items or money, try to get them to go away, or try to form an alliance with them. At some places, called [...] "Cathedrals of Shadows", players can fuse two to three allied <b>demons</b> into one single, more powerful demon; as <b>demons</b> do not receive experience points, this is the only way for the player to increase their demons' power. Magnetite is used as a fuel for allied <b>demons,</b> and is used up by summoned <b>demons</b> as the player character walks around in the dungeons; if players run out of magnetite, summoned <b>demons</b> take damage.|$|R

The film also starred John Schuyler as the film's hero and Burns' wife Kathy.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood <b>Demon)</b> can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a <b>demon</b> killing her. The <b>demon</b> is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the <b>demon</b> king of death.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion {{at a location}} called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant <b>demon,</b> then initiate a fusion. The resultant <b>demon</b> will both possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the <b>Demon</b> Compendium, a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a <b>demon</b> from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E

5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the <b>demon</b> will attack. Once a <b>demon</b> is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the <b>demon</b> is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the <b>demon</b> will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. <b>Demon</b> fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better <b>demon</b> compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The <b>demon</b> blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The <b>demon</b> grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the <b>demon.</b> Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the <b>demon</b> lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the <b>demon,</b> who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a <b>demon</b> has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the <b>demon</b> to perform an action: an angry <b>demon</b> will attack the party, a frightened <b>demon</b> will flee the battle, a joyful <b>demon</b> will give the player an item, and an interested <b>demon</b> will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E
