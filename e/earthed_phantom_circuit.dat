5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an <b>earth</b> return <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b> An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|R
5000|$|A {{phantom group}} is {{composed}} of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit.</b> Here the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself {{and at the same}} time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The [...] "side circuits" [...] within <b>phantom</b> <b>circuits</b> can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called [...] "repeating coils". The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> is split evenly by the center taps.

40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the twentieth century a method that allowed for a third voice {{communications}} channel over two copper pairs was developed. The third channel was known as the "Phantom Circuit". Over the years communicating with the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> became less and less worth while until it was abandoned completely. Today researchers in the area of DSL technology view the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> as the method for squeezing the last bit of bandwidth out of copper twisted pair communications. It is the objective of this contribution to first clarify whether communication at DSL frequencies is at all possible over a <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit,</b> and secondly whether it can be used to increase the possible transfer rate and/or the distances over which these transfer rates can be achieved. For test purposes <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> interface boards were fabricated using interface transformers that are currently implemented in VDSL 2 systems.

However, more than one level of phantoming is usually impractical. Isolation between the <b>phantom</b> <b>circuit</b> and the side circuits relies on accurate balance {{of the line and}} transformers. Imperfect balance results in crosstalk between the <b>phantom</b> and side <b>circuits</b> and this effect accumulates as each level of phantoms is added. Even small levels of crosstalk are unacceptable on analogue telecommunications circuits since speech crosstalk is still intelligible down to quite low levels.|$|R

50|$|Phantom {{powering}} is {{not always}} implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1 mA per microphone), so the <b>phantom</b> supply <b>circuits</b> typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed {{on the assumption that}} this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2 mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt <b>phantom</b> power supply <b>circuits,</b> especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2 mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.|$|R

Current in vivo bioimpedance spectroscopy methods are performed on a body appendage and thus represent a combined measurement of all tissues in the measurement field, rather than the blood individually. This paper describes a novel in vivo measurement technique to calculate bioelectrical properties of blood while excluding the disturbances from surrounding tissues, based on analysis of the impedance changes caused by blood accumulation. The forearm was modelled as a cylinder containing anatomical structures such as skin-fat layer, muscles, bones. Blood volume was modeled as the inner cylinder. A tetrapolar electrode system was applied to a human forearm and the impedance curves measured with and without blood pooling were processed to calculate the impedance parameters of arterial blood. The bioelectrical parameters of blood were estimated by fitting the blood curve to a Cole-Cole model using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) nonlinear curve fitting method. The approach proposed was verified using an experimental <b>phantom,</b> an equivalent <b>circuit</b> model and a preliminary human experiment. Results show that electrical properties of blood and surrounding tissues can be separated successfully. Of Cole-Cole parameters, the characteristic frequency fc is the most reliable parameter to characterize blood bioelectrical properties. This method may allow simplified measurement of blood characteristic parameters for many biomedical and clinical monitoring applications. Index Term...|$|R
