50|$|Common predators of the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> {{often find}} {{themselves}} entangled in fishing nets, thus large numbers of them drown in nets each year. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> can catch avian influenza, so future outbreaks {{have the potential to}} threaten <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> populations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> dive {{to obtain}} food, which they eat on the surface. They mainly eat molluscs, aquatic plants, and aquatic insects. During the summer months, the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> will eat small aquatic crustaceans. There {{is a report}} of four <b>greater</b> <b>scaups</b> in April near Chicago {{swallowing}} hibernating leopard frogs (with body length about 5 cm), which they dredged out of a roadside freshwater pond. In freshwater ecosystems, the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> will eat seeds, leaves, stems and roots, along with sedges, pondweeds, muskgrass, and wild celery. Owing to the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup's</b> webbed feet and weight, it can dive up to 6 m and stay submerged {{for up to a}} minute, allowing it to reach food sources that are unobtainable to other diving ducks. The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> forms large flocks, some of which can contain thousands of birds. When flocks are on flowing water, they will face the current, and as the ducks float backwards, some fly {{to the front of the}} flock to maintain position.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are {{a popular}} game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and {{commercial}} reasons. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted with shotguns because {{they must be}} shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to 121 km/h. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game. In America and Canada, waterfowl must be hunted with non-toxic shot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> {{are rated}} {{as a species}} of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. During aerial {{population}} surveys <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>scaup</b> are counted together, because they look almost identical from the air. It was estimated that the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> made up about 11% of the continental scaup population. Since the 1980s, scaup populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American scaup population survey was 4.2 million scaup, however, the worldwide <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a banding program for the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the scaup is killed by a hunter {{or if it is}} captured by another banding group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organizations. These banding programs yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> faces {{numerous}} threats, {{the most}} significant challenge to their survival is habitat degradation caused by a mix of human development and runoff. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> when moulting and during the winter, are threatened by escalated levels of organochloride contaminants. Oil and sewage pollution also threaten this duck. Since 80% of the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> population winters in the urbanized part of the Atlantic Flyway, these ducks are subject {{to high levels of}} organic contaminates, along with increased levels of heavy metals in foods and habitat.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{studied the}} {{breeding}} ecology of <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>scaup</b> on {{islands of the}} North Arm of Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, and on the nearby mainland during 1990 – 98. The occurrence of nests of both species on the North Arm islands was determined primarily by the distribution of nesting gulls and terns and secondarily by habitat features. Nest parasitism was frequent on the islands, {{but not on the}} mainland. Average clutch size was 8. 99 ± 0. 12 (n = 169) for <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and 9. 20 ± 0. 17 (n = 93) for lesser scaup on the North Arm, and 8. 71 ± 0. 18 (n = 55) for lesser scaup on the mainland. No <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> nests were found on the mainland. Apparent nest success on the islands was higher (<b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> 75 %, n = 271; lesser scaup 77 %, n = 158) than on the mainland (lesser scaup 37 %, n = 59). Apparent egg success was 63 % (n = 1485) for <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and 67 % (n = 934) for lesser scaup on the islands, and 40 % (n = 435) for lesser scaup on the mainland. Hatchability of eggs was 98 % (n = 556) for <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and 94 % (n = 416) for lesser scaup on islands, and 98 % (n = 435) for lesser scaup on the mainland. Our findings, when compared to those of previous studies, do not indicate that either clutch size or egg hatchability has declined in recent years. Therefore, it seems unlikely that broad changes in these reproductive parameters are responsible for local or continental declines in lesser scaup populations. However, nest success on our mainland study area may have been too low to maintain the local population...|$|R

5000|$|The genus name Aythya {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek aithuia which refers to a seabird {{mentioned}} by Aristotle and others and is thought to refer to a duck, auklet or other seabird. The species name marila is from the Greek word for charcoal embers or coal dust. The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> was first studied by Linnaeus in 1761. Male <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> from America are distinguishable from those in Europe and Asia by the stronger vermiculations, worm-like carvings or marks on the mantle and scapulars, and are considered a separate subspecies, A. m. nearctica. Females of the two subspecies are indistinguishable. Based on size differences, a Pleistocene paleosubspecies, Aythya marila asphaltica, has also been described by Serebrovskij in 1941 from fossils recovered at Binagady, Azerbaijan. The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup's</b> name may come from [...] "scalp", a Scottish and Northern English word for a shellfish bed, or from the duck's mating call: [...] "scaup scaup".|$|R
5000|$|Lesser scaup {{are often}} hard to {{distinguish}} from the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> when direct comparison is not possible, but in North America a large scaup flock will often have both species present. Females, juveniles and drakes in eclipse plumage {{are hard to}} identify; there is considerable overlap in length between the two species, but <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> are usually noticeably more bulky. Lesser scaup females and immatures tend to have less white around the bill, but this too varies considerably between individual birds. The bill may give a hint; in the lesser scaup it has a stronger curve on the upperside than in the greater, resulting in a distal part that looks somewhat flattened and wide in the lesser scaup—hence the vernacular name [...] "broadbill". If the birds fly, the most tell-tale sign is the white secondary remiges, whereas in the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> the white extends on the primary remiges also, i.e. far towards the wingtip.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> {{breed in}} the tundra and the boreal forest; it is {{estimated}} that 75% of the North American population breed in Alaska. They typically nest on islands in large northern lakes. <b>Greater</b> <b>scaup</b> begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Drake <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> have a soft, quick whistle they use {{to attract the attention of}} hens during courtship, which takes place from late winter to early spring, on the way back to their northern breeding grounds. Female <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> have a single pitch, a raspy “arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr” vocalization. The courtship is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs. Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies, usually near water, on an island or shoreline, or on a raft of floating vegetation. The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down. After the female lays the eggs, the drake abandons the female and goes with other drakes to a large, isolated lake to molt. These lakes can be close to the breeding grounds or miles away. The lakes chosen are used yearly by the same ducks. The optimal molting lake is fairly shallow and has an abundance of food sources and cover. The female lays six to nine olive-buff-colored eggs, which she incubates for 24-28 days. A larger clutch could indicate brood parasitism by other <b>greater</b> <b>scaups</b> or even ducks of other species. Newly hatched chicks are covered with down and are soon able to walk, swim, and feed themselves; however, they are not able to fly until 40-45 days after hatching. The vulnerable small chicks follow their mother, who protects them from predators.|$|R
50|$|The redhead and {{the common}} pochard form a sister group which itself is sister to the canvasback. This group is then sister to the {{monophyletic}} group consisting of the white-eyes (hardhead, Madagascar pochard, and the sister species ferruginous duck and baer's pochard) and scaups (New Zealand scaup, ring-necked duck, tufted duck, <b>greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> lesser scaup).|$|R
50|$|The adult <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> is 39 - 56 cm {{long with}} a 71 - 84 cm {{wingspan}} {{and a body}} mass of 726 - 1360 g. It has a blue bill and yellow eyes and is 20% heavier and 10% longer than the closely related lesser scaup. The male has a dark head with a green sheen, a black breast, a light back, a black tail, and a white underside. The drake or male <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> is larger and has a more rounded head than the female. The drake's belly and flanks are a bright white. Its neck, breast, and tail feathers are a glossy black, while its lower flanks are vermiculated gray. The upper wing has a white stripe starting as the speculum and extending along the flight feathers to the wingtip. Legs and feet of both sexes are gray. The adult female has a brown body and head, with white wing markings {{similar to those of}} the male but slightly duller. It has a white band and brown oval shaped patches at the base of the bill, which is a slightly duller shade of blue than the drake's. Juvenile <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> look similar to adult females. The <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> drake's eclipse plumage looks similar to its breeding plumage, except the pale parts of the plumage are a buffy gray. Distinguishing <b>greater</b> from lesser <b>scaups</b> can be difficult in the field. The head of the greater tends to be more rounded, and the white wing stripe is more extensive.|$|R
50|$|A joint {{group of}} American and Canadian {{scientists}} researching scaup migration across the Great Lakes found that 100% of female <b>greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> and 77% of female lesser scaup, had escalated levels of selenium in their bodies.

40|$|Estimating the {{frequency}} of hybridization {{is important to understand}} its evolutionary consequences and its effects on conservation efforts. In this study, we examined the extent of hybridization in two sister species of ducks that hybridize. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and 3589 double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequences (ddRADseq) to identify admixture between wild lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> (A. marila). Among 111 individuals, we found one introgressed mitochondrial DNA haplotype in lesser scaup and four in <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> Likewise, based on the site-frequency spectrum from autosomal DNA, gene flow was asymmetrical, with higher rates from lesser into <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> However, using ddRADseq nuclear DNA, all individuals were assigned to their respective species with 3 ̆e 0. 95 posterior assignment probability. To examine the power for detecting admixture, we simulated a breeding experiment in which empirical data were used to create F 1 hybrids and nine generations (F 2 –F 10) of backcrossing. F 1 hybrids and F 2, F 3 and most F 4 backcrosses were clearly distinguishable from pure individuals, but evidence of admixed histories was effectively lost after the fourth generation. Thus, we conclude that low interspecific assignment probabilities (0. 011 – 0. 043) for two lesser and nineteen <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> were consistent with admixed histories beyond the F 3 generation. These results indicate that the propensity of these species to hybridize in the wild is low and largely asymmetric. When applied to species-specific cases, our approach offers powerful utility for examining concerns of hybridization in conservation efforts, especially for determining the generational time until admixed histories are effectively lost through backcrossing...|$|R

A total of 24, 319 birds was recorded in field records and included thirty-two species.

During the winter months while the lake is frozen over, the birds are concentrated in open water near hot springs or where a strong water current is present. They consist of bottom feeding or diving birds during this time; principally meranser, bufflehead, pied-billed grebe, ruddy, golden eye, coot and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup.</b> The fall migrants consisted largely of widgeons while the spring influx was composed mostly of <b>greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> western an eared grebe. The most abundant species were the ruddy, golden eye, widgeon, coot and <b>greater</b> <b>scaup,</b> constituting 23 %, 21 %, 16 %, 11 % and 10 % respectively {{of the total number}} of all birds observed. In frequency of appearance in field records, the <b>greater</b> <b>scaup</b> and coot were recorded on more than 80 % of the field trips while the ruddy and golden eye were present in from 70 % to 80 % of the trips. Availability of feeding areas appears to be the principal factor causing fluctuation in number during the winter season. The temperature and precipitation conditions during the period of the census were not average. The dry tall characteristic of this region prevailed extremely late. The first precipitation of any consequence and in the form of snow occurred in late December. An extremely cold period during January and February followed this dry fall season. The spring season was later than usual, the temperature falling to moderate until late March. These variations from the average weather conditions produced three effects: first, a delayed fall migration; second, limited feeding area for the wintering birds due to restricted areas of open water while the lake surface was frozen; third, a delayed spring migration which was concentrated an of short duration...|$|R
