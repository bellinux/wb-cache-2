MethodsData collected by the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies (ESSCA) network between 2009 and 2012 from 12 European countries were analysed. ResultsMethylisothiazolinone 0. 2 % aq. produced the highest prevalence of sensitization during the study period, with an overall prevalence of 4. 5 %. The mixture methylchloroisothiazolinone /methylisothiazolinone tested at 0. 02 % aq. followed closely, with 4. 1 % of positive reactions. Other preservatives with lower rates of sensitization, but still over 1 %, include methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN) 0. 5 % pet. and <b>iodopropynyl</b> <b>butylcarbamate</b> (IPBC) 0. 2 % pet. Formaldehyde releasers and parabens yielded less than 1 % positive reactions during the study period.

40|$|Background: Preservatives {{present in}} {{cosmetics}} and other industrial products can cause allergic contact dermatitis. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the frequency of allergy to selected preservatives in consecutive patients examined due to contact dermatitis in the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Łódź, and to establish whether individuals sensitized to formaldehyde react simultaneously to formaldehyde releasers. Material and Methods: A group of 405 patients (308 females and 97 males) was examined in 2011 – 2013. In all participants patch tests with a series of 13 preservatives (paraben mix, formaldehyde, Quaternium 15, chloromethylisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone mix, methyldibromoglutaronitrile, diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol, <b>iodopropynyl</b> <b>butylcarbamate,</b> benzalkonium chloride, sodium metabisulfite, produced by Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Sweden) were performed. Results: Of the 405 patients 74 (including 52 females) showed positive results of patch tests. Contact allergy to at least 1 preservative was noted in 47 (11. 6 %) patients, including 34 (11 %) females and 13 (13. 4 %) males. Methylisothiazolinone proved to be the most frequent sensitizer – 4. 7 % (5. 2 % females, 3. 1 % males) while parabens, 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol and imidazolidinyl urea (0. 2 %) were found to be the least frequent. Fourteen (3. 4 %) participants, 10 women and 4 men, were allergic to formaldehyde and/or formaldehyde releasers. In 11 (78. 6 %) of them monovalent hypersensitivity was observed. In 13 (3. 2 % of the examined group) patients allergy to preservatives might have been of occupational origin. Conclusions: Preservatives, particularly isothiazolinones, are significant causal factors of allergic contact dermatitis, including occupational cases. Individuals sensitized to formaldehyde may react simultaneously to formaldehyde releasers, however, such reactions are relatively rare. Med Pr 2015; 66 (3) : 327 – 33...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} treatment of metalworking fluids (MWFs) is a cost effective alternative to conventional waste disposal processes. While research has proven {{that this process}} is capable of treating large volumes of wastes with high organic concentrations, there are uncertainties about the mechanisms by which the treatment occurs, and there are limitations that must be overcome. There {{is a need to}} understand the importance of the mechanisms by which carbon (and hence COD) is removed from the wastewater. This will allow for waste practitioners to make better decisions for optimizing the process, and for disposing of waste (i. e sludge) that is generated. The {{biological treatment}} process is also susceptible to biocides present within formulations. These compounds either need to be removed before the treatment process, or the bioreactors need to be made more resistant to them to ensure that their presence does not hinder the reactor functioning. This study aims to answer the uncertainties about the carbon removal mechanisms involved in the treatment of oil-containing MWFs. In the first experimental chapter, it is shown that the predominant mechanism of carbon removal is oil/water separation induced by emulsifier degradation, and hence the bioprocess treatment rate is significantly affected by the biodegradability of surfactants and by the presence of cations found naturally in the water that used to prepare the emulsions. The study then provides insights into the potential that coagulation and coalescence has for removing inhibitory components commonly found in MWFs. Coagulation and coalescence is shown to effectively remove biocides with low aqueous solubility (<b>iodopropynyl</b> <b>butylcarbamate)</b> and those that partition themselves into the oil phase (o-phenyl phenate and its sodium salt). Finally, to improve the resistance of reactors to inhibitory compounds, factors influencing the development of fixed-film reactors are investigated. A micro-cosmic system is used to study the both physico-chemical effects and nutritional factors on the development of biofilm reactors. It is shown that biofilm yields can be controlled through pH adjustment, and that these yields are maximized with phosphate stimulation and ammonium limitation. It is then shown that fixed-film reactors are able to treat metalworking fluids even under conditions deemed to be inhibitory. In summary, this project provides insights into further understanding and enhancing the biological treatment of MWFs. </p...|$|E
