25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> {{the value of his}} texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
500|$|... it {{is totally}} beyond me why you ignored Batwoman in your first two issues... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> your {{reluctance}} {{to go back to}} the days where everybody in Gotham had a Bat-identity, but you can't wipe out Batwoman that easily... I was counting on her making the scene in a new story, perhaps coming out of retirement to offer assistance to your Dynamite Duo [...]|$|E
500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're {{frustrated}} we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly I do;--but this {{friendship}} is so unequal. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>understand</b> {{that it should}} have grown from personal liking on your side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, is it you, O'Connor?" [...] General Hill exclaimed. [...] "If {{they were}} those two battalions of yours, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> it.|$|R
500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part that I started and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. I put my hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "My dear sir, <b>I</b> know--I <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how {{it seems}} offensive; but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{assure you that}} I had no intention--no--no--" [...] he falters, with an imploring glance at Campbell, who takes the word.|$|R

500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|Bergkamp and Wright {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's 2–0 win against Everton {{on the first}} day of March. The team won by an {{identical}} scoreline at home to Nottingham Forest a week later and kept a third consecutive cleansheet against Southampton; midfielders Stephen Hughes and Paul Shaw both got themselves on the scoresheet. Defeat at home to Liverpool on 24 March 1997 was marred by a dubious penalty awarded to striker Robbie Fowler. The player himself [...] "stood and mouthed: 'No penalty!'" [...] given Seaman made no contact in the penalty box, but the referee unaltered his decision. Although Fowler's spotkick was later saved, the ball rebounded to Jason McAteer, who scored. Wenger ruled the team out of the title race again, by saying after the match, [...] "Everybody knows now that it was not a penalty, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that a referee took a wrong decision. That's football and it eliminates our chance of the championship." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Pan's investigation, {{and other}} {{inconsistencies}} highlighted by Falun Gong organisations, led some journalists and other observers {{to entertain the}} possibility that the self-immolation was not as straightforward as the Chinese official media accounts suggested. In the National Review, Ann Noonan of the Laogai Research Foundation suggested that it was [...] "hardly a far-fetched hypothesis" [...] that the government staged the incident or allowed it to proceed to discredit Falun Gong, as the government vowed to crush the practice before the eightieth anniversary celebrations of the Communist Party in July. Clive Ansley, a Vancouver-based rights lawyer who lived in China during the self-immolation, suggested that a dramatic response by Falun Gong would have been understandable, but ultimately concluded that the event was staged: [...] "You've got Falun Gong people in this country, they've been oppressed over and over again, they are not allowed to speak, they are not allowed to assert any of their rights as citizens, the level of frustration must be terribly, terribly high.. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> people doing that.. but ironically, we ultimately found out that it was staged anyway, it was not real. it was completely staged by the government." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carr was [...] "fascinated {{with the}} {{psychology}} of killers, who were subliminally acting out the pain of being controlled by monstrous parents by controlling and killing victims, seeking a release that would never come." [...] As he explains, [...] "For me it began in New York with the Son of Sam killings while I was in college...I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> some {{of the kind of}} rage that's behind what they do. I can't understand the major portion of it because that's what leads to the violence they commit. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the germ of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaudio and Coria were at {{the centre}} of another dispute at the World Team Cup where Gaudio said, [...] "Let's be truthful, this isn't a team, because there's someone who makes {{decisions}} choosing the best for himself. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that a player gets tired and decides to rest before Paris. I also did so on Tuesday against the Czechs {{but not in the}} most important match of all. Coria and I were the best team and if we were a real team this wouldn't have happened." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I expect, my dear, that {{he slipped}} away because he didn't {{want to see}} you. It sounds rude, doesn't it? But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{perfectly}} <b>understand</b> it." ...|$|R
2500|$|William Boyd-Carpenter {{corresponded with}} the last empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse). [...] "In early 1895 she wrote to William Boyd-Carpenter, who as Bishop of Ripon was also court {{chaplain}} to her grandmother Queen Victoria, that she was trying hard {{to come to terms}} with external trappings of her new faith. ‘Now that I am more used to hear the Russian language <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the service so much better, and many things have become clear to me and comprehensible which at first rather startled me. [...] The singing is most beautiful and edifying, only I miss the sermons, which are never preached in the Imperial chapels..." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fifth}} season {{received}} a Best Drama Series nomination at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Brian Grubb of Uproxx wrote: House of Cards {{has not been}} very good for multiple seasons now, if it was ever that good. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the original excitement about it. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were on television. And not even [...] "television," [...] really. They were on a big budget series that was made for and by a streaming service. David Fincher was involved and even directed a few episodes. This was a borderline revolutionary development. [...] I don't see how anyone who watched it can think it deserves {{a place in the}} best six or seven dramas on television.|$|E
2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once {{you see how}} she fits into the story, you will {{understand}} why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, {{his work}} came to {{national}} attention when Eric Morganthaler wrote a front page article about {{him for the}} Wall Street Journal. This coverage resulted in invitations to talk show interviews by Geraldo Rivera, Phil Donahue and Oprah Winfrey. Though Zamora was openly gay, he chose to not make that explicit point to school children, preferring to emphasize to them that he got the disease through unprotected sex, to underscore {{the fact that both}} homosexuals and heterosexuals could contract HIV. On July 12, 1993, he testified before the United States Congress, arguing for more explicit HIV/AIDS educational programs, saying, [...] "If you want to reach me as a young man [...] especially a young gay man of color [...] then you need to give me information in a language and vocabulary <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> and relate to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{omission}} of commonly played {{songs such as}} [...] "Run to the Hills" [...] and [...] "The Trooper" [...] from the 2010 setlist led to some criticism, with the Calgary Herald suggesting that [...] "...striking a more even balance between that new material and the unsinkable, ironclad battleships of yesteryear, would have made an incredibly satisfying show that much greater". Speaking in defence of the band's choice of setlist, Mike Portnoy (then of Dream Theater) said: [...] "I can understand that fans {{want to hear the}} hits, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that Maiden don't want to be stuck playing the same songs {{for the rest of their}} lives. They put out new music so they want to play the new music." [...] Interviewed for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 14 July, Janick Gers responded to criticism of the setlist: ...|$|E

"With full {{affection for}} the flag which I have been born under, and the flag I represent, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the {{sentiment}} and feeling of a republican who has created his independence, and values that before all; but I can say fairly that I believe {{in the future that}} I can assimilate the system, which I have been connected with, with the Cape Colony, and it is not an impossible idea that the neighbouring republics, retaining their independence, should share with us as to certain general principles. If I might put it to you, I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E
