5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group,</b> to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group</b> in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E
5|$|Phenolics, {{sometimes}} called phenols, consist of an aromatic 6-carbon ring bonded to a <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group.</b> Some phenols have antiseptic properties, while others disrupt endocrine activity. Phenolics range from simple tannins {{to the more}} complex flavonoids that give plants much of their red, blue, yellow, and white pigments. Complex phenolics called polyphenols are capable of producing {{many different types of}} effects on humans, including antioxidant properties. Some examples of phenolics used for defense in plants are: lignin, silymarin and cannabinoids. Condensed tannins, polymers composed of 2 to 50 (or more) flavonoid molecules, inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes.|$|E

25|$|An amine {{functional}} group displaces the adjacent halide in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate an aziridine. Amino alcohols {{have the same}} reactivity, but the <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group</b> must first be converted into a good leaving group. The cyclization of an amino alcohol is called a Wenker synthesis (1935), and that of a haloamine the Gabriel ethylenimine method (1888).|$|E
25|$|The Pictet–Gams {{reaction}} and the Pictet–Spengler reaction are both {{variations on the}} Bischler–Napieralski reaction. A Pictet–Gams reaction works similarly to the Bischler–Napieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group</b> in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the isoquinoline rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate.|$|E

50|$|Loss of a {{positive}} hydrogen ion (H+) from the hydroxyl group of a phenol forms a corresponding negative phenolate ion or phenoxide ion, and the corresponding salts are called phenolates or phenoxides, although the term aryloxides is preferred according to the IUPAC Gold Book. Phenols can have two or more <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> bonded to the aromatic ring(s) in the same molecule.

25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (aldose) or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group</b> of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E
25|$|More specifically, the {{biosynthesis}} of (−)-menthol {{takes place}} in the secretory gland cells of the peppermint plant. Geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), first catalyzes the reaction of IPP and DMAPP into geranyl diphosphate. Next (−)-limonene synthase (LS) catalyzes the cyclization of geranyl diphosphate to (−)-limonene. (−)-Limonene-3-hydroxylase (L3OH), using O2 and NADPH, then catalyzes the allylic hydroxylation of (−)-limonene at the 3 position to (−)-trans-isopiperitenol. (−)-Trans-isopiperitenol dehydrogenase (iPD) further oxidizes the <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group</b> on the 3 position using NAD+ to make (−)-isopiperitenone. (−)-Isopiperitenone reductase (iPR) then reduces the double bond between carbons 1 and 2 using NADPH to form (+)-cis-isopulegone. (+)-Cis-isopulegone isomerase (iPI) then isomerizes the remaining double bond to form (+)-pulegone. (+)-Pulegone reductase (PR) then reduces this double bond using NADPH to form (−)-menthone. (−)-Menthone reductase (MR) then reduces the carbonyl group using NADPH to form (−)-menthol.|$|E

40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{study has been}} carried out on selected polycyclitols to evaluate the potential of conformational locking of <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> in lending predictability to the O–H···O hydrogen-bonding network observed in the crystal structures of such compounds. The polycyclitols employed in this study are conformationally locked with all the <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> destined to be axial owing to the trans ring fusion(s) in the polycyclic carbon framework. The consequent formation of intramolecular O–H···O hydrogen bonds between the 1, 3 -syn diaxial <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> now permits any packing pattern in the polycyclitols to be described in terms {{of a small group of}} intramolecularly bonded molecular motifs linked to their respective neighbors by four O–H···O bonds.

40|$|Abstract: Surface <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> {{are known}} to play a {{significant}} role in the photocatalytic behavior of TiO(2). The molecular or dissociative character of H(2) O adsorption on titania is strongly affected by the local surface structure, but dissociation, producing -OH, should prevail on surface sites with a high degree of coordinative unsaturation. Here we report an IR investigation of <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups</b> on low coordination sites of TiO(2) P 25 (Degussa), a commercial titania powder considered a staple in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis. The presence of coordinatively defective surface terminations well agrees with the roughness of the border of TiO(2) particles observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, IR spectra of adsorbed CO were used to probe the Lewis acidity of surface Ti(4 +) ions exposed after the removal of water molecules and <b>hydroxy</b> <b>groups.</b> Evidence for two additional types of surface cationic sites with respect those reported in the literature was found...|$|R

2500|$|Phenol {{is highly}} {{reactive}} toward electrophilic aromatic substitution as the oxygen atom's pi electrons donate electron density into the ring. [...] By this general approach, many groups can be appended to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and other processes. However, phenol's ring is so strongly activated—second only to aniline—that bromination or chlorination of phenol leads to substitution on all carbon atoms ortho and para to the <b>hydroxy</b> <b>group,</b> {{not only on}} one carbon. Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol while with concentrated nitric acid, more nitro groups get substituted on the ring to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol which is known as picric acid.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases where}} an enolization is {{occurring}} around an allylic group (usually {{as part of}} a cyclic system), A1,3 strain can cause the reaction to be nearly impossible.
