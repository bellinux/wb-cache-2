The main purpose of this study was to investigate the respiratory effects of exposure to high atmospheric concentrations of <b>flour</b> <b>dust.</b>  Methods This study was carried out in a local flour producing factory in Shiraz, in 1384. Sixty seven subjects (35 exposed and 32 non-exposed) were investigated. The prevalence of respiratory symptom as well as lung function capacities was evaluated. Additionally, atmospheric concentrations of <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> were measured.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{evaluated}} {{the effect on}} exposure of an intervention programme, which focused on risk education and providing information on good work practices. This intervention programme was enrolled {{as part of a}} Dutch covenant in the flour processing industry (industrial bakeries, flour mills, ingredient producers). METHODS: Data from several measurement surveys collected pre- and post-intervention were used to evaluate changes in exposure over time. All datasets contained personal measurements analysed for <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and fungal alpha-amylase contents, and contextual information was available on process characteristics, work practice, and use of control measures. RESULTS: Changes in exposure over time varied substantially between sectors and jobs. For bakeries a modest downward annual trend of - 2 % was found for <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and - 8 % for amylase. For flour mills the annual trend for <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> was - 12 %; no significant trend was observed for amylase. For ingredient producers results were generally non-significant but indicated a reduction in <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> exposure and increase in fungal alpha-amylase exposure. Modest increase in use of control measures and proper work practices were reported in most sectors, especially the use of local exhaust ventilation and decreased use of compressed air. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the observed reductions in exposure levels indicates that the sector-wide intervention strategy implemented during the covenant period had a limited overall effect. This indicates that a more rigorous approach is needed to substantially decrease the exposure levels to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and related allergens and, respectively, the prevalence of associated occupational diseases...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: A {{recent study}} of {{supermarket}} bakery workers in South Africa demonstrated that 25 % of workers were sensitised to flour allergens and 13 % had baker's asthma. Evidence on exposure reduction strategies using specifically designed interventions aimed at {{reducing the risk of}} baker's asthma is scarce. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of different control measures to reduce airborne <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> exposure using a randomised design. Methods: A group-randomised study design was used to assign 30 bakeries of a large supermarket chain store to two intervention groups and a control group, of which 15 bakeries were studied. Full-shift environmental personal samples were used to characterise exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and wheat and rye allergens levels pre-intervention (n= 176) and post-intervention (n= 208). Results: The overall intervention effect revealed a 50 % decrease in mean <b>flour</b> <b>dust,</b> wheat and rye allergen exposure. The reduction in exposure was highest for managers (67 %) and bakers (47 %), and lowest for counterhands (23 %). For bakers, the greatest reduction in <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> was associated with control measures such as the use of the mixer lid (67 %), divider oil (63 %) or focused training (54 %). However, the greatest reduction (80 %) was observed when using a combination of all control measures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{conducted}} a study to determine prevalences of sensitization to bakery-associated antigens (BAAs) and work-related respiratory symptoms at a large commercial bakery. METHODS: The following measurements were carried out: personal breathing zone (PBZ) and general area (GA) monitoring for inhalable <b>flour</b> <b>dust,</b> α-amylase and wheat, a questionnaire, and blood tests for IgE specific to <b>flour</b> <b>dust,</b> wheat, α-amylase, and common aeroallergens. RESULTS: Of 186 bakery employees present during our site visit, 161 completed the questionnaire and 96 allowed their blood to be drawn. The geometric mean PBZ and GA inhalable <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations for the lower-exposure group was 0. 235 mg/m(3), and for the higher-exposure group was 3. 01 mg/m(3). Employees in the higher-exposure group had significantly higher prevalences of work-related wheezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and frequent sneezing than the lower-exposure group. The prevalence of IgE specific to wheat was significantly higher among employees who ever had {{a job in the}} higher-exposure group or in production at another bakery at both the ≥ 0. 10 kU/L and the ≥ 0. 35 kU/L cutoffs, and to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and α-amylase at the ≥ 0. 10 kU/L cutoff, compared to the lower-exposure group.

40|$|Abstract The aims of {{the thesis}} were to {{estimate}} the risk for bakers to contract asthma or rhinitis. We also wanted to study the impact of exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and of allergic sensitisation on the risk for asthma or rhinitis. Furthermore, the relation between nasal symptoms, indices of nasal inflammation and <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> exposure was studied. A retrospective cohort study using a mailed questionnaire comprised 2226 former baker trade school students, 931 controls from other schools and 930 population controls. This study estimated the risk for asthma or rhinitis compared with controls and relative exposure. Bakers reporting asthma (n= 26) or rhinitis (n= 21) and baker referents (n= 44) of the cohort study participated in a clinical case-referent study, assessing the impact of sensitisation. A cross-sectional study of 12 currently flour exposed bakers evaluated the relation between nasal symptoms, inflammation and exposure. There was an approximately doubled risk for asthma in male bakers and for rhinitis in bakers of both genders. Bakers also changed job due to asthma or rhinitis more frequently than controls. An allergic disposition increased the risk for asthma or rhinitis. The risk for asthma or rhinitis increased by current exposure to inhalable <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> at onset of disease, but not by cumulative exposure dose. Asthma and rhinitis were associated with sensitisation to common allergens, while the impact of sensitisation to flour was unclear. Bakers with nasal symptoms had more nasal inflammation as compared with bakers without such symptoms {{and there seems to}} be an association between nasal inflammation and cumulative exposure dose. It is concluded that among Swedish bakers mainly working in the 1970 s and 1980 s, there was an approximately doubled risk for asthma in male bakers and for rhinitis in bakers of both genders. An allergic disposition increased the risk. The risk also increased by current <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> exposure. Sensitisation to common allergens was associated with asthma or rhinitis.

Two hundred male workers with current exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and two hundred non-exposed male as a control group were interviewed and self designed study questionnaire was administered to them and the parameters of their pulmonary function were measured. Results: Respiratory symptoms such as cough, expectoration, wheezing, and shortness of breath, were significantly (p <  0. 0001) higher among exposed workers as compared to unexposed. Furthermore highly significant (p <  0. 0001) decrements in the pulmonary function of exposed subjects were noted. Moreover, a highly significant decline in FEV 1 %, FVC% and FEV 1 /FVC% was noticed regarding the duration of exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> (p <  0. 0001). Also, there was a highly significant difference between heavily exposed compared to lightly exposed subjects (p <  0. 001).

40|$|Background: The {{pathogenesis}} and the pathologic alterations {{of occupational}} asthma {{are similar to}} those of nonoccupational asthma. Occupational asthma may therefore represent a useful model of "human asthma" to investigate mechanisms and pathophysiology of asthma in general. In an occupational setting the cause and onset of asthma may be easily identified, and the natural history may be examined in follow-up studies. The mechanisms involved in occupational asthma include genetic predisposition, immunologically mediated responses, as well as nonspecific airway inflammation. In particular, high molecular weight (eg, grain <b>dust,</b> <b>flour)</b> and some low molecular weight sensitizers (eg, acid anhydrides and platinum halide salts) have been shown to induce occupational asthma through an immunoglobulin E (IgE) -dependent mechanism, while cell-dependent immunologic mechanisms are likely to be more relevant for occupational asthma induced by other low molecular weight sensitizers (eg, toluene diisocyanate and plicatic acid contained in western red cedar). The pathology of the airway mucosa of occupational asthma is remarkably similar to the pathology of nonoccupational asthma, ie, characterized by infiltration and accumulation of eosinophils, mast cells, and activated lymphocytes along with subepithelial fibrosis. In this article, the most relevant mechanisms are discussed with particular reference to the similarities and discrepancies between occupational and nonoccupational asthma...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} in France to assess possible associations between occupational exposures and squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx.  METHODS—The study was restricted to men, and included 201  hypopharyngeal cancers, 296  laryngeal cancers, and 296  controls (patients with other tumour sites). Detailed information on smoking, alcohol consumption, and lifetime occupational history was collected. Occupational exposure to seven substances (formaldehyde, leather <b>dust,</b> wood <b>dust,</b> <b>flour</b> <b>dust,</b> coal dust, silica dust, and textile dust) was assessed with a job exposure matrix. Exposure variables used in the analysis were probability, duration, and cumulative level of exposure. Odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, and were adjusted for major confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol, and when relevant other occupational exposures).  RESULTS—Hypopharyngeal cancer was found to be associated with exposure to coal dust (OR 2. 31,  95 % CI 1. 21  to 4. 40), with a significant rise in risk with probability (p< 0. 005 for trend) and level (p< 0. 007 for trend) of exposure. Exposure to coal dust was also associated with an increased risk of laryngeal cancer (OR 1. 67,  95 % CI 0. 92  to 3. 02), but no dose-response pattern was found. A significant relation, limited to hypopharyngeal cancer, was found with the probability of exposure to formaldehyde (p< 0. 005 for trend), with a fourfold risk for the highest category (OR 3. 78  ,  95 % CI 1. 50  to 9. 49). When subjects exposed to formaldehyde with a low probability were excluded, the risk also increased with duration (p< 0. 04) and cumulative level of exposure (p< 0. 14).

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{studies have}} shown that even low {{exposure}} levels to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and related allergens can cause severe respiratory symptoms. In The Netherlands the Dutch government and responsible branch organizations [from bakeries (traditional & industrial), flour mills and bakery ingredient producers] signed a covenant to reduce exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust</b> and decrease the prevalence of work-related occupational airway disease. This paper describes a sector wide survey to measure exposure to <b>flour</b> <b>dust,</b> wheat allergens and fungal α-amylase. The results are being used to underpin various elements of the covenant. Methods: A dataset containing 910 personal measurements was compiled from four field studies containing information on exposure and potential determinants. The dataset represents a baseline estimate of exposure for four major flour processing sectors in The Netherlands. Exposure models for all sectors and agents were generated, based on job, tasks and company size, taking into account worker and company as random effect components. Use of control measures and, where possible, their effect were evaluated. Results: <b>Flour</b> <b>dust</b> and enzyme exposures vary strongly between sectors. The job performed and specific tasks were identified as important determinants of exposure. The number of identified control measures during walk-through surveys, and their effectiveness in reduction of dust exposure was generally limited. The exposure models explained significant exposure variability between companies and workers but performed poorly in explaining day to day differences in exposure. Discussion: The dataset serves as a baseline estimate and will be compared with a post intervention survey in the near future. The information obtained on control measures can be used to optimize the intervention scenarios that will be implemented in the different sectors by external occupational hygienists. The predictive exposure models will provide a relevant measure of average personal exposure that will be used in the sector wide health surveillance system. © The Author 2007.
