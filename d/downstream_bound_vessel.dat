For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype {{which is the}} opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour <b>bound</b> <b>vessels,</b> while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is [...] "red right returning".|$|R

Coastguards {{and others are}} permitted to broadcast short informative safety messages on channel 16, however, it is an offence in most countries to make false mayday calls. When using the channel to call up ships or shore stations, the call has to be switched to a working channel after the initial response {{in order to keep}} channel 16 available to others.|$|R

She usually carried coal to Africa: at the time, she had just been repainted at a dry dock and {{was on her}} way to pick up a load of coal. Her Master was Captain Harrison, who was accompanied by an experienced Thames river pilot. The collier was coming down the river with the tide at half speed.|$|R

50|$|Another {{tidal wave}} {{technology}} harvests energy from surface waves or from pressure fluctuations below the sea surface. A {{report from the}} Ocean Engineering Centre, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras estimates the annual wave energy potential along the Indian coast is between 5 MW to 15 MW per metre, suggesting a theoretical maximum potential for electricity harvesting from India's 7500 kilometre coast line may be about 40 GW. However, the realistic economical potential, the report claims, {{is likely to be}} considerably less. A significant barrier to surface energy harvesting is the interference of its equipment to fishing and other sea <b>bound</b> <b>vessels,</b> particularly in unsettled weather. India built its first seas surface energy harvesting technology demonstration plant in Vizhinjam, near Thiruruvananthpuram.|$|R

In this study, an advanced and efficient modelling method for impact simulation of the structure and similar multi-physics systems is presented. Numerical implementation of this modelling technique, using Abaqus finite element code is described and used in the impact simulation of the inflatable structure based on its current design {{as well as an}} alternative design of the structure. Results from the two designs provisions were compared and from these results, recommendation for improvement of the current design is also reported. This is desirable in ensuring high reliability in application of the structure in meeting its design objectives...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{triangular}} mesh generation on domains with arbitrary geometries. A special approach for the generation of an optimal number of uniformly distributed inner grid points is proposed. The scheme is based on an analogy with the construction of an equilibrium state of a system of a nite number of uniformly charged electrical particles closed in a <b>bounded</b> <b>vessel.</b> The method has minimum geometrical constraints and is therefore suitable also for domains with really complicated geometries. Ecient meshing procedure of the advancing front type is applied to the pre-constructed set of inner grid points and its reliability proved. An object-oriented freeware C++ library XGEN based on the presented method is developed. Advantages of the object-oriented approach are explained and the usage of the meshing tool briey described. Examples on the mesh generation on various domains are presented. 1 Introduction There is a number of various techniques for the 2 D an [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The first {{recorded}} wreck was in early March 1656. Two English men owar, the Primrose and Mayflower, {{were searching for}} two Spanish frigates which had been patrolling the area and had captured a Bristol <b>bound</b> <b>vessel.</b> The sixth rate, 22 gun man owar, Primrose lost her main topmast near the Longships, off Land’s End and drifted onto the Seven Stones. She managed to free herself and later sank in 60 fathom m taking sixteen men, two women and a child with her. At {{the investigation into the}} loss, Trinity House, on behalf of the Admiralty, stated that they could not find any chart that showed the reef. The Admiralty found that there was no neglect either by the Officers or company, the place of wreck being a rock not visible nor described in any chart they could find. The largest loss of life was on 27 February 1748 with the sinking of the fourteen gun sloop HMS Lizard which was wrecked with the loss of over one hundred crew.|$|R
