The data was presented in summary documents for children 0 – 14 years old (form № 12) and for infants (form № 31). Growth of morbidity with airways pathologies and pneumonias during last 7 years, remaining mortality due to pneumonias in hospitals and tendency to its increase in infants, stable quantity of patients with otitis show necessity of inclusion of effective and modern prophylactic measures including vaccination against pneumococcal infections.

Under the significant deficit of obligate physiologically useful for colonic biotic community Bifidobacteriums and Lactobacteriums there is determined the population increase {{of the level of}} bacteroides — 18. 8 %, peptococcus — 64. 9 %, clostridium — 88. 0  %, coliform bacterium — 28. 7 %, Proteus — 57 %, staphylococcus — 71. 1  %, yeast-like fungiCandida — 92. 0 %.

In Kenya, upper respiratory infections are among the most common infections encountered in outpatient facilities. Some of these infections are becoming difficult to control because some of the causing microorganisms have acquired antibiotic resistance and hence the need to develop new drugs with higher efficacy. Ethnobotanical studies have now been found to be instrumental in improving chances of discovering plants with antimicrobial activity in new drug development. In Kenya the majority of local people are turning to herbal remedies for primary health care needs. In most cases the sources of these remedies are undocumented and the knowledge about them passed orally form generation to generation, hence under threat of disappearing with current rates of modernisation. This study explored the traditional remedies used in managing various ENT diseases in seven districts of the Central Province of Kenya. The most common ENT conditions managed using traditional therapies include: common cold, cough, tonsillitis, otitis-media, chest pains and asthma. The results indicate that 67 species belonging to 36 plant families were utilized in this region. These plants were of varying habits; herbs (37. 3 %), shrubs (34. 4 %), trees (25. 4 %) as well as some grasses and sedges (3 %). The traditional preparations were found to be made mainly from leaves (49 %), roots (20. 5 %) and barks (12. 5 %). For each of the ENT conditions multiple species are utilized mainly as individual preparations but occasionally as polyherbal concoctions. In the case of common cold for example, 30 different species are used. Plants reported in this survey are important candidates for antimicrobial tests against ENT disease causing micro-organisms, especially those with antibiotic resistance. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Brain abscess {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} diseases among the neurosurgical infectious diseases which is accompanied by considerable mortality and morbidity. The aim of this research is contemplation of brain abscess in children (5 - 12 years) to ascertain the incidence, effectual underlying factors, clinical and laboratory findings and mortality and morbidity rates in Ghaem hospital in Mashad since 10 years ago. Methods: This is a descriptive and analytic study in children with brain abscess in Ghaem hospital achieved retrospectively. We considered age, sex, underlying factors, clinical and laboratory findings, location of abscess, methods of treatment (medical or surgical), the duration of staying in hospital, and mortality and morbidity of the disease. Statistical analysis was achieved with Odds Ratio and Chi 2 test. Findings: The age of children with brain abscess was 5 - 7 years. Male to female ratio was 1. 6 to 1. The most common underlying factors for brain abscesses were acute and chronic <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>ear,</b> mastoiditis, and chronic cyanotic heart disease (CCHD). The patients had fever (55. 5 %), headache (46. 6 %), focal neurological findings (64. 6 %) and altered consciousness in 46. 7 %. The most common sites of involvement were: temporo-parietal (20 %) and parietal lobe (18. 2 %). Pus culturing was positive in 34 % of cases. In 73. 3 % of cases one organism and in 26. 6 % several organisms were found in the culture. We achieved aspirated type operation in 93. 3 % of cases. The incidence of mortality and morbidity was 17. 7 % totally. The mortality and morbidity rates in patients with CCHD and otogenic brain abscess were 11. 1 % and 22. 2 % respectively. There was no meaningful correlation between mortality and morbidity with the number of abscesses or patient’s age. Conclusion: Attention to hygiene of mouth and teeth in pediatric patients with cyanotic heart disease is very important in prevention of infectious brain diseases. We must also consider attention to ear–nose–throat diseases of children. It is very important that the patients are examined again after treatment because of finding and treatment of unknown otitis and chronic sinusitis...|$|E
