5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

25|$|Pieces cannot move {{until they}} have been dalled. A die showing the dal allows the player to dal one piece, which means to turn it {{parallel}} to its row and move it one position ahead. With the first dal, only the piece closest to the stern can be dalled, and then <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> row C. With no dalled pieces, a throw with no dals is a lost move.|$|E
25|$|Rendezvous {{in orbit}} {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed {{to catch up with}} another, the result is that <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other. To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.|$|E

25|$|The 40/20 rule is a {{relatively}} new rule created to reward excellence in kicking for touch. When a player on the attacking team kicks the ball from behind his 40-metre line and <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> touch between the opposition's 20-metre line and goal-line after bouncing at least once within the field of play, a 40/20 is awarded. The usual decision to give the head and feed of the scrum to the non-kicking team when the ball enters touch is reversed if the kick is a 40/20. As scrums are rarely competitive, a successful 40/20 virtually guarantees possession in an attacking position by effectively moving the team from their own 40-metre line to the position where the ball went out.|$|E

Toyota also put the same newly designed TRD Midnight Black alloy wheels used on the FJ-S on the new TRD Pro Series 4Runner.|$|E
25|$|Between the South Carolina {{line and}} the US74 bypass, US1 is a two-lane road but sees a {{considerable}} amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US74/US220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass and Cameron. US1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US1 runs concurrently with US64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for this section of US1. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing towards US Highway 58 before South Hill.|$|E

The title of the film is a reference to iconic Hollywood culture. David Lynch lives near Mulholland Drive, and stated in an interview, [...] "At night, you ride {{on the top of the}} world. In the daytime you ride on top of the world, too, but it's mysterious, and there's a hair of fear because <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> remote areas.

Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said [...] "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric." [...] Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song [...] "40", and so they were looking to replace it with [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] from that point on. He explained, [...] "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment ...". The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it. [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] was used as the final live song, and [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] was chosen to play over the credits.|$|E
500|$|The forest cobra is an agile, diurnal {{species that}} climbs well {{and is one}} of the most aquatic of the true cobras of the genus Naja. It is terrestrial, but it is fast, graceful climber, known to ascend trees to a height of [...] or more. It is quick moving and alert. It swims well and readily takes to the water; in some areas its main diet is fish and could be {{regarded}} as semi-aquatic. Although it is active mostly during the day (diurnal) in uninhabited areas, it can also be active by night (nocturnal) where <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> urban areas. When not active, it takes cover in holes, brush piles, hollow logs, among root clusters or in rock crevices, or in abandoned termite mounds at forest fringe or clearings. In certain areas, it hides along river banks, in overhanging root systems or bird holes, and in urban areas will hide in junk piles or unused buildings. When agitated, it rears up to a considerable height and spreads a long, narrow hood. It can strike quickly, to quite a long distance, and if molested and cornered, it will rush forward and make a determined effort to bite. It is an alert and agile species of cobra. Some authorities believe it is one of the most dangerous African snakes to be kept as many captive forest cobras are described to be particularly aggressive when handled. This species is not able to [...] "spit" [...] its venom.|$|E

DVDDizzy rhetorically asked how the season [...] "stand up for someone just looking to jump into a full, semi-recent year of episodes", answering [...] "Pretty darn well". It explained [...] "Nearly everything that makes [...] "The Simpsons" [...] what it is can be found here. Most important is the large cast of Springfield residents used to perfection...Clearly, real thought and lots of <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> each episode's creation", and added [...] "it's almost miraculous how fresh and sharp [...] "The Simpsons" [...] remains in its thirteenth year on air". The site explained [...] "Not every moment here is brilliant. After a rocky start, the season really hits its groove a few episodes in. Even though jokes don't always land, there are guaranteed {{to be at least}} a few amusing moments per episode. The stylings haven't changed all that much. There are tasteful homages and cultural references, including loving parodies of classic movies, television, and literature [...] as usual, tons of famous guest stars lend their voices, some as themselves and others as fictional characters". Adam Rayner of WhatCulture wrote that [...] "Season thirteen represents a time when the show was clinging to the classic humour that was derived from situations that were rooted in a reality – albeit a heightened reality – which could happen to you and your family, while slowly descending into the surreal and farcical." [...] Matt Wheeldon of GoodFilmGuide said [...] "the 13th Season another solid, and fairly memorable, effort from the world’s best loved cartoon; even if it isn’t the be all and end all of Simpsons cartooning. DVD Talk's Ryan Keefer gave a season 3.5/5 stars and said [...] "While Jean might not have brought things to previous glory, he certainly righted the ship in Season 13." [...] Blu-Ray.com gave season 13 a 3.5/5 and Casey Broadwater's sentiment was [...] "The hit-to-miss ratio is much better here than in the previous three seasons, and while the episodes are never quite as hilarious as the Simpsons of old—from way back in the early 1990s—season 13 does mark a turning point for the series." [...] Ron Martin of 411 Mania was more critical giving the season a 6.5/10. Part of the verdict was [...] "Season 13 is representative of the chaotic scatterbrained nature the show would take on from here on out." [...] Casey Burchby of DVD Talk gave the season a 3/5 and wrote [...] "the thirteenth season is further proof of the regrettable change in comic tone that the series took on {{in the early part of}} the last decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|The United States Department of Justice filed {{a lawsuit}} against the state of Arizona in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on July 6, 2010, asking that the law be {{declared}} invalid since it interferes with the immigration regulations [...] "exclusively vested in the federal government." [...] In a brief to the press, the department's lawyers referenced the notion of federal preemption and stated that, [...] "The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country," [...] and that [...] "The immigration framework set forth by Congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns – concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state." [...] This pointed to an additional practical argument, that being that the law would result in federal authorities losing focus on their broader priorities {{in order to deal with}} an influx of deportations from Arizona. [...] The Justice Department requested that the federal courts issue an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the law before <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> effect. [...] The suit does not argue that the law will lead to racial profiling, although department officials said they would continue to monitor that aspect when and if the measure went into effect.|$|E
