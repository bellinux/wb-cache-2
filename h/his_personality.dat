5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others found <b>his</b> <b>personality</b> to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration.

5|$|If Mussorgsky's {{compositions}} {{are destined}} to live unfaded for fifty years after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me.
