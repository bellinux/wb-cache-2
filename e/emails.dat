The player assumes {{the role of an}} American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked <b>emails</b> are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.|$|E

50|$|<b>Email</b> poses special {{challenges}} for preservation: <b>email</b> client software varies widely; {{there is no}} common structure for <b>email</b> messages; <b>email</b> often communicates sensitive information; individual <b>email</b> accounts may contain business and personal messages intermingled; and <b>email</b> may include attached documents {{in a variety of}} file formats. <b>Email</b> messages can also carry viruses or have spam content. While <b>email</b> transmission is standardized, there is no formal standard for the long-term preservation of <b>email</b> messages.|$|R

5|$|On 3 September 2007, Odex {{director}} Stephen Sing {{announced on}} his company's Internet forum that Odex {{would no longer}} send letters of demand to Internet users who had stopped their illegal downloading {{since the beginning of}} the enforcement drive. Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist <b>emails</b> intended for the alleged downloaders. The company did not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such <b>emails</b> to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E

Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, <b>emails</b> sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: With {{the rapid}} growth of the number of <b>email</b> {{messages}} and the diverse use of <b>email,</b> people have become overwhelmed by the large volumes of <b>email</b> archives. As a result, <b>email</b> tools that facilitate the browsing of <b>email</b> messages are highly required. This study described an empirical study that aimed to investigate whether the usability of <b>email</b> client can be improved by incorporating graphical visualization techniques to browse <b>email</b> data. Approach: Two <b>email</b> visualization approaches, called LinearVis and MatrixVis, were developed for this empirical study which presented <b>email</b> messages based on a dateline together with other <b>email</b> information. The usability of each approach was compared to atypical <b>email</b> tool in terms of locating messages. Results: The results demonstrated that LinearVis was the most usable <b>email</b> approach in terms of browsing <b>email</b> messages whereas MatrixVis was found to be the least usable <b>email</b> condition. Conclusion: The results showed that usability of <b>email</b> clients can be significantly improved by presenting graphically <b>email</b> messages with only a small volume of hidden <b>email</b> data. Results also indicated that usability of the graphical representations, that hide large volume of <b>email</b> data, can be negatively affected...|$|R

To generate more interest among readers, Alanguilan released the sold-out first issue for free online. This led publisher Editions Ca Et La to purchase the French rights in 2010. After Alanguilan exchanged <b>emails</b> with publisher Dan Vado, Slave Labor Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of <b>email</b> {{as a viable}} and inexpensive communication channel has led to its increased presence in {{the daily lives of}} professionals. <b>Email</b> has become a ubiquitous tool in a faster paced and more globally connected world. Besides simple notes, professionals now use <b>email</b> to communicate tasks, important personal and organizational announcements, meeting requests, and share documents. As the importance of <b>email</b> has grown, professionals have made the <b>email</b> client a work nerve center. The vast increase in the volume of <b>email</b> {{and the use of the}} <b>email</b> client as a multifunctional tool now threatens the productivity gains it once created. Business professionals suffer from <b>email</b> overload which is accompanied by stress and organizational breakdowns. As a result, many organizations have created <b>email</b> free holidays and professionals have declared <b>email</b> bankruptcy. In this thesis the research on <b>email</b> overload is reviewed, analyzed, and extended through a study of <b>email</b> overload in academia. Using surveys and interviews of faculty at a large university, the researcher found that <b>email</b> overload was present in academia. The study also identified participants’ behaviors in performing <b>email</b> triage, managing <b>email</b> and <b>email</b> overload, and the effects of <b>email</b> overload. The researcher was also able to discover characteristics of cyclical <b>email</b> volumes amongst faculty which may have a direct impact on determining methods of <b>email</b> organization and the occurrence of <b>email</b> overload. Additionally, the study identified that faculty have extended their <b>email</b> client ever further by using it as a task and project manager, information manager, workload barometer, and headline aggregator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Email</b> viruses {{constitute}} one of {{the major}} Internet security problems. In this paper we present an <b>email</b> virus model that accounts for the behaviors of <b>email</b> users, such as <b>email</b> checking frequency and the probability of opening an <b>email</b> attachment. <b>Email</b> viruses spread over a logical network defined by <b>email</b> address books. The topology of <b>email</b> network {{plays an important role in}} determining the behavior of an <b>email</b> virus spreading. Our observations suggest that the node degrees in an <b>email</b> network are heavy-tailed distributed and we model it as a power law network. We compare <b>email</b> virus propagation on three topologies: power law, small world and random graph topologies. The impact of the power law topology on the spread of <b>email</b> viruses is mixed: <b>email</b> viruses spread more quickly than on a small world or a random graph topology but immunization defense against viruses is more effective on a power law topology...|$|R

40|$|As the {{criticality}} of <b>email</b> {{for electronic}} business activity increases, ad-hoc <b>email</b> implementation, prolonged management neglect and user abuse of <b>email</b> systems have generated negative effects. However, managements ability to rectify problems with <b>email</b> systems is hindered by {{our understanding of}} its organisational use. Research on <b>email</b> systems is often dated, and based on quantitative methodologies that cannot explain the interaction between various controls in organisational settings. Updating {{our understanding of the}} organisational aspects of <b>email</b> systems utilizing qualitative methods is necessary. This paper presents a multiple case study investigation of <b>email</b> system monitoring and control. The study examines the interaction between key elements of <b>email</b> control identified by previous researchers, and considers the role of such controls at various implementation phases. The findings reveal eight major elements to be particularly important in monitoring and controlling <b>email</b> systems within the organisations studied. These are: (1) form a cross-functional <b>email</b> system management team; (2) implement and regularly update <b>email</b> management software; (3) formulate a detailed and legally sound <b>email</b> policy; (4) engage in structured <b>email</b> system training; (5) create and maintain ongoing awareness of <b>email</b> policy; (6) engage in a process of hybrid feedback and control based <b>email</b> monitoring; (7) firmly enforce discipline in accordance with the <b>email</b> policy; and (8) conduct regular reviews and updates of the <b>email</b> management programme...|$|R
