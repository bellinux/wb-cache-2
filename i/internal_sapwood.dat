30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the respiration rate of logs increased as a function of temperature following Arrhenius' equation, with activation energy (Ea) value of 27708 J mol− 1. The respiration rate at a reference temperature of 20 °C decreased from 25.1 mg CO 2 kg DW− 1 h− 1 one week after harvest to 16.2 and 11.5 mg CO 2 kg DW− 1 h− 1 three and six weeks after harvest, respectively. The dominant respiration tissue shifted from cambial and parenchymatous tissues in ‘fresh’ logs towards the <b>internal</b> <b>sapwood</b> over a six-week period. This shift may be attributed to severe dehydration of the outer layers. Microbial activity also contributed to the respiration of logs when stored at humid conditions.|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{and fungi}} were {{isolated}} from {{external and internal}} zone of brown and water saturated wood of trunk of Betula pendula trees aged 44 - 46. Quantitative and qualitative differences in the bacterial and fungal populations were found between both the zones. Populations of bacteria increased towards the <b>internal</b> <b>sapwood,</b> contrary to the fungi which more frequently colonised the external zone. The most common bacteria were Pseudomonas spp. (mainly P. fluorescens biovar I) whereas Bacillus macerans, B. alvei and Erwinia heibicola were able to degrade the polygalacturonic acid and pectin gels. In case of the fungi population, the most common (more than 3 %) colonising the external zone were successively: Phialophora fastigiata, Trichoderma harzianum, Alternaria alternata, Mortierella isabellina, Cladosporium herbarum, T. viride, C. cladosporioides and Melanconium betulinum. In the community of fungi occurring in the internal zone, the most common (more than 6. 5 %) were: Cladosporium herbarum, Phialophora lagerbergii and Ph. fastigiata...|$|E
