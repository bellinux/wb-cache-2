5|$|Lutosławski's {{formidable}} technical developments {{grew out}} of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to his resolution of purpose {{in the face of}} the anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral {{was built on the}} site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E

50|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 1,052 men, including 509 prisoners. The Prussians had lost 130. The battle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to {{the superiority of}} the Needle gun over the Austrian Lorenz rifle.|$|R
5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> {{to the success of the}} Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E
50|$|The 2008 season <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to McKillop's {{recruiting}} prowess, as {{they have}} been carried by the shooting of Stephen Curry, who did not get a second look from most of the bigger programs.|$|R

5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E

50|$|Its solid fortifications <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the innumerable {{attacks by}} Spanish, French and English pirates and privateers.

50|$|Kim’s books <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to his {{stubborn}} {{engagement with}} the events of modern Korean history. Kim believes that literature is grounded, created and manifested in reality; and only as such, can it attain the power to heal wounded souls.|$|R
5000|$|The various {{samplers}} {{displayed on}} the walls <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the skill and diligence of their young creators from {{a time when a}} neat hand with a needle and an [...] "improving" [...] text <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sign of a good upbringing.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to {{the good}} design and {{workmanship}} that went into his steam engines, that several of his big mill engines ran for over eighty years, and one of them, installed second-hand at the locomotive repair works at King's Cross, ran for over a century.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{to this point}} has been classical. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament,</b> however, to the generality of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics that the treatment can be made quantum mechanical with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities.

25|$|In September 2014 {{with the}} rise of the Islamic State, the U.S. {{government}} began aggressive military operations against them in both Iraq and Syria. SAD Ground Branch was placed in charge of the ground war.

50|$|Rebuffat {{produced}} three colour films depicting {{himself and}} others climbing in the Alps. These <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to his skill as a climber, {{and his love}} of the mountains. Étoiles et Tempêtes won the Grand Prix at the Trento Filmfestival in Italy. Trente.|$|R
50|$|Malcolm was {{apparently}} largely {{ignorant of the}} long-term effects of Margaret's endeavours, not being especially religious himself.

50|$|Unfortunately, by {{the time}} {{portable}} tape recording became available in the 1950s, he had largely given up playing owing to severe deafness.

25|$|That MHS outlived the National Board of Health {{and emerged}} in the 1890s reinvigorated <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Hamilton's skills as a {{political}} negotiator {{as well as a}} bureaucrat. Under his tenure, MHS gained authorities to establish a national quarantine on sea and land (interstate), formal recognition of merit-based requirements for a Commissioned Corps of medical officers, and a new laboratory devoted to bacteriology, the newest public health science of the day.|$|E
25|$|The Rev Henry Tuberville, DD {{wrote this}} {{catechism}} in 1649 at the English College of Douay in Flanders. It {{is based on}} the Roman Catechism of the Council of Trent and was similarly written with the purpose of teaching Christian doctrine during the tumultuous English Reformation. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Rev. Tuberville and his colleagues at Douay that it remains one of the clearest and most direct compendiums of Catholic teaching in the English language.|$|E
25|$|The film is {{also thought}} notable for {{being one of}} the first adult films to be {{produced}} or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might anger or offend the target audience (straight men). That Bernard would do so <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament,</b> film historians have said, to his willingness to take risks and his subtle understanding of the role homoeroticism and homosexuality play in French male sexual identity.|$|E
50|$|This Charming Man {{has been}} {{described}} as Marian Keyes's darkest and most uncompromising novel.

25|$|Although some {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas were traditionally hunter-gatherers—and many, especially in the Amazon basin, still are—many groups practiced aquaculture and agriculture. The impact of their agricultural endowment to the world <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to their time and work in reshaping and cultivating the flora indigenous to the Americas. Although some societies depended heavily on agriculture, others practiced a mix of farming, hunting, and gathering. In some regions the {{indigenous peoples}} created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, chiefdoms, states, and empires.|$|E
25|$|The {{years between}} its first {{sighting}} by Sprent {{and the first}} successful summit expedition almost 50 years later saw a mixture of hardy pioneer adventurers trying to bag the peak. The thick horizontal scrub, mixed with ancient cool temperate rainforest which dominates the area {{proved to be the}} barrier between men and the mountain. Together with the harsh weather generated by the roaring forties the mountain did not give itself easily. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to the wildness of the Tasmanian South West that it took almost 50 years to reach its heart and jewel.|$|E
25|$|The Alhambra {{palace and}} {{fortress}} best reflects {{the culture and}} art of the last centuries of Moorish rule of Al-Andalus. The complex was completed {{towards the end of}} the Muslim rule of Spain by Yusuf I (1333–1353) and Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada (1353–1391). Artists and intellectuals took refuge at Alhambra after the Reconquista began to roll back Muslim territory. The site integrates natural qualities with constructed structures and gardens, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> to Moorish culture in Spain and to the skills of the Muslim artisans, craftsmen, and builders of their era.|$|E
50|$|Featuring {{national}} and international artists, SMF concerts (past and present) draw crowds of 4,000-plus fans who turn out to see bands not widely recognized by the general public.
