5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
