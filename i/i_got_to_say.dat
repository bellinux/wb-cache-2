500|$|Music {{writers have}} {{described}} the instrumental's jazz elements and Murray questions whether Hendrix's approach was studied or more organic. [...] Bassist Jaco Pastorius felt that Hendrix's impact on jazz was obvious: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is... 'Third Stone from the Sun'. [...] And for anyone who doesn't know about that by now , they should have checked Jimi out a lot earlier." [...] Shadwick feels that the freak-out sections may have inspired countless less-imaginative imitators.

500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1987, Lightfoot filed {{a lawsuit}} against {{composer}} Michael Masser, claiming that Masser's melody for the song [...] "The Greatest Love of All"—recorded by George Benson (1977) and Whitney Houston (1985)—stole 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". The transitional section that begins [...] "I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow" [...] of the Masser song has the same melody as [...] "I never thought I could feel this way and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back" [...] of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated {{that he did not want}} people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, it was {{reported}} that Red Sox closer Jonathan Papelbon had made comments about the incident stating that in his opinion, it was [...] "a bunch of bull what [...] did. All <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> is what comes around goes around, man. Payback's a bitch, I'll tell you what", and that [...] "this thing isn't all settled and done." [...] Papelbon also said that things would be different at Tropicana Field the next time the Red Sox were there, as opposed to the last time in which the Red Sox were swept by the Rays {{for the first time in}} franchise history. In that series from June 30 to July 2, the Rays swept the Red Sox at home for the second time in the season, and Papelbon never pitched in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Two notable {{people who}} had {{previously}} defended Cosby, and believed in his innocence, changed their minds. American actress and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg and Joseph C. Phillips (a Cosby Show regular for three years) each made public statements on July 15, 2015. Goldberg said, [...] "If {{this is to be}} tried {{in the court of public}} opinion, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> all of the information that's out there kind of points to guilt." [...] In an interview Goldberg had a message for Cosby: [...] "It looks bad, Bill. Either speak up or shut up." [...] Goldberg had received threats for staunchly standing by Cosby. Goldberg, in the form of a question, referred to Cosby as a [...] "serial rapist" [...] and questioned why he was still on the streets. Phillips was more direct in a separate comment from Goldberg, saying [...] "Of course Bill Cosby is guilty!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just walk away from it all completely." ...|$|E

[...] "My heart died within me, that time; but I kneeled down and said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belief right through, and then the Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer. But no, the gate wouldn't open; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and, thinks I, this makes four, and 'tis all I know out of book, and if this don't do it nothing will, and I'm a lost man.

6000|$|Besides the astonishment {{which the}} rock scenery {{on the hill}} was {{calculated}} to excite, we found in its neighbourhood an additional cause for surprise of a very different description. Just as we were preparing to ascend the eminence, {{the silence of the}} great waste around us was broken by a long and hearty cheer. The Hurlers themselves, if they had suddenly returned to a state of flesh and blood, and resumed their interrupted game, could hardly have made more noise, or exhibited a greater joviality of disposition, than did some three or four tradesmen of the town of Liskeard, who had been enjoying a pic-nic under the Cheese-Wring, had seen us approaching over the plain, and now darted out of their ambush to welcome us, flourishing porter-bottles in their hands as olive branches of peace, amity, and good-will. My companion skilfully contrived to make his escape; but I was stopped and surrounded in an instant. One benevolent stranger held a glass in a very slanting position, while a brother philanthropist violently uncorked a bottle and directed half of its contents in a magnificent jet of light brown froth all over everybody, before he found the way into the tumbler. It was of no use to decline imbibing the remainder of the light brown froth--"There was the Cheese-Wring (cried all the benevolent strangers in chorus), and here was the porter--I must drink all their good healths, and they would all drink mine--this was Cornish hospitality, and Cornish hospitality was notoriously the finest thing in the world! As for my friend there, who was drawing, they bore him no ill-will because he wouldn't drink--they would buy his drawing, and one of the commercial gentlemen, who was a stationer, would publish a hundred, two hundred, five hundred, a thousand copies of it, on sheets of letter-paper, price one penny! What had <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to that?--If that wasn't hospitality, what the devil was?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I see," [...] {{interrupted}} the good-natured seaman; [...] "well, it is reading the Word of God that I mean. You see, I regard the Bible as my class-book, my book o' logarithms, chart compass, rudder, etcetera, all rolled into one. Now, I don't mind tellin' you a secret. When I {{first went to}} sea I was a very wild harum-scarum young fellow, an' havin' some sort of influence over my mates, I did 'em a deal of damage and led 'em astray. Well, when the Lord in His great mercy saved my soul, I could not forget this, and although I knew I was forgiven, my heart was grieved {{to think of the}} mischief I had done. I felt as if I would give anything in life to undo it if I could. As this was not possible, however, I bethought me that the next best thing would be to do as much good as I could to the class that I had damaged, so, when I came home and left the sea for good, I used to go down about the docks and give away Bibles and Testaments to the sailors. Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a word or two to 'em now and then about their souls but I soon found that there are professed unbelievers among the tars, an' they put questions that puzzled me at times, so I took to readin' the Bible with a view to answering objectors an' bein' able to give a reason of the hope that is in me--to studyin', in fact, what I call theology. But I ain't above takin' help," [...] continued the captain with a modest look, [...] "from ordinary good books when I come across 'em--my chief difficulty bein', to find out what are the best books to consult, and this has led me sometimes to think of buyin' up all the theological books I can lay hands on, an' glancin' 'em all through so as to make notes of such as seemed worth readin' with care. The labour however seems so great, that up to now I've bin kept back, but I've had a talk with a friend to-day which has decided me, so I'll go off to Yarmouth to-morrow an' buy a whole lot o' theological books--a regular library in fact--and set to work to read up.
