60|$|March 20.--Despatched proofs {{and copy}} this morning; and Swanston, the carpenter, coming in, I made a sort <b>of</b> busy <b>idle</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> it with {{altering}} and hanging pictures and prints, to {{find room for}} those which came from Edinburgh, and by dint of being on foot from ten to near five, put all things into apple-pie order. What strange beings we are! The serious duties I have on hand cannot divert my mind from the most melancholy thoughts; and yet the talking with these workmen, and the trifling occupation which they give me, serves to dissipate my attention. The truth is, I fancy that a body under the impulse of violent motion cannot be stopped or forced back, but may indirectly be urged into a different channel. In the evening I read, and sent off my Sheriff-Court processes.|$|R

5000|$|A {{common theme}} in {{criticism}} of Hebrew Sabbath rest was idleness, found {{not to be}} in the Christian spirit of rest. Irenaeus (late 2nd c.), also citing continuous Sabbath observance, wrote that the Christian [...] "will not be commanded to leave <b>idle</b> one <b>day</b> <b>of</b> rest, who is constantly keeping sabbath", and Tertullian (early 3rd century) argued [...] "that we still more ought to observe a sabbath from all servile work always, and not only every seventh-day, but through all time". This early metaphorical interpretation of Sabbath applied it to the entire Christian life.|$|R

In addition, many private cars are also put on display. Other large cities featured rail equipment and displays from freight railroads, transit agencies, non-profit rail organizations and historical societies as part <b>of</b> National Train <b>Day.</b> Some smaller events consisted of a model train layout from a local club or other train-related items on display.|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{application}} of a network management framework, called Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), to manage a particular type of network devices named Terminal Node Controller (TNC). TNCs are widely used in the amateur packet radio community. We present new tools based on SNMP for remote management of TNCs. A Management Information Base (MIB) has been created for the TNCs parameters we manage in KISS mode. The MIB is implemented under the Linux operating system and uses the CMU-SNMP package. We implemented also a new command to manage simultaneously and remotely several TNC parameters. Keywords: Network management, terminal node controller, management information base, Linux. 1 Introduction The number of users accessing amateur packet radio is growing from day to <b>day.</b> Managers <b>of</b> telecommunications <b>equipment</b> are called {{to pay more attention to}} these pieces <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> in order to exploit them in a better way.

In July 1917 during the Third Battle of Ypres, although both divisions were totally exhausted after 13 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> moving heavy <b>equipment</b> under heavy shelling he ordered their battalions advance through deep mud towards well fortified German positions left untouched by totally inadequate artillery preparation.

In these <b>days</b> <b>of</b> off-hand <b>equipment,</b> the matter was easily enough arranged.

60|$|The islanders {{were ready}} to give up their idols and call {{themselves}} Christians, to hear Mr. Williams preach, and to observe the Sabbath; being, in fact, like the Red Indians of Eliot's experience, so <b>idle</b> that a <b>day</b> <b>of</b> no work made no difference to them. Their indolence, the effect of their enervating climate, was well-nigh invincible; they preferred hunger to trouble, and withal their customs were abhorrent to Christian morality. Most islets of the South Seas have much the same experience. The people, taken on their best side, show themselves gentle and intelligent, and their chiefs are dignified gentlemen; but there is a horrible background of ferocity and barbarism--often cannibalism. It generally proves comparatively easy to obtain a recognition of Christianity, and the cruelty and violence are usually laid aside; but to bring purity and morality to bear upon these races is a much more difficult thing, and the apparent failures have been at once the grief and reproach of missionaries, while those who assail them with scoffs forget the difficulty of dealing with the inveterate customs of a whole people, in a luxurious climate, and with little or no inducement to such industrial occupations or refinements of mind, as are the best auxiliaries of religion in raising the tone.|$|R
