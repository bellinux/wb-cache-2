500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{challenges}} to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding due process and equal protection, none of which were successful. [...] Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the act, including whether knowledge of soring or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is the only issue that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the Circuit Court level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the Fifth Circuit Court, it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.|$|E

Some business owners complain that open displays of affection drives away tourists and other visitors.

'Gentlemen,' said the judge to the jurors, after he had gone through all the evidence, and told them what was admissible, and what was not--'gentlemen, I must especially remind you, that in coming to a verdict in the matter, no amount of guilt on the part of any other person can render guiltless him whom you are now trying, or palliate his guilt if he be guilty.

That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> which you are called on to decide; not whether Mr. Scott, for purposes of his own, led Mr. Tudor on to guilt, and then turned against him; but whether Mr. Tudor himself has, or has not, been guilty under this Act of Parliament that has been explained to you.|$|E
