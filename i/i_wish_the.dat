5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>the</b> effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

But while the nation remains so divided over abortion, I believe that the states, through the democratic process, should determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate."

[...] Jeff Lake of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10 and said, [...] "Overall, A-Force #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially {{in the hands of}} Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 saying, [...] "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, {{that you have to have}} read a Secret Wars tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson does a great job at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to be a fun addition to the Marvel Universe." ...|$|E
