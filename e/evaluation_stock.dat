40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} stock accounting {{records in the}} phase of purchasing and releasing in a certain company. This thesis is divided to theoretical and practical part. Stocks are important for manufacturing companies. The theoretical part describes demarcation of stock and its basic separation, different methods of <b>stock</b> <b>evaluation</b> during the purchasing and releasing, methods of stock accounting, stocks of own production, accounting transactions {{at the end of}} the accounting period, discounts on purchased stocks and stock management. The aim of this thesis is to perform a practical application of <b>stock</b> <b>evaluation</b> based on the previous theoretical knowledge. The practical part firstly describes a specific company which was chosen for the study. This company is HELUZ brick industry v. o. s [...] The practical part presents a comparison of methods of <b>stock</b> <b>evaluation</b> during the releasing based on the accounting records received from the company. The methods of <b>stock</b> <b>evaluation</b> used in thesis are: weighted arithmetic average, FIFO and LIFO.

40|$|The <b>evaluation</b> of <b>stocks</b> and the {{selection}} of the ‘best’ ones is an important step in the process of constructing an optimal portfolio. This study proposes the multicriteria method UTADIS (UTilites Additives DIScriminantes) for the sorting of stocks in categories incorporating, not only quantitative measures, but also the knowledge as well as the preferences of experts. The study illustrates the application of the method on the construction industry stocks in Athens Stock Exchange, using the financial characteristics of the companies. The model developed is evaluated according to its usefulness in a decision process. Further research and the application of the method in other industries’ stocks can establish the method as an important tool in <b>stock</b> <b>evaluation</b> and the relative decision making process. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{volatility}} of commodity prices, {{the application of the}} current cost theory in the <b>evaluation</b> of <b>stocks</b> is essential for providing information on the performance of agricultural cooperatives. The objective of this work was to check the economies and diseconomies in the stock cost of three commodities (soye, wheat and corn) in an agricultural cooperative in the state of ParanÃ¡. A descriptive and quantitative research was carried out, including a case study demonstrating the use of market quotas {{as an alternative to the}} <b>evaluation</b> of <b>stocks</b> according to information on current prices of agricultural commodities. The results show differences between the stock values appraised by the historic cost, the corrected historic cost, the current cost and the corrected current cost. Using the historic cost, no economy or diseconomy was observed. With the corrected historic cost there is a small economy of cost. However, using the current cost and the corrected current cost there is a considerable economy, which highlights the importance of the current cost theory. The application of the current cost theory in the evaluation of actives, when market information is available, is essential for obtaining satisfactory results because it increases the utility of the information provided. current cost theory, cost economy or diseconomy, commodities.,...|$|R

Based on EEG technology and Low Resolution Brain Tomography we find something very new in the area: men and women use different neural circuits to make financial investment decisions. We also find that, on average, female trade less stock in each investment decision and make more decisions to sell than men, what is congruent with literature that describes that normally male have more optimistic aspirations in negotiations than female (Babcock, 2003 and Riley & Babcock, 2002) and female try to make investments decision that produce financial return in short-term period (Overman et al., 2004).

40|$|Principal Findings : According to fishers, fishing {{activity}} substantially {{evolved in the}} area with time, expanding towards deeper grounds and towards areas more distant from the coast. The maximum amount of catch ever caught {{and the weight of}} the largest species ever captured inversely declined with time. Fishers (70 %) cited specific fishing grounds where depletion occurred. They documented ecological changes of marine biodiversity during {{the last half of the}} century: 94 % reported the decline of commercially important fish and invertebrates and 61 % listed species that could have been extirpated, with frequent mentions to cartilaginous fish. Declines and extirpations were in line with available quantitative <b>evaluations</b> from <b>stock</b> assessments and international conventions, and were likely linked to fishing impacts. Conversely, half of interviewed fishers claimed that several species had proliferated, such as cephalopods, jellyfish, and small-sized fish. These changes were likely related to trophic cascades due to fishing and due to climate change effects. The species composition of depletions, local extinctions and proliferations showed differences by region suggesting that regional dynamics are important when analysing biodiversity changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Stocking is {{commonly}} practiced to create, sustain, or enhance fisheries, but comprehensive <b>evaluations</b> of <b>stocking</b> success are rare. I assessed the relative abundance, survival, {{and growth of}} three strains of brown trout Salmo trutta that were stocked as sympatric populations into six rivers to evaluate relative stocking performance from 1997 to 2000. Stocked brown trout from wild broodstock were initially smaller but were more abundant and had higher survival and growth rates than fish from two domestic strains. However, on average, the densities and biomass of all stocked brown trout were lower than the densities and biomass of unclipped resident brown trout. Fisheries managers must consider the performance of individual stocked brown trout strains, {{as well as the}} performance of stocked brown trout in general, when implementing or reviewing brown trout stocking programs. The stocking of trout into rivers where low natural reproduction or some other habitat feature limits the quality of trout fisheries is a common fisheries management practice. Traditionally, domesticated strains have been selectively bred to improve survival, growth, maturity, fecundity, and disease resistance i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Efficient public {{transportation}} {{is becoming increasingly}} vital for modern capitals. DSB S-tog a/s is the major supplier of rail traffic on the infrastructure of the city-rail network in Copenhagen. S-tog has experienced a demand for increasing volume {{and quality of the}} transportation offered to the customers, and has concurrently been met with demands for higher efficiency in the daily operation. The plans of timetable, rolling stock and crew must hence allow for a high level of customer service, be efficient, and be robust against disturbances of operations. It is a highly non-trivial task to meet these conflicting goals. S-tog has therefore on the strategic level decided to use software with optimization capabilities in the planning processes. We describe the current status for each activity using optimization or simulation as a tool: Timetable <b>evaluation,</b> rolling <b>stock</b> planning, and crew scheduling. In addition we describe on-going efforts in using mathematical models in activities such as timetable design and work-force planning. We also identify some organizatorial key factors, which have paved the way for extended use of optimization methods in railway production planning. ...|$|R
