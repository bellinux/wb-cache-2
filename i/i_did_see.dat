25|$|I {{discovered}} {{a dark and}} hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
500|$|On 21 May 1942, The Shooting Star {{concluded}} serialisation. Less {{than a week}} later, {{the occupied}} government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would {{have to wear a}} yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn't want to believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} and news {{director for the}} local radio station WHJB, John Murphy, {{arrived on the scene}} of the event before authorities had arrived, in response to several calls to the station from alarmed citizens. He took several photographs and conducted interviews with witnesses. His former wife Bonnie Milslagle later reported that all but one roll of the film were confiscated by military personnel. WHJB office manager Mabel Mazza described one of the pictures: [...] "It was very dark and it was with a lot of trees around and everything. And I don't know how far away from the site he was. But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> a picture of a sort of a cone-like thing. It's the only time I ever saw it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Hynek and Vallee's 1975 book The Edge of Reality, Hynek {{published}} a stereoscopic {{photograph of a}} UFO he took during a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two exposures. UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book Psychic Vibrations that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he later told a reporter for The Globe and Mail {{that he had never}} seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek [...] "has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> one—not without a witness'".|$|E
60|$|Bessie. Oh, yes. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> you. You had {{something}} under your coat.|$|E

6000|$|... "A small hollow <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>see,</b> but as to {{its being}} a heel-print I could not {{pronounce}} on that. Has it been made lately, think you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> to it," [...] replied Tolly, in a {{disappointed}} tone, [...] "and {{it struck}} fire splendidly when I tried it before startin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Goodness! If ever <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> such a pig!' said Ellen King, as she {{mounted the}} stairs. 'I wouldn't touch {{him with a}} pair of tongs!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It sounds rather silly, as {{a matter}} of fact," [...] said Mr. Farrer, slowly. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> a broken bough moving about the garden." ...|$|E

6000|$|Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, [...] "Yes, I thought <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> {{four or five}} men; {{but it was too}} dim to be sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{up against}} things and can't see my way. That is, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>see</b> where <b>I</b> mean to go, but don't know if I ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don Arturo nodded. [...] "I imagine <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>see.</b> You {{thought you}} could handle the thing better than Don Ramon and the Spanish officers? Rather a bold claim, was it not?" ...|$|R
60|$|JOHNNY. Or he {{can spend}} more on it than it brings him in: thats how I look at it. What I say is that everybody's {{business}} is nobody's business. I hope I'm not a hard man, nor a narrow man, nor unwilling to pay reasonable taxes, and subscribe in reason to deserving charities, and even serve on a jury in my turn; and no man can say I ever refused to help a friend out of a difficulty when he was worth helping. But when you ask me to go beyond that, I tell you frankly <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>I</b> never <b>did</b> <b>see</b> it, even when I was only a boy, and had to pretend to take in all the ideas the Governor fed me up with. I didnt <b>see</b> it; and <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>see</b> it.|$|R

60|$|MITCHENER. I {{might make}} him my {{chaplain}}. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>see</b> why <b>I</b> shouldnt have a chaplain on my staff. He showed a very proper spirit in punching that young cub's head. <b>I</b> should have <b>done</b> the same myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>see</b> him; {{but that}} was all. He {{seemed to be in}} a {{tremendous}} hurry, and said he must be back in town to-night. He's not staying, is he?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I see! And yet," [...] he went on, [...] "I am {{not quite}} sure that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Is</b> there any radical {{difference}} between marriage and a really intimate friendship {{between a man and}} a woman?" ...|$|R
