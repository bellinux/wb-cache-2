5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time. The crew {{were looking for}} a script which could go immediately into production in order to free up time to work on other scripts which needed more work. She <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> executive producer Michael Piller, who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E
5|$|While match referee Massimo Busacca and {{his assistants}} {{collected}} their mementoes of the final, the Barcelona team formed a {{guard of honour}} for the Manchester United players, just as the English side had done for Chelsea in 2008.

Other dignitaries present included Manchester United chief executive David Gill; The Football Association's president Prince William, and chairman Lord Triesman; Barcelona president Joan Laporta; Juan Carlos I of Spain; Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar; and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

The Penguins lost in five games to the top-seeded New Jersey Devils, as their players held Lemieux and Jágr without a goal that series.

25|$|Very few Gozo boats still survive today. One {{of these}} is the Sacra Famiglia (G32), which was built in Kalkara in 1933. It had become {{unseaworthy}} by the 1970s, and was beached at Mġarr. The hulk was eventually purchased by a private individual who wanted to sell it to the Ministry for Gozo. It was then purchased by the Gozo Channel Company Limited, who <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Wirt Għawdex and sponsored its restoration. After the boat was restored by the Caruana brothers (the sons of its original builder), it was placed on permanent display at the Żewwieqa promenade in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E
25|$|Diocletian and Maximian {{stepped down}} as co-emperors on May 1, 305, {{possibly}} due to Diocletian's poor health. Before the assembled armies at Milan, Maximian removed his purple cloak and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Severus, the new Caesar, and proclaimed Constantius as Augustus. The same scene played out at Nicomedia {{under the authority of}} Diocletian. Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a Caesar, fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill. Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, just as he was preparing to campaign in Britain.|$|E
25|$|On 3 March 1942, Hitler awarded Pavelić the Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Siegfried Kasche, the German envoy, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him in Zagreb. Eugen Dido Kvaternik, son of Slavko Kvaternik, {{and one of}} {{the main}} protagonists in the Ustaše {{genocide}} of the Serbs stated that Pavelić directed Croat nationalism against the Serbs in order to distract the Croat population from a potential backlash against the Italians over his territorial concessions to them in Dalmatia. The worst policies directed against minorities were Ustaše-run concentration and forced labor camps. The most notorious camp was the Jasenovac concentration camp, where 80,000–100,000 people died, including around 18,000 Croatian Jews, or around 90% of the pre-World War II Jewish community.|$|E
