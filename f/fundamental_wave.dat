30|$|Hou {{proposes a}} {{residual}} spectrum saliency model {{from the perspective}} of information theory [22]. He believes that human visual processing mechanism can be interpreted with efficient encoding. From {{the point of view of}} information theory, efficient coding decomposes images into two parts. One is the new information, and the other is priori information. The prior information belongs to the redundant information and should be suppressed in the encoding of the system. For the image scene, these redundant information represent the statistical invariant attribute in the environment. By means of removing the remaining components from the image, the detection algorithm of residual spectrum significant component highlights the new information in the image, that is, the image of the significant components. The main idea is to see the image as multi-object projection accumulated under the uniform background and represents it with the image of the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The amplitude spectrum is usually affected by the characteristics of object regardless of its position, so the original object image is decomposed into weighted sum of complex <b>fundamental</b> <b>waves.</b> If regarding these <b>fundamental</b> <b>waves</b> as a set of features, the amplitude spectrum shows the weight of these features in the image.

Following the great minds that first drew the links between music and physics—a list including Pythagoras, Kepler, Newton, Einstein, and Rakim—The Jazz of Physics revisits the ancient realm where music, physics, and the cosmos were one. This cosmological journey accompanies Alexander’s own tale of struggling to reconcile his passion for music and physics, from taking music lessons as a boy in the Bronx to studying theoretical physics at Imperial College, London’s inner sanctum of string theory.
