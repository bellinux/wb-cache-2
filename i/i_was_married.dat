Kilu-Hepa, or Gilukhipa, the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh Amenhotep III, who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or Tadukhipa, the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.|$|E

500|$|Anderson was by {{no means}} alone in her late {{emergence}} onto the literary stage: Geordie Williamson notes that several of Anderson's Australian female contemporaries including Elizabeth Jolley, Olga Masters, and Amy Witting did not begin publishing until they had reached retirement age. He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances, including [...] "the demands of family and work, lack of financial independence, an indifferent publishing environment." [...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married,</b> and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was the house) ... I never craved {{to be out in the}} workplace." [...] He suggests that, as well as adverse material circumstances, Anderson's career was delayed, and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain [...] "diffidence regarding her gifts." [...] In her own essay entitled [...] "Starting Too Late," [...] Anderson complains that [...] "they are unwilling servants, those skills we learn too late." [...] She would perhaps have described success as such a skill. When asked about how winning awards had affected her life, she replied that: ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married,</b> and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of giving my word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E

Santorum replied, [...] "I'm a conservative. I'm not a libertarian. I believe in some government. I do believe that... as a senator from Pennsylvania that I had a responsibility {{to go out there}} and represent the interests of my state." [...] Moderator Josh McElveen asked Paul if he stood by comments that Gingrich was a [...] "chicken hawk" [...] for not serving in the military. When Paul said that he did, Gingrich said, [...] "Dr. Paul has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false. The fact is, I never asked for deferment. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married</b> with a child. It was never a question." [...] Paul replied, [...] "When I was drafted, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married</b> and had two kids, and I went", which was greeted with applause.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pressure}} of the Serbian Kingdom on the Kingdom of Albania grew especially {{under the leadership of}} Stefan Dušan. Although the fate of city of Durrës, the capital of the Kingdom, is unknown, by 1346 all Albania was reported to be under the rule of Dushan. In 1348, Charles, Duke of Durazzo, was decapitated by his cousin Philip II, Prince of Taranto, who also inherited his rights on the Kingdom of Albania. Meanwhile, in Albania, after the death of Dušan, his empire began to disintegrate and, in central Albania, the Thopia family under Karl Topia, claimed rights to the Kingdom of Albania. In fact Stefan Uroš <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married</b> to [...] Helen of Anjou and Karl Topia was recognized as Count of Albania. Karl Thopia took Durrës from the Angevins in 1368 with the consensus of its citizens. In 1376 Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo who had gained the rights on the Albanian Kingdom from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383, Thopia took once again control of the city.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Albanian territories were lost, {{the notion}} and {{rights of the}} Kingdom of Albania {{continued}} for the Angevins {{for a long time}} after Charles of Anjou's death. The Kingdom was inherited by Charles II after the death of his father in 1285. In August 1294, Charles II passed his rights on Albania to his son Philip I, Prince of Taranto. In November 1294, Philip <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>married</b> to the daughter of the Epirote Despot Nikephoros I, renewing the old alliance between the two states. His plans of recovering old Angevin domains were paused for a while when in 1299 Philip of Taranto became a prisoner of Frederick III of Sicily in the Battle of Falconaria. However, after his release in 1302, he claimed his rights on the Albanian kingdom and began preparations to recover it. He gained the support of local Albanian Catholics who preferred a Catholic Italian power as their protector instead of [...] the Orthodox Serbs and Greeks, as well as the support of Pope Benedict XI. In the summer of 1304, Serbs were expelled from the city of Durrës by its citizens and local nobles, who in September submitted themselves to Angevin rule. Philip and his father Charles II renewed the old privileges that Charles of Anjou had promised to the citizens and nobility of Durrës. In 1305, further extensive exemptions from dues and taxes were granted to the citizens of Durrës and the local nobles from Charles II.|$|E
2500|$|Zina {{recorded}} in her autobiography {{that when she}} was eighteen she was courted by Henry Bailey Jacobs. During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy. On March 7, 1841, she married Jacobs, believing she had thus avoided future proposals from Smith. Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett conducted the ceremony. Her journal from the day of the wedding reads: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>Married</b> to Mr. Henry Bailey Jacobs. He had been a missionary preaching the Gospel for some time. His Father Henry Jacobs {{was one of the first}} elders in the Church, faithful and true until the last.Zina become pregnant shortly after her marriage. However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for myself from the Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me if I did not establish that principle [...] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life." [...] She and Smith were married on October 27, 1841. [...] Her brother Dimick performed the ceremony. [...] By that time, Joseph was married to five other women, besides his first wife Emma: Fanny Alger, Louisa Beaman, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, Nancy Marinda Johnson Hyde, and Clarissa Reed Hancock.|$|E
