5|$|After {{a battle}} with Erinys, Kratos arrives in Sparta and {{witnesses}} a group of Spartans tearing down a statue of Ares, intent on replacing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of Kratos. Kratos then chases a dissenter loyal to Ares into the Spartan Jails, who attempts to kill Kratos by releasing the Piraeus Lion. Defeating both foes, Kratos journeys to the Temple of Ares, where he encounters the spirit of his child self and learns that he must return to the now sunken Atlantis and locate the Domain of Death. Before leaving, a loyal Spartan provides him with his former weapons—used during Kratos' days as a Captain of the Spartan army—the Arms of Sparta. After returning to the sunken Atlantis, Kratos receives great resentment from Poseidon for sinking his beloved city.|$|E
5|$|The Anderson Street {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} with Anderson Street and Linden Avenue in Hackensack. The station has one track running through <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> lone asphalt side platform appearing on the northbound side. The station has a nearby parking lot at the same intersection, with fifty parking spaces maintained by Park America (under lease from New Jersey Transit). Two of these fifty parking spaces are handicap accessible, although the station itself is not. These parking spots are permit-only, but are free to use on evenings and weekends. The station is located in New Jersey Transit's fifth fare zone, tickets may be purchased at the station. Except for the Metro-North Railroad Express routes to Spring Valley, all trains serve the Anderson Street station, and there is nearby access to the 175 and 770 New Jersey Transit bus lines. The station is 18 minutes from Secaucus Junction, 21 minutes from Hoboken Terminal, and 39 minutes from Spring Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, {{other than the fact that}} it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one.</b> An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E

5|$|Comet was recommissioned in 1869 {{to perform}} the same duties as in the {{previous}} year; 1870 followed the same pattern as well, until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July interrupted Comets activities. On 16 July, Comet was assigned to the defense force in the Jade Bay outside Wilhelmshaven, but she saw no action during the conflict. She was decommissioned on 29 April 1871, at which point an investigation of her hull revealed the necessity of a major overhaul, which was done at the Königliche Werft in Danzig. Work ended in May 1872. In December, Comet was sent into the Baltic to search for vessels that had been wrecked in a severe storm, and if necessary, sink them to prevent them from becoming navigational hazards. She returned to Kiel without having located any wrecks on 31 December, in advance of the heavy sea ice that occurred in the Baltic every winter. Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the German admiralty, did not consider Comet to have sufficiently performed her duties, and so he relieved her captain of his command. With a new commander, Comet was sent out again on 5 January 1873, and this time did succeed in finding and sinking several wrecked vessels. After returning to Kiel on 24 January, she was decommissioned, but was temporarily recommissioned from 5 to 20 March for another patrol in the Baltic for wrecked ships. During this period, a detachment from the Torpedo Division based in Wilhelmshaven came aboard the vessel to test their new towed torpedoes. On 12 March, while cruising north of Cape Arkona, Comet encountered a wrecked vessel and was able to sink <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Following the Italian intervention, Prpić {{was able}} {{to proceed with the}} task of {{clearing}} the wider area of Nevesinje from 3 July, ensuring NDH control of population centres and roads. On 5 July, he replaced his deputy Prohaska with Colonel Franjo Šimić, and assigned him a force consisting of the 6th, 11th, 15th and 17th Battalions, a company of the 18th Battalion and a troop of artillery. The force numbered 62 officers and 2,062 men, with heavy weapons including four 100mm Skoda houfnice vz 14 mountain howitzers, six heavy machine guns and twenty-seven light machine guns. Šimić seized the crossroads near Kifino Selo and Plužine, securing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> company of the 11th Battalion, then sent the 15th Battalion to Gacko and the 17th Battalion to Berkovići. A half company of the 21st Battalion secured the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Once this was completed, the major roads in eastern Herzegovina were secured. These operations proceeded without significant fighting, as some of the rebels retreated over the border with Montenegro, and others hid their weapons in the mountains and returned to their homes. By 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control over all the towns and transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E

25|$|Because Niépce's camera {{photographs}} {{required an}} extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), {{he sought to}} greatly improve his bitumen process or replace <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required.

25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent wave front, it approximates Gaussian beam profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> convex lens, and then collimating it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E

25|$|In 113BC, the Iranian Parthians conquered Dura-Europos, {{and held}} <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> brief intermission, until 165 AD, {{when it was}} taken by the Romans. The Parthian period was a phase of {{expansion}} at Dura Europos—an expansion favored by abandonment of the town's military function. All the space enclosed by the walls gradually became occupied, and the installation of new inhabitants with Semitic and Iranian names alongside descendants of the original Macedonian colonists contributed to an increase in the population, which was a multicultural one, as inscriptions in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Hatrian, Palmyrene, Middle Persian, Parthian, and Safaitic testify. In the 1st century BC, it served as a frontier fortress of the Parthian Empire.|$|E

25|$|Russia has {{thousands}} of rivers and inland bodies of water, providing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> of the world's largest surface-water resources. However, most of Russia's {{rivers and streams}} belong to the Arctic drainage basin, which lies mainly in Siberia but also includes part of European Russia. Altogether, 84 percent of Russia's surface water is located east of the Urals in rivers flowing through sparsely populated territory and into the Arctic and Pacific oceans. In contrast, areas with the highest concentrations of population, and therefore the highest demand for water supplies, tend to have the warmest climates and highest rates of evaporation. As a result, densely populated {{areas such as the}} Don and Kuban River basins north of the Caucasus have barely adequate (or in some cases inadequate) water resources.|$|E
25|$|Hendrik Brouwer's {{discovery}} of the Brouwer Route, that sailing east from the Cape of Good Hope until land was sighted and then sailing north along {{the west coast of}} Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean, made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog landed at Cape Inscription on what is now known as Dirk Hartog Island, off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a pewter plate. In 1697 the Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh landed on the island and discovered Hartog's plate.
