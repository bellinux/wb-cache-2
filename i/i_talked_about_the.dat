During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> approach, I was referring to the whole team, I spoke {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said what I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E

In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shit I knew and saw.

40|$|Most {{members of}} the Akha ethnic {{minority}} group living in Thailand today have converted to Christianity and no longer practice Aqkaqzanr 1 or traditional Akha culture. At the same time, however, some Akha are continuing to carry their traditional culture. As a result, many divisions and tensions have arisen within Akha communities. For example, many Christian Akha refuse {{to participate in the}} rituals of traditionalists. In addition, debates have arisen among Akha as to the relationship between ethnicity and religion. For example, on one hand many traditionalists argue that to be Akha is to carry Aqkaqzanr and that individuals carrying the zanr of other groups are no longer Akha. On the other hand, many Christians argue that religion and culture are different parts of their identity and that their conversion to Christianity has not changed their culture or identity. In this paper I present a case study of a multi-religious Akha community in northern Thailand. First, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impacts of national integration upon the village. Second, I discuss the different kinds of social problems that have developed as a result of conversions to non-indigenous forms of religion. Third, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> importance or lack thereof of Aqkaqzanr for villagers carrying different religious belief systems. Last, <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ongoing efforts of a (Neo) Traditionalist group of villagers to modify and continue carrying Aqkaqzanr {{as an integral part of}} their identity...|$|R

Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:--"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark {{on the size of the}} room, or the number of couples." ...|$|E

While {{we wait for the}} courts to act, it's time for the City of San Francisco to start respecting state law. It is time for the city to stop traveling down this dangerous path of ignoring the rule of law. Lockyer responded by acknowledging his office had to defend state law [...] "and allow the courts to determine whether the city has acted illegally", but said his political belief were sympathetic to issuing the licenses: As a lifelong defender of civil rights, due process and equal protection for all, I do not personally support policies that give lesser legal rights and responsibilities to committed same-sex couples than those provided to heterosexual couples. That is why I have and continue to strongly support extending the benefits and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples through domestic partnerships and civil union statutes.|$|E

That my silence and gravity, as you write in the letter, could be taken as an expression of shock at your reports {{that it was possible to}} make an atomic bomb is a quite peculiar misunderstanding, which must be due to the great tension in your own mind. From the day three years earlier when I realized that slow neutrons could only cause fission in Uranium 235 and not 238, it was of course obvious to me that a bomb with certain effect could be produced by separating the uraniums. In June 1939 I had even given a public lecture in Birmingham about uranium fission, where <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effects of such a bomb but of course added that the technical preparations would be so large that one did not know how soon they could be overcome.
