5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E

60|$|He {{felt sick}} in every fibre. He almost <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> little handbag he carried, which held his flute and piccolo. It seemed a burden just then--a {{millstone}} round his neck. He <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> scene he had left--and he <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> hard, inviolable heart that stuck unchanging {{in his own}} breast.|$|R
60|$|Mishcha wagged slowly her old head. She <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Oomgar, but she <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Beast of Shadows more, and off she hopped again, {{stiff and}} cold, {{to seek out}} Thimble and Thumb.|$|R
25|$|In Poland, German Nazi atrocities {{ended by}} late 1944, {{but they were}} {{replaced}} by Soviet oppression with the advance of Red Army forces.

25|$|Reproof {{involves}} {{actions for}} which a person could be disfellowshipped, and {{is said to be}} an effort to 'reach the heart' and convince a person of the need to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> sanctioned actions and repent.

25|$|Milne and {{his wife}} became estranged from their son, who came to resent {{what he saw as}} his father's {{exploitation}} of his childhood and came to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> books that had thrust him into the public eye.

25|$|He {{could not}} endure {{imprisonment}} and immediately organized an escape party. Escaping from the POW camp with two comrades, they successfully made it almost to Kuala Lumpur, {{often with the}} aid of Malayan Chinese and Chinese communist guerrillas, before they were betrayed to the Japanese by Malays. It was during this escape that McLaren began to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Japanese as he passed the bodies of hundreds of Chinese men, women and children, who had been tortured, raped, and then killed by Japanese occupation forces.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. We both <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

Moss tells Aaronow {{that they need to}} strike back by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to another real estate agency. Moss's plan would require Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary, and steal all the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss intimidates him, claiming that he is already an accomplice simply by listening to Moss's pitch.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his last meal of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|The band {{signed to}} {{independent}} record label Situation Two, {{an offshoot of}} Beggars Banquet Records, and released a three-track, triple A-side single, Moya, during this period. They toured through England headlining some shows and touring with Bauhaus and Theatre of <b>Hate.</b> <b>The</b> band played their final performance in Manchester during February 1983, meaning after only sixteen months the band was over. A compilation named The Southern Death Cult was released, this being a collection of the single, radio sessions with John Peel for Radio One and live performances - one of which an audience member recorded with a tape recorder.|$|E
25|$|In late 1998 {{the band}} {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} 7ball magazine (pictured left), representing the widest media coverage the band garnered throughout their career. The cover reflects the visual signature of the band at the time. Fourth from the Last was themed around bowling, a sport which band member had mixed feelings about. At least one member (Todd Gruener) was said to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> sport, while Andrew Schar had played in a league. Closing out 1998, the band played some dates with one of their mainstream counterparts, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and alternative band Cracker.|$|E

25|$|Cooper's {{father had}} held his lands in knight-service, so Cooper's {{inheritance}} now {{came under the}} authority of the Court of Wards. The trustees whom his father had appointed to administer his estate, his brother-in-law (Anthony Ashley Cooper's uncle by marriage) Edward Tooker and his colleague from the House of Commons, Sir Daniel Norton, purchased Cooper's wardship from the king, but they remained unable to sell Cooper's land without permission of the Court of Wards because, on his death, Sir John Cooper had left some £35,000 in gambling debts. The Court of Wards ordered the sale of the best of Sir John's lands to pay his debts, with several sales commissioners picking up choice properties at £20,000 less than their market value, a circumstance which led Cooper to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Court of Wards as a corrupt institution.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{itself was}} planned {{as early as}} the 1920s. The {{above-ground}} Artery was built in two sections. First was the part north of High Street and Broad Street to the Tobin Bridge, built between 1951 and 1954. Immediately, residents began to <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> new highway and the way it towered over and separated neighborhoods. Due to this opposition, {{the southern end of the}} Central Artery through the South Station area was built underground, through what became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. Eventually, the entire highway was moved underground as part of the Big Dig Project. The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the original Artery not torn down; it now serves southbound traffic. The idea of building the entire Artery underground was first floated in the 1970s emanating from the central artery depression concept developed by the Boston Transportation Planning Review. The final section through the Dewey Square Tunnel and on to the Southeast Expressway at Massachusetts Avenue opened in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E

Nedić frequently complained about their presence to the Germans and demanded that the Bulgarians withdrew from Serbia.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the term}} was not coined until the early 1980s, some couples prior to that point have been {{retrospectively}} termed supercouples; for example, Jeff Baker and Penny Hughes and Bob and Lisa Hughes, from As the World Turns. Doug Williams and Julie Olson from Days of Our Lives are sometimes considered the first supercouple. From 1970 until 1976, Doug and Julie's relationship wavers between love and <b>hate.</b> <b>The</b> chemistry the portrayers exhibited became evident offscreen; the real-life couple, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth, were married in 1974. This set off a commotion among thousands of fans, who wrote letters to the show asking that the couple also be allowed to marry in the story. Since the actors were already married, they felt this was a valid request. NBC worked the tension and lengthened the anticipation of the wedding but eventually caved into the audience's pressure. Doug and Julie are married in October 1976 within the series. They are the first soap opera characters {{to appear on the}} cover of Time.|$|E
