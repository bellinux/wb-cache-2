The data is then accessible to both the CERES team for validation and to schools for educational application via the Internet. By March of 1998 ninety-three schools, in nine countries had enrolled in the S'COOL project. Joining the United States participants were from schools in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The project is gradually becoming the global project envisioned by the project s creators. As students obtain the requested data useful for the scientists, it was hoped that students with guidance from their instructors would have opportunity and motivation to learn more about clouds and atmospheric science as well...|$|E
30|$|The 2006 Kuril event {{ruptured}} the up-dip {{margin of}} the megathrust further seaward than typical great earthquakes along the Kuril island arc, in a distinctive region where the trench narrows, the volcanic arc is disrupted, and a fore-arc basin is present (Lay et al., 2009). The thrust event ruptured about 200 km along strike of the arc and immediately activated normal faulting activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trench slope which decayed slowly over time until the great 2007 Kuril intraplate event occurred, radiating with strong short-period seismic wave energy. While {{the moment of the}} 2007 event was about 50 % that of the 2006 event and the far-field tsunami was correspondingly smaller, the 2007 event produced stronger shaking in Japan due to having higher moment-scaled energy release (Ammon et al., 2008). While the 37 -year time separation between <b>the</b> Sanriku events <b>in</b> 1896 and 1933 is substantial, the Kuril doublet was separated by only about 60 days. A much smaller pair of thrust (Mw 7.2, 16 August 2005) and outer rise normal (Mw 7.0, 14 November 2005) events ruptured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of interest here, separated by 90 days (Hino et al., 2009). The processes that control the relative timing of these events are not known specifically, but candidates include viscous relaxation of {{the lower part of the}} slab, poroelastic response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trench slope region to <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> stresses from <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> event, and visco-elastic deformation of the subducting plate (Lay et al., 2009).|$|R
2500|$|Allied forces {{identified}} a Japanese airfield under construction at Guadalcanal, and 19,000 US Marines were embarked {{to capture the}} airfield. An amphibious landing was made on 7 August. The battle lasted until 9 February 1943 and was strongly contested, on land, at sea and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Hyakutake's <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> on 14 September to re-take the island's Henderson Field was defeated. [...] In an unequal battle, Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi's forces lost about 850 killed, while the American Marines lost 104. When the news reached Imperial General Headquarters in Japan, they decided in an emergency session {{that they could not}} support fronts in both New Guinea and at Guadalcanal. Hyakutake decided that he only had sufficient troops and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal. He prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal in another attempt to recapture the airfield. With the concurrence of the Japanese command staff, he ordered Horii to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. The Japanese troops were, after several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses, at Ioribaiwa, within [...] of Port Moresby. There were also concerns that Allied forces might land at Buna at any time.|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the construction of models and <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> conditions for <b>the</b> various modes of legs operation. The article presents the way of setting <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> conditions for <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> with constant pressure and for leg operation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mode of increased pressure caused by the lowering of the roof. The results of modal analyses conducted for 2 modes of leg operation are shown. It is shown that the form and frequency of natural oscillations of hydraulic legs are determined by their design, pressures of <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> and nominal operating resistance, {{as well as by}} the operating modes which differ in schemes of interaction of leg elements with interacting elements of the support and the roof and floor strata. At the same time, changing the operating mode of the legs changes the natural frequency both to the higher and to the lower side, as well as the form of oscillations of certain frequencies. For more accurate calculation of the frequency response of hydraulic legs to the external load of frequencies, it is proposed to take into account not only their design and power properties, but also the modes of their loading...|$|R
25|$|A spaceflight {{typically}} {{begins with}} a rocket launch, which provides <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> to overcome <b>the</b> force of gravity and propels the spacecraft {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> Earth. Once <b>in</b> space, <b>the</b> motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact.|$|R
50|$|Eka Movement or Unity Movement is {{a peasant}} {{movement}} which surfaced in Hardoi, Bahraich and Sitapur during {{the end of}} 1921 by Madri Passi. <b>The</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> was given by the leaders of Congress and Khilafat.

[...] "The development of the philosophy of spirit in post-Kantian idealism, originating in Germany, may be interpreted historically as a revolt against the suppression of <b>the</b> spirit <b>in</b> Protestant theology; for it was in its initial intention an affirmation, or reaffirmation, of the human spirit." ...|$|R
40|$|Sundarban, {{the largest}} {{mangrove}} forest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, {{is known to}} act as a buffer against the cyc-lone and storm surge. Theoretically, Sundarban absorbs <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> of <b>the</b> wind and acts to “resist ” the storm surge flooding. The role of Sundarban was evident during the cyclone Sidr when the Sundarban solely defended <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> of <b>the</b> cyclonic wind and the resulting storm surge inundation. In doing this, Sundarban sacrificed 30 % of its plant habitats. Although no scientific study has yet been conducted, it is generally believed that Sundarban will continuously play its role as a buffer against the cyclone when landfall of the cyclone is at or close to the Sundarban. Considering these facts, the present study mainly focused on a scientific insight into the role of Sundarban as a buffer against the present-day cyclone and storm surge and also its probable role on the impacts of future storms of similar nature but with different landfall locations. The Delft 3 D dashboard and flow model are applied to compute the resulting inundation due to cyclone in-duced storm surge. The results show that Sundarban indeed acts as a buffer against the storm surge inundation when cyclone landfall is at or close to Sundarban...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that time-periodic modulation of <b>the</b> nonlinearity coefficient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation strongly facilitates creation of traveling solitons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lattice. We predict this possibility in a semiqualitative form analytically, and test it in direct numerical simulations. Systematic computations reveal several generic dynamical regimes, {{depending on the}} amplitude and frequency of the time modulation, and on <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust</b> which sets <b>the</b> soliton <b>in</b> motion. These regimes include irregular motion of the soliton, regular motion of a decaying one, and regular motion of a stable soliton. The motion may occur <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> straight and reverse directions, relative to <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> <b>thrust.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of stable motion, extremely long simulations in a lattice with periodic boundary conditions {{demonstrate that}} the soliton keeps moving indefinitely long without any visible loss. Velocities of moving stable solitons are in good agreement with the analytical prediction, {{which is based on}} requiring a resonance between the ac drive and motion of the soliton through the periodic lattice. The generic dynamical regimes are mapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model’s parameter space. Collisions between moving stable solitons are briefly investigated too, with a conclusion that two different outcomes are possible: elastic bounce, or bounce with mass transfer from one soliton to the other. The model can be realized experimentally in a Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a deep optical lattice...|$|R
