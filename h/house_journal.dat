25|$|The {{design of}} the modern bassoon owes {{a great deal to}} the performer, teacher, and {{composer}} Carl Almenräder. Assisted by the German acoustic researcher Gottfried Weber, he developed the 17-key bassoon with a range spanning four octaves. Almenräder's improvements to the bassoon began with an 1823 treatise describing ways of improving intonation, response, and technical ease of playing by augmenting and rearranging the keywork. Subsequent articles further developed his ideas. His employment at Schott gave him the freedom to construct and test instruments according to these new designs, and he published the results in Caecilia, Schott's <b>house</b> <b>journal.</b> Almenräder continued publishing and building instruments until his death in 1846, and Ludwig van Beethoven himself requested one of the newly made instruments after hearing of the papers. In 1831, Almenräder left Schott to start his own factory with a partner, Johann Adam Heckel.|$|E

Israeli historian Avi Shlaim later praised Finkelstein's thesis, {{saying that it}} had established his credentials {{when he was still}} a doctoral student. In Shlaim's view, Finkelstein had produced an [...] "unanswerable case" [...] with [...] "irrefutable evidence", proving that Peters' book was both [...] "preposterous and worthless".|$|E

2500|$|The <b>House</b> <b>Journal,</b> {{recently}} {{discovered in the}} collections of the State Historical Society of Missouri, casts doubt on such assertions of quorum. Complete {{from the beginning of}} the session to end, the handwritten document never reports a roll call vote, so there is no authentication of the quorum. Newspaper accounts of the claims of the lone House member who the Journal reports as having voted no on both the articles of secession and affiliation with the Confederacy, Isaac N. Shambaugh of DeKalb County, further cloud the earlier claims of legitimacy. The [...] Missouri Statesman of January 31, 1862, offered coverage of Shambaugh's speech to constituents in which he claimed that the legislative quorum was fraudulent, with at best only 39 House members and 10 members of the Senate present at either Neosho or Cassville, and that the names of affirmative voting members were deliberately excluded from both House and Senate journals. He corroborated the <b>House</b> <b>Journal</b> by claiming to have been the lone no votes on the two bills.|$|E

60|$|It is {{certainly}} not the function of a romance to relate, with the exactness of a <b>House</b> <b>journal,</b> the proceedings of a Legislature. Somebody has likened the state-house to pioneer Kentucky, a dark and bloody ground over which the battles of selfish interests ebbed and flowed,--no place for an innocent and unselfish bystander like Mr. Crewe, who desired only to make of his State an Utopia; whose measures were for the public good--not his own. But if any politician were fatuous enough to believe that Humphrey Crewe was a man to introduce bills and calmly await their fate; a man who, like Senator Sanderson, only came down to the capital when he was notified by telegram, that politician was entirely mistaken.|$|E
