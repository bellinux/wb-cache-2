5|$|Most Indonesians lived <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty, {{particularly}} {{a significant proportion}} of the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery. Chinese merchants, in particular, were often forced to keep their goods at artificially low prices under threat of death.|$|E

5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E

40|$|While {{a number}} of {{emotions}} {{are considered to be}} innate or present from a very early age, the way they are understood and displayed is determined by social and cultural as well as biological factors. Adults or "expert others" from the environment in which children live can facilitate young children's development of emotion understanding and display. Yet adults do not always recognise emotion and emotion display in children. This paper discusses a cross-cultural study of the emotion of <b>fear.</b> <b>In</b> Canada <b>and</b> in Australia caregivers were asked to name fears that preschool-aged children (3 - 5 year olds) experience, and to describe how these children show fear. While some differences were found <b>in</b> <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> displays, a much greater difference was found in their incidence. For example, 55...|$|R

40|$|The basolateral amygdala's {{involvement}} <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> acquisition <b>and</b> {{expression to}} visual and auditory stimuli is well known. The {{involvement of the}} basolateral and other amygdala areas <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> acquisition <b>and</b> expression to stimuli of other modalities is less certain. We evaluated {{the contribution of the}} basolateral and medial amygdala to olfactory <b>and</b> to context <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> conditioning by infusing into these areas the NMDA receptor antagonist AP 5, the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX, or vehicle prior to either odor-shock pairings or fear-potentiated startle testing. Pre-training AP 5 infusions into the basolateral amygdala disrupted fear conditioning to the odor but not the context conditioned stimulus (CS). Pre-test NBQX infusions disrupted fear-potentiated startle to the odor but not context CS. Neither compound blocked fear conditioning when infused into the medial amygdala prior to training, but pre-test NBQX infusions did block fear-potentiated startle. The results confirm and extend recent findings suggesting a role for the basolateral amygdala <b>in</b> olfactory <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> conditioning, reveal an unexpected dissociation of the basolateral amygdala's involvement in discrete cue versus context <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> conditioning, <b>and</b> implicate {{for the first time the}} medial amygdala in fear-potentiated startle...|$|R

25|$|Eastern Baghdad, meanwhile, {{remained}} {{in a state}} of turmoil. The Dailamite army occupied the eastern quarters of the city and began retaliating against the population for their support of the Hamdanids during the fighting. Ignoring an order by Mu'izz al-Dawla to refrain from pillaging, they began looting, set fire to houses and killed a number of civilians. Many of the residents fled <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> attempted to head north to Ukbara, but died along the way in the summer heat. The chaos ceased only when Saymari executed several pillagers and sent out patrols to reestablish order.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} such an {{approach}} is to invest the sculptures with greater psychological energy. The viewer finds it easier to gauge the state of mind of the characters and therefore understands the larger story at work: Daphne's wide open mouth <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> astonishment, David biting his lip in determined concentration, or Proserpina desperately struggling to free herself. In addition to portraying psychological realism, they show a greater concern for representing physical details. The tousled hair of Pluto, the pliant flesh of Proserpina, or the forest of leaves beginning to envelop Daphne all demonstrate Bernini's exactitude and delight for representing complex real world textures in marble form.|$|E
25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, <b>in</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E

25|$|Oxytocin is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, oxytocin {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, oxytocin has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that oxytocin modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of oxytocin <b>in</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. One theory states that oxytocin increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that oxytocin increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do <b>in</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
