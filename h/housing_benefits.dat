Since the demographic variables are alternative-invariant, what remains is a function of transfer entitlement only. These functions are comparable across programmes, and our estimates imply that Family Credit entitlement has less of a labour supply effect than child nutrition entitlement has, and <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> {{does not appear to have}} a different effect on labour supply than variation in other income. There is no reform to <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit,</b> and identification relies on variation in real housing costs over time and across regions because the <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> formula was typically just up-rated with inflation.

The Senate version of the bill had no mention of the Cherokee Nation or the Cherokee Freedmen descendants.

As his workforce expands, Butters starts offering health care and other benefits to his employees, attracting more and more adults. To this end, he visits the local ACORN office to apply for low-income <b>housing</b> <b>benefits,</b> seek mortgage loans, and inquire about the tax-status of his business.

40|$|What is {{the problem}} under consideration? Why is {{government}} intervention necessary? <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> claimants living in the social rented sector generally have no restrictions placed {{on the size of}} accommodation that they occupy, and the amount of <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> to which they are entitled. Eligible rent levels for claimants in the social rented sector are not currently determined by reference {{to the size of the}} claimant’s household, in contrast to the rules that apply in the private rented sector. In the private rented sector claimants only receive <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> for accommodation based upon the needs of their household. In order to contain growing <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> expenditure; encourage mobility within the social rented sector; strengthen work-incentives and make better use of available social housing, the Government intends to introduce size criteria for working age <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> claimants living in the social rented sector. What are the policy objectives and the intended effects? The policy is intended to contain <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> expenditure in the social rented sector. Where claimants are currently living in accommodation which is considered too large for their needs, the <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> restriction will provide an incentive to move to more suitably sized accommodation. This will free-up accommodation for households living in overcrowded accommodation, or enable accommodation to be offered to other people on the waiting list for social <b>housing.</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> claimants living i...|$|R

This analysis highlights the trade-offs involved in various strategies available for restructuring the present system. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{major change}} to the {{valuation}} process for <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> was the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) a flat rate allowance paid to <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> claimants, which was introduced on 7 April 2008 {{as part of the}} welfare reform programme. It applies to private sector tenants who make a new claim for <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> or those claiming <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> who change address. It will also apply to tenants claiming <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> who move from the social sector into private sector accommodation. LHA is a standard allowance {{based on the number of}} bedrooms: shared room (room in a shared property); one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms and five bedrooms, in an area known as a Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). It is the median rent of private sector lettings for that size of accommodation in the BRMA.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{homeless}} people began appearing {{in large numbers}} in the city, the result of multiple factors including the closing of state institutions for the mentally ill, the Reagan administration drastically cutting Section 8 <b>housing</b> <b>benefits,</b> and social changes which increased the availability of addictive drugs. Combined with San Francisco's attractive environment and generous welfare policies the problem soon became endemic. Mayor Art Agnos (1988–92) {{was the first to}} attack the problem, and not the last; it is a top issue for San Franciscans even today. His program, Beyond Shelter, became the basis for federal programs and was recognized by Harvard for Innovations in Local Government. Agnos allowed the homeless to camp in the Civic Center park after the Loma Prieta earthquake that made over 1,000 SRO's uninhabitable, which led to its title of [...] "Camp Agnos." [...] His opponent used this to attack Agnos in 1991, an election Agnos lost. Frank Jordan launched the [...] "MATRIX" [...] program the next year, which aimed to displace the homeless through aggressive police action. And it did displace them-to the rest of the city. His successor, Willie Lewis Brown, Jr., was able to largely ignore the problem, riding on the strong economy into a second term. Later, mayor Gavin Newsom created the controversial [...] "Care Not Cash" [...] program and policy on the homeless, which calls for ending the city's generous welfare policies towards the homeless and instead placing them in affordable housing and requiring them to attend city funded drug rehabilitation and job training programs.|$|E
