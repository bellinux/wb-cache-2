5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} experimental work.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear <b>Experimental</b> <b>Reactor</b> program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem with}} using heavy water {{was that it}} was scarce, and {{scientists}} could not readily acquire the quantities required by a reactor. At Columbia University in the United States, Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd attempted to use graphite as a moderator instead. This turned out to be possible, but the graphite had to be very pure, as impurities, particularly boron, tended to absorb neutrons. On 2 December 1942, Fermi's team initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> known as Chicago Pile-1. For the Manhattan Project, this was a crucial step towards the manufacture of plutonium in a reactor for use in an atomic bomb, but much larger reactors were required for mass production.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, JET {{produced}} {{a peak of}} 16.1MW of fusion power (65% of heat to plasma), with fusion power of over 10MW sustained for over 0.5sec. Its successor, the International Thermonuclear <b>Experimental</b> <b>Reactor</b> (ITER), was officially announced {{as part of a}} seven-party consortium (six countries and the EU). ITER is designed to produce ten times more fusion power than the power put into the plasma. ITER is currently under construction in Cadarache, France.|$|E
50|$|In {{the history}} of atomic power development, at least 60 {{criticality}} accidents have occurred, including 22 in process environments, outside of nuclear <b>reactor</b> cores or <b>experimental</b> assemblies, and 38 in small <b>experimental</b> <b>reactors</b> and other test assemblies.|$|R

25|$|During the Manhattan Project the United States {{constructed}} three {{heavy water}} production plants {{as part of}} the P-9 Project at Morgantown Ordnance Works, near Morgantown, West Virginia; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and Newport, Indiana; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and Sylacauga, Alabama. Heavy water was also acquired from the Cominco plant in Trail, British Columbia, Canada. The Chicago Pile-3 <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> used heavy water as a moderator and went critical in 1944. The three domestic production plants were shut down in 1945 after producing around 20 metric tons of product (around 20,000 litres). The Wabash plant was reopened and began resumption of heavy water production in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} ITER (International Thermonuclear <b>Experimental</b> <b>Reactor)</b> {{power station}} {{will be built}} at Cadarache in the South of France and {{is the result of}} an international collaboration involving the European Union (represented by EURATOM), Japan, the People's Republic of China, India, the Republic of Korea, Russia and the United States. Dublin City University is the lead partner in this Irish research through Irish Fusion Association under the National Centre for Plasma Science and Technology with 10 more University College Cork scientists taking part in the project as well under the auspices of Association Euratom DCU, which was established in 1996.

25|$|The first Swedish nuclear reactor, R1, {{was started}} in 1951 and it {{was placed in a}} dug out cavern below the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It was a small <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> with a thermal power of 1 MW. The purpose of R1 was not to produce power or {{plutonium}} but to gain insight into reactor physics. Also, the uranium extraction site in Kvarntorp reached its intended production capacity. In 1953, the Swedish scientists realized that the critical mass for the plutonium fueled nuclear weapons had been overestimated and the figure was reduced down to 5–10kg in a report by Sigvard Eklund, which meant that the production requirement for plutonium was significantly less than it was earlier anticipated. In 1955, FOA concluded that Sweden would be able to produce nuclear weapons once it had a plutonium reactor.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, the Allies {{discovered}} that Germany was not putting as much serious effort {{into the program}} as had been previously thought. They {{had been unable to}} sustain a chain reaction. The Germans had completed only a small, partly built <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> (which had been hidden away). By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor, partially due to the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, even had the Germans succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with a graphite reactor in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from development of an atomic bomb with maximal effort. The engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required {{about two and a half}} years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R, for example.|$|E

These superconducting magnets are used in magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance instruments as well as in particle accelerators. For example, the Large Hadron Collider uses 600 tons of superconducting strands, while the International Thermonuclear <b>Experimental</b> <b>Reactor</b> uses an estimated 600 tonnes of Nb3Sn strands and 250 tonnes of NbTi strands. In 1992 alone, more than US$1billion worth of clinical magnetic resonance imaging systems were constructed with niobium-titanium wire.|$|E

500|$|During the war, Chadwick had {{arranged}} for ICI to build a small plant to produce uranium metal. By 1947, it was operational and producing [...] per week. This would be used in BEPO, the <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> built at Harwell, but the plant required uranium oxide feed, and the export of this from the United States was banned under the McMahon Act. Hinton and his staff at Risley built a new uranium metal plant at Springfields, {{on the site of}} a former poison gas plant, at a cost of ₤5.5 million. The first uranium metal was produced in October 1948.|$|E
500|$|By October 1942, the Metallurgical Laboratory had to {{consider}} how it would proceed with designing large production reactors when they had yet to get an <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> to work. Fermi favored taking small steps, while Allison and Eugene Wigner argued that larger steps were necessary if atomic bombs were to be developed in time to affect {{the course of the}} war. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., told them that time was more important than money, and if two approaches looked promising, they should build both. In the end, this was what was done. Allison was one of 49 scientists who watched the project take a leap forward when Chicago Pile-1 went critical at Stagg Field on December 2, 1942. As Compton's reactor project began to spread outside Chicago in 1943, Allison became director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in June 1943.|$|E
500|$|The {{other major}} {{problem was the}} purity of the uranium. Impurities could act as neutron poisons and prevent a nuclear reactor from working, but the uranium oxide that Fermi wanted for his <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> {{contained}} unacceptably large amounts of impurities. As a result, references published before 1942 typically listed its melting point at around [...] when pure uranium metal actually melts at [...] The most effective way to purify uranium oxide in the laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E

500|$|Delays in {{establishing}} the plant in Red Gate Woods led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. The reactor required {{an enormous amount of}} graphite blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure uranium. Frank Spedding of Iowa State University were able to produce only two short tons of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by Goodyear Tire to encase the reactor. On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor</b> known as Chicago Pile-1. The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as [...] "going critical". Compton reported the success to Conant in Washington, D.C., by a coded phone call, saying, [...] "The Italian navigator [...] has just landed in the new world." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{nuclear reactor}} in the UK, a small 100kW {{research}} reactor known as GLEEP, went critical at Harwell on 15 August 1947. It was fuelled by [...] of uranium metal and [...] of uranium dioxide, and used [...] of nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator. This was fine for some experimental work, but {{the production of}} radioactive isotopes required a more powerful 6,000kW reactor with a higher neutron flux. British staff at the Montreal Laboratory had designed [...] BEPO in 1945 and 1946; Risley handled the engineering and construction. The key choices in reactor design are {{the selection of the}} fuel, the neutron moderator, and the coolant. Since enriched uranium was unavailable, the only available fuel was natural uranium. Similarly, while the Montreal Laboratory had experience with designing and building the ZEEP heavy-water reactor in Canada, no heavy water was available in the UK, so graphite was the only choice for a neutron moderator. That left cooling, and for an <b>experimental</b> <b>reactor,</b> air cooling was the obvious choice. The resulting reactor was thus quite similar to the American X-10 Graphite Reactor. BEPO, which went critical on 5 July 1948, used [...] of metallic uranium and [...] of graphite, encased in [...] of steel and [...] of concrete.|$|E
