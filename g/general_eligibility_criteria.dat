40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{rule-based}} formalization of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> for clinical trials. The rule-based formalization is implemented {{by using the}} logic programming language Prolog. Compared with existing formalizations such as pattern-based and scriptbased languages, the rule-based formalization has the advantages of being declarative, expressive, reusable and easy to maintain. Our rule-based formalisation {{is based on a}} <b>general</b> framework for <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> containting three types of knowledge: (1) trial-specific knowledge, (2) domain-specific knowledge and (3) common knowledge. This framework enables the reuse of several parts of the formalisation of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria.</b> We have implemented the proposed rule-based formalization in SemanticCT, a semantically-enabled system for clinical trials, showing the feasibility of using our rule-based formalization of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> for supporting patient recruitment in clinical trial systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Depressive {{symptoms}} and decreased physical functioning are interrelated conditions and common in older persons, causing significant individual and societal burden. Evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation {{may be beneficial}} for both mental and physical functioning. However, previous randomized controlled trials have yielded inconsistent results and often had suboptimal designs. This study examines the effect of vitamin D supplementation on both depressive {{symptoms and}} physical functioning in a high-risk population of older persons with low vitamin D status. The D-Vitaal study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating {{the effects of a}} daily dose of 1200 IU vitamin D 3 versus placebo for one year on depressive symptoms and physical functioning (primary outcomes) in older adults. Participants (N[*]=[*] 155, age 60 - 80 years) were recruited from the <b>general</b> population. <b>Eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> included the presence of depressive symptoms, ≥ 1 functional limitation and serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels between 15 and 50 / 70 nmol/L (depending on season). Secondary outcomes include incidence of major depressive disorder, anxiety symptoms, health-related quality of life, cognitive function and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. With this study, we aim to elucidate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms and physical functioning in older persons who are at high risk of developing more substantial mental and physical problems. If effective, vitamin D supplementation can be a preventive intervention strategy that is easy to implement in the primary care setting. Netherlands Trial Register NTR 3845.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the links between}} {{the likelihood of a}} modified audit report and the professional qualifications of the auditor for a sample of small and medium-sized firms. Like Denmark, Germany and Sweden, Finland has a two-tier system for qualifications. The data show that modified audit reports are more common in unprofitable, leveraged and failing firms, but there are no significant differences in the propensity to modify the report between auditors with the higher and lower professional qualification. However, it is found that non-professional auditors, i. e. auditors assumed to meet only <b>general</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> specified by law, are less likely to modify the report. Finnish auditing laws stipulate that all companies must be audited. However, the company must be audited by a professional auditor only if the business exceeds a certain size. Therefore the paper continues with a study of factors related to the decision to engage a professional auditor, although the law does not require firms to do so. Results show that failing firms are significantly less likely to be audited by professional auditors than non-failing firms. ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In view of {{the fact}} that {{motivation}} is linked directly to the learning process and educational achievement, this study endeavored to identify strategies to improve students’ educational achievement motivation at Guilan University of Medical Sciences. Methods: To conduct this descriptive-analytical study, 368 students from Guilan University of Medical Sciences were selected using simple random sampling from 2013 - 2014. All of the Guilan University of Medical Sciences’ students met the <b>general</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> except guest students. The questionnaire included five domains of economic, socio-cultural, educational, geo-regional, and personality factors in educational achievement motivation. Through using descriptive and inferential statistics (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests), the compiled data were analyzed at the significance level of 0. 05. Results: Data analysis revealed that socio-cultural factors have the maximum score (64. 14 ± 9. 92) and geo-regional factors have the minimum score (19. 01 ± 3. 63) on the participants’ educational achievement motivation. What is more, a significant difference was revealed between educational field and educational effective factors as well as educational level and educational effective factors (p< 0. 011, p< 0. 004, respectively). Conclusion: Given that the socio-cultural factors had the maximum score on the students’ educational achievement motivation, it is recommended that university officials take these factors into account, and attempt to plan to provide appropriate strategies to enhance their students’ motivation, specifically their educational achievement motivation...|$|E
40|$|The neurofibromatoses ({{neurofibromatosis}} type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis) {{are rare}} disorders having clinical manifestations that vary greatly from patient to patient. The rarity and variability of these disorders {{has made it}} challenging for investigators to identify sufficient numbers of patients with particular clinical characteristics or specific germline mutations for participation in interventional studies. Similarly, because {{the natural history of}} all types of neurofibromatosis (NF) is variable and unique for each individual, it is difficult to identify meaningful clinical outcome measures for potential therapeutic interventions. In 2012, the Children's Tumor Foundation created a web-based patient-entered database, the NF Registry, to inform patients of research opportunities for which they fit <b>general</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> and enable patients to contact investigators who are seeking to enroll patients in approved trials. Registrants were recruited through CTF-affiliated NF clinics and conferences, through its website, and by word-of-mouth and social media. Following online consent, demographic information and details regarding manifestations of NF were solicited on the Registry website. Statistical analyses were performed on data from a cohort of 4680 registrants (the number of registrants as of October 9, 2015) who met diagnostic criteria for one of the 3 NF conditions. The analyses support our hypothesis that patient-reported symptom incidences in the NF Registry are congruent with published clinician-sourced data.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} and critically assess previous economic evaluations of smoking cessation interventions delivered during pregnancy. Design: Qualitative review of studies with primary data collection or hypothetical modelling. Quality assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies checklist. Data sources: Electronic search of 13 databases including Medline, Econlit, Embase, and PubMed, and manual {{search of the}} UK's National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines and US Surgeon <b>General.</b> <b>Eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> for selecting studies: All study designs considered if they were published in English, evaluated a cessation intervention delivered to pregnant women during pregnancy, and reported any relevant economic evaluation metric (eg, cost per quitter, incremental cost per quality adjusted life year). Results: 18 studies were included. 18 evaluations were conducted alongside clinical trials, four were part of observational studies, five were hypothetical decision-analytic models and one combined modelling with within-trial analysis. Analyses conducted were cost-offset (nine studies), cost-effectiveness (five studies), cost-utility (two studies), and combined cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (two studies). Six studies each were identified as high, fair and poor quality, respectively. All interventions were demonstrated to be cost-effective except motivational interviewing which was dominated by usual care (one study). Areas where the current literature was limited were the robust investigation of uncertainty, including time horizons that included outcomes beyond the end of pregnancy, including major morbidities for the mother and her infant, and incorporating better estimates of postpartum relapse. Conclusions: There are relatively few high quality economic evaluations of cessation interventions during pregnancy. The majority of the literature suggests that such interventions offer value for money; however, there are methodological issues that require addressing, including investigating uncertainty more robustly, utilising better estimates for postpartum relapse, extending beyond a within-pregnancy time horizon, and including major morbidities for the mother and her infant for within-pregnancy and beyond...|$|E

40|$|The Food Subsidy Programme (Programa Subsidio de Alimentos, PSA) is {{the main}} basic social {{protection}} programme {{of the government of}} Mozambique in terms of coverage. It was established in 1990 to help the destitute elderly (women above 55 and men above 60), people living with a disability, the chronically sick and their dependants by providing a monthly cash transfer. The programme falls under the mandate of the Ministry for Women and Social Action (MMAS), while implementation {{is the responsibility of the}} National Institute for Social Action (INAS), the Ministry?s executing agency. By the end of 2008, the PSA covered 143, 455 households with a total of 287, 454 beneficiaries. The main direct beneficiaries were the elderly (93 per cent), followed by people living with disabilities (6 per cent) and the chronically ill (1 per cent). The <b>general</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> are: age, residency for more than six months in the selected area, per capita earnings less than the minimum benefit on the PSA scale, and/or recognised by medical declaration to be chronically ill or living with a disability. Potential beneficiaries are selected by a local intermediary (known as a Permanente) chosen by the community and appointed by INAS, after which the application undergoes an approval process within the INAS delegation. Although the PSA is a national programme, it does not reach the entire eligible population and its coverage is unequally distributed across districts. This is the result of the absence of an expansion strategy based on poverty incidence and population density. Expansion of the PSA was initially restricted to urban areas in order to mitigate the effects of the post-war structural adjustment programme on the urban population (Low et al., 1999). Currently, expansion to remote rural areas is a programme priority. The programme?s administrative cost is considered high relative to the amount transferred to the beneficiaries (Ellis, 2007). Though the programme is the largest in terms of the number of beneficiaries, its coverage is low relative to the potential universe of beneficiaries. Expansion of the programme tends to diminish the administrative costs in relative terms. In 2008, the PSA underwent two important reforms. First, the subsidy scale increased. The subsidy amount for the first (direct) beneficiaries rose from 70 to 100 meticais (US$ 2. 5 to US$ 3. 6), and the additional benefit for dependants increased from 10 to 50 meticais (US$ 0. 36 to US$ 1. 80) per dependant up to four. The second reform was the greater focus on the inclusion of eligible dependants as indirect beneficiaries in the payment scheme, and the monitoring and evaluation system. Though it is a relatively old programme, it has never been evaluated before. An opportunity to conduct an evaluation has arisen in the context of the reforms. This Policy Research Brief seeks to improve knowledge of the PSA by presenting the first part of the PSA impact evaluation?that is, the summary of the baseline report.

40|$|Homicides must possess certain {{characteristics}} {{before they}} become eligible for capital punishment. Over the last several decades, virtually every state has added to its list of possible <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria.</b> We draw on this variation to identify deterrent effects of the eligibility expansions. Eligibility expansions may deter future homicides through two channels: (1) by {{paving the way for}} more death sentences and executions and (2) by providing prosecutors with greater leverage to secure enhanced sentences (capital or non-capital). The latter channel is likely to be triggered on a fairly common basis. We estimate that the adoption of a law making child murders specifically eligible for capital punishment is associated with an approximately 19 % reduction in the rate of homicides of youth victims. We estimate deterrence findings of similar magnitude when we turn to the estimation of an empirical specification that draws on variations in the full set of <b>eligibility</b> <b>criteria</b> and that parameterizes <b>general</b> <b>eligibility</b> statutes using a simulated measure of the propensity of each state to extend capital eligibility to a given murder.
