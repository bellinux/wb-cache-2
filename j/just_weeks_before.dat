After a lengthy fundraising campaign, restoration is nearing completion.|$|E

In the days following their marriage, Abraham approached Pérez after news of their elopement spread on local news and radio stations, apologized, accepted their relationship, and accepted Pérez back into the band as its guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jeanne {{steadily}} weakened while crossing eastern Hispaniola, and on September 17 it briefly weakened to {{tropical depression}} status after reaching open waters. Its original circulation dissipated {{as a new}} one reformed closer to the main area of thunderstorms.

Jeanne encountered favorable conditions as it continued westward, and it reached major hurricane status before crossing the northern Bahamas on September 25. The next day, it struck Martin County, Florida in nearly the same location as Hurricane Frances <b>just</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before.</b> Jeanne weakened over land while turning the northwest, deteriorating to tropical depression status over Georgia on September 27.

5|$|While moving northward off {{the coast}} of Florida, Irene was {{initially}} expected to make landfall along the South Carolina coastline, prompting the National Hurricane Center to issue a Hurricane Warning from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Because of this, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for portions of South Carolina. However, when the track shifted further to the east, mandatory evacuation orders were issued for coastal areas of North Carolina, with tens of thousands removed from their homes. The evacuation order included several beach towns; those living in low-lying areas and mobile homes were advised to seek shelter. In addition, many of those left homeless from Hurricane Floyd's passage <b>just</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> were evacuated to shelters.

In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. <b>Just</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered.
