5|$|There are two extant {{species of}} Gavialidae: the gharial and the <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> Gharials can be {{recognised}} {{by the long}} narrow snout, with an enlarged boss at the tip. They are rare and found only in South Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
25|$|Eogavialis is an extinct genus of gavialoid crocodylian. It superficially resembles Tomistoma schlegelii, {{the extant}} <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> and {{consequently}} {{material from the}} genus was originally referred to Tomistoma. Indeed, {{it was not until}} 1982 that the name Eogavialis was constructed after it was realised that the specimens were from a more basal form.|$|E
50|$|The Aquarium Reptile Complex is a 20000 ft2 m2 {{building}} with a 50000 gal tank for Pacific coral reef species, as well as exhibits for Galapagos tortoises, <b>false</b> <b>gharials,</b> Komodo dragons, and other reptiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>gharials</b> are mound-nesters. Females lay small {{clutches}} of 13 to 35 eggs per nest, {{and appear to}} produce the largest eggs of extant crocodilians. Sexual maturity in females appears to be attained around 2.5 to 3 m, which is large compared to other crocodilians.|$|R
50|$|This {{part of the}} zoo is {{the home}} to animals which are native to the {{tropical}} rainforests of Asia. Animals which are on display here include <b>false</b> <b>gharials,</b> great hornbills, southern pig-tailed macaques, siamang, orangutans, Malayan tapirs, leopards, sun bears, Asian elephants and Bengal tigers.|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} is sporadic in Indonesia the Philippines and Malaysia, with some areas harbouring large populations (Borneo and Sumatra, for example) {{and others with}} very small, at-risk populations (e.g., Peninsular Malaysia). Despite the {{close proximity to the}} crocodile hotbed of northern Australia, crocodiles no longer exist in Bali. This species is also reportedly extinct on Lombok, Komodo, and most of Java. In the southern Malaysian Peninsula as well as Borneo, salwater crocodiles may co-exist with the relatively narrow-snouted <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (as well as on Sumatra) and the closely related but usually smaller Siamese crocodile (as well as in Java). A small population may remain within Ujung Kulon National Park in western Java. The saltwater crocodile is also present in very limited parts of the South Pacific, with an average population in the Solomon Islands, a very small and soon-to-be-extinct population in Vanuatu (where the population officially stands at only three) and a decent but at-risk population (which may be rebounding) in Palau. They once ranged as far west as the east coast of Africa to the Seychelles Islands. These crocodiles were once believed to be a population of Nile crocodiles, but they were later proven to be C. porosus.|$|E
500|$|Rampant fish bombing have {{destroyed}} many coral reefs and affecting fisheries {{production in the}} state. Moreover, the illegal activities of the extraction of river sand and gravel in the rivers of Padas, Papar and Tuaran had become the latest concern along with the wildlife and marine hunting and poaching. Due to severe deforestation along with massive wildlife and marine poaching, the Sumatran rhino have been declared as extinct in early 2015. Some other species that was threatened with extinction is banteng, bearded pig, clouded leopard, dugong, elephant, <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> green turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, orangutan, pangolin, proboscis monkey, river shark, roughnose stingray, sambar deer, shark and sun bear. [...] Although the indigenous community are also involved in hunting, they hunt based on their spiritual believes and practice, and on a small scale, which differentiates them from poachers. Well-known indigenous practices, such as [...] "maganu totuo" [...] or [...] "montok kosukopan", [...] "tuwa di powigian", [...] "managal" [...] or [...] "tagal" [...] and [...] "meminting", have helped to maintain resources and prevent their depletion.|$|E
2500|$|Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true {{crocodiles}} are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of {{whose members are}} considered {{true crocodiles}}, is classified as a biological subfamily. A broader {{sense of the term}} crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia, which includes [...] the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (family Gavialidae), and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.|$|E
50|$|The Reptile Park {{has both}} {{indoor and outdoor}} exhibits, and {{includes}} estuarine or saltwater crocodiles, freshwater crocodiles, <b>false</b> <b>gharials,</b> and African dwarf crocodiles. It also exhibits tortoises and terrapins, including Aldabran tortoises (the second largest tortoise species in the world) and local Tutong or river terrapins. Snakes in the collection include reticulated pythons, and many venomous snakes.|$|R
50|$|Steps {{have been}} taken by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments to prevent its {{extinction}} in the wild. There are reports of some populations rebounding in Indonesia, yet with this slight recovery, mostly irrational fears of attacks have surfaced amongst the local human population. Yayasan Ulin (The Ironwood Foundation) is currently attempting to manage a wetland area in East Kalimantan, which is known to contain the <b>false</b> <b>gharials.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>gharials</b> {{are native}} to Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Indonesia (Sumatra, and Borneo), but were extirpated in Thailand. It is unclear if they remain in Java. Apart from rivers, they inhabit swamps and lakes. The species {{is almost entirely}} found today in peat swamps and lowland swamp forests. In the 1990s, {{information}} and sightings were available from 39 localities in 10 different river drainages, along with the remote river systems of Borneo.|$|R
2500|$|Tomistomines {{have been}} {{traditionally}} classified as crocodiles. However, molecular {{analyses of the}} <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> the only living tomistomine, suggest that the subfamily is actually within Gavialidae (along with the modern gharial of the subfamily Gavialinae) rather than Crocodylinae. The [...] presence of a prominent crista that runs along the postorbital in Eogavialis testifies to its position as a gavialid. Other characteristics such as a rectangular skull table, subcircular orbits with everted orbital rims, and a constricted antorbital area are also shared with Eogavialis and other modern gavialids, as seen in a well preserved skull of E. africanum housed at Yale (YPM 6263) and material from Kenya of E. andrewsi.|$|E
2500|$|All spinosaurids {{had very}} narrow jaws with {{relatively}} homogeneous pointed teeth. This arrangement is particularly found in crocodiles {{such as the}} <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> The long conical teeth, which do not possess serrated edges, are suitable particularly to grabbing and holding of prey. They differed from teeth of other theropods, which seemed geared towards tearing or cutting off seized body parts. Particularly with Irritator and Suchomimus a convergence with crocodiles is regularly discussed in the literature [...] Individual fossils belonging to the Spinosauridae were regarded {{in the past as}} crocodile fossils [...] For example, Baryonyx fossils from Portugal were originally described as Suchosaurus and only in 2007 were they recognized as those of a spinosaurid.|$|E
2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volc√°n Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, pancake tortoise, Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E
50|$|Champsosauridae is {{the best-known}} {{family of the}} Choristodera and typifies the group. Champsosaurus was first {{described}} from Late Cretaceous strata of Montana by Cope in 1876. Champsosaurs resembled modern <b>gharials</b> (gavials) or <b>false</b> <b>gharials.</b> The skull of these animals have a long, thin snout filled with small, sharp conical teeth. This is due to champsosaurs and gharials occupying similar niches: hunting small aquatic prey in rivers and swamps. This {{is a classic example}} of convergent evolution. More primitive choristoderes have shorter, broader snouts.|$|R
5000|$|Brazaitis {{has contributed}} to {{multiple}} projects on crocodilian biology and the conservation of commercially utilized reptiles. In 1967 he developed a methodology for sexing crocodilians, an essential technique for successful captive breeding of these animals. [...] In 1968, he initiated the first captive breeding attempt for endangered Chinese alligators. [...] Under the leadership of Behler, it later {{became the basis for}} the first AZA Species Survival Plan and a collaborative captive breeding program for the species at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge in Grand Chenier, Louisiana. During Brazaitis‚Äôs tenure in the Bronx Zoo, the Reptile Department bred nine species of crocodilians, producing numerous founder stocks of endangered Cuban crocodiles, Siamese crocodiles, and the first Malayan <b>false</b> <b>gharials</b> to be captive bred in a US zoo.|$|R
50|$|These {{forests are}} home to {{wildlife}} including gibbons, orangutans, and crocodiles. In particular the riverbanks of the swamps are important habitats for the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the silvery lutung (Presbytis cristata) and are the main habitat of Borneo's unique and endangered proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus) which can swim well in the rivers, and the Borneo roundleaf bat (Hipposideros doriae). There are two birds endemic to the peat forests, the Javan white-eye (Zosterops flavus) and the hook-billed bulbul (Setornis criniger) while more than 200 species of birds have been recorded in Tanjung Puting National Park in Kalimantan. Rivers of the peat swamps {{are home to}} the rare arowana fish (Scleropages formosus), otters, waterbirds, <b>false</b> <b>gharials</b> and crocodiles.Another small species of fish, are the Parosphromenus which are also extremely endagered. The parosphromenus species are small fish of extreme beauty.|$|R
2500|$|The adult {{saltwater}} crocodile's broad body {{contrasts with}} that of most other lean crocodiles, leading to early unverified assumptions the reptile was an alligator. The head is very large. The largest skull sized that could be scientifically verified was for a specimen in the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle sourced to Cambodia, the skull length for this specimen was [...] (female skull lengths of over [...] are exceptional), with a mandibular length of [...] and a maximum width across the skull (near the base) of [...] The length of the specimen this came from is not known but based on skull-to-total-length ratios for very large saltwater crocodiles its length was presumably somewhere in the [...] range. Although {{it is the largest}} overall living crocodilian and reptile, other crocodilians may have a proportionately longer skull, namely the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (Tomistoma schlegelii), skull lengths in the latter have been verified up to [...] (the largest crocodilian skull verified for a living species), although both of these thin-snouted species have less massive skulls and considerably less massive bodies than the saltwater crocodile. The teeth are also long, with the largest teeth (the fourth tooth from the front on the lower jaw) having been measured at up to [...] in length. If detached from the body, the head of a very large male crocodile can reportedly weigh over [...] alone, including the large muscles and tendons {{at the base of the}} skull that lend the crocodile its massive biting strength.|$|E
2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these groups, recent molecular studies consistently indicate that the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (and by inference other related extinct forms) traditionally viewed as belonging to the crocodylian subfamily Tomistominae actually belong to Gavialoidea. As its name suggests, the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> was {{once thought to be}} only distantly related to the gharial despite its similar appearance. The <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> and other tomistomines were traditionally classified within the superfamily Crocodyloidea as close relatives of crocodiles. This classification is based on morphological evidence, which, when incorporated into phylogenetic analyses, often place the group within Crocodyloidea.|$|E
50|$|The LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles), {{which opened}} in 2012, is a $14 million indoor-outdoor exhibit complex that focuses on herps and {{terrestrial}} arthropods. Guests first pass through the Oak Woodland Pond, where local species can move in and live among native plants. The next feature is the 6000 sq ft main building where the Damp Forest houses poison dart frogs, Chinese giant salamanders, and a recreation of a Daintree Rainforest river with archerfish, Australian lungfish, and Fly River turtles. The Mangshan pitviper, west African green mamba, South American bushmaster and other snakes live in the next segment of the building, Betty's Bite and Squeeze Room, named after GLAZA co-chair Betty White. Guests can see keepers care for animals behind the scenes in the Behind the Glass room. The Care and Conservation Room showcases Gray's monitor and other endangered reptiles. After the main building is Arroyo Lagarto, a set of outdoor exhibits for Madagascar radiated tortoise, Madagascar spider tortoise, desert lizards, and California desert tortoise. A 2000 sq ft secondary building, the Desert LAIR, houses the Gila monster, Sonoran toad, Arizona Desert hairy scorpion, California kingsnake, and other species from Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California. The LAIR ends with Crocodile Swamp, an outdoor exhibit home to <b>false</b> <b>gharials.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the daytime, these owls shelter, often singly, {{in quite}} dark places, such as densely foliaged trees. Buffy fish owls are easily disturbed, quite the {{opposite}} of the highly stoic tawny fish owl, often being wide-awake before being spotted by a human observer. The largest part of its diet appears to consist of fish, crabs and frogs followed by reptiles, toads and crayfish. Their diet is not extensively studied but appears to be basically the same as those of the brown and tawny fish owls. Rats, mice and large insects are also sometimes taken and even bats have been captured by this species. A small handful of prey has been identified to genera or species in Java: goldfish (Carassius auratus), the gold-ringed cat snake (Boiga dendrophila), puff-faced water snake (Homalopsis buccata), young <b>false</b> <b>gharials</b> (Tomistoma schlegelii), fruit bats (Cynopterus ssp.), centipedes (Scolopendra ssp.), black rats (Rattus rattus) and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus bankiva), some of this prey such as the cat snake and junglefowl being of a fairly large size. Like the brown fish owl but unlike most owls, this species has been recorded consuming carrion, including the remains of a crocodile and a Sunda stink badger (Mydaus javanensis). The buffy fish owl does not produce firm pellets as do most owls. Instead bones and frog and insect remains are ejected in pieces and fall to the ground below roost. Prey remains have only been found within the nest, never around or below the nest as is commonly recorded in other owls. The buffy fish owl hunts mainly from the bank, swooping down much {{in the manner of a}} fish eagle but never getting its feathers wet. It also walks into shallow streams and brooks, additionally snatching their main foods in such locations.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, {{very little}} {{was known about}} the diet or {{behaviour}} of the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> in the wild. Details are slowly being revealed. In the past, the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> was thought to have a diet of only fish and very small vertebrates. But more recent evidence and observation inidicate {{that it has a}} generalist diet despite its narrow snout. In addition to fish and smaller aquatic animals, mature adults prey on larger vertebrates, including proboscis monkeys, long-tailed macaques, deer, water birds, and reptiles. An eye-witness accounted of a <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> attacking a cow in East Kalimantan.|$|E

50|$|Tomistominae is a {{subfamily}} of crocodylians {{that includes}} one living species, the <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> Many more extinct species are known, extending {{the range of}} the subfamily back to the Eocene epoch. In contrast to the <b>false</b> <b>gharial,</b> which is a freshwater species that lives only in southeast Asia, extinct tomistomines had a global distribution and lived in estuaries and along coastlines.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, a 4-m female <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> {{attacked}} and ate a fisherman in central Kalimantan; {{his remains were}} found in the gharial's stomach. This was the first verified fatal human attack by a <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> However, by 2012, at least two more verified fatal attacks on humans by false gharials had occurred indicating perhaps an increase of human-false gharial conflict possibly correlated to the decline of habitat, habitat quality and natural prey numbers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> may be {{considered}} an ecological equivalent to Neotropical crocodiles such as the Orinoco and American crocodiles, which both have slender snouts but a broad diet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> {{is listed}} on CITES Appendix I. Currently {{population}} surveys indicate {{that while the}} <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> {{is not for the}} most extirpated from areas it used to inhabit, the distribution of individuals is much more spotty than the previously more connective distribution, putting the animals at risk of genetic isolation. In large part, the isolation of false gharials is due to extremely extensive habitat destruction and disturbance within the species' area of distribution, few areas outside of legally protected areas are likely to bear viable breeding populations.|$|E
50|$|There are {{crocodile}} in the Likau River, {{although no}} crocodile attacks {{have been reported}} in the park. There are two species of riverine crocodiles in the park; the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> (Tomistoma schlegelii), and an estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porousus). The estuarine/saltwater crocodile is very dangerous and has been responsible for many fatal attacks in Sarawak in recent years. The <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> is generally shy and passive, but on rare occasions fatal attacks have been confirmed in Central Kalimantan and Sumatra. Both species should be treated with respect and given distance.|$|E
50|$|Gavialoidea is one {{of three}} superfamilies of crocodylians, the other two being Alligatoroidea and Crocodyloidea. Although many extinct species are known, only the gharial Gavialis gangeticus and the <b>false</b> <b>gharial</b> Tomistoma schlegelii are alive today.|$|E
50|$|Rhamphosuchus ("Beak crocodile") is an extinct {{relative}} of the modern <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> It inhabited {{what is now the}} Indian sub-continent in the Miocene. It is only known from incomplete sets of fossils, mostly teeth and skulls.|$|E
50|$|There are two extant {{species of}} Gavialidae: the gharial and the <b>false</b> <b>gharial.</b> Gharials can be {{recognised}} {{by the long}} narrow snout, with an enlarged boss at the tip. They are rare and found only in South Asia.|$|E
