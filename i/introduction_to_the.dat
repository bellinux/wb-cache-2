5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his clients for a letter of <b>introduction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E

Two days of severe fighting secured this strategic island in the Battle of Tulagi. After his battalion relocated to Guadalcanal they conducted raids on Savo Island and at Tasimboko, on Guadalcanal.

In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, On the Reckoning of Time, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.|$|E
