50|$|Folk art: Folk art {{originally}} suggested {{crafts and}} decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe - though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill - everything from chain-saw animals to <b>hub-cap</b> buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to societys mainstream.|$|E
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests of}} a heavy-class {{helicopter}} model {{were carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of several components optimised for drag reduction by computational fluid dynamics analysis. The optimised components included different <b>hub-cap</b> configurations, a fairing for blade attachments and the sponsons. Moreover, the effects of vortex generators positioned on the back ramp were investigated. The optimisation effect was evaluated by comparison of the drag measurements carried out for both the original and the optimised helicopter configurations. The comprehensive experimental campaign involved the use of different measurement techniques. Indeed, pressure measurements and stereo particle image velocimetry surveys were performed to achieve a physical insight about the results of load measurements. The test activity confirms the achievement of an overall reduction of about 6 % of the original model drag at cruise attitude...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the experimental activity {{carried out to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the CFD-based shape optimisation of several components of a common helicopter platform of the heavy-weight class. The considered geometry is basically the same of the model tested in the frame of thÃ¨ GO AHE AD project. The comprehensive wind tunnel campaign includes both the original helicopter configuration and the optimised version to assess the optimisation effectiveness by comparison. The optimised components included different <b>hub-cap</b> configurations, a set of fairings for the blade-stubs attachments and the sponsons. Moreover, the effects on drag reduction produced by an array of vortex generators positioned on the back-ramp were investigated. Different measurement techniques were employed as loads and moments measurements, steady and unsteady pressure surveys and stereo particle image vclocimetry. The performed measurements confirm a overall drag reduction of about 6 % at cruise attitude for the optimised configuration...|$|E

5000|$|At {{launch the}} car was offered with two levels of {{equipment}} and trim: The Basic [...] "Luxe" [...] and the slightly better equipped [...] "Confort". [...] The [...] "Confort" [...] version was differentiated from the outside through the inclusion of <b>hub-caps</b> on the wheels. [...] The spare wheel and jack were mounted in a special cradle under the bonnet/hood (rather than both simply being placed loose {{on the floor of}} the luggage area at the back). [...] The interior of the [...] "Confort" [...] was slightly less basic, with plastic moulded door panels rather than flat, vinyl covered hardboard.The steering wheel was less [...] "rustic" [...] than that which the less expensive [...] "Luxe" [...] version of the Dyane shared with the Citroën 2CV. [...] The extra 615 francs in the 1967 domestic market listed price for the Dyane [...] "Confort" [...] represented a supplement of just over 10% when compared to the list price for the more basic [...] "Luxe".|$|R
