5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and <b>distributivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and <b>distributivity.</b> An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
25|$|It is {{not hard}} to verify that {{conditions}} (1)–(4) above imply the <b>distributivity</b> of S, so the result above gives a characterization of <b>distributivity</b> for (∨,0)-semilattices.|$|E
25|$|For an {{overview}} of stronger notions of <b>distributivity</b> which are appropriate for complete lattices and which are used to define more special classes of lattices such as frames and completely distributive lattices, see <b>distributivity</b> in order theory.|$|E
25|$|This proof {{uses the}} {{definition}} of even integers, the integer properties of closure under addition and multiplication, and <b>distributivity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Can {{this list}} be made shorter yet? Again {{the answer is}} yes. To begin with, some of the above laws are implied {{by some of the}} others. A {{sufficient}} subset of the above laws consists of the pairs of associativity, commutativity, and absorption laws, <b>distributivity</b> of ∧ over ∨ (or the other <b>distributivity</b> law—one suffices), and the two complement laws. In fact this is the traditional axiomatization of Boolean algebra as a complemented distributive lattice.|$|E

25|$|<b>Distributivity</b> {{partially}} {{holds for}} ordinal arithmetic: R(S+T) = RS+RT. However, the other distributive law (T+U)R = TR+UR is not generally true: (1+1)·ω = 2·ω = ω while 1·ω+1·ω = ω+ω which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left near-semiring, {{but do not}} form a ring.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{algebraic}} number field {{relies on the}} concept of a field. A field consists of a set of elements together with two operations, namely addition, and multiplication, and some <b>distributivity</b> assumptions. A prominent example of a field is the field of rational numbers, commonly denoted Q, together with its usual operations of addition and multiplication.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that can be built from constants and symbols called indeterminates or variables by means of addition, multiplication and exponentiation to a non-negative integer power. Two such expressions that may be transformed, one to the other, by applying the usual properties of commutativity, associativity and <b>distributivity</b> of addition and multiplication are considered as defining the same polynomial.|$|E
25|$|The nonexistence of free {{complete}} Boolean algebras can {{be traced}} to failure to extend the equations of Boolean logic suitably to all laws that should hold for infinitary conjunction and disjunction, in particular the neglect of <b>distributivity</b> in the definition of complete Boolean algebra. A complete Boolean algebra is called completely distributive when arbitrary conjunctions distribute over arbitrary disjunctions and vice versa. A Boolean algebra is a CABA if and only if it is complete and completely distributive, giving a third definition of CABA. A fourth definition is as any Boolean algebra isomorphic to a power set algebra.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{algebraic}} {{operations for}} real interval numbers (real closed intervals) {{can be extended}} to complex numbers. It is therefore not surprising that complex interval arithmetic is similar to, but not the same as, ordinary complex arithmetic. It can be shown that, {{as it is the}} case with real interval arithmetic, there is no <b>distributivity</b> between addition and multiplication of complex interval numbers except for certain special cases, and inverse elements do not always exist for complex interval numbers. Two other useful properties of ordinary complex arithmetic fail to hold in complex interval arithmetic: the additive and multiplicative properties, of ordinary complex conjugates, do not hold for complex interval conjugates.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} is {{an expression}} that {{is the sum of}} a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression {{is an expression}} that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity and <b>distributivity</b> of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same polynomial function.|$|E

500|$|There {{are even}} more generalizations of {{multiplication}} than addition. In general, multiplication operations always distribute over addition; this requirement is formalized {{in the definition of}} a ring. In some contexts, such as the integers, <b>distributivity</b> over addition and the existence of a multiplicative identity is enough to uniquely determine the multiplication operation. The distributive property also provides information about addition; by expanding the product [...] in both ways, one concludes that addition is forced to be commutative. For this reason, ring addition is commutative in general.|$|E

2500|$|One {{approach}} is to reject disjunction introduction but keep disjunctive syllogism and transitivity. In this approach, rules of natural deduction hold, except for disjunction introduction and excluded middle; moreover, inference A⊢B {{does not necessarily mean}} entailment A⇒B. Also, the following usual Boolean properties hold: [...] double negation as well as associativity, commutativity, <b>distributivity,</b> De Morgan, and idempotence inferences (for conjunction and disjunction). [...] Furthermore, inconsistency-robust proof by contradiction holds for entailment (A⇒(B∧¬B))⊢¬A.|$|E

[...] The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from A to B. Many algebraic operations on real numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and negation have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of commutativity, associativity, and <b>distributivity.</b> These operations and associated laws qualify Euclidean vectors {{as an example of the}} more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a vector space.|$|E

Conversely, given any ring, (R, +, · [...] ), (R, +) is an abelian group. Furthermore, for every r in R, right (or left) multiplication by r {{gives rise to a}} morphism of (R, +), by right (or left) <b>distributivity.</b> Let A = (R, +).

In other words, let EndR(A) be the set of all morphisms m of A, having the property that m(r · x) = r · m(x). It was seen that every r in R gives rise to a morphism of A: right multiplication by r. It is in fact true that this association of any element of R, to a morphism of A, as a function from R to EndR(A), is an isomorphism of rings. In this sense, therefore, any ring can be viewed as the endomorphism ring of some abelian X-group (by X-group, it is meant a group with X being its set of operators). In essence, the most general form of a ring, is the endomorphism group of some abelian X-group.|$|E
