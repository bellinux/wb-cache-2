40|$|In this MiniReview, {{the main}} {{modifications}} {{made during the}} revision of the current Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence are reviewed and justified. Several new features {{have been added to}} this guideline, as well as changes aimed at improving the clarity of the guidance provided. The first issue to be addressed was to limit the scope of the guideline to bioequivalence studies for immediate release dosage forms with systemic action. Therefore, the guideline refers to bioequivalence alone. Moreover, the new definition of <b>Generic</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>Product</b> has been incorporated. Clearer guidance covering more specific cases is now given on sections such as: fed/fasting conditions, use of metabolite data, enantiomers and strength {{to be used in the}} bioequivalence study. Steady-state design is now restricted and other designs, such as parallel group design, replicate design and two-stage design, are now incorporated in a more explicit form. New practical guidance on Highly Variable Drug Products and Narrow Therapeutic Index Drugs has been incorporated. The possibility for a biowaiver based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification System is now more explicit for Class I drugs and can be extended to Class III drugs under restricted conditions. We are aware that the initial goal of providing a very specific and clear guidance on these issues has not been entirely achieved, mainly because it is almost impossible to cover all individual cases and predict every possible situation that may arise. Demonstration of bioequivalence will still require in many instances a case by case approach...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Aims This bioequivalence study aimed to compare rate {{and extent of}} absorption of a <b>generic</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> of ibandronic acid 150 -mg film-coated tablet versus Bonviva. Methods This was a single-centre, open-label, random-ized, three-way, three-sequence, reference-replicated, crossover bioequivalence study, under fasting conditions. A single oral dose of ibandronic acid as one 150 -mg film-coated tablet was administered in each study period. Each washout period lasted 14 days. Blood samples were col-lected according to a predefined sampling schedule and up to 48. 0 hours after administraton in each period. Plasma concentrations of ibandronic acid were measured using a liquid chromatograph–mass spectrometry/mass spectrom-etry method. Bioequivalence between generic and refer-ence medicinal products is acceptable if the 90 % confidence intervals (CI) of ratio of least-squares means between the test and the reference product of ln-trans-formed area under the serum concentration–time curve from time zero to time of last measurable concentration (AUC 0 –t) is within the 80. 00 – 125. 00 % interval. Prospec-tively, a scaled average bioequivalence approach for maximum serum concentration (Cmax) was established. Results 153 healthy volunteers were enrolled and ran-domized. After the test formulation (T) and first and second Bonviva (R) dosing, the Cmax was 96. 71 ± 90. 19 ng/mL, 92. 67 ± 91. 48 ng/mL and 87. 94 ± 60. 20 ng/mL and the AUC 0 –t was 390. 83 ± 287. 27 ngh/mL, 388. 54 ± 356. 76 ngh/mL and 383. 53 ± 246. 72, respectively.

Methods: A retrospective, new-user cohort study was designed. Electronic medical records (EMR) of patients included in the health plan of Badalona Serveis Assistencials SA, Barcelona, Spain were exhaustively extracted for analysis. Participants were beneficiaries aged 18 + years, followed between 2008 and 2012, with a pNP/GAD International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) code, who initiated treatment with generic or brand-name gabapentin or venlafaxine. Assessments included 1 -year treatment persistence and adherence (medication possession ratio), health care costs, and reduction in severity of pain and anxiety symptoms. Results: A total of 2, 210 EMR were analyzed; 1, 369 on gabapentin (brand 400; generic 969) and 841 on venlafaxine (brand 370 and generic 471). Brand-name gabapentin and venlafaxine were both significantly associated with longer persistence than generic: 7. 3 versus 6. 3 months, P< 0. 001; and 8. 8 versus 8. 1 months, P< 0. 05, respectively. Brand-name was associated with higher adherence: 86. 5 % versus 81. 3 %, P< 0. 001; and 82. 1 % versus 79. 0 %, P< 0. 05, respectively. Adjusted average costs were higher with generic compared with brand: € 1, 277 versus € 1, 057 (difference of € 220 per patient; P< 0. 001) for gabapentin; and € 1, 110 versus € 928 (difference of € 182 per patient; P= 0. 020) for venlafaxine, both because of more use of medical visits and concomitant medication. Compared with generic, brand-name was associated with higher reduction in pain (7. 8 %; P< 0. 001) and anxiety (13. 2 %; P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Patients initiating brand-name gabapentin or venlafaxine {{were more likely to}} adhere and persist on treatment of pNP or GAD, have lower health care costs, and show further reduction of pain and anxiety symptoms than with generic drugs in routine medical practice.

40|$|Patients {{may benefit}} from new uses for old drugs. Competent {{authorities}} such as the European Medicines Agency evaluate the quality, efficacy and safety of a <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> for the use in a well-defined therapeutic indication. Innovations may continue upon the approval, for example through the licensing of new therapeutic indications or dosage forms, which {{is also known as}} post-innovation innovation. The development of new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, could allow for a quicker and cheaper drug development by the utilisation of existing knowledge. The aim of the present thesis was to provide insight in the performance of the drug regulatory system for medicines in the post-innovation phase of their life cycle. Special interest {{has been paid to the}} period after the approval of the first generic product version of a drug: the post-generic phase. That occasion may significantly affect the intellectual property prospects of a drug and may limit the opportunities to make a return on investments for further innovations. First, we showed through two studies that in the European Union’s Decentralised Procedure and the Mutual Recognition procedure, which are frequently used to obtain approval for <b>generic</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> licensing failure occurred in about 1 out of 10 licensing procedures. The reasons for licensing failure varied widely and were both of a drug quality and clinical nature. It was also concluded that increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via both procedures. Subsequently, we studied to what extent the drug regulatory system allowed for innovation during the post-innovation phase of the drug life cycle. We showed that extensions of the indication of already licensed <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> were mainly authorised a few years before approval of the first generic product version and ceased thereafter. On the contrary we found that old drugs were licensed as new <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> approved for new therapeutic indications or other innovations. A case study indicated that the viability of the business case for the development of such medicines may depend on a specific window of opportunity within a therapeutic area and the possibility to establish a period of relative exclusivity. We also demonstrated that after approval of a first generic product version the number of clinical trials with those drugs decreased but a considerable amount of clinical research still remained. Our analysis of the EU legislation and case-law of the European Court of Justice showed that the need for prior market approval has consistently been considered to be the general rule of the EU legislation on medicinal products; also for post-innovation innovation. However, we observed a clinical need for unlicensed pharmacy preparations and off-label use, while there are even more potential new uses. These observations in combination with society’s struggle with the need to license new uses of existing drugs and the lack of adequate incentives to do so, suggests that the drug regulatory system is under pressure. Regulatory reform is needed to enhance post-innovation innovation and use every drug to its full potential...|$|R

40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for interchangeable <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> have declined during the analysed years.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} multinational clinical research, regulatory requirements need to become international and harmonised. The EU introduced the Directive 2001 / 20 /EC in 2004, regulating investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Methods We conducted a survey {{in order to identify}} the national regulatory requirements for major categories of clinical research in ten European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network (ECRIN) countries-Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom-covering approximately 70 % of the EU population. Here we describe the results for regulatory requirements for typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> in the ten countries. Results Our results show that the ten countries have fairly harmonised definitions of typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Clinical trials assessing typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> require authorisation from a national competent authority in each of the countries surveyed. The opinion of the competent authorities is communicated to the trial sponsor within the same timelines, i. e., no more than 60 days, in all ten countries. The authority to which the application has to be sent to in the different countries is not fully harmonised. Conclusion The Directive 2001 / 20 /EC defined the term 'investigational medicinal product' and all regulatory requirements described therein are applicable to investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Our survey showed, however, that those requirements had been adopted in ten European countries, not for investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> overall, but rather a narrower category which we term 'typical' investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The result is partial EU harmonisation of requirements and a relatively navigable landscape for the sponsor regarding typical investigational <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire. The report revealed that, even though {{a number of countries}} had developed legislative texts on <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> these texts vary widely from one country to another and in only a few cases are they specific to veterinary <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> In most cases, the implementing regulations are not properly enforced.

40|$|According to the European Medicine Agency, a “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> {{that contains a}} version of the active substance of an original biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> (reference or innovative <b>medicinal</b> <b>product)</b> that has been authorized in the European Economic Area. The similarity to the reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> in terms of quality, biological activity, safety and efficacy needs to be set on a comprehensive comparability basis. The generic standard approach (demonstration of bioequivalence with a reference <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> by appropriate bioavailability studies), which is applicable {{to a wide range of}} chemically derived <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> is not sufficient to prove the similarity of biotechnology derived products due to their structural complexity. Furthermore, these biopharmaceuticals products, in comparison with the conventional ones, show a greater ability to activate the immune response. The evaluation of biosimilar medicines for authorisation purposes by the European Medicine Agency does not include recommendations on whether a biosimilar should be used interchangeably with its reference medicine. Substitution policies are, therefore, within the remit of the EU member states. In order to support pharmacovigilance monitoring, all appropriate measures should be taken to clearly identify any biological <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> with due regard to its brand name and batch number.
