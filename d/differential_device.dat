50|$|Fairey Aviation built {{a number}} of Sopwith Baby floatplanes at its Hamble works. A variant of the Sopwith Baby was built by the Fairey Aviation Co., Ltd. On 23 October 1916, Sopwith Baby No.8134 {{was sent to the}} Fairey works for repair, and the {{opportunity}} was taken to rebuild the aircraft to incorporate {{a number of}} modifications. The most significant was the Fairey Patent Camber Gear, which was a form of trailing edge flap used to increase lift. On the Fairey-built aircraft, the entire trailing edge of each wing was hinged along the rear spar, lowered by rotating a handwheel in the cockpit. A <b>differential</b> <b>device</b> ensured that the flaps could still be actuated as ailerons; thus, lateral control was maintained. In this modified form, the aircraft was known as the Fairey Hamble Baby. Production Hamble Babies differed in appearance from those built by Sopwith and Blackburn. The planform of wings and tailplane were changed: the wings had increased span and reduced chord, had rounded tips, and the tailplane had a characteristic shape different from the semi-circular outline of the Sopwith original. A new and angular fin, Fairey-designed main floats of new form, and an enlarged tail float were fitted, and the engine cowling was modified. Parnall also produced Hamble Babies, which had some detail differences from the Fairey produced aircraft. The last 74 aircraft were produced by Parnall as landplanes and known as the Hamble Baby Convert.|$|E

Current outputs of both electrodes are subtracted and twice differentiated; a steady state is reached and the stationary and dynamic responses are recorded. Both responses are proportional to glucose concentration in the 0. 1 µM- 2 mM range, and the reproducibility was found to be better than 2 % using these conditions.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} of sources of randomness in true random number generators aimed at cryptographic applications implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). One of the most often used source of randomness in logic devices is the timing jitter present in clock signals, generated using ring oscillators (RO). In order to estimate the entropy of the generated random bit-stream, {{it is necessary to}} characterize the employed timing jitter. Using the simulation of the clock jitter injection into the gates of RO we show that the proportion of jitter from uncorrelated and correlated noise sources on the overall period jitter depends on the number of delay elements (inverters). We also propose a new and precise method of the jitter measurement outside the device based {{on the use of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>device</b> outputs in conjunction with a differential oscilloscope probe. The measured standard deviation of the clock period is more than two times smaller than the one obtained using traditional methods.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{describe}} and explain aspects of residential child care in New Zealand. It notes that the indigenous literature is sparse, that the subject has been neglected as a research area {{and that there is}} uncertainty about residential child care as a form of substitute provision. To clarify the subject area, a review of the international literature Focuses first on the way in which children are assigned to residential care. It then examines formative trends and influences, principles and methods and knowledge about the participants and suggests that the field lacks clear definition and identity. Prior to formulating a research strategy, previous studies are evaluated and five of these, dubbed the Milestone Studies, are examined in detail. Some proposals from General Systems Theory, in particular the study of complex adaptive systems, are reviewed and these elements built into a research model which draws together the constructs of perceptual process, role-interaction and system-matrix. This model develops six cumulative theoretical propositions based on those notions, defines its operational terms and formulates fourteen hypotheses for empirical testing. For the field work, a survey instrument, including a semantic <b>differential</b> <b>device,</b> was constructed and pilot tested. The population, consisting of staff members in certain roles plus all young persons aged thirteen years and over was reached through a two-stage postal survey. The First stage ascertained numbers and the second brought in 961 individual responses, estimated to be 80 % of the total population as defined. The results confirm that although the two separate systems of residential child care, one run by the State and the other by diverse non-statutory agencies, have some characteristics in common, they are distinguished by the ethnic origins of their constituents, the length of time that members have been associated with child care and by different perceptions of roles and objects. Moreover, distinct intra-system differences between role-groups were observed. Differences are explained largely in terms of the emphasis of the State system upon the re-socialization of the adolescent offender compared with the non-State commitment to the younger, dependent child. This study concludes that it achieved the goals set, that it makes a small contribution to the research application of the semantic differential and that it provides a base for further study in the field of residential child care...|$|E
