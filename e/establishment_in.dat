5|$|Later, in December 1942, the 27th Battalion was {{transferred}} from the 3rd Brigade to the 23rd Brigade. This unit had previously been a 2nd AIF unit, but the loss of several of its battalions when they had been deployed to Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, had resulted in it being re-formed with Militia battalions and the 27th joined the 7th and 8th Battalions to round out its <b>establishment.</b> <b>In</b> March 1943, after having endured several bombings by Japanese aircraft since their arrival in Darwin the previous year, the battalion was replaced in the Darwin garrison and its personnel returned Adelaide for leave. In December, they regrouped on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for jungle training, as the 23rd Brigade—then part of the 3rd Division—was converted to the jungle <b>establishment,</b> <b>in</b> preparation for them undertaking active service in New Guinea. Around this time the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion, meaning that because more than 65 per cent of its personnel had volunteered for service outside of Australian territory, it could be deployed beyond the limits {{set out in the}} Defence Act (1903).|$|E

5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid <b>establishment</b> <b>in</b> the city and the city's populace.

Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became more and more common.|$|E
