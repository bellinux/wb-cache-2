[...] "Even though his daddy did sell drugs, I didn't deprive my son," [...] the elder Mayweather says. [...] "The drugs I sold, he was a part of it. He had plenty of food. He had the best clothes and I gave him money. He didn't want for anything. Anybody in Grand Rapids can tell you that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of my kids".

[...] "If it wasn't for me he wouldn't be where he is today," [...] he maintains.|$|E
2500|$|When Bow was 16, {{her mother}} Sarah fell from a second-story window and {{suffered}} a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with [...] "psychosis due to epilepsy". From her earliest years, Bow had {{learned how to}} care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be [...] "mean" [...] to her, but [...] "didn't mean to... she couldn't help it". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; [...] "As a kid <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of my mother, she didn't take care of me". Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she [...] "would be much better off dead". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother up. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode, and later she was committed to a sanatorium by Robert Bow.|$|E

[...] Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith [...] "always told me I want you to be there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of Anna with her health and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy.

2500|$|In 1884, {{following}} his final term at Carlisle, Standing Bear, {{armed with a}} recommendation by Captain Pratt, returned home to the Rosebud Agency, Rosebud, South Dakota, where he was hired as an assistant at the reservation's school at the salary of three hundred dollars a year. In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
