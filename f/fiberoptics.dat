50|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{an optical}} technique that provides non-destructive analysis with chemical specificity without complex sample preparation, and {{is capable of}} detecting components within mixtures. Raman signal corresponds to vibrational excitation of specific molecules within the system based on the scattered visible light emitted from a molecule with a lower energy than the excitation light source. Raman spectroscopy, when coupled with microfluidic devices, can monitor fluid mixing and trapping of liquids and can also detect solid and gas phases within microfluidic platforms.

In 1955 Frangenheim visited Raoul Palmer in Paris another pioneer in laparoscopy applying it for the investigation of infertility. In 1958 Frangenheim reported his experience when few gynecologist were using the abdominal approach to investigate the pelvis.

[...] He started to teach numerous interested colleagues at the Wuppertal hospital, among them Patrick Steptoe. Frangenheim published the first book about gynecologic laparoscopy in 1959. He pointed out that it was superior to culdoscopy and useful for investigations of infertility and ectopic pregnancy.In 1964 Frangenheim presented the use of “cold light” whereby the light was transmitted through <b>fiberoptics</b> to the laparoscope.

40|$|<b>Fiberoptics</b> {{could offer}} several major {{benefits}} for cryogenic liquid-fueled rocket engines, including lightning immunity, weight reduction, {{and the possibility}} of implementing a number of new measurements for engine condition monitoring. The technical feasibility of using <b>fiberoptics</b> in the severe environments posed by cryogenic liquid-fueled rocket engines was determined. The issues of importance and subsequent requirements for this use of <b>fiberoptics</b> were compiled. These included temperature ranges, moisture embrittlement succeptability, and the ability to withstand extreme shock and vibration levels. Different types of optical fibers were evaluated and several types of optical fibers' ability to withstand use in cryogenic liquid-fueled rocket engines was demonstrated through environmental testing of samples. This testing included: cold-bend testing, moisture embrittlement testing, temperature cycling, temperature extremes testing, vibration testing, and shock testing. Three of five fiber samples withstood the tests to a level proving feasibility, and two of these remained intact in all six of the tests.

40|$|Abstract Background Conventional cancer therapy {{including}} surgery, radiation, {{and chemotherapy}} often are physically debilitating and largely ineffective in previously treated patients with recurrent {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A natural photochemical, hypericin, could be a less invasive method for laser photodynamic therapy (PDT) of these recurrent head and neck malignancies. Hypericin has powerful photo-oxidizing ability, tumor localization properties, and fluorescent imaging capabilities as well as minimal dark toxicity. The current study defined hypericin PDT in vitro with human SCC cells before the cells were grown as tumor transplants in nude mice and tested {{as a model for}} hypericin induced tumor fluorescence and PDT via laser <b>fiberoptics.</b> Methods SNU squamous carcinoma cells were grown in tissue culture, detached from monolayers with trypsin, and incubated with 0. 1 μg to 10 μg/ml of hypericin before exposure to laser light at 514, 550, or 593 nm to define optimal dose, time, and wavelength for PDT of tumor cells. The SCC cells also were injected subcutaneously in nude mice and grown for 6 – 8 weeks to form tumors before hypericin injection and insertion of <b>fiberoptics</b> from a KTP 532 surgical laser to assess the feasibility of this operating room instrument in stimulating fluorescence and PDT of tumors. Results In vitro testing revealed a hypericin dose of 0. 2 – 0. 5 μg/ml was needed for PDT of the SCC cells with an optimal tumoricidal response seen at the 593 nm light absorption maximum. In vivo tumor retention of injected hypericin was seen for 7 to 10 days using KTP 532 laser induced fluorescence and biweekly PDT via laser <b>fiberoptics</b> led to regression of SCC tumor transplants under 0. 4 cm 2 diameter, but resulted in progression of larger size tumors in the nude mice. Conclusion In this preclinical study, hypericin was tested for 514 – 593 nm dye laser PDT of human SCC cells in vitro and for KTP 532 surgical laser targeting of SCC tumors in mice. The results suggest hypericin is a potent tumor imaging agent using this surgical laser that may prove useful in defining tumor margins and possibly in sterilizing post-resection margins. Deeply penetrating pulsed infrared laser emissions will be needed for PDT of larger and more inaccessible tumors. </p...|$|E
