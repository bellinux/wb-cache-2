2500|$|In 1895, George Collingridge {{produced}} his The Discovery of Australia, {{an attempt}} to trace all European efforts to find the Great Southern Land {{to the time of}} Cook, and also introducing his interpretation of the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia, using the Dieppe maps. Fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, Collingridge was inspired by the publicity surrounding the arrival in Australia of copies of several Dieppe maps, which had been purchased by libraries in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. Despite a number of errors regarding place names, and [...] "untenable" [...] theories to explain misplacement on the Dieppe maps, his book was a remarkable effort considering it was written {{at a time when many}} maps and documents were inaccessible and <b>document</b> <b>photography</b> was still in its infancy. Collingridge's theory did not find public approval, however, and Professors G. Arnold Wood and Ernest Scott publicly criticised much of what he had written. Collingridge produced a shorter version of this book for use in New South Wales schools; The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea. It was not used.|$|E
40|$|My work is photographic, but it {{has evolved}} into more structuraldependent, installation-based work {{over the past year}} and a half. Working {{traditionally}} with photography for a period of time, I wanted the work to become something different, something alternative. Making the work has become not only a literal labor of love, but also it has grown into a labor of self-exploration. The process I use is time intensive and allows me to transform a single image into something quite different from the original. I create the pieces by taking color film negatives or digital images, and outputting them onto inkjet compatible heat transfer paper. I take that printed image on the heat transfer material and adhere (or "iron") it onto wooden panels. The wood panels include various sizes oftwo-by-fours and sheets of plywood. After I secure the image onto the wood, I coat it generously with polyurethane. Using this process to add text and multiple layers to the imagery creates a mysterious sensibility and uniquely renders the images as one-of-a-kind, distinguishing it from traditional, inherently reproducible photographic processes. My reaction to the fact that not everything in life is easily explained or even comprehensible provides the context for my work. The body of work presented for my thesis show, Autonomy at 2 a. m., incorporates various conceptual and psychological elements. First, I began exploring spaces that made me feel contemplative. The images represent the solitary moments of clarity in which I am able to distinguish my identity and personal direction. I compare these photographs to each breath I take, moments in which I am able to sort out and understand the elements of my life. The images help me to visually grasp onto parts of myself that were hard for me to process intellectually. Being reflective and exploring the self means more than those terms suggest. Self-exploration is a visual process for me. Photography allows me to translate and interpret my environment. Personal moments captured photographically are made public for an audience to contemplate in a gallery setting. One goal of this project is to remove specificity of place from each image in order to encourage viewers to relate to and connect with the mood in the work. I want the audience to take notice of and question the setting in which the photographs are exhibited. The photographs depict seemingly ordinary environments and objects. They have a voyeuristic sensibility and capture details of places late at night in which people are unaware I am photographing or they are noticeably absent. The gooey, non-traditional technique I use to present the photographs is intended to intrigue viewers. The process and the resulting body of work embrace fluidity and unpredictability, adjectives and properties that might be used to describe my life. The images can be made and installed differently each time they are shown. The title, Autonomy at 2 a. m., provides a verbal cue for each visual moment that is portrayed. "Autonomy" embraces independence, strength, liberation, and solitude. The images in Autonomy at 2 a. m. work as visual and sensory suggestions rather than as faithful representations. A representational medium often used to <b>document,</b> <b>Photography</b> cultivates an audience that expects to see some recognizable, identifiable "thing". The work is meant to frustrate that expectation and create "image-objects" that disorient as well as encourage introspection similar to the sensations that spawned the photographs in the first place...|$|E

40|$|Hard {{disk storage}} {{capacity}} {{has continued to}} rise whilst {{at the same time}} the cost per megabyte continues to fall. This, combined with increased usage of digital storage for <b>documents,</b> <b>photography</b> and video for both home and business use has led to increased need for reliable data storage system. Redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) have proven to offer the best characteristics for reliable storage. However, to date RAID based systems have been limited, due to cost and circuit complexity, by their support for only single disk erasure tolerance. FPGAs allow us to overcome these difficulties and allow support for more complex storage algorithms. This paper introduces an efficient FPGA based hardware RAID 6 accelerator providing uninterrupted access during all single and double disk erasures and recover...|$|R
