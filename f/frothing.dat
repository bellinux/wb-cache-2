5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody <b>frothing</b> at the mouth.|$|E

25|$|The troops worst {{affected}} had intense cyanosis and frothy exudation {{from the}} mouth and nose; some of the severe casualties who reached casualty clearing stations, had a pallor and collapse associated with phosgene poisoning. In a few cases cyanosis gave place to pallor before the victim died. The troops who died rapidly in the front line, about ninety minutes after {{the beginning of the}} attack, showed deep cyanosis and copious <b>frothing,</b> with paroxysmal coughing prominent in the early stages. The clinical evidence suggested that the gas cloud contained a low proportion of phosgene to chlorine. About twenty civilians were affected by the gas, though none severely, as they had been instructed in gas precautions and had been issued with respirators. The civilians had also protected themselves by closing windows and doors and by filling cracks with wet cloths; many also wore anti-gas helmets indoors.|$|E
25|$|Other Shanghainese {{cultural}} artifacts {{include the}} cheongsam (Shanghainese: zansae), a modernization {{of the traditional}} Manchurian qipao. This contrasts sharply with the traditional qipao, {{which was designed to}} conceal the figure and be worn regardless of age. The cheongsam went along well with the western overcoat and the scarf, and portrayed a unique East Asian modernity, epitomizing the Shanghainese population in general. As Western fashions changed, the basic cheongsam design changed, too, introducing high-neck sleeveless dresses, bell-like sleeves, and the black lace <b>frothing</b> at the hem of a ball gown. By the 1940s, cheongsams came in transparent black, beaded bodices, matching capes and even velvet. Later, checked fabrics became also quite common. The 1949 Communist Revolution ended the cheongsam and other fashions in Shanghai. However, the Shanghainese styles have seen a recent revival as stylish party dresses. The fashion industry has been rapidly revitalizing in the past decade. Like Shanghai's architecture, local fashion designers strive to create a fusion of western and traditional designs, often with innovative if controversial results.|$|E

He was held {{for a time in}} the hospital's prison ward—Howard's Hall, known as the [...] "hell-hole", a building without windows—in a room with a thick steel door and nine peepholes to allow the psychiatrists to observe him as they tried to agree on a diagnosis. Visitors were admitted for only 15 minutes at a time, while patients wandered around screaming and <b>frothing</b> at the mouth.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{chapters}} address aspects of English food, whether types of food such as meat, eggs, fungi, and bread, or {{ways of dealing}} with food such as salting, drying and preserving. Some chapters such as 'Elizabethan households' are explicitly historical. Every chapter, however, is also a history. For example, chapter V, Meat, discusses [...] "a rather interesting mediaeval miracle" [...] and illustrates a traditional [...] "Colonial Travelling Meat Safe of Mosquito Net". The text switches repeatedly from instructions ("To prepare mutton fat for a mutton piecrust, melt it over a bowl of hot water") to historical asides ("Mutton fat was used in the mountain-sheep districts for the same purposes as suet or goose-grease in the valleys"). Many of the processes are distinctly old-fashioned; thus, Hartley describes basting, dredging, and <b>frothing,</b> switching between the past and present tenses: [...] "Dredging. This was done between bastings. Thus you dredge with powders or spices to give flavour, or with acid juices, or chopped herbs, which the pouring fat washes down into the crevices of the roasting meat." ...|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, in a psychoanalytical {{review of}} The Crab with the Golden Claws, commented that this book {{witnessed}} Tintin's [...] "real {{entrance into the}} community of human beings" [...] as he gains an [...] "older brother" [...] in Haddock. He also believed that the recurring image of alcohol throughout the story was symbolic of sexuality. In particular, he believed {{that there was a}} strong homoerotic subtext between Haddock and Tintin, represented in the two delirious sequences; in one, Haddock envisions Tintin as a champagne bottle <b>frothing</b> at the top (thereby symbolising an ejaculating penis), while in the other, Tintin dreams that he is trapped inside a bottle, with Haddock about to stick a corkscrew into him (thereby symbolising sexual penetration). However, Apostolidès notes, in both instances the pair are prevented from realising their sexual fantasies. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred with Apostolidès on this point, also highlighting what he perceived as homoerotic undertones to these two scenes. He also noted that in this Adventure, the manner in which a chance finding of a tin can on a Belgian street leads Tintin into the story is representative of the recurring theme of [...] "Tintin the detective" [...] found throughout the series.|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "chocolate" [...] {{entered the}} English {{language}} from Spanish in about 1600. The word entered Spanish from Nahuatl word chocolātl, {{the language of}} the Aztecs, but the exact etymology of the Nahuatl word is debated. One proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning [...] "beaten drink", which may derive from the word for the <b>frothing</b> stick, chicoli. The term [...] "chocolate chip" [...] was first used in 1940. The term [...] "chocolatier", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.|$|E
2500|$|... “Joseph Scott, the Blackball Mine Manager.., {{believed}} that the majority (of miners) {{were killed by the}} explosion and “not more than half a dozen by the afterdamp”. Robert Russell, believing the explosion to be caused by firedamp, while acknowledging that the explosion force and coal dust flames contributed to the causes of death, {{believed that}} “at the end it was the afterdamp gases that killed them (all).” Dr. James McBrearty’s description of many victims <b>frothing</b> at the mouth, suggests asphyxiation by the predominant afterdamp gas, being carbon dioxide. The afterdamp gas carbon monoxide which presented such a problem for the recovery teams must also have contributed to death through poisoning. It was not then fully appreciated that only small quantities of carbon monoxide or white damp could be fatal”.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Cragg of musicOMH argued, [...] "For {{the most}} part, the {{strength}} of the songwriting should keep the doubters at bay, Goulding and producer Starsmith concocting a heady mix of skyscraping choruses, twinkling beats and Goulding's elastic vocals." [...] In a mixed review, Claire Allfree of Metro viewed the album as [...] "undeniably pretty aerated synthpop" [...] and praised songs like [...] "Starry Eyed" [...] ("pulsingly pert") and [...] "The Writer" [...] ("a lilting melodic hook"), but felt that [...] "Goulding's girly, heartfelt voice is oddly depthless, while the electronic vapour and four-to-the-floor house beats swoop in a wash of perfectly calibrated bland sound." [...] In a review for the NME, Mark Beaumont critiqued that [...] "there's nothing here groundbreaking enough to justify the critical <b>frothing.</b> It's largely straight-ahead folk-pop dappled with a mild ground-frost of sequenced beats, Auto-Tune, and synth sizzles." [...] Drowned in Sound's David Renshaw opined that [...] "Lights sounds like a naïve folk album given a blog house remix" [...] and concluded, [...] "Devoid of a true soul or sense of honesty Lights can be a pretty hollow listen." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis was unimpressed, dismissing the album as [...] "general acoustic singer-songwriter material".|$|E
2500|$|The French knights thus {{continued}} up the hill, though accounts {{state that}} more than half were on foot by this point, either because they had been unhorsed by the lines of sharpened stakes or had dismounted to pull up stakes. Struggling in their heavy armor, they reached the plateau {{on the top of the}} slope, where they had expected to find fleeing Turkish forces, but instead found themselves facing a fresh corps of sipahis, whom Bayezid had kept in reserve. [...] As the sipahis surged forward in the counterattack sounding trumpets, banging kettle drums and yelling [...] "God is great!", the desperation of their situation was readily apparent to the French and some knights broke and fled back down the slope. [...] The rest fought on [...] "no <b>frothing</b> boar nor enraged wolf more fiercely," [...] in the words of one contemporary chronicler. [...] Admiral de Vienne, to whom was granted the honor as the eldest knight of carrying the French standard into battle, was wounded many times as he attempted to rally the morale of his countrymen, before being struck down dead. [...] Other notable knights who were slain include Jean de Carrouges, Philippe de Bar and Odard de Chasseron. [...] The Turks threatened to overwhelm Nevers and his bodyguard threw themselves to the ground in silent submission to plead for the life of their liege lord. [...] Notwithstanding the declaration of jihad, the Turks were as interested in the riches that could be gained by ransoming noble captives as anyone else, and took Nevers prisoner. [...] Seeing Nevers taken, the rest of the French yielded.|$|E
