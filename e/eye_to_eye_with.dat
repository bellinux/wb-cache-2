5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always see <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, {{there was always the}} factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E
25|$|After recovering, a Bishop from {{a nearby}} diocese {{requested}} Phillips' presence in Pinyin. Phillips arrived at the mission station on 9 March 1906. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel opened a mission station in Pinyin in 1979. During the time Phillips was there, {{there were no other}} mission stations present in the area. Phillips often did not see <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> missionaries in Pinyin and wished to build a permanent hospital. In 1908, Phillips received permission to build the hospital that she had requested. Phillips opened St. Agatha's Hospital on 5 February 1909 and it was dedicated on 1 May.|$|E
25|$|Nariakira {{did not see}} <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> his father, Shimazu Narioki, or his father’s chief advisor, Zusho Hirosato. Both Narioki and Zusho were wary of the Tokugawa shogunate. Zusho {{also saw}} many {{similarities}} in Nariakira and his grandfather, Shigehide. Shigehide also had {{a great interest in}} Dutch studies as well as scientific and industrial projects, which promptly led to the deterioration of the domain’s financial position. Having worked so hard to rehabilitate and strengthen the treasury of Satsuma, Zusho did not encourage Nariakira’s ambitious and costly program for a military build-up. Narioki and Zusho’s mutual disdain and mistrust for Nariakira led to their endeavoring to isolate Nariakira from Satsuma’s affairs, which entailed withholding or all together ceasing the flow from all sources of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with the shogunate.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} if the residual corneal stromal bed of 250 µm is enough to prevent iatrogenic keratectasia in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we studied 958 patients who underwent LASIK from April 2000 to October 2003 retrospectively. The estimated probabilities of the residual stromal bed, that was less than 250 µm, were calculated using the publi- shed flap thickness data of Moria C&B microkeratome. Then we calculated {{the ratio of the}} real incidence of keratectasia to the expected the percentage of the patients with less than 250 µm residual stromal bed in our study. Using the LASIK flap thickness data of Miranda, Kezirian and Nagy, the expected probabilities that the residual stroma would be less than 250 µm were 8. 8 %, 4. 3 % and 1. 5 % of the 1, 916 eyes respectively, while keratectasia developed in both eyes (0. 1 %) of 1 patient in our study. The estimated ratio of the keratectatic <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> less than 250 µm stromal bed were 1. 2 - 6. 9 %. Compared <b>to</b> the number of <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> residual stromal thickness less than 250 m, the incidence of keratectasia was relatively low. The residual stromal bed thickness of more than 250 µm may possibly be safe, but further observations for long period are necessary...|$|R

Tovey said Aden {{will always be}} [...] "the love of Belle's life", but she is traumatised by the previous events. Aden witnesses Belle kissing Angelo, which destroys their relationship. Belle is left unsure what to do because she sees Angelo has her [...] "safety net" [...] and Aden [...] "brings out the passion in her". She added that Angelo doesn't compare with her love for Aden, that her relationship with Aden was the [...] "most beautiful" [...] on the programme {{and that she would}} never escape her feelings for Aden. Aden later [...] "jumps on Belle" [...] and tells her they are in love and should be together. Tovey said Belle gets [...] "caught in the moment" [...] and they make love. Tovey was unhappy with the fact that Belle cheated, as she thought it was out of character. When Angelo finds out the truth, he publicly humiliates Belle. He later goes around to her home and becomes violent. Belle is later found badly beaten and although Angelo is not responsible, he gets the blame. Jacobz said the under the circumstances he would have thought the same. He added that Aden [...] "hates" [...] Angelo.

30|$|Uveitic eyes without ME {{not only}} had lower retinal {{sensitivity}} compared <b>to</b> normal <b>eyes,</b> but the corresponding rise in retinal sensitivity with each rise in retinal thickness was more in normal <b>eyes</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> uveitis. Although the decrease in sensitivity in uveitic eyes without ME {{was not statistically significant}} (p[*]=[*] 0.246), it may indicate that macular edema may not be the only factor affecting retinal sensitivity and that the inflammatory process in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> uveitis may affect retinal sensitivity. The cut points of 350  μm in <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> UME and 280  μm in uveitic eyes without ME were chosen based on the exploratory data analysis. Unadjusted factors in the model, such as the frequency of flare-ups, duration of ME, and duration of disease, {{may play a role in}} the relationship between macular sensitivity and thickness. There may be the possibility that areas with higher macular thickness and edema have active disease compared to areas with normal thickness retina. Retinal thinning or atrophy either due to the development of cystic changes or loss of photoreceptors have been shown to decrease retinal sensitivity as well [26, 27]. It should be noted that differences in measuring devices (OPKO/OTI® vs MP- 1 ®) and methods of data analysis may also result in variation in results.|$|R
40|$|Eye {{contact is}} such {{a natural part of}} our {{everyday}} interactions, that we may take it for granted or dismiss its value. Yet it {{can be one of the}} most powerful ways of communicating and can assist or hinder in building relationships. Utilizing the method of literature review within hermeneutic methodology this dissertation looks at how eye contact and the gaze are addressed within literature on psychoanalytically informed psychotherapy. The research suggests that many psychoanalytic theorists, such as Winnicott, Stern and Bowlby have discussed the important role gazing plays within mother-infant dyads, but these findings have not been adequately translated to an understanding of how eye contact and the gaze can facilitate the process of psychotherapy. This dissertation looks at recent findings in neuroscience which suggest that eye contact has a major impact on the developing brain of the baby and hence paying intentional attention to non-verbal embodied communications, such as eye contact, can also play an essential role in facilitating reparative processes in adult psychotherapy relationships. The findings of this study suggest that eye contact occurring between the therapist and the client can be used as an integral part of the careful negotiations in the intersubjective space of closeness and distance, allowing for repair of the self to take place. This requires that psychotherapists come <b>eye</b> <b>to</b> <b>eye</b> not only <b>with</b> the otherness of the other, but also with what the other evokes in us...|$|R

2500|$|Despite their friendship, {{tensions}} between Graham and King emerged in 1958 when the sponsoring committee of a crusade {{which took place}} in San Antonio, Texas on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state's segregationist governor, Price Daniel.

On Jam Jar (1995), by Fresh Film in association with BBC Four, which aired in the UK, Williams provided her audience with a greater depth of understanding of autism.
