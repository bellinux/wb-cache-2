60|$|No hard {{task was}} it to win the {{friendship}} of the most of those good-natured outlaws. They were used to men of a better order than theirs coming to the hidden camps {{and sooner or later}} sinking to their lower level. Besides, with them everything was easy come, easy go. That was why life itself went on so carelessly and usually ended so cheaply. There were men among them, however, that made Duane feel that terrible inexplicable wrath rise in his breast. He could not bear to be near them. He could not trust himself. He felt that any instant a word, a deed, something might call too deeply to that instinct he could no longer control. Jackrabbit Benson was one of these men. Because of him and other outlaws of his ilk Duane could scarcely ever forget the reality of things. This was a hidden valley, a robbers' den, a rendezvous for murderers, a wild place stained red by deeds of wild men. And because of that there was always a charged atmosphere. The merriest, idlest, most careless moment might in the flash of an <b>eye</b> <b>end</b> in ruthless and tragic action. In an assemblage of desperate characters it could not be otherwise. The terrible thing that Duane sensed was this. The valley was beautiful, sunny, fragrant, a place to dream in; the mountaintops were always blue or gold rimmed, the yellow river slid slowly and majestically by, the birds sang in the cottonwoods, the horses grazed and pranced, children played and women longed for love, freedom, happiness; the outlaws rode in and out, free with money and speech; they lived comfortably in their adobe homes, smoked, gambled, talked, laughed, whiled away the idle hours--and all the time life there was wrong, and the simplest moment might be precipitated by that evil into the most awful of contrasts. Duane felt rather than saw a dark, brooding shadow over the valley.|$|E

A conventional 65 Si 7 spring steel leaf spring model with standard eye, casted and riveted <b>eye</b> <b>end</b> are considered. The CAD model of the leaf springs is prepared in CATIA and analyzed using ANSYS. The standard eye, casted and riveted eye leaf springs are subjected to similar loading conditions. The CAE analysis of the leaf spring is performed for various parameters like deflection and Von-Mises stress. Mass reduction of 62. 9 % is achieved in case of riveted eye mono leaf spring as compared to standard eye mono leaf spring for the same loading conditions.

50|$|When larger 'gaze saccades' are {{accompanied}} by a head movement, Listing's law cannot be maintained constantly because VOR movements occur during or {{toward the end of}} the movement sequence.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how signals {{generated in the}} oculomotor cerebellum could {{be involved in the}} control of gaze shifts, which rapidly redirect the eyes from one object to another. Neurons in the caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN), the output of the oculomotor cerebellum, discharged when monkeys made horizontal head-unrestrained gaze shifts, composed of an eye saccade and a head movement. Eighty-seven percent of our neurons discharged a burst of spikes for both ipsiversive and contraversive gaze shifts. In both directions, burst end was much better timed with gaze end than was burst start with gaze start, was well correlated with <b>eye</b> <b>end,</b> and was poorly correlated with head end or the time of peak head velocity. Moreover, bursts accompanied all head-unrestrained gaze shifts whether the head moved or not. Therefore we conclude that the cFN {{is not part of the}} pathway that controls head movement. For contraversive gaze shifts, the early part of the burst was correlated with gaze acceleration. Thereafter, the burst of the neuronal population continued throughout the prolonged deceleration of large gaze shifts. For a majority of neurons, gaze duration was correlated with burst duration; for some, gaze amplitude was less well correlated with the number of spikes. Therefore we suggest that the population burst provides an acceleration boost for high acceleration (smaller) contraversive gaze shifts and helps maintain the drive required to extend the deceleration of large contraversive gaze shifts. In contrast, the ipsiversive population burst, which is less well correlated with gaze metrics but whose peak rate occurs before gaze end, seems responsible primarily for terminating the gaze shift...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} inter-trial {{variability}} of saccade trajectories observed in five rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). For each time point during a saccade, the inter-trial variance of eye position and its covariance with <b>eye</b> <b>end</b> position were evaluated. Data were modeled by a superposition of three noise components due to 1) planning noise, 2) signal-dependent motor noise, and 3) signal-dependent premotor noise entering within an internal feedback loop. Both planning noise and signal-dependent motor noise (together called accumulating noise) predict a simple S-shaped variance increase during saccades, {{which was not}} sufficient to explain the data. Adding noise within an internal feedback loop enabled the model to mimic variance/covariance structure in each monkey, and to estimate the noise amplitudes and the feedback gain. Feedback noise {{had little effect on}} end point noise, which was dominated by accumulating noise. This analysis was further extended to saccades executed during inactivation of the caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN) {{on one side of the}} cerebellum. Saccades ipsiversive to an inactivated cFN showed more end point variance than did normal saccades. During cFN inactivation, eye position during saccades was statistically more strongly coupled to eye position at saccade end. The proposed model could fit the variance/covariance structure of ipsiversive and contraversive saccades. Inactivation effects on saccade noise are explained by a decrease of the feedback gain and an increase of planning and/or signal-dependent motor noise. The decrease of the fitted feedback gain is consistent with previous studies suggesting a role for the cerebellum in an internal feedback mechanism. Increased end point variance did not result from impaired feedback but from the increase of accumulating noise. The effects of cFN inactivation on saccade noise indicate that the effects of cFN inactivation cannot be explained entirely with the cFN's direct connections to the saccade-related premotor centers in the brainstem...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of 30 min of exposure to either + 3 G(sub x) or + 3 G(sub z) centrifugation on cerebrovascular responses to 800 head-up tilt (HUT) in 14 healthy individuals. Both before and after + 3 G(sub x) or + 3 G(sub z) centrifugation, eye-level blood pressure (BP(sub <b>eye)),</b> <b>end</b> tidal CO 2 (P(sub ET) CO 2), mean cerebral flow velocity (CFV) in the middle cerebral artery (trans cranial Doppler ultrasound), cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) and dynamic cerebral autoregulatory gain (GAIN) were measured with subjects in the supine position and during subsequent 800 HUT for 30 min. Mean BP(sub eye) decreased with HUT in both the G(sub x) (n= 7) and G(sub z) (n= 7) groups (P less than 0. 00 l), with the decrease being greater after centrifugation only in the G(sub z) group (P less than 0. 05). P(sub ET) CO 2 also decreased with HUT in both groups (P less than 0. 0 l), but the absolute level of decrease was unaffected by centrifugation. CFV decreased during HUT more significantly after than before centrifugation in both groups (P less than 0. 02). However, these greater decreases were not associated with greater increases in CVR. In the supine position after compared to before centrifugation, GAIN increased in both groups (P less than 0. 05, suggesting an autoregulatory deficit), with the change being correlated to a measure of otolith function (the linear vestibulo-ocular reflex) in the G(sub x) group (R= 0. 76, P less than 0. 05) but not in the G(sub z) group (R= 0. 24, P= 0. 60). However, GAIN was subsequently restored to pre-centrifugation levels during post-centrifugation HUT (i. e., as BP(sub eye) decreased), suggesting that both types of centrifugation resulted in a leftward shift of the cerebral autoregulation curve. We speculate that this leftward shift may have been due to vestibular activation (especially during +G(sub x)) or potentially to an adaptation to reduced cerebral perfusion pressure during +G(sub z) ...|$|E

Gaze shifts could be either Matching (both <b>eyes</b> <b>end</b> up pointing direct or averted) or Mismatching (one <b>eye</b> <b>ends</b> up pointing direct, the other averted). Matching shifts revealed an attentional cueing mechanism, where TOJs were biased in favour of the eye lying in the hemispace cued by the avatar’s Starting Gaze Direction. For example, the left eye {{was more likely to}} be judged as shifting first when the avatar initially gazed toward {{the left side of the}} screen. Mismatching shifts showed biased TOJs in favour of the eye performing the averted shift, but only in the context of two separate hemifaces that does not violate expectations of directional gaze shift congruency. This suggests a postdictive inferential strategy that prioritises eye movements based on the type of gaze shift, independently of where attention is initially allocated. Averted shifts are prioritised over direct, as these might signal the presence of behaviourally relevant information in the environment...|$|R
