50|$|<b>Enamel</b> hypocalcification is {{a defect}} of tooth <b>enamel</b> in which normal amounts of <b>enamel</b> are {{produced}} but are hypomineralized. In this defect the <b>enamel</b> is softer than normal. Some areas in <b>enamel</b> are hypocalcified: <b>enamel</b> spindles, <b>enamel</b> tufts, and <b>enamel</b> lamellae.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Enamel</b> {{spindles}} {{are often}} confused {{with two other}} entities: <b>enamel</b> lamellae and <b>enamel</b> tufts. Lamellae are linear <b>enamel</b> defects that extend {{from the surface of}} the <b>enamel</b> towards the DEJ, or vice versa. <b>Enamel</b> tufts are [...] "small, branching defects that are found only at the DEJ, protruding into the <b>enamel</b> towards the <b>enamel</b> surface. <b>Enamel</b> spindles however, are in fact odontoblast processes that extend into the <b>enamel.</b>|$|R
50|$|All tooth <b>enamel,</b> {{including}} interrod <b>enamel</b> and <b>enamel</b> rods, {{is made by}} ameloblasts. However, interrod <b>enamel</b> {{is formed}} slightly sooner than <b>enamel</b> rods.|$|R

5|$|The collar {{was made}} of gold, {{consisting}} of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were alternately <b>enamelled</b> white within red, and red within white.

40|$|In Monodelphis domestica, {{although}} both processes from odontoblasts and projections from ameloblasts {{were found in}} developing <b>enamel,</b> {{the majority of the}} contents of <b>enamel</b> tubules were probably processes that originated from odontoblasts. Processes from odontoblasts penetrating into <b>enamel</b> touched part of the ameloblasts in the stage of <b>enamel</b> formation. No specialised cell junctions were seen at the adherence between the two. There were no <b>enamel</b> tubules in the aprismatic and pseudoprismatic <b>enamel</b> layer. It is likely that <b>enamel</b> tubules exist only in prismatic <b>enamel.</b> The majority of <b>enamel</b> tubules seemed to contain no cell processes in the stage of <b>enamel</b> maturation, indicating that the cell processes in the tubules probably degenerate after the stage of <b>enamel</b> formation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{arrangement}} of <b>enamel</b> rods is understood {{more clearly than}} their internal structure. <b>Enamel</b> rods are found in rows along the tooth, and within each row, the long axis of the <b>enamel</b> rod is generally perpendicular to the underlying dentin. [...] In permanent teeth, the <b>enamel</b> rods near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) tilt slightly toward {{the root of the}} tooth. Understanding <b>enamel</b> orientation is very important in restorative dentistry, because <b>enamel</b> unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture.The area around the <b>enamel</b> rod is known as interrod <b>enamel.</b> Interrod <b>enamel</b> has the same composition as <b>enamel</b> rod, however a histologic distinction is made between the two because crystal orientation is different in each.

40|$|Metrical {{methods for}} {{describing}} {{the variance in}} extant hominoids are applied to phenetic groupings of later Miocene hominoids {{in order to produce}} palaeospecies whose variance is compatible with that seen in living hominoids. <b>Enamel</b> thickness measurements are presented for samples of living and fossil hominoids. An index of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness scaled for size has been developed and this defined four categories of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness metrically: Thin <b>enamel</b> (mean values of relative <b>enamel</b> thickness between 8. 90 and 11. 30), intermediate/ thin <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 11. 30 and 14. 65), intermediate/ thick <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 14. 65 and 17. 25), and thick <b>enamel</b> (mean values between 17. 70 and 26. 20).

5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup <b>enamelled</b> with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present for his brother in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An <b>enamelled</b> crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the Order, {{including}} the Sovereign, is allotted a stall in the Chapel, above which his or her heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with mantling and topped by his crest. If he is a peer, the coronet appropriate to his rank is placed beneath the helm. Under the laws of heraldry, women, other than monarchs, do not normally bear helms nor crests; instead, the coronet alone is used (if she is a peeress or princess). Lady Marion Fraser had a helm and crest included when she was granted arms; these are displayed above her stall {{in the same manner}} as for knights. Unlike other British Orders, the armorial banners of Knights and Ladies of the Thistle are not hung in the chapel, but instead in an adjacent part of St Giles High Kirk. The Thistle Chapel does, however, bear the arms of members living and deceased on stall plates. These <b>enamelled</b> plates are affixed to the back of the stall and display its occupant's name, arms, and date of admission into the Order.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enamel</b> tufts are {{frequently}} confused with <b>enamel</b> lamellae, {{which are also}} <b>enamel</b> defects, but which differ in two ways: lamella are linear, and not branched, and they exist primarily extending from the <b>enamel</b> surface, through the <b>enamel</b> and towards the dentinoenamel junction, whereas <b>enamel</b> tufts project in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{microstructure}} of the <b>enamel</b> of VPL/JU/NKIM/25 {{has been}} studied. Unlike other gondwanatheres, it has <b>enamel</b> consisting of three layers—radial <b>enamel,</b> tangential <b>enamel,</b> and PLEX. The rows of small, round <b>enamel</b> prisms {{are separated by}} interprismatic matrix that forms crystals oriented at right angles relative to the prisms. Prisms arise at the enamel-dentine junction, run through the <b>enamel,</b> and meet the outer <b>enamel</b> at a high angle. These features of the <b>enamel</b> are apparently adaptations that protect the tooth from cracks.|$|R
50|$|The Cross of Mathilde was {{equipped}} with forty <b>enamel</b> tablets, of which 37 remain: the <b>enamel</b> with the donor portrait, the <b>enamel</b> with the cross inscription, two round <b>enamels</b> with the personifications of the Sun and the Moon, and 33 ornamental <b>enamels.</b> Three further ornamental <b>enamels</b> were lost before the first description of the cross. Of all the objects in the Essen treasury, the Cross of Mathilde is the most richly decorated with <b>enamel.</b> All the <b>enamel</b> frames are filigreed.|$|R
5|$|Each of the cover, main body, {{and foot}} of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the <b>enamelled</b> medallions inside the cover and bowl were made {{separately}} before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou. High quality courtly work like the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris {{in the absence of}} other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.|$|E
5|$|Most Hungarian lords and the prelates {{opposed the}} {{restoration}} of paganism. They preferred the devout Christian Andrew to his pagan brother Levente, even if, {{at least according to}} Kristó and Steinhübel, the latter was the eldest among Vazul's three sons. The Hungarian chronicles write that Levente, who died in short time, did not oppose his brother's ascension to the throne. The three bishops who had survived the pagan uprising crowned Andrew in Székesfehérvár {{in the last quarter of}} 1046 or in the spring of 1047. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Andrew was crowned with a crown that the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos had sent to him. Nine <b>enamelled</b> plaques from this golden crown were unearthed in Nyitraivánka (Ivanka pri Nitre, Slovakia) in the 19th century. Andrew soon broke with his pagan supporters, restored Christianity and declared pagan rites illegal. According to Kosztolnyik, Andrew's epithets (the White or the Catholic) are connected to these events.|$|E
