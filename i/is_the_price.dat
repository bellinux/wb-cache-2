5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward exchange rate {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward exchange rate depends on three known variables: the spot exchange rate, the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

40|$|Before one {{can begin}} to examine the models for option pricing, it is {{necessary}} to understand some fundamental principles that govern <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> of options. These principles do not give specific option prices except in a very limited sense. Rather, they define the bounds within which option prices must lie. In addition they define relationships among different options, such as those differing by exercise price, between puts and calls, and between European and American options. We let St <b>be</b> <b>the</b> asset <b>price</b> today, ST <b>be</b> <b>the</b> asset <b>price</b> at expiration, X <b>be</b> <b>the</b> exercise <b>price,</b> r <b>be</b> <b>the</b> continuously compounded risk-free rate, σ <b>be</b> <b>the</b> volatility, and τ = T- t <b>be</b> <b>the</b> time to expiration. Let ct <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a European call at time t and pt <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a European put at time t. <b>The</b> asset <b>is</b> assumed to make no payments such as dividends, but we shall relax that assumption at appropriate points. Let Ct <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of an American call at time t and Pt <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of an American put at time t. Other notation will be introduced as needed. Absolute Minimum and Maximum Values By absolute minimum and maximum values, we wish to define bounds within which <b>the</b> option <b>prices</b> must lie. We do not {{rule out the possibility that}} <b>the</b> actual option <b>prices</b> might have a higher minimum or lower maximum value that we can establish later on.

25|$|A {{minimum wage}} {{is the lowest}} {{remuneration}} that employers can legally pay their workers. Equivalently, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> floor below which workers may not sell their labor. Although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases {{the standard of living}} of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty, increases unemployment (particularly among unskilled or inexperienced workers) and is damaging to businesses, because excessively high minimum wages require businesses to raise the prices of their product or service to accommodate the extra expense of paying a higher wage.|$|E

25|$|Currencies are traded {{against one}} another in pairs. Each {{currency}} pair thus constitutes an individual trading product and is traditionally noted XXXYYY or XXX/YYY, where XXX and YYY are the ISO 4217 international three-letter code of the currencies involved. The first currency (XXX) is the base currency that is quoted relative to the second currency (YYY), called the counter currency (or quote currency). For instance, the quotation EURUSD (EUR/USD) 1.5465 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the Euro expressed in US dollars, meaning 1 euro = 1.5465 dollars. The market convention is to quote most exchange rates against the USD with the US dollar as the base currency (e.g. USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF). The exceptions are the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and the euro (EUR) where the USD is the counter currency (e.g. GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURUSD).|$|E

500|$|On 13 August 1893, Lobengula {{refused to}} accept the stipend due him {{under the terms of the}} Rudd Concession, saying [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of my blood". The next day, Jameson signed a secret {{agreement}} with settlers at Fort Victoria, promising each man [...] of farm land, 20 gold claims and a share of Lobengula's cattle in return for service in a war against Matabeleland. Lobengula wrote again to Queen Victoria, and tried to send Mshete to England again at the head of another embassy, but Loch detained the izinDuna at Cape Town for a few days, then sent them home. Following a few minor skirmishes, the First Matabele War started in earnest in October: Company troops moved on Lobengula, using the inexorable firepower of their Maxim machine guns to crush attacks by the far larger Matabele army. On 3 November, with the whites nearing Bulawayo, Lobengula torched the town and fled; the settlers began rebuilding atop the ruins the next day. Jameson sent troops north from Bulawayo to bring the king back, but this column ceased its pursuit in early December after the remnants of Lobengula's army ambushed and annihilated 34 troopers who were sent across the Shangani River ahead of the main force. Lobengula had escaped the Company, but he lived only another two months before dying from smallpox in the north of the country on 22 or 23 January 1894.|$|E
