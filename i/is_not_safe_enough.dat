At the outset, we emphasize that the statute does not seek to regulate the construction or operation of a nuclear powerplant. It would clearly be impermissible for California to attempt to do so, for such regulation, even if enacted out of nonsafety concerns, would nevertheless directly conflict with the NRC's exclusive authority over plant construction and operation. Respondents appear to concede as much. Respondents do broadly argue, however, that although safety regulation of nuclear plants by States is forbidden, a State may completely prohibit new construction until its safety concerns are satisfied by the Federal Government. We reject this line of reasoning. State safety regulation is not pre-empted only when it conflicts with federal law. Rather, the Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns, except the limited powers expressly ceded to the States. 25 [...] When the Federal Government [...] completely occupies a given field or an identifiable portion of it, as it has done here, the test of pre-emption is whether [...] "the matter on which the State asserts the right to act is in any way regulated by the Federal Act."

40|$|Purpose. Anterior screw {{fixation}} {{has become a}} popular surgical treatment method for instable odontoid fractures. Screw loosening and migration are a rare, severe complication following anterior odontoid fixation, {{which can lead to}} esophagus perforation and requires revision operation. Methods. We report a case of screw loosening and migration after anterior odontoid fixation, which perforated the esophagus and was excreted without complications in a 78 -year-old male patient. Results. A ventral dislocated anterior screw perforated through the esophagus after eight years after implantation and was excreted through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. At a 6 -month follow-up after the event the patient was asymptomatic. Conclusion. Extrusion via the GI tract <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to be considered as a treatment option for loosened screws. Some improvements could be implemented to prevent such an incident. Furthermore, this case is a fine example that recent preoperative imaging is mandatory before revision surgery for screw loosening...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{on the development}} of gastric mucosal lesions (GMLs) was investigated clinicopathologically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and experimentally in rats treated with NSAIDs. Two hundred and seventy-three patients with RA including 248 patients under NSAIDs therapy were employed in this clinical study. GMLs were classified into two categories, gastritis and/or gastric erosion (GGE) and gastric ulcer (GU). Of 273 patients with RA, GMLs were found in 146 patients, consisting of 90 patients with GGE, 32 patients with GU and 24 patients with both GGE and GU. Frequencies of GMLs were 58 % (143 / 248) in RA patients under NSAIDs therapy and 12 % (3 / 25) in those without NSAIDs, indicating a close association between development of GMLs and treatment with NSAIDs. Interesting- ly, patients under rectal NSAIDs therapy also developed GMLs at an almost the same frequency as those under oral NSAIDs therapy. The development of GMLs was confirmed experimentally in rats given sodium diclofenate intrarectally, suggesting that rectal admin- istration of NSAIDs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent GMLs induced by NSAIDs. On the other hand, the use of NSAIDs prodrugs may reduce the incidence of GMLs. Acidity in gastric juice was increased in patients with GMLs. In NSAIDs-treated rats, H₂ receptor antago- nists (H₂-RAs) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) were both effective in preventing GMLs. In the present clinical observation, PPI was superior to H₂-RAs in healing GU in the patients treated with NSAIDs. The gastric mucosal blood flow measured by laser Doppler flow meter was decreased in RA patients with GU. Multi-variate analysis using Cox's hazard model clarified that healing of GU induced by NSAIDs was influenced by Stein- brocker's class, by location and size of GU, and by medication for GU...|$|E

40|$|Exogenous {{neurotrophin}} {{delivery to}} the deaf cochlea can prevent deafness-induced auditory neuron degeneration, however, we have previously reported that these survival effects are rapidly lost if the treatment stops.

This study investigated the survival-promoting effects of encapsulated BDNF over-expressing Schwann cells on auditory neurons in the deaf guinea pig. In comparison to control (empty) capsules, there was significantly greater auditory neuron survival following the cell-based BDNF treatment.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the airway {{management}} and difficult airway procedures with nine multiple choice questions directed to seventy emergency department staff. Materials and Methods: Nine multiple choice questions were used for the questionnaire. The first five questions were used to define the airway management and the current practices in managing difficult airway and the remaining four were used to define the opinion of participants in particular situations. Results: Seventy participants composed of physicians and allied health care personnel were included in the study. The results showed that emergency physicians were responsible for airway management in 70 % of the emergency departments. However, there was no standard algorithm established in 40 % of the sites. 27 % of participants reported that the bag valve mask ventilation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> due to the risk of aspiration. 95. 7 % of the participants reported that they occasionally need alternative airway devices, however 31. 4 % of them did not have these devices in use.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) {{have the potential to}} provide an unlimited source of cardiomyocytes, which are invaluable resources for drug or toxicology screening, medical research, and cell therapy. Currently a number of obstacles exist such as the insufficient efficiency of differentiation protocols, which should be overcome before hESC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used for clinical applications. Although the differentiation efficiency can be improved by the genetic manipulation of hESCs to over-express cardiac-specific transcription factors, these differentiated cells <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> applied in cell therapy. Protein transduction has been demonstrated as an alternative approach for increasing the efficiency of hESCs differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. METHODS: We present an efficient protocol for the differentiation of hESCs in suspension by direct introduction of a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, Islet 1 (ISL 1) recombinant protein into the cells. RESULTS: We found that the highest beating clusters were derived by continuous treatment of hESCs with 40 µg/ml recombinant ISL 1 protein during days 1 - 8 after the initiation of differentiation. The treatment resulted in up to a 3 -fold {{increase in the number of}} beating areas. In addition, the number of cells that expressed cardiac specific markers (cTnT, CONNEXIN 43, ACTININ, and GATA 4) doubled. This protocol was also reproducible for another hESC line. CONCLUSIONS: This study has presented a new, efficient, and reproducible procedure for cardiomyocytes differentiation. Our results will pave the way for scaled up and controlled differentiation of hESCs to be used for biomedical applications in a bioreactor culture system...|$|R

Three knights are fleeing from the battle, Sir Henry Stafford, Lord Lovel, and Edmund Plantagent, although the latter two <b>are</b> <b>not</b> identified until they split from Stafford and arrive at a church. All three {{are members of the}} defeated Yorkist contingency. With the aid of John de la Poole, the Earl of Lincoln, Lovel and Edumund are involved in spiriting away Richard, Duke of York into the hands of Mynheer Jahn Warbeck, a Flemish moneylender who had previously housed him and pretended that Richard was his deceased son, Perkin Warbeck. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered <b>safe</b> <b>enough</b> for the youth at the present time, so it is arranged for Richard to go with Madeline de Faro, Warbeck's 25-year-old sister. Madeline is married to mariner Hernan de Faro, and the two have a daughter named Monina, and Richard and Monina develop a strong sibling bond, Richard aware he could never marry a commoner. It is she who rescues and nurses him back to health after his first taste of battle in the Granada War.|$|R
