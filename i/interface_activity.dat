40|$|Subduction zone megathrusts {{produce the}} {{majority}} of the world's largest earthquakes. To understand the processes that control seismicity here, it is important to improve our knowledge on the subduction interface characteristics and its spatial variations. Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica, extends the continental landmass ~ 50 km towards the trench, making it a very suitable place to study <b>interface</b> <b>activity</b> from right {{on the top of the}} seismogenic zone of the Middle America Subduction Zone (MASZ). We contribute to and utilize an earthquake catalog of 8765 analyst-picked events to determine the spatial variability in the earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) in this region. After initial detection, magnitude determination and location, the events are precisely relocated using a locally derived 3 -D seismic compressional and shear wave velocity model (DeShon et al., 2006). After restricting the dataset to events nearest the interface and with low formal error (horizontal location error < 5 km), we retain a subset of 3226 events that best resolves <b>interface</b> <b>activity.</b> Beneath Nicoya, we determine the spatial variability and mean FMD of the interface, and focus on the relative relationship of small-to-large earthquakes, termed b-value. Across the region, the overall b-value (1. 18 ± 0. 04) is higher than the global average (b~ 1), and much larger than the global subduction zone average (b~ 0. 6). Significant variation in b-value is observed along the active plate interface. A well resolved zone of lower b is observed at and offshore central Nicoya coast, in a previously determined locked patch using deformation observed from Global Positioning System (GPS). Conversely, high b-values prevail over the subducted portion of the Fisher ridge, which likely ruptured in the 1990 Gulf of Nicoya Mw 7. 0 earthquake. Observed regions of low b-value approximately corresponds to more strongly-locked segments of the subduction interface resulting in higher differential stress, which may be released in the next large interface earthquake in this part of the MASZ. Across the region the b-value is found to vary inversely with the degree of interface locking. Thus, it is proposed that if sufficient data exist, spatial b-value mapping can be used as a proxy to determine interface locking. This method is especially useful along the subduction megathrust, which is generally offshore making geodetic measurements difficult. M. S. Committee Member: Andrew V.

Do different types of pairs interact differently and remember the activity differently? These questions were addressed with a classroom experiment in which 8 year old boy-boy, boy-girl and girl-girl pairs work through the screenpages of a CD-ROM storybook prior to completing a cued-recall comprehension test and a freerecall story writing exercise. During the storybook activity measures of computer interface use and measures of verbal interaction were recorded. Differences between pairs of children were recorded {{in the use of}} the computer interface, and verbal interactions were related to <b>interface</b> <b>activity.</b> The comprehension test delivered no differences between pairs, but the free-recall story writing exercise found superior performance for girls who had previously worked together.

The Koelle-Friedenwald copper thiocholine histochemical method was modified by eliminating the sulfide conversion and by treatment of the tissue with potassium permanganate. In fixed tissue, enzymatic activity was demonstrated on the inner surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear envelope, subsurface cisternae, and agranular reticulum of the perikaryon and axon. In briefly fixed tissue, end product appeared also at the axon-sheath and the sheath-sheath <b>interface.</b> <b>Activity</b> at the synaptic junction was most readily obtained in unfixed tissue. Isolated neurons recovered from the diver following chemical analysis were studied with the electron microscope. Cells having a high enzyme activity showed a badly ruptured or absent neural plasmalemma and sheath. In this case the measured activity was apparently due to the enzyme present in the endoplasmic reticulum. Neurons having low activity exhibited an intact plasmalemma and sheath. This may reflect the effectiveness of the neural plasmalemma and sheath as a penetration barrier. The effects of fixation on enzyme activity are discussed.

40|$|Aim: Serum {{antinuclear}} antibodies (ANA) are occasionally {{noted in}} patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We examined the significance of ANA in NASH. Methods: We compared clinicopathological features {{in patients with}} ANA-positive NASH (n = 35) and ANA-negative NASH (n = 36). Inflammatory cell profiles {{and the distribution of}} oxidative stress markers were also examined immunohistochemically. Results: ANA-positive NASH was significantly associated with female gender (P = 0. 005), high degree of portal inflammation (P = 0. 039), <b>interface</b> <b>activity</b> (P = 0. 036) and hepatocellular ballooning (P = 0. 0008). In addition, ANA of high titer (320 -fold or more) was significantly associated with the histological grade and stage of NASH (P = 0. 02). The degree of steatosis wais rather mild in the high-titer ANA group(P = 0. 01). The analysis of inflammatory cell profiles revealed that CD 3 -positive T cells were predominant and plasma cells were rather few in the portal area and hepatic lobules in both ANA-positive and ANA-negative groups. There was no difference in the distribution of oxidative stress markers between ANA-positive and ANA-negative groups. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the presence of ANA {{may be related to the}} progression of NASH and that a different type of autoimmune mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of NASH with ANA, compared to the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis. © 2007 The Japan Society of Hepatology...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, Division of Information and Communication Sciences, Computing Department, 2008. Bibliography: p. 503 - 514. This study {{investigated}} learning design in a web-conferencing environment based on three semesters of lessons conducted {{as part of}} an introductory programming subject. As well as characterizing the nature of discourse and interaction, the study focused on how the design of the <b>interface,</b> <b>activity</b> and task type affected collaboration and learning. Engeström's (1987) Activity Theory based upon a socio-constructivist view of learning was used to frame the analysis. [...] Interface designs incorporated theory relating to graphical user interface design, multimedia learning, and findings from the cognitive sciences. Activity designs were differentiated based on the degree of student ownership, from teacher-centred (transmissive) approaches, to teacher-led (guided interaction) approaches, to student-centred (collaborative group-work) designs. Types of tasks were considered {{on the basis of their}} level of knowledge (declarative, procedural and conceptual), their character (authenticity, situatedness) and their domain specific nature (in the field of computer science education). The effects of the different <b>interface,</b> <b>activity</b> and task designs on collaboration and mental model formation were explored. [...] A mixed method approach to analysis was adopted, incorporating a design-based research study and a multimodal discourse analysis. The design-based research allowed a broader, more interpretivistic and process focused analysis to be conducted, based on the strategic redesigns that occurred between iterations of the subject. The multimodal discourse analysis enabled more detailed, objective and outcomes based measurements of the subject of discourse, the nature of interactions and the types of modalities used to mediate learning. Triangulating data from the design-based research study and the multimodal discourse analysis provided a more complete description of phenomena and promoted greater reliability. [...] Results include the way in which different modalities afforded different possibilities for representing, and how combinations of those modalities could be effectively integrated by applying multimedia learning principles. Student-centred learning designs increased student involvement, allowing them to take greater ownership over the content and to more fully share their mental models. Authentic, meaningful problem solving tasks promoted greater student engagement. The capacity to dynamically redesign the interface based on the collaborative and cognitive requirements of the learning episode supported more effective implementation of conversational (Laurillard, 2002) approaches to learning. [...] More effective interaction and collaboration resulted from prescribing patterns of engagement, managing activity and technology so that student discourse could focus on content, and providing guidance regarding semiotic representational forms so that students could concentrate on applying those representations rather than inventing them. Teacher and student virtual classroom competencies critically influenced collaboration and learning. [...] Based on the findings in this study, a framework of nine pedagogical patterns for teaching and learning in web-conferencing environments is proposed. The framework provides an integrated approach to learning design that relates the interface design with the activity design and the level of knowledge (task type).

40|$|In infections {{with the}} {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV), {{there is a}} wide spectrum of histological alterations that can affect the liver, from acute hepatitis to mild reactive phenomena to more severe forms, including chronic hepatitis with varying degrees of inflammation/fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In cases of acute hepatitis C, biopsies are rare, pathologists focusing their attention on the chronic form of the disease. The histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis through liver biopsy remains extremely important in the management of patients infected with HCV, since it is the cornerstone of the detection of liver disease caused by the virus as well as the determination of the intensity of this disease. It should therefore be added to the diagnosis of infection made using serologic methods. The basic parameter for the histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis is the presence of portal inflammatory infiltrate, with predominance of lymphocytes, usually with variations in the number of plasmocytes and histiocytes. This inflammation is accompanied by periportal activity of varying degrees (also denominated <b>interface</b> <b>activity</b> or piecemeal necrosis), parenchymal activity (lobular) and fibrosis. There are various classification systems using in the scoring and staging of chronic hepatitis [4, 9, 11, 13, 18, 21, 34]. Many of those systems are of historical importance.

For this reason, the Committee for a Pilot Study on Database Interfaces was charged to review and advise on data <b>interfacing</b> <b>activities.</b> The committee used six case studies (1) to identify and understand the most important problems associated with collecting, integrating, and analyzing environmental data from local to global spatial scales and over a very wide range of temporal scales; and (2) to elaborate the common barriers to interfacing data of disparate sources and types. Consistent with the committee's charge, the primary focus was the interfacing of geophysical and ecological data. The case studies used by the committee were: The Impact Assessment Project for Drought Early Warning in the Sahel, The National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, The H. J.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{dedicated}} to reactive-blending syntheses of stable polymer alloys from polyphenylene ethers (PPE) and styrene copolymers (SAN, ABS). The syntheses decisively depend on the chemical modification of the blending components and on the characterization of the interfaces. Different reactive-blending approaches to connecting phases through chemical modification of the blending components proved to be little successful. Model tests showed that the interface between two amorphous components is the mechanical weak point of the blend even {{in the presence of}} mediators which improve the components' compatibility. The correlations between the structures and mediatory effects of block copolymers and the rheological blending properties were analyzed by means of ternary blends consisting of PPE, SAN and polystyrene-b-polymethyl-methacrylate two-block copolymers. The interaction between <b>interface</b> <b>activity</b> and micelle formation, and the influence of concentrations and molecular weights on the dispersing action of the block copolymer were investigated. Based on the results obtained a new concept for phase mediation in amorphous blends was developed. This concept is based on the use of ABC three-block copolymers whose elastomeric center blocks compensate internal stresses at the interface. The polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-co-butylene) -b-polymethyl-methacrylate three-block copolymers which were synthesized applying a new method impart a dispersing action and lead to a surprising increase in the viscosity of PPE/SAN blends.

40|$|BackgroundUntreated {{autoimmune}} hepatitis (AIH) can develop into liver cirrhosis, with potentially fatal outcomes. Viral hepatitis in children was endemic in Taiwan before universal hepatitis B vaccination, but AIH {{has rarely been}} reported in Taiwanese children. We performed this retrospective study to characterize the clinical features of AIH in Taiwanese children. MethodsWe enrolled children with AIH, based on the revised scoring system of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) from 383 children hospitalized with hepatitis from January 2000 to April 2008. Other etiologies of hepatitis were excluded. ResultsThere were three definite and six probable AIH cases. The incidence of AIH among children hospitalized with hepatitis was 2. 3 %. Eight children had other autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (6), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) (1), and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (1). Another had biliary atresia, and AIH developed after cadaveric liver transplantation. Antinuclear antibodies ranged from 1 : 160 - 1 : 2560. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 546 ± 188 U/L (mean ± SD). Jaundice occurred in four patients. Liver histology in the three definite AIH patients showed chronic hepatitis with predominantly lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in portal areas, with prominent <b>interface</b> <b>activity.</b> Treatment included prednisolone, azathioprine, and/or cyclosporine.
