25|$|It {{was in the}} {{interests}} of the British to <b>keep</b> <b>US</b> citizens aware of German actions and attitudes. One over-enthusiastic propagandist's fabricated story was circulated that in some regions of Germany, schoolchildren were given a holiday to celebrate the sinking of the Lusitania. This story was based on the popular reception given the Goetz medal (see below) and was so effective that James W. Gerard, the US ambassador to Germany, recounted it being told in his memoir of his time in Germany, Face to Face with Kaiserism (1918), though without vouching for its validity.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E

25|$|Eventually the U.S. and British {{political}} leadership reached a compromise {{in which both}} would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was Franklin D. Roosevelt's desire to <b>keep</b> <b>US</b> troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction {{to the idea of}} eliminating Italy from the war. It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict, or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it. The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the Royal Navy, to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt, the Far East, the Middle East and India. Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the Eastern Front to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the Soviets.|$|E
500|$|Recording a {{new album}} was, {{according}} to Robert, a [...] "natural progression" [...] after the band began playing together again. [...] "The thing that kind of introduces us back together is all those memories of the songs, and once you start playing those songs... it always takes us back to... 18 years now. It can {{take us back to}} our past and think about where we were when we were writing these songs, and that's a bond, I think, [...] will always <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> together as four people.... It just progressed into, 'Maybe it's time to make a new record.|$|E

In the accompanying quote, Beyoncé said: [...] "I try to write songs that will {{bring out the best}} in all of us and <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> close together.

500|$|McCain {{voted against}} a 1983 {{resolution}} allowing President Reagan to <b>keep</b> <b>U.S.</b> Marines deployed {{as part of}} the Multinational Force in Lebanon, on the grounds that he [...] " [...] not foresee obtainable objectives in Lebanon." [...] After the catastrophic Beirut barracks bombing a month later, this stance against his party and president gained him national media exposure and started his reputation as a political maverick. [...] McCain sided with Newt Gingrich's group of young conservatives in some of their battles against the House Democratic leadership, but declined to join Gingrich's Conservative Opportunity Society. [...] McCain felt personal affection for Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and established good relations with some Democrats in the House, such as Paul Simon and especially Mo Udall.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} favorable reviews. Brad Trechak of the TV Squad said of {{the episode}}: [...] "In the end, the episode was really good {{at the beginning and}} the ending, but the middle kind of dragged." [...] Eric Hochburger of TV Fanatic criticized the Mike Scioscia cameo, although he said that [...] "hile this week's installment will never replace our favorite Simpsons baseball episode, [...] "Homer at the Bat," [...] there [...] certainly plenty of great jokes and a strong enough story with heart to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> entertained." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club compared the episode favorably to [...] "Lisa on Ice" [...] although he also criticized the Scioscia cameo, calling it [...] "awkward". In conclusion he gave the episode an A-, the best grade of the night.|$|E

500|$|Director Tom Hooper {{lets his}} actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by music critics. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the song {{four out of}} five stars and stated, [...] "Quiet storm gets a freaky sci-fi makeover". Pitchfork Media's Carrie Battan commended Usher's collaboration with Diplo as [...] "a doubly satisfying departure from their respective strains of club-ready fare." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called the song [...] "an ode to the bewildering thoughts and feelings of relationship purgatory" [...] and wrote that it is [...] "a sound that Usher should explore more often." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin felt that the song is [...] "as vividly communicative as it is decoratively beautiful" [...] and praised its articulation, calling it [...] "a tour de force of pacing and dynamics, giving listeners more and more, but then always easing up just enough to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> begging for one more verse." ...|$|E

With {{the appearance of}} Abby, things really started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling.

500|$|He {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP polled 943,598votes (6.2%), gaining two MEPs. Griffin and fellow MEP Andrew Brons were {{subsequently}} pelted with eggs as they attempted to stage a celebratory press conference outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venue– a public house near Manchester– was chosen the following day. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted [...] "No platform for Nazi Nick" [...] and [...] "Nazi scum off our streets". Griffin viewed the election as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. [...] "In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> out. To triumph against that level of pressure as a political party has never been done before." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyril Connolly, {{reviewing}} You Only Live Twice in The Sunday Times {{wrote that}} Fleming's latest book was [...] "reactionary, sentimental, square, the Bond-image flails {{its way through}} the middle-brow masses, a relaxation to the great, a stimulus to the humble, the only common denominator between Kennedy and Oswald". The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that [...] "as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really get going until more than half way through". In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, [...] "though Mr. Fleming's macabre imagination is as interesting as ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone". Dealing with the cliffhanger ending to the story, the reviewer wrote that [...] "Mr. Fleming would <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> on tenterhooks, but at this rate of going even his most devoted admirers will free themselves before very long." ...|$|E

The Alcorn family publicly requested that they be given privacy to grieve in a statement issued by the Kings Local School District. In that statement, staff from Alcorn's former school, Kings High School, declared that [...] "Joshua Alcorn was a sweet, talented, tender-hearted 17-year-old", adding that counselors would be made available to students affected by the incident.

500|$|The {{libretto}} {{was written}} by the court poet, Salomon Franck, and published in [...] in 1715. The opening refers to Jesus' words in John 3:5: [...] "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." [...] (...) The second movement, a recitative, reflects upon birth in the Spirit as baptism through God's grace: [...] "" [...] (In the bath of spirit and water he becomes a child of blessedness and grace).

The cantata concludes with the fifth stanza of Ludwig Helmbold's hymn of 1575, [...] "", mentioning scripture, baptism and the Eucharist.

We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
