40|$|Abstract—The {{establishment}} of help desk {{is to provide}} technical support to users when they encounter technical problems related to hardware, software, application programs and network connections. However, due to resources problem, in particular the lack of help desk staff, users often {{have to wait for}} a considerably long time before their enquiries and problems are answered and solved. To relieve user’s dissatisfaction, academic researchers and help desk practitioners has started to encourage users to exploit online resources. Instead of contacting help desk, user can access online knowledge resources, such as knowledge base, to look for information that is useful to resolve their existing difficulties. A significant number of knowledge bases are designed to support “keyword search ” and FAQ as the <b>front</b> end <b>user</b> interface, but both designs have their disadvantages. This paper investigates the application of ontology and software agent technology to develop a dynamic user interface. This interface is designed to replace “keyword search ” and FAQ as the <b>front</b> end <b>user</b> interface of the online knowledge base...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} a new omni-directional wheelchair for handicapped persons {{working in the}} office. We consider that fully holonomic motion is not necessary. Thus, the developed omni-directional wheelchair has two omni-wheels for rear wheels and two casters for <b>front.</b> <b>Users</b> move by grasping desks, bookshelves and other furniture, for moving in a small area near the desk in the office, with this omni-directional wheelchair. In other places, for transferring passageways, users drive by both-hands or electric motor. To investigate {{the effects of the}} developed omni wheelchair, the time required to move 1 〔m〕 lateral side were measured ten times. The results were 11. 6 ± 0. 7 sec (standard wheelchair), 7. 1 ± 0. 5 sec (omni wheelchair), and 4. 6 ± 0. 3 sec (caster shair). Omni-directional wheelchair reduces the time about 39 % compared with the standard wheelchair. There was a significant difference (p< 0. 001) between these two groups, and these results suggested that the omni^directional wheelchair was practical for handicapped people in office works...|$|R
