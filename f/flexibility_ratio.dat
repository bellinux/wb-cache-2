40|$|In this exploratory, {{empirical}} {{study of}} modernizing durable goods plants, {{it was found}} that typical measures of flexibility (e. g., number of unique parts and part families) are independent. More importantly, plants and firms with greater strategic manufacturing focus, regardless of specific emphasis (e. g., cost or quality), scheduled fewer part numbers on new flexible automation systems. This suggests that product focus and strategic focus are related in plants producing discrete parts. When flexibility is emphasized as a strategic manufacturing focus, new automation systems are significantly more likely to have shorter change-over times per part family. In general, part family-changeover time ratios appear to have the greatest potential of measures evaluated for building a useful theory of flexibility in discrete parts manufacturing. An evaluation of changes made in part types and part families during the implementation period showed that product flexibility is pursued as a way to reduce high labor costs in manufacturing. These plants accomplished this end by increasing the number of parts scheduled on new systems. Implications for strategic management of flexibility and scope are presented. <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratios,</b> manufacturing strategy, <b>flexibility,</b> agile manufacturing...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of sealing components on the rotordynamic stability of turbomachinery {{has become a}} key topic because {{the oil and gas}} market is increasingly demanding high rotational speeds and high efficiency. This leads the turbomachinery manufacturers to design higher <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratios</b> and to reduce the clearance of the seals. Accurate prediction of the effective damping of seals is critical to avoid instability problems; in recent years, ‘‘negative-swirl” swirl brakes have been used to reverse the circumferential direction of the inlet flow, which changes the sign of the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients and generates stabilizing forces. Experimental tests for a teeth-on-stator labyrinth seal were performed by manufacturers with positive and negative pre-swirl values to investigate the pre-swirl effect on the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient. Those results are used as a benchmark in this paper. To analyse the rotor-fluid interaction in the seals, the bulkflow numeric approach is more time efficient than computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Although the accuracy of the coefficients prediction in bulk-flow models is satisfactory for liquid phase application, the accuracy of the results strongly depends on the operating conditions {{in the case of the}} gas phase. In this paper, the authors propose an improvement in the state-of-the-art bulk-flow model by introducing the effect of the energy equation in the zeroth-order solution to better characterize real gas properties due to the enthalpy variation along the seal cavities. The consideration of the energy equation allows for a better estimation of the coefficients in the case of a negative pre-swirl ratio, therefore, it extend the prediction fidelity over a wide range of operating conditions.

Two different polystyrene materials were utilized as deformable inclusions. Lateral dynamic earth pressures and wall displacements at different elevations of the retaining wall model were monitored during the tests. The earth pressures and displacements of the retaining walls with deformable inclusions were {{compared with those of}} the models without geofoam inclusions. Comparisons indicated that geofoam panels of low stiffness installed against the retaining wall model affect displacement and dynamic lateral pressure profile along the wall height. Depending on the inclusion characteristics and the wall flexibility, up to 50 % reduction in dynamic earth pressures was observed. The efficiency of load and displacement reduction decreased as the <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio</b> of the wall model increased. On the other hand, dynamic load reduction efficiency of the deformable inclusion increased as the amplitude and frequency ratio of the seismic excitation increased. Relative flexibility of the deformable layer (the thickness and the elastic stiffness of the polystyrene material) {{played an important role in}} the amount of load reduction. Dynamic earth pressure coefficients were compared with those calculated with an analytical approach. Pressure coefficients calculated with this method were found to be in good agreement with {{the results of}} the tests performed on the wall model having low <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio.</b> It was observed that deformable inclusions reduce residual wall stresses observed at the end of seismic excitation thus contributing to the post-earthquake stability of the retaining wall.

The explored methods include geometric localisation, mask fitting, forward modeling, polarisation ratio and local correlation tracking plus triangulation. The five methods are applied to the same CME event, which occurred on August 7 2010. Their corresponding results are presented and compared, especially in their propagation direction and spatial extent in 3 D. We find that mask fitting and geometric localisation method produce consistent results. Reconstructions including three-view observations are more precise than reconstructions done with only two views. Compared to the forward modeling method, in which a-priori shape of the CME geometry is assumed, mask fitting has more <b>flexibility.</b> Polarisation <b>ratio</b> method makes use of the Thomson scattering geometry. We find spatially the 3 D CME derived from mask fitting lies mostly in the overlap region obtained with the polarisation method from COR 2 A and B. In addition, mask fitting can help resolve the front/back ambiguity inherent in the polarisation ratio method. However, local correlation tracking plus triangulation did not show a consistent result with the other four methods.

The main objective of the present study is to assess the performance of a family house with a volume of 326. 7 m 3 and a net floor area of 121 m 2, located in the city of Izmir, Turkey in terms of energetic, exergetic and sustainability aspects. The indoor and exterior air temperatures are taken as 20 °C and 1 °C, respectively. In the analysis and assessment, various metrics (indices or indicators) such as exergetic efficiency, exergy <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio</b> and sustainability index are utilized. Two heating options (Case 1 : condensing boiler and Case 2 : air heat pump) are considered for comparison purposes. The total heat loss rate of the family house is determined to be 3770. 72 W. The overall energy efficiencies of the studied cases are calculated to be 49. 4 % for Case 1 and 54. 7 % for Case 2.

A comparison of the two composites in terms of mechanical properties is made and the results are tabulated. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional dynamic {{numerical}} analyses {{have been}} conducted, using FLAC 7. 0, {{to evaluate the}} seismic response of underground structures located far from the seismic source, placed in either linear-elastic or nonlinear elastoplastic ground. The interaction between the ground and deep circular tunnels with a tied interface is considered. For the simulations, {{it is assumed that}} the liner remains in its elastic regime, and plane strain conditions apply to any cross section perpendicular to the tunnel axis. An elastoplastic constitutive model is implemented in FLAC to simulate the nonlinear ground. The effect of input frequency and relative stiffness between the liner and the ground, on the seismic response of tunnels, is evaluated. The response is studied in terms of distortions normalized with respect to those of the free field, and load demand (axial forces and bending moments) in the liner. In all cases, i. e. for linear-elastic and nonlinear ground models, the results show negligible effect of the input frequency on the distortions of the cross section, for input frequencies smaller than 5  Hz; that is for ratios between the wave length and the tunnel opening (λ/D) larger than ten for linear-elastic and nine for nonlinear ground. Larger normalized distortions are obtained for the nonlinear than for the linear-elastic ground, for the same relative stiffness, with differences increasing as the tunnel becomes more flexible, or when the amplitude of the dynamic input shear stress increases. It has been found that normalized distortions for the nonlinear ground do not follow a unique relationship, as it happens for the linear-elastic ground, but increase as the amplitude of the dynamic input increases. The loading in the liner decreases as the structure becomes more flexible with respect to the ground, and is smaller for a tunnel placed in a stiffer nonlinear ground than in a softer nonlinear ground, for the same <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
40|$|Loops {{connecting}} the transmembrane (TM) α-helices in membrane proteins {{are expected to}} affect the structural organization of the thereby connected helices and the helical bundles as a whole. This effect, which has been largely ignored previously, is studied here by analyzing the x-ray structures of 41 α-helical membrane proteins. First we define the loop <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio,</b> R, and find that 53 % of the loops are stretched, where a stretched loop constrains {{the distance between the}} two connected helices. The significance of this constraining effect is supported by experiments carried out with bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin, in which cutting or eliminating their (predominately stretched) loops has led to a decrease in protein stability, and for rhodopsin, in most cases, also to the destruction of the structure. We show that for nonstretched loops in the extramembranous regions, the fraction of hydrophobic residues is comparable to that for soluble proteins; furthermore (as is also the case for soluble proteins), the hydrophobic residues in these regions are preferentially buried. This is expected to lead to the compact structural organization of the loops, which is transferred to the TM helices, causing them to assemble. We argue that a soluble protein complexed with a membrane protein similarly promotes compactness; other properties of such complexes are also studied. We calculate complementary attractive interactions between helices, including hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions of sequential motifs, such as GXXXG. The relative and combined effects of all these factors on the association of the TM helices are discussed and protein structures with only a few of these factors are analyzed. Our study emphasizes the need for classifying membrane proteins into groups according to structural organization. This classification should be considered when procedures for structural analysis or prediction are developed and applied. Detailed analysis of each structure is provided at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} on anatomical structures of pretreated large (betung) bamboo (Dendrocalamusasper) using single culture of white-rot fungi has been investigated, which {{revealed that the}} pretreatment caused the decrease in the Runkel ratioas well as the coefficient rigidity {{and the increase in}} the <b>flexibility</b> <b>ratio</b> of their corresponding bamboo fibers. However, there is no study reported on the anatomical structure changes of them caused by pretreatment using mixed culture of white-rot fungi. This paper reports the results of the {{research on}} paper/pulp quality after different treatments. Pretreatment that used Trametes versicolor fungi and lasted for 45 days inflicted intensive fiber damages compared with those of untreated bamboo (control). Fresh and barkless large (betung) bamboo chips of 2 year's old, and 1. 6 cm in length, were inoculated by 10 % of mixed culture of white-rot fungi inoculums stock for 30 and 45 days in room temperature. There were four treatment groups of mixed culture, i. e T. versi color and P. ostreatus (TVPO); P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium (POPC); P. chrysosporium and T. versi color (PCTV); and P. chrysosporium, T. versicolorand P. ostreatus (TVPCPO). After the inoculation period, the chips weremacerated into separate fibers using Scultze method to analyze the fiber dimension and its derived values. The fibers were then observed regarding their macro and microscopic structures by optical microscope. Mixed culture pretreatment of white-rot fungi accelerated improvement of fiber morphology and fiber derived value characteristics, except for Muhlsteph ratio. The fiber derived values oftreated bamboo tended to improve compared to those of untreated bamboo, there by requiring milder pulping conditions. Accordingly, the treated bamboo would indicatively produce a good quality pulp (grade I) based on FAO and LPHH (Forest Product Research Report) requirements. Co-culture treatment using P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus for 45 days produced the best fiber dimension and its derived value properties. The fungi hypae colonized on the surface area of bamboo followed by mycelium penetration into substrate (bamboo-inner structure). The partial degradation caused by delignification indicatively attributed to the fungi activity was shown in the macroscopic images...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variations of the phytoplanktonic C:N ratio in an oceanic basin {{and its impact on}} primary production are described from 3 D bio-physical modelling. A simple marine ecosystem model with variable phytoplanktonic C:N ratio (cell-quota model) is coupled to a 3 D eddy-resolving model representing a double gyre circulation at basin-scale. The results are compared with those obtained with constant C:N ratio (Redfield model) in the same configuration. Realistic values of C:N ratios for phytoplankton and production are simulated, with mesoscale, seasonal, and zonal variations, and are in agreement with previous in situ measurements. Various metrics are used to describe the {{spatial and temporal}} scales of variability if the phytoplanktonic C:N ratio. Our main result is that taking into account phytoplanktonic plasticity through a variable C:N <b>ratio</b> (<b>flexibility)</b> smoothes the spatial and temporal variability of both phytoplankton concentration and primary production compared to Redfield model (damping effect). Especially, production is increased in the southern low-productive oligotrophic gyre and decreased in the northern high-productive gyre (of + 39 % and - 34 %, respectively, for the production in carbon) ...|$|R
40|$|Background HIV-infected {{individuals}} {{continue to}} experience neurocognitive deterioration despite virologically successful treatments. The causes of neurocognitive impairment are still unclear. However, several {{factors have been}} suggested including the role of genetics. There is evidence suggesting that neurocognitive impairment is heritable and individual differences in cognition are strongly driven by genetic variations. The contribution of genetic variants affecting the metabolism and activity of dopamine may influence these individual differences. Methods The present study explored the relationship between two candidate genes (DRD 4 and DRD 2) and neurocognitive performance in HIV-infected adults. A total of 267 HIV-infected adults were genotyped for polymorphisms, DRD 4 48 bp-variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), DRD 2 rs 6277 and ANKK 1 rs 1800497. The Short Category (SCT), Color Trail (CTT) and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Tests (ROCT) were used to measure executive function and memory. Results Results showed significant associations with the SNP rs 6277 and impaired executive function (odds ratio = 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 6; p = 0. 004) and cognitive <b>flexibility</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> = 1. 6, 95 % CI 2. 0 – 5. 7; p = 0. 001). The results were further stratified by race and sex and significant results were seen in males (odds ratio = 3. 5, 95 % CI 1. 5 – 5. 5; p = 0. 008) and in African Americans (odds ratio = 3. 1, 95 % CI 2. 3 – 3. 5; p = 0. 01). Also, DRD 4 VNTR 7 -allele {{was significantly associated with}} executive dysfunction. Conclusion The study shows that genetically determined differences in the SNP rs 6277 DRD 2 gene and DRD 4 48 bp VNTR may be risk factors for deficits in executive function and cognitive flexibility...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} sand pine (Pinus clausa) seedlings {{in relation to the}} locations of hardwoods and palmettos that had resprouted in five recently clear-cut and one burned stand in sand pine scrub vegetation in Ocala National Forest (Florida, USA). We also studied how the shade and mechanical support provided by the taller resprouts affect the allometry and biomechanics of sand pine seedling stems. Although soil surface temperatures were higher and soil moisture contents (0 – 5 cm) were lower in open than in covered microsites, sand pine seedling densities did not vary in relation to proximity to resprouted hardwoods and palmettos. There was no apparent nurse plant effect on sand pine seedling distributions, but seedlings that grew up under the resprouts had larger whole stem <b>flexibilities,</b> greater height:diameter <b>ratios,</b> and less tapered stems. In response to the mechanical support and shade of neighboring plants, sand pine seedlings grow taller per unit investment in stem tissue, thereby shortening the period during which they presumably suffer from above-ground competition. This biomechanical plasticity increases the rates at which sand pine seedlings can overtop their resprouted competitors...|$|R
