25|$|Changes in {{chromosome}} number may involve even larger mutations, where {{segments of the}} DNA within chromosomes break and then rearrange. For example, in the <b>Homininae,</b> two chromosomes fused to produce human chromosome 2; this fusion did not occur in the lineage of the other apes, and they retain these separate chromosomes. In evolution, the most important role of such chromosomal rearrangements may be to accelerate the divergence of a population into new species by making populations less likely to interbreed, thereby preserving genetic differences between these populations.|$|E
25|$|The genus Pan {{is part of}} the {{subfamily}} <b>Homininae,</b> {{to which}} humans also belong. The lineages of chimpanzees and humans separated in a drawn-out process of speciation over the period of roughly between twelve and five million years ago, making them humanity's closest living relative. Research by Mary-Claire King in 1973 found 99% identical DNA between human beings and chimpanzees. For some time, research modified that finding to about 94% commonality, with some of the difference occurring in noncoding DNA, but more recent knowledge states the difference in DNA between humans, chimpanzees and bonobos at just about 1%–1.2% again.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of gorillas {{are the other}} two <b>Homininae</b> genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago. Human gene sequences differ only 1.6% on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes, but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has. Until recently, gorillas {{were considered to be}} a single species, with three subspecies: the western lowland gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. There is now agreement that there are two species, each with two subspecies. More recently, a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species. The separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the Ice Age, when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each other.|$|E
50|$|John Edward Gray (1825) was {{an early}} {{advocate}} of classifying taxa by designating tribes and families. Wood and Richmond (2000) proposed that Hominini ("hominins") be designated as a tribe that comprised all species of early humans and pre-humans ancestral to humans back to after the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor; and that <b>Hominina</b> be designated a subtribe of Hominini to include only the genus Homo—that is, not including the earlier upright walking hominins of the Pliocene such as Australopithecus, Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus, or Sahelanthropus. Designations alternative to <b>Hominina</b> existed, or were offered: Australopithecinae (Gregory & Hellman 1939) and Preanthropinae (Cela-Conde & Altaba 2002); and later, Cela-Conde and Ayala (2003) proposed that the four genera Australopithecus, Ardipithecus, Praeanthropus, and Sahelanthropus be grouped with Homo within <b>Hominina.</b>|$|R

5000|$|For each clade it is {{indicated}} approximately when newer extant clades emerged. Some (older) texts will refer to Homonini as the <b>Hominina</b> branch.

500|$|About 500 {{million years}} ago, plants and fungi colonised {{the land and}} were soon {{followed}} by arthropods and other animals. Insects were particularly successful and even today make {{up the majority of}} animal species. Amphibians first appeared around 364 million years ago, followed by early amniotes and birds around 155 million years ago (both from [...] "reptile"-like lineages), mammals around 129 million years ago, <b>homininae</b> around 10 million years ago and modern humans around 250,000 years ago. However, despite the evolution of these large animals, smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the Earth, with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{studies of}} 4.4 {{million years old}} [...] Ardipithecus ramidus suggest bipedalism, it is thus {{possible}} that bipedalism evolved very early in <b>homininae</b> and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. According to Richard Dawkins in his book [...] "The Ancestor's Tale", [...] chimps and bonobos are descended from Australopithecus gracile type species while gorillas are descended from Paranthropus. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins. Early homininaes such as Ardipithecus ramidus may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas and towards efficient walking and running in modern humans (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of Neanderthal extinction was a less efficient running.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a gradual {{increase}} in brain volume as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the human timeline of evolution (see <b>Homininae),</b> starting from about 600cm3 in Homo habilis up to 1736cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Thus, in general there is a correlation between brain volume and intelligence. However, modern Homo sapiens have a smaller brain volume (brain size 1250cm3) than neanderthals; women have a brain volume slightly smaller than men, and the Flores hominids (Homo floresiensis), nicknamed [...] "hobbits", had a cranial capacity of about [...] 380cm3, {{about a third of}} the Homo erectus average and considered small for a chimpanzee. It is proposed that they evolved from H. erectus as a case of insular dwarfism. In spite of their threefold smaller brain there is evidence that H. floresiensis used fire and made stone tools as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestor, H. erectus. Iain Davidson summarizes the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size as [...] "As large as you need and as small as you can".|$|E
50|$|This {{cladogram}} {{shows the}} clade of superfamily Hominoidea and its descendent clades; it features the hominids, {{which is the}} family Hominidae. The hominids comprise the orangutans, gorillas, and the clade of the tribe Hominini—which groups the subtribe Panina (chimpanzees), the extinct subtribe Australopithecina (australopithicenes), and the subtribe <b>Hominina</b> (humans).|$|R
50|$|In the {{proposal}} of Mann and Weiss (1996), the tribe Hominini includes Pan {{as well as}} Homo, but within separate subtribes.

The early Hominini split further, separating the line to Homo from the lineage of Pan. Currently, tribe Hominini designates the subtribes Hominina, containing genus Homo; Panina, genus Pan; and Australopithecina, with several extinct genera—the subtribes are not labelled on this chart.|$|E
25|$|Modern humans (Homo sapiens, {{primarily}} ssp.

5000|$|Pongidae, or the Pongids, is an {{obsolete}} primate taxon {{containing the}} gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. They are sometimes called [...] "great apes". Pongidae {{is now known}} to be paraphyletic. Pongids gave rise to <b>Hominina</b> around seven mya. The corresponding crown group for this taxon is Hominidae. Pongidae has six extant member species. This taxon is rarely used today but is of historical significance.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, orangutans are {{a sister}} group to <b>Homininae</b> {{and are the}} basal genus in the family as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1980, {{the family}} (and term) Hominidae meant humans only; the {{non-human}} great apes {{were assigned to}} the family Pongidae. Later discoveries led to revised classifications, with the great apes then united with humans (now in subfamily <b>Homininae)</b> as members of family Hominidae [...] Further discoveries indicated that gorillas and chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than they are to orangutans, leading to their (gorillas and chimpanzees) placement in subfamily <b>Homininae</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} <b>Homininae</b> can {{be further}} subdivided into three branches: the tribe Gorillini (gorillas), and the tribe Hominini with subtribes Panina (chimpanzees) and Hominina (humans and their extinct relatives). The Late Miocene fossil Nakalipithecus nakayamai, described in 2007, is a basal member of this clade, as is, perhaps, its contemporary Ouranopithecus; that is, they are not assignable {{to any of the}} three extant branches. Their existence suggests that the <b>Homininae</b> tribes diverged not earlier than about 8 million years ago (see Human evolutionary genetics).|$|E
5000|$|The Hominini is a taxonomical {{tribe of}} the {{subfamily}} Homininae; it comprises three subtribes: <b>Hominina,</b> with its one genus Homo; Australopithecina, comprising {{at least three}} extinct (or, fossil) genera (see inset at bottom right); and Panina, with its one genus Pan, the chimpanzees (see the evolutionary tree below). Members of the human clade, that is, the subtribe <b>Hominina,</b> include only the genus Homo; it is the [...] "human" [...] branch as depicted in an evolutionary tree chart (see below). Over the past several decades, a broad community of scientists and scholars have adopted the term [...] "hominins" [...] to emphasize the history of proto-humans speciating from the stem chimpanzees—which process began about eight million years ago; see chimpanzee-human last common ancestor (CHLCA). Thus, the genus Homo and those species of the australopithecines that arose after the split from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees are called [...] "hominins". Not all hominins {{are directly related to}} the emergence of early Homo.|$|R
5000|$|The scientist/ scholar {{community}} has not reached a consensus regarding a taxon for the (probable) ancestral stem between the subtribes <b>Hominina</b> and Australopithecina—hence the blank space (*) after the tribe-label [...] "Hominini". However, the {{community has}} informally adopted a name to refer to humans and their closest biological relatives. These comprise the several Homo genera—only {{one of which is}} not extinct—plus those australopithecines that rose after the splitting of the lineage of chimpanzees from the last common ancestor(s) (LCA). These humans and australopithecines collectively are called hominins.|$|R
500|$|Half {{a million}} years ago and 50 light-years from Earth, {{a star in the}} {{constellation}} Draco [...] turns supernova, and the star's remnant becomes a neutron star. The radiation from the explosion causes mutations in many Earth organisms, including a group of <b>hominina</b> that become the ancestors of Homo sapiens. The star's short-lived plasma jets are lop-sided because of anomalies in its magnetic field, and set it on a course passing within 250astronomical units of the Sun. In 2020 AD, human astronomers detect the neutron star, call it [...] "Dragon's Egg", and in 2050 they send an expedition to explore it.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{importance of}} Nakalipithecus is twofold: first, together with Ouranopithecus it provides evidence that current <b>Homininae</b> lineages (gorillas, chimpanzees, humans) diverged {{from a common}} ancestor not before about 8 million years ago. Second, it supports {{the theory that the}} closest relatives of humans evolved in Africa. The competing view—that modern-type Great Apes went extinct in Africa and that the <b>Homininae</b> were originally an Asian lineage which only later recolonized Africa—is hard to reconcile with the early Late Miocene presence of a basal hominine in Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{volume of}} the human braincase has {{increased}} as humans have evolved (see <b>Homininae),</b> starting from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis up to 1600 cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis, which was the hominid with the biggest brain size.|$|E
5000|$|Many paleoanthropologists {{propose that}} the Homo line derives from A. africanus; in this view {{it might be better}} to place Selam in the A. africanus line, since it has more human traits than most A. afarensis (see <b>Homininae).</b>|$|E
50|$|Mann and Weiss (1996), {{proposed}} that the tribe Hominini should encompass Pan as well as Homo, but grouped within separate subtribes. They would classify Homo and all bipedal apes to the subtribe <b>Hominina</b> and Pan to the subtribe Panina. (Wood (2010) discusses the different views of this taxonomy.) Richard Wrangham (2001) argued that the CHLCA species was very similar to chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) — {{so much so that}} it should be classified {{as a member of the}} Pan genus and be given the taxonomic name Pan prior. To date, no fossil has been identified as a potential candidate for the CHLCA or the taxon Pan prior.|$|R
40|$|Alu {{elements}} have {{inserted in}} primate genomes throughout {{the evolution of}} the order.

This study represents the first conclusive application of short interspersed elements, which are considered nearly homoplasy-free, to elucidate the phylogeny of hominids. Phylogenetic analysis of Alu Ye 5 elements and elements from several other subfamilies reveals high levels of support for monophyly of Hominidae, tribe Hominini and subtribe <b>Hominina.</b> Here we present the strongest evidence reported to date for a sister relationship between humans and chimpanzees while clearly distinguishing the chimpanzee and human lineages...|$|R
50|$|Two of the skulls—D2700, {{with a brain}} {{volume of}} , and D4500 or Dmanisi Skull 5, with a brain volume of about 546 centimetres—present the two {{smallest}} and most primitive <b>Hominina</b> skulls from the Pleistocene period. The variation in these skulls were compared to variations in modern humans and within a sample group of chimpanzees. The researchers found that, despite appearances, the variations in the Dmanisi skulls were no greater than those seen among modern people and among chimpanzees. These findings suggest that previous fossil finds that were classified as different species {{on the basis of}} the large morphological variation among them—including Homo rudolfensis, Homo gautengensis, H. ergaster, and potentially even H. habilis—should perhaps be re-classified to the same lineage as Homo erectus.|$|R

5000|$|In 1871 {{there were}} hardly any human fossils of ancient hominins available. Almost fifty years later, Darwin's {{speculation}} was supported when anthropologists began finding fossils of ancient small-brained hominins {{in several areas}} of Africa (list of <b>hominina</b> fossils). The hypothesis of recent (as opposed to archaic) African origin developed in the 20th century. The [...] "Recent African origin" [...] of modern humans means [...] "single origin" [...] (monogenism) and {{has been used in}} various contexts as an antonym to polygenism. The debate in anthropology had swung in favour of monogenism by the mid-20th century. Isolated proponents of polygenism held forth in the mid-20th century, such as Carleton Coon, who thought as late as 1962 that H. sapiens arose five times from H. erectus in five places.|$|R
5000|$|Homo is {{the genus}} that {{comprises}} the species Homo sapiens, which includes modern humans, {{as well as}} several extinct species classified as ancestral to or closely related to modern humans, most notably Homo erectus.The genus is between 2 and 3 million years old, taken to emerge with the appearance of Homo habilis and possibly that of Homo gautengensis. [...] Homo is derived from the genus Australopithecus, which itself had previously split from the lineage of Pan, the chimpanzees.Taxonomically, Homo is the only genus assigned to the subtribe <b>Hominina</b> which, with the subtribes Australopithecina and Panina, comprise the tribe Hominini (see evolutionary tree below). All species of the genus Homo plus those species of the australopithecines that arose after the split from Pan are called hominins.|$|R
50|$|These {{environmental}} pressures caused selection to favor bipedalism: walking on hind legs. This gave the Homininae's eyes greater elevation, {{the ability to}} see approaching danger further off, and a more efficient means of locomotion. It also freed the arms from the task of walking and made the hands available for tasks such as gathering food. At some point the bipedal primates developed handedness, giving them the ability to pick up sticks, bones and stones and use them as weapons, or as tools for tasks such as killing smaller animals, cracking nuts, or cutting up carcasses. In other words, these primates developed the use of primitive technology. Bipedal tool-using primates form the <b>Hominina</b> subtribe, of which the earliest species, such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis, date to about 7 to 5 million years ago.|$|R
