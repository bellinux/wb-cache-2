40|$|The European {{legislative}} framework of cross-border mergers {{is a result}} of a long process of identifying the needs of the common market, domestic laws and national businesses and bringing them closer together. From virtual impossibility of merging across national borders, to a transfer of seat, to the Cross-Border Mergers Directive private and public limited companies can now engage in a cross-border merger transaction under best harmonised rules to date. However, the diversity of national company laws leaves gaps that are not resolved on a European level - there is no harmonising instrument in the area of creditor protection and the protection of dissenting minority shareholders, among others. The CBM Directive contains a <b>framework</b> <b>provision</b> referencing the need of protection of minority members, whereas specific mechanisms are left for the Member States to implement. The question that arises is whether the status quo of minority protection is sufficient to ensure smooth functioning of the cross-border mergers framework or whether further harmonisation is required...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{conclusion}} of contracts between entrepreneurs under the Czech Civil Code, it is a relatively common arrangement that the parties disclaim any and all liability for damage arising from non-compliance with contractual obligations, if they can prove that this failure was due to an obstacle independent of their will. This circumstance excluding liability for the damage is called force majeure by the theory. In many countries this circumstance is ruled upon directly by the legislation (höhere Gewalt, vis major). The Czech regulations represented by the new Civil Code of 2012 (CivC), however, contains only a <b>framework</b> <b>provision</b> that mentions discharging reasons. The paper deals with the – rather disputable – issue that the force majeure does not affect the obligation to pay a contractual penalty under the new rules of the CivC. It should be therefore reflected in the arrangements for contractual penalties inter partes. To this effect the paper analyses the concepts of contractual penalties and force majeure in civil law legislation. Afterwards it compares their mutual relationship and impact on the obligations of the Contracting Parties. Finally, it draws recommendations for practice {{from the perspective of the}} contracting process...|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{violence}} is New Zealand’s most significant human rights failing {{according to the}} 2014 Universal Periodic Review on Human Rights. Yet, {{there is no indication}} in legislation or policy that domestic {{violence is}} considered a human rights issue in New Zealand. The Domestic Violence Act 1995 is merely ordinary law. In this paper I consider whether a human rights approach to domestic violence would provide greater redress for vulnerable women and children in New Zealand. Ultimately it is argued that domestic violence should be framed as a human rights approach. This could be by recognising a right to be free from domestic violence within the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or by inserting a rights <b>framework</b> <b>provision</b> into the Domestic Violence Act. However, this is no simple solution to domestic violence. This is because it seems that human rights are considered mere political claims in New Zealand and because there is a clear reluctance to require the state to take positive action to prevent human rights abuses. Such culture may undermine the effectiveness of a recognised right to be free from domestic violence. However, I conclude by arguing that such problems do not outweigh the benefits of a human rights approach but merely require careful and sensitive enforcement of the right to be free from domestic violence...|$|E
40|$|How to {{guarantee}} Quality of Service (QoS) with the minimum resource cost {{has become a}} new problem in cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations. However, the new problem is challenging as the cloud-based MapReduce environment is dynamically changing. As a result, a static resource allocation scheme is not suitable for cloud-based MapReduce as resources may be under-provisioning, which leads to violations in the QoS of cloud-based MapReduce, or over-provisioning, which increases unnecessary resource cost. This paper abstracts the problem of cloud-based computation-intensive MapReduce computations as a dynamical optimization problem, and proposes an event-driven resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>framework</b> to solve that problem. This new event-driven framework has been compared with existing popular static resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>frameworks</b> and periodic resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>frameworks</b> by experiments. The experimental results {{have shown that the}} new event-driven resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>framework</b> not only guarantees the QoS of those MapReduce computations, but also reduces the running cost of MapReduce computations by 4. 87 - 21. 61 percent compared with those static resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>frameworks,</b> and by 1. 70 - 16. 12 percent compared with those periodic resource <b>provisioning</b> <b>frameworks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{experience}} of non-UK-qualified doctors in working within the regulatory framework of the General Medical Council (GMC) document Good Medical Practice. Design Individual interviews and focus groups. Setting United Kingdom. Participants Non-UK-qualified doctors who had registered with the GMC between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2008, doctors attending training/induction programmes for non-UK-qualified doctors, and key informants involved in training and support for non-UK-qualified doctors. Main outcome measures Themes identified from analysis of interview and focus group transcripts. Results Information and support for non-UK qualified doctors who apply to register {{to work in the}} UK has little reference to the ethical and professional standards required of doctors working in the UK. Recognition of the ethical, legal and cultural context of UK healthcare occurs once doctors are working in practice. Non-UK qualified doctors reported clear differences in the ethical and legal framework for practising medicine between the UK and their country of qualification, particularly in the model of the doctor–patient relationship. The degree of support for non-UK-qualified doctors in dealing with ethical concerns is related to the type of post they work in. European doctors describe similar difficulties with working in an unfamiliar regulatory framework to their non-European colleagues. Conclusions Non-UK-qualified doctors experience a number of difficulties related to practising within a different ethical and professional regulatory <b>framework.</b> <b>Provision</b> of information and educational resources before registration, together with in-practice support would help to develop a more effective understanding of GMP and its implications for practice in the UK...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{recent years}} the {{development}} of standard markets {{and its impact on}} the environs has become a burning issue in the minds of many governments and people alike. Consequently this paper is poised to take a comprehensive look at the location of the Rumuwoji Mile 1 Market in Port Harcourt with respect to the social and economic impacts on the environs. The State Government has shown considerable interest in the location of the market and other ancillary activities and facilities around it. This led to considerable emphasis being placed on the relationship between the various land-uses viz residential commercial recreational transportation etc in most urban centers in like Port Harcourt. This has become imperative as there seem to be palpable hazards and effects being exacted on the environs daily by different socio-economic activities within and around the market. In the same vein this paper has taken special interest in identifying different hazards and the real and potential effects the Mile 1 Rumuwoji market has on its immediate environs as a segment of an urban city of Port Harcourt. The methodology employed in conducting the research was the Hazard and Effect Management Process HEMP to ascertain the hazards and effects posed by the market. From the research it was discovered that the market serves as a central place because it attracts people from different origin to the area and that properties in the area are of mixed uses. The market provides employment in the area. Noise and unhealthy sanitary practices are allowed to thrive there and inadequate parking spaces. To mitigate these challenges some of the recommendations includes the adoption of the social impact mitigation and enhancement <b>framework</b> <b>provision</b> of basic facilities and services the creation of more parking spaces. Sanitary laws and effective refuse collection and disposal should be put in place. If these are done the living conditions of the people living in the area will be improved and the quality of their lives enhanced...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 {{there was}} {{statistical}} {{evidence of an}} increasing number of children in the Northern Territory (NT) suspected of (or actually) suffering abuse and/or neglect. Placing the underlying cause of this increase within an ecological <b>framework,</b> <b>provision</b> of supportive services to assist families ‘at risk’ of harming their children could mitigate the extent of abuse. Child and Family Health nurses (CFHNs) may be an untapped resource to provide those services. The study hoped to provide mechanisms for CFHNs to engage in interdisciplinary and cross-agency collaborative practices and to deliver improved early intervention to vulnerable families. This thesis describes a qualitative multi-method study conducted in three phases. An exploratory study was conducted to provide baseline data to inform an action research approach to address any ‘problem issues’ uncovered. The study design was modified due to complex political and bureaucratic changes that impeded the progress of the action research phase. An explanatory case study was then conducted to gain information about the practice directions and policy environment of the health and social care services available to vulnerable families. Interviews with child health and child protection leaders/experts provided data for this case study. Supplementary data were gathered from a purposeful sample of relevant documents to contextualise the information gained in the case study interviews and identify rapidly changing directions in health and social care policy during this period. The ability of CFHNs in the NT to extend their role into an early intervention service to support vulnerable families remains problematic without human and financial resources made available for this to occur. Interdisciplinary practices across health and social care services remain limited and there is little local cross-agency understanding of the potential of the CFHN role. The voice of nurses in policy development and leadership positions influencing child health services is limited. In other places in Australia and internationally, the role of CFHNs is more fully developed in supporting vulnerable families and mitigating the ecological risks of child abuse and neglect...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with {{a study of}} policy of Hong Kong Government in effective building management. With the Government’s established policy in advocating building management, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) make use of competitions to induce property management companies (PMCs) and owners’ organizations to improve the management standard. After semi-structured interviews with organizer, judges and participants of competition, the Government’s policy is analyzed. Laguna Verde (LV) in Kowloon City District is taken as an example for illustration. It was found that they make use of techniques similar to business competitive strategies for preparing the competition. This may be the reason for their continued championship. It was concluded that the policy is well address to the objective of advocating quality building management and therefore effective. In addition, the policy has attributes of being an efficient policy, with equity and community acceptance. The institutional constraints are also less because the policy well aligns with other policies. In addition, the policy is flexible and different format can be adopted to address different policy and social needs. Quality Building Management Competition (QBMC) is a territory-wide district-base programme organized by the HAD. LV {{has been successful in}} obtaining the championship in Kowloon City District QBMC for five consecutive terms, i. e., 2004 - 05, 2005 - 06, 2006 - 07, 2008 - 09 & 2009 - 10 (the term of 2007 - 08 was suspended). Using LV as an example, it is considered the factors for achieving quality management. The various strategies adopted by LV in obtaining the championship are studied. It is then utilized to illustrate the key elements of quality management through owners’ and occupiers’ participation. These include the set up of management committees / owners’ corporations (OCs), the representative groups, to manage common parts of buildings and the appointment of PMCs, the trade practitioners, to provide services including professional support and management of common areas. It is also illustrated in this paper that there are other dimensions of institutional arrangements, ranging from the establishment of legal <b>framework,</b> <b>provision</b> of professional and support service to OCs by the Government, to the statutory regulation on the property management industry, which contribute to effective building management and maintenance. HAD, in response to government’s call on encouraging owners’ / occupiers participation in private building management, makes use of this competition to promote the good practice of building management. PMCs and OCs also make use of the competition in promoting their public image and enhancing the value of their properties. Therefore, a case study of how LV obtains the championship and an analysis in the implication of the competition in implementing the Government’s policy and serving the objective in private building management is valuable. The literature review includes the conceptual framework of challenge in managing common property, i. e. the tragedy of the commons versus the tragedy of the anticommons: when multiple owners hold rights to exclude others from a scarce resource and no one exercises an effective privilege of use, the resource might be prone to overuse / underuse. In the context of building management, this refers to the attribute that common area of the buildings is of multiple ownerships. If the rights and obligations of such communal private property are not clearly defined, this will inevitably lead to lack of proper maintenance of the common parts and in turn the dilapidation of buildings and the diminishing value of properties. This problem known as the tragedy of the commons and the anitcommons gives rise to different institutional arrangements for property right governance or property management. It is further investigated into the choice among different institutional arrangements and the collective action of owners’ active participation in building management by referring to transaction costs analysis and Collective Interest Model. Besides, the literature review gives background information of the competition, property management in general in Hong Kong, description of Kowloon City District QBMC and competitive strategies, in which both positioning and resources based approach will be applied. This is a descriptive research and qualitative method will be adopted. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to the key staff participated in the competition. The organizer, that is, HAD and District Council (DC), as well as key members of the judging panel will also be interviewed. From the analysis on various opinions from participating parties in the QBMC, it is concluded that QBMC, being a competition programme, together with a series of individual and continual publicity and educational programmes, performs the function of facilitating effective building management by OCs and service quality improvement committed by PMCs. It echoes to and is efficacious in achieving the Government’s policy in encouraging owners’ / occupiers participation in private building management. To a certain extent, the Government’s role in provision of well-established statutory framework and support services for OCs, as well as in implementation of regulatory framework for private property industry in Hong Kong contributes to effective building management. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a novel net-work <b>framework</b> <b>provisioning</b> broadcast and unicast services simultaneously. For each serving file to users, a cellular base station determines either to broadcast or unicast the file based on user demand prediction examining the file’s content specific characteristics such as: file size, delay tolerance, price sensitivity.

An important requirement {{is the need}} to make this infrastructure appear as a single logical coordinated resource – which in reality consists of a variety of resources aggregated across different administrative domains. The aggregation of network resources is often undertaken over a ‘best effort’ infrastructure as provided by the Internet – however many applications, which necessitate soft-real time constraints, such as collaborative working or remote visualisation, require more stringent traffic guarantees. Managing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements across these aggregated resources therefore becomes an important concern. Such QoS criteria must extend to computational, data and network resources, and are often expressed in a Service Level Agreement, multiples of which may co-exist over the entire collection of resources. In this paper we focus on network QoS as part of our wider work on the Grid QoS Management (G-QoSm) <b>framework.</b> <b>Provisioning</b> of such QoS support is provided via the Differentiated Services architecture, and relies on the use of a Bandwidth Broker (BB) component.

This paper presents {{the design and}} implementation of a flexible and efficient QoS framework for cluster-based network services. This framework achieves four objectives. First, the framework provides a flexible mechanism for service providers to specify a variety of desired service quality metrics through QoS yield functions. Secondly, the <b>framework</b> <b>provisions</b> service differentiation and admission control for multiple classes of service accesses by employing both the yield functions and resource allocation guarantees. Thirdly, the framework achieves efficient resource utilization by producing high aggregate QoS yield through greedy scheduling and speculative admission control that drops zero or low yield requests. Finally, the design of this QoS framework takes into consideration service scalability and availability by deploying a decentralized two-level request distribution and scheduling scheme. We implemented the proposed framework {{on top of the}} Neptune clustering middleware, which provides replication and loadbalancing support for cluster-based services. Our simulations and experiments based on the prototype implementation show that the proposed schemes can effectively utilize system resources under QoS constraints, especially when system resource consumption is approaching or beyond the saturation point. Comparing with a previously proposed dynamic server partitioning scheme, the evaluations also show that our system responds more promptly to demand spikes and behaves more smoothly during server failures...|$|R
