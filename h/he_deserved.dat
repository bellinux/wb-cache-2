5|$|A segment with Raven {{took place}} where he demanded {{to be placed in}} the main event for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko disagreed, {{resulting}} in Raven attacking him before security pulled Raven off. Rhino then came out and stated that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> the title shot more than Raven.|$|E
5|$|The swift {{outcome of}} the trial {{resulted}} in the almost immediate execution of the two men. One Driscoll, led out alone, was shot first. Then the other was led out, shown his dead relative's body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> death, and was also shot.|$|E
5|$|Further {{advancement}} of rank was facilitated with Conroy's marriage to Elizabeth Fisher on 26 December 1808 in Dublin, {{though not as}} far as Conroy felt <b>he</b> <b>deserved.</b> Elizabeth {{was the daughter of}} Colonel (later Major-General) Benjamin Fisher and Conroy served under him in Ireland and England while performing various administrative duties. Conroy was promoted to Second Captain on 13 March 1811 and appointed adjutant in the Corps of Artillery Drivers on 11 March 1817.|$|E

5|$|In his 12 starts {{before the}} All-Star break, Lin {{averaged}} 22.5points and 8.7assists, and New York had a 9–3 record. He {{played in the}} Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend. He was omitted from the original Rising Stars roster, but was added after his sudden rise to stardom. Some media outlets—including USA Today, Los Angeles Times, and CBSSports.com—stated that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> {{to play in the}} All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. He added that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard {{was unhappy}} with his new assignment, believing that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> command {{of one of the}} great Confederate field armies. He {{performed}} successfully, however, preventing the capture of Charleston by Union naval and land attacks in 1863. On April 7, 1863, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, led a union ironclad attack against Fort Sumter that was repulsed by highly accurate artillery fire from Beauregard's forces. In July through September 1863, union land forces under Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore launched a series of attacks on Fort Wagner on Morris Island and other fortifications {{at the mouth of the}} harbor, while Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren attempted to destroy Fort Sumter. Because the latter operation failed, the successful seizure of Morris Island was not effective in threatening Charleston.|$|E
5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the atabeg Anur died, {{at which point the}} amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ra'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years. Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, saying that he had been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E

5|$|Richard Benjamin Ferrell (October 12, 1905 – July 27, 1995) was an American {{professional}} baseball player, coach, scout, and executive. He played for 18seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the St. Louis Browns, Boston Red Sox, and Washington Senators, from 1929 through 1947. His brother, Wes Ferrell, {{was a major}} league pitcher for 15seasons, and they were teammates from 1933 through part of 1938 on the Red Sox and Senators. Following his three seasons in minor league baseball, he appealed to the Commissioner of Baseball to become a free agent, claiming {{that he was being}} held in the minors though <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> promotion. The Commissioner agreed, and he was granted free agency; he signed with the St. Louis Browns.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} one of 20 to receive an {{invitation}} to the Tour de France. Contador, Leipheimer, and Armstrong were all named to the team. There was much speculation and controversy, which began when Armstrong first signed with the team, over who would be the team's protected rider in the Tour. Though Armstrong's express goal in returning from retirement was to win an eighth Tour de France, Contador had won his last three Grand Tours and insisted that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> leadership of the team and hinted that he might leave if forced to support Armstrong. Bruyneel assured Contador that he would be the leader before the season began. Contador was also publicly named team leader shortly before the Tour began.|$|E
5|$|When Dean {{returned}} to the United States, he received a hero's welcome and was presented {{with a number of}} decorations, including the Medal of Honor, which he was unaware he had been awarded. Dean maintained he did not think his own experience was particularly heroic and asserted he did not feel <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> an award for his actions in Korea. He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E

5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with the notable exception of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Cross {{recipient}} Cecil Meritt {{cited the}} fact that he already held Canada's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the sovereign's spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating that if he was to be appointed, it should be on his merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> a knighthood. Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand {{was between}} Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy {{at the same}} event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided to challenge him at No Way Out. In the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by slapping the referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that <b>he</b> <b>deserved</b> another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would {{be added to the}} WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.|$|E
