40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that acute HIV infection results in a rapid and profound loss of memory CD 4 + CCR 5 + T cells within {{the first few weeks}} of infection [1, 2]. Since most of these cells reside in the intestinal tract, profound CD 4 + T cell depletion occurs in the intestine within days of infection, whereas peripheral lymphoid tissues such as blood and lymph nodes, which harbor mainly naïve CD 4 + T cells, are less severely affected. These studies confirmed earlier reports in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [3] and demonstrated that primary HIV infection results in rapid and dramatic losses {{of the majority of the}} CD 4 + T cells in the body. However, profound losses can only be detected when examining mucosal tissues (i. e., the intestine). Recognition of the mucosal immune system as a principal target of early HIV infection constitutes a fundamental change in our understanding of <b>HIV</b> <b>pathophysiology,</b> with potential implications for therapeutic monitoring and vaccine development [4]...|$|E
40|$|Background: nurses’ knowledge, {{attitudes and}} {{practices}} towards patients with HIV/AIDS are of ongoing interest, especially in developing countries. Nothing or very {{little is known about}} Italian nurses. Methods: HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of the nurses (n = 107) from one university hospital inCatania,Sicily, were documented. Comparisons among nurses belonging to different Operative Units (O. U.) were conducted by the chi-square test (P< 0. 05). Results: although HIV was nurses’ main concern in regard to contracting infections in the workplace (54 %), {{the vast majority of them}} (98 %) had never refused an HIV/AIDS patient care assignment. Moreover, despite their concern of being more at risk of contracting HIV than the general population (41 %), a not negligible percentage of nurses did not use gloves routinely (21 %) and only a few treated all patients as potentially HIV-positive (9 %). The vast majority of the respondents knew the meaning of AIDS (87 %) and of a positive serological test (78 %). On the contrary, a relatively low percentage of them knew what is the ‘window period’ (62 %) and were acquainted with <b>HIV</b> <b>pathophysiology</b> (65 %). No statistically significant differences in terms of risk perception were found between nurses who had previously attended an HIV/AIDS workshop, lecture or specific course (43 %) and nurses who did not (57 %). Level of knowledge was positively associated to age (P= 0. 000) and to education (P= 0. 016), and it was found higher in nurses working in a O. U. of Infectious Diseases. Conclusions: data from our study show that also in developed countries, such as Italy, nurses could have some misconceptions and concerns about HIV/AIDS. The importance of examining the impact of continuing education on nurses’ preparedness to care for patients with HIV/AIDS and to prevent the risks of occupational HIV transmission is discussed.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The lung is {{a central}} organ in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> -induced <b>pathophysiology,</b> becoming infected during the asymptomatic period of the disease. The presence of HIV elicits a discrete virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated immune response in the pulmonary microenvironment. Here, Carlo Agostini and colleagues {{provide a framework for}} understanding the mechanisms underlying the spread of the retrovirus and the consequent progression of disease in patients with AIDS-associated lung involvement...|$|R

Human immunodeficiency virus- (HIV-) related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of <b>HIV</b> infection. The <b>pathophysiology</b> of HIV-related PAH is complex, with viral proteins seeming to play the major role. However, other factors, such as coinfection with other microorganisms and HIV-related systemic inflammation, might also contribute. The clinical presentation of HIV-related PAH and diagnosis is similar {{to other forms of}} pulmonary hypertension. Both PAH-specific therapies and HAART are important in HIV-related PAHmanagement. Future studies investigating the pathogenesis are needed to discover new therapeutic targets and treatments. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV {{infection}} {{occurs in}} 30 % {{of children with}} severe acute malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. Effects of <b>HIV</b> on the <b>pathophysiology</b> and recovery from malnutrition are poorly understood. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 75 severely malnourished Ugandan children. HIV status/CD 4 counts were assessed at baseline; auxologic data and blood samples were obtained at admission and after 14 days of inpatient treatment. We utilized metabolomic profiling to characterize effects of HIV infection on metabolic status and subsequent responses to nutritional therapy. Findings: At admission, patients (mean age 16. 3 mo) had growth failure (mean W/H z-score 24. 27 in non-edematous patients) that improved with formula feeding (mean increase 1. 00). 24 % (18 / 75) were HIV-infected. Nine children died within the first 14 days of hospitalization; mortality was higher for HIV-infected patients (33 % v. 5 %, OR = 8. 83). HIV-infected and HIV-negative children presented with elevated NEFA, ketones, and even-numbered acylcarnitines and reductions in albumin and amino acids. Leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and IGF- 1 levels were low while growth hormone, cortisol, and ghrelin levels were high. At baseline, HIV-infected patients had higher triglycerides, ketones, and even-chain acylcarnitines and lowe...|$|R

We utilized metabolomic profiling to characterize effects of HIV infection on metabolic status and subsequent responses to nutritional therapy. At admission, patients (mean age 16. 3 mo) had growth failure (mean W/H z-score - 4. 27 in non-edematous patients) that improved with formula feeding (mean increase 1. 00). 24 % (18 / 75) were HIV-infected. Nine children died within the first 14 days of hospitalization; mortality was higher for HIV-infected patients (33 % v. 5 %, OR =  8. 83).

At baseline, HIV-infected patients had higher triglycerides, ketones, and even-chain acylcarnitines and lower leptin and adiponectin levels than HIV-negative patients. Leptin levels rose in all patients following nutritional intervention, but adiponectin levels remained depressed in HIV-infected children. Baseline hypoleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia were associated with increased mortality. Our findings suggest a critical interplay between HIV infection and adipose tissue storage and function in the adaptation to malnutrition. Hypoleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia may contribute to high mortality rates among malnourished, HIV-infected children...|$|R
