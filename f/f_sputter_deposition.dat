Membrane thickness was varied from 3 mm to 150 {micro}m. The hydrogen permeation flux {{was found to be}} inversely proportional to the thickness of the dense films, indicating that the bulk diffusion rather than the surface reaction played a dominant role in the H{sub 2 } transport through these dense membranes within the studied thickness range. Hydrogen permeation flux increases with increasing upstream hydrogen partial pressure and decreasing downstream hydrogen partial pressure. The activation energy for hydrogen permeation through the SCTm membrane is about 116 kJ/mol in 600 - 700 C and 16 kJ/mol in 750 - 950 C. This indicates a change in the electrical and protonic conduction mechanism at around 700 C.

The polymeric-gel casting method includes preparation of mixed metal oxide gel and coating of the gel on a macroporous alumina support.

Such ultrathin SCTm membranes will offer sufficiently high hydrogen permeance for practical applications. Thin gas-tight SCTm membranes were synthesized on porous SCTm supports by the dry-pressing method. In this method, the green powder of SCTm was prepared by wet chemical method using metal nitrates as the precursors. Particle size of the powder was revealed to be a vital factor in determining the porosity and shrinkage of the sintered disks. Small particle size formed the dense film while large particle size produced porous substrates. The SCTm film thickness was varied from 1 mm to 0. 15 mm by varying the amount of the target powder. A close match between the shrinkage of the substrate and the dense film led to the defect free-thin films. The selectivity of H{sub 2 } over He with these films was infinite. The chemical environment {{on each side of the}} membrane influenced the H{sub 2 } permeation flux as it had concurrent effects on the driving force and electronic/ionic conductivities. The H{sub 2 } permeation rates were found to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the dense film indicating that bulk diffusion rather than surface reaction played a dominant role in H{sub 2 } transport through these dense films within the studied thickness range (150 {micro}m - 1 mm) ...|$|E

40|$|Catalysts are {{of great}} {{importance}} in many different fields, including the energy and the environmental sectors. It is important to produce them with simple preparation technique and to enhance the catalysts surface-to-volume ratio. The work undertaken in this thesis concerns the synthesis of nanostructures by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and R. <b>F.</b> <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition</b> and the tailoring of their structures by varying deposition parameters. We synthesized Cobalt oxide nanoparticles (NPs) by PLD and studied {{the influence of the}} deposition parameters (i. e. substrate temperature, target-to-substrate distance and partial pressure of Oxygen in the chamber) on the final structure and crystalline phase of the NPs. The deposited NPs can be divided in two main categories: small NPs having a diameter of about 5 nm, and big NPs of size ranging from 50 to 400 nm. Depending on the value chosen for the deposition parameters, small NPs have CoO- or Co 3 O 4 crystalline phase, and NPs can have a core/shell structure. The phase composition of the core and of the shell also vary according to the deposition conditions. We synthesized thin film of Co-B NPs by PLD. Depending on the energy density, the laser process is able to produce well-dispersed spherical Co NPs partially embedded within B-based film matrix in a single-step deposition. The small size, the polycrystalline nature of Co NPs, and the presence of Boron matrix is important for catalytic performance of the Co-B film. The catalytic activity of the Co-B has been tested in hydrolysis of chemical hydrides (ammonia borane and sodium borohydride). PLD deposition of C-film, to serve as support for Co-B NPs, was performed at different Ar pressures (from 10 to 50 Pa) to tailor film roughness in order to investigate the role of porous and irregular C- surface on supporting Co-B NPs acting as catalysts. The measured hydrogen generation rate attained with C-supported Co-B catalyst film is higher than both unsupported-Co-B film and conventional Co-B powder. Multilayer ITO/Cr-doped-TiO 2 thin films have been synthesized by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering in order to sensitize TiO 2 in visible light and to lower the charge recombination rate in the Cr-doped-TiO 2. When the multilayer films were exposed to visible light, we observed that the photocurrent increases as function of the number of bilayers by reaching the maximum with 6 -bilayers of ITO/Cr-doped- TiO 2. The superior photocatalytic efficiency of the 6 -bilayers film implies higher hydrogen production rate through water-splitting. Spontaneous growth of Lead nanowires (NWs) have been observed in composite Al-Pb film deposited by R. <b>F.</b> <b>sputtering</b> <b>deposition.</b> The parameters of deposition and the storage of the Al-Pb films after deposition has been changed {{in order to understand the}} growth process of NWs.

The chlorine post-growth treatment is modiﬁed in order to uniformly cover the cell surface and reduce the probability of pinholes and shunting pathways creation which, in turn, reduces the series resistance. The deionized water etching is proposed, for the ﬁrst time, as the simplest solution to optimize the effect of shunt resistance, stability and metal-semiconductor inter-diffusion at the back contact.

40|$|Most {{commercial}} state-of-the-art batteries {{work with}} a liquid organic electrolyte which might cause safety problems due to an insufficient thermal and electrochemical stability. Replacing the liquid by a solid electrolyte is one approach to overcome these problems. Next to sulfides and phosphates, oxide compounds like the garnet-structured Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 (LLZ) are promising materials for solid electrolytes. LLZ exists in two modifications, a tetragonal and a cubic, whereby the cubic high temperature phase shows a higher Li-ion conductivity (about 10 - 4 S/cm). Further advantageous properties of LLZ are its thermal (up to 1050 °C) and electrochemical stability (up to 8 V) which allows its usage with high-voltage electrodes or in batteries at elevated temperatures. Since the conductivity is two orders of magnitude lower compared to organic electrolytes the overall resistance can be lowered by reduction to a thin electrolyte layer in all-solid-state cells.
