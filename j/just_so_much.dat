[...] "I mean, it's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. It's so much fun being a bad actor playing a character..."

500|$|Spielberg kept most of {{the parts}} secret in the filmmaking, as {{the cast and crew}} were left {{confused}} about how the aliens looked. When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, [...] " [...] wouldn't give [...] to anybody". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good. In the old days people didn't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good.

[...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions."

Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea? There are moments like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow".

500|$|The storyline {{received}} {{attention from the}} Australian Family Association, with spokesman John Morrissey {{saying that he was}} concerned about TV [...] "normalising" [...] same-sex relationships. Psychologist Dr Janet Hall praised the storyline, saying it allows families to discuss the topic. Bower defended the kiss, which was shot before the Home and Away controversy, saying [...] "Ours is a lovely tale about friendship. It's very innocent." [...] She added [...] "If {{we were going to do}} a lesbian story – and Neighbours is not against lesbian stories – we would do it properly. This is a teenage romance story. There's nothing sexual". In June 2009, Bower was asked if there were any plans to explore Donna's bisexuality, to which she replied that there was not. She said [...] "We're getting an enormous amount of leverage with Donna being the person she is and there's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> storyline with her and romance with Ringo that I'm not saying it's out of the question, but it's not in any planning stages now".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown {{described}} Gilmour's guitar {{style as}} [...] "characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures." [...] According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on [...] "Money", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Comfortably Numb" [...] "cut through the mix like {{a laser beam}} through fog." [...] Brown described the [...] "Time" [...] solo as [...] "a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato." [...] Brown described Gilmour's sense of phrasing as intuitive, singling it out as perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist. Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: [...] "I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting... singing sustain... you need to play loud — {{at or near the}} feedback threshold. It's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more fun to play... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] was filmed in December 2004 in Los Angeles, California. It was co-directed by Spears and Billie Woodruff, who {{previously}} {{worked with her}} in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and in [...] "Overprotected". Spears described the shoot as [...] "hectic", adding it was filmed [...] "in a record-breaking five hours". She also commented about co-directing with Woodruff, saying that [...] "he had no ego whatsoever, and the whole process was <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun". Spears is credited as [...] "Mona Lisa" [...] in the video, as she said [...] "I kinda think she's like my alter ego whenever I feel like being mean or possibly like bustin' people around to get stuff right... It's kinda easier to be called 'Mona Lisa' instead of Britney". The video was also choreographed and styled entirely by Spears, with clothing from Juicy Couture. Spears ultimately added that working behind the camera inspired her to become a director in the future, explaining, [...] "After doing about 20 videos, it gets kind of boring playing the same role. I feel like being behind the camera is sometimes more satisfying than being in front of it".|$|E
500|$|Two songs {{taken from}} the album ("Mandatory Suicide" [...] and [...] "South of Heaven") have become near {{constant}} fixtures in the band's live setlist, notching up appearances on the following: the live DVDs Live Intrusion, War at the Warfield, Still Reigning, Soundtrack to the Apocalypses deluxe edition's bonus live disc, and the live double album Decade of Aggression. [...] Lombardo guested with Finnish cellist group Apocalyptica on a live medley of the two tracks at 1998's Headbanger's Heaven festival in the Netherlands. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters described [...] "South of Heaven" [...] as [...] "an unorthodox set opener in theory", noting [...] "the song went over like a megaton bomb detonating the place: dozens of inverted crosses projected behind the high drum riser, the sinewy opening notes kicked in, followed by an overture of bass, cymbal crashes, and tom fills, {{leading up to the}} slowly building crescendo" [...] in a concert review. Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and thinking, Man! There's <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> groove in that song.' To my kids I was saying, 'Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!' And it's heavy."

500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E

2500|$|Variety {{called it}} [...] "a distended, talky, {{redundant}} and moody melodrama" [...] and added, [...] "The overemphasis on Streisand makes the film just {{another one of}} those Streisand vehicles where no other elements ever get a chance." [...] Time Out London observed, [...] "ith the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the Communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade. Although Streisand's liberated Jewish lady is implausible, and emphasizes the period setting as <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> dressing, Redford's Fitzgerald-type character [...] [...] [...] is an intriguing trailer for his later Great Gatsby.

[...] Amy Dawson of Metro UK called it [...] "a delicate, countrified guitar ballad that drives into a power-chorus singalong conclusion." [...] Colin McGuire of PopMatters was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "'I Won't Give Up', for instance, is acoustic guitar-laden folky pop that falls at least a little bit flat with its predictably bland approach. While the song's hook proves itself memorable enough, the track never graduates into anything other than the ballad-like tediousness the singer has a tendency to revert into." ...|$|E

IGN commented [...] "For those planning to check out everything Modern Warfare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign– you're looking at a no-brainer purchase". GameTrailers stated [...] "The air of unpredictability and the care that was paid to each separate element puts it in lofty company. The multiplayer hasn't received an overhaul, but considering most shooters are still playing catch-up with Call of Duty 4, the tweaks and twists make it the best multiplayer shooting experience in the industry. Few games manage to meet such high expectations". Computer and Video Games called the game [...] "Loud, epic and incredibly polished, [...] this year's biggest must-have shooter".|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs...

Love recounted: [...] "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality.
