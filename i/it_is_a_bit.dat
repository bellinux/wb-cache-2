25|$|The flapamba is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} in the percussion family. It consists of tuned wooden bars pinched on one side (over the node), and mounted over resonator boxes. Sliding the bars slightly forward or backward affects their tuning. Unlike marimba or xylophone however, the sound is not as focused tonally, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more percussive (closer to tuned log drums).|$|E
25|$|The Ueschinen Hut is {{situated}} in the Ueschinen Valley, at a height of 1,890metres, and about two to three hours' {{walk away from the}} centre. It is usually open from May to October. During the summer it is used mainly as a base for climbing and hiking activities, but it may be used by groups at any time if weather allows. The hut is actually half of a cowshed, so sometimes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> noisy at night. It can sleep up to 30 people and has a fully equipped kitchen with wood stove, a general living and eating room and a special toilet– there is no electricity and no shower.|$|E

[...] The first leg, played at Stamford Bridge ended in a draw with Guðjohnsen and Pirès scoring for their respective clubs. Arsenal were unable {{to take advantage of}} Marcel Desailly's dismissal in the second half, but Wenger felt his team were in a good position to progress: [...] "Our main aim will be to win the game at Highbury and we know we can do that." ...|$|E

500|$|For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders {{for more than ten}} minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient of everything else to be found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
500|$|The less ornate Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove, {{which has}} also been known {{traditionally}} as the Rod of Equity and Mercy, is emblematic {{of his or her}} spiritual role. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> longer at [...] but weighs about the same as the Sceptre with Cross. The sceptre is decorated with 285 gemstones, including 94 diamonds, 53 rubies, 10 emeralds, 4 sapphires and 3 spinels. At the top is a gold monde set with diamonds and topped by a plain cross, on which sits a white champlevé enamelled dove with its wings outspread; the eyes, beak and feet are gold leaf. The dove has been used to represent the Holy Ghost, who guides the sovereign's actions, for many centuries. Circling the rod are bands of precious stones. The Sceptre with Dove is the final piece of regalia delivered to the monarch in the investment part of a coronation. It is borne in the left hand, and as the monarch holds both sceptres, he or she is crowned with StEdward's Crown.|$|E

Ruby starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now with everything?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?".

Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She said that ultimately everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong.

500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Lundgren played gladiator Brixos in the Italian-made historical/biblical drama, The Inquiry (L'inchiesta), {{also known}} as The Final Inquiry, {{alongside}} Daniele Liotti, Mónica Cruz, Max von Sydow, F. Murray Abraham and Ornella Muti. It is the remake of the 1986 Italian film directed by Damiano Damiani and starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel. Set in AD35 in the Roman Empire, the story follows a fictional Roman general named Titus Valerius Taurus, a veteran of campaigns in Germania, who is sent to Judea by the emperor Tiberius to investigate {{the possibility of the}} divinity of the recently crucified Jesus. The film, shot on location in Tunisia and Bulgaria, featured a score from Andrea Morricone, the son of the acclaimed film score composer Ennio Morricone. It premiered at the Capri-Hollywood and the Los Angeles-Italia Film Festival. One reviewer on a website catering for historical movies said of the film, [...] "The Final Inquiry is one of those movies you are glad you ran into.... I had such low expectations for this movie, but was glad to have been proven wrong. I know about the negative reviews this movie has gotten and some of the criticism is well deserved while some of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|Another story arc saw Charlie {{reveal that}} her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) {{is in fact}} her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline {{challenging}} and felt {{they had to get}} it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing.

500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
