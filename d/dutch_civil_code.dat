25|$|In 1838, a new <b>Dutch</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> (Burgerlijk Wetboek) {{replaced}} the Code Civil {{and dealt with}} nationality in a new, Dutch way but still largely influence by the French system. The new Burgerlijk Wetboek cemented the rights of nationality of women and touched upon the loss of nationality. Dutch nationality would be lost by naturalization or permanent residence in another country. As well, serving in a foreign army and providing labour for a foreign public service without royal permission would deprive one of Dutch nationality.|$|E
25|$|The year 1795 {{marked the}} {{downfall}} of the Dutch Republic and gave birth to the Batavian Republic. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first codification of Dutch national citizenship appeared in the Napoleonic Code for the Kingdom of Holland effective from 1801–1811, originating from the French code of civil rights, the Code Civil. In 1813, after the proclamation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Code Civil continued to remain in effect even though a new Dutch constitution was drawn in 1815. The new constitution de facto became the first Dutch codification of Dutch citizenship, where it was stated that, starting from 1815, only residents had the freedom to occupy positions in public offices. This was a significant change from the citizenship laws of the preceding centuries. The <b>Dutch</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> stipulated that residents were only those people who were born to parents officially residing on Dutch territory. Due to the colonial ambitions of the Netherlands, all those people who traveled abroad in official service of the country were considered to live in the Netherlands and were to be counted as residents. The new Dutch civil law was the building block for the implementation of jus sanguinis. On the other hand, even though descent remained very important for the acquisition of citizenship, the emphasis on the significance of residency, was evidence of the French influence of jus soli.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{law allows}} {{associations}} (verenigingen) and foundations (stichtingen) {{to bring a}} so-called collective action on behalf of other persons, provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws (statuten) (section 3:305a <b>Dutch</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code).</b> All types of actions are permitted, excluding a claim for monetary damages. Most class actions {{over the past decade}} have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services. The acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant. The settlement may also include– and usually primarily consists of– monetary compensation of damages. Such settlement can be declared binding for all injured parties by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 <b>Dutch</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code).</b> [...] The injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Interestingly, settlements involving injured parties from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Notably since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, it may be interesting to combine a US class action and a Dutch collective action {{to be able to come}} to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide. An example of this is the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Reserves Settlement that was declared binding upon both US and non-US plaintiffs.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{a unified}} European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> {{can be traced to}} the {{idea of a}} unified Europe and the {{creation}} of the European Union. The European Parliament requested the creation of a European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> in 1989, 1994 and 2000.

40|$|The {{rigorous}} thesis Liability {{for damages}} - Indemnity mainly describes requisite assumptions that constitute {{an obligation to}} provide indemnity. The thesis compares the existing legislation of Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., the <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> and Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the prospective new <b>Civil</b> <b>Code.</b> The author further describes the law relating to the obligation to provide indemnity under the German <b>Civil</b> <b>Code,</b> emphasizing particularly the fact that general provisions of the new <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> dealing with the obligation to provide indemnity {{have been inspired by}} the German <b>Civil</b> <b>Code...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of a European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> is, like {{a national}} <b>civil</b> <b>code,</b> to deal comprehensively with the core areas of private law. Private law typically {{covered in a}} <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> includes the family law, the law of inheritance, property law and the Law of Obligations. The law of obligations includes the law of contracts, delicts (or torts) and restitution. It was from work on European contract law that the push for a comprehensive European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> arose. The development of a European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> has primarily focused on creating a unified law of contracts. Thus European <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> is often used in specific reference to the harmonisation of contract law throughout the EU.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a modern {{comprehensive}} code is the Dutch Burgerlijk Wetboek which came into force in 1992. The Burgerlijk Wetboek covers civil, commercial law, consumer law and labour law and was almost 40 years in the making.

The March 2006 European Parliament resolution recommended taking the new <b>Dutch</b> <b>civil</b> <b>code</b> as a model as well.|$|E

50|$|The Portuguese Law was {{in force}} in Timor-Leste until its {{invasion}} by Indonesia in 1975. After the invasion and occupation, the Indonesian law replaced de facto the Portuguese one (although not de jure, as the occupation was never {{recognized by the}} international community).

As a provisional measure, the Indonesian law was kept in force after the independence of Timor-Leste in 2002, this being gradually replaced by Timorese own laws. The new Timorese law about the commercial societies of 2004 is very influenced by the Portuguese Code of Commercial Societies of 1986. In 2011, the Indonesian Civil Code was replaced by the new Civil Code of Timor-Leste, which is based in the Portuguese Civil Code of 1966.|$|E
50|$|A Stichting is a {{legal person}} created through a legal act.

The foundations are defined in the <b>Dutch</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Code</b> (Burgerlijk Wetboek), Boek 2 Art 285-304. It is not necessary in the Netherlands that a foundation serves a purpose of general interest, but its official goal cannot include making payments to anybody, except for charitable causes. A foundation is governed and represented by a board that is responsible for the foundation's administration. The board does not have a requirement for specific number of members.|$|E
