50|$|In {{the decade}} between 2005 and 2015, {{at least five}} groups argued the notion that memory reconsolidation {{can be used to}} treat {{psychological}} problems. Three of these groups have proposed that the wide variety of different psychotherapies produce permanent change in clients {{to the extent that they}} manage to activate this same neurobiological mechanism of reconsolidation in a way that leads to <b>deconsolidation.</b> Memory reconsolidation may be a common factor in many forms of psychotherapy.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} reason for transshipment {{is to change}} the means of transport during the journey (e.g., from ship transport to road transport), known as transloading. Another reason is to combine small shipments into a large shipment (consolidation), dividing the large shipment at the other end (<b>deconsolidation).</b> Transshipment usually takes place in transport hubs. Much international transshipment also takes place in designated customs areas, thus avoiding the need for customs checks or duties, otherwise a major hindrance for efficient transport.|$|E

5000|$|The brain {{clearly does}} not require {{emotional}} arousal per se for inducing <b>deconsolidation.</b> That is a fundamental point. If the target learning happens to be emotional, then its reactivation (the first of the two required elements) of course entails an experience of that emotion, but the emotion itself does not inherently {{play a role in}} the mismatch that then deconsolidates the target learning, or in the new learning that then rewrites and erases the target learning (discussed at greater length in [...] ). ... The same considerations imply that [...] "changing emotion with emotion" [...] (stated three times by Lane et al.) inaccurately characterizes how learned responses change through reconsolidation. Mismatch consists most fundamentally of a direct, unmistakable perception that the world functions differently from one's learned model. [...] "Changing model with mismatch" [...] is the core phenomenology.|$|E
50|$|The Macquarie Point {{facility}} {{is out of}} date in terms of handling the size of modern freight trains, and lacks any space for a major redevelopment. It {{is located in the}} immediate area of a residential and tourist precinct, and is close to the Hobart CBD. It features many short holding tracks that prevent trains being moved as a single continuous vehicle which causes extensive Shunting throughout loading operations. These delays occur in addition to long travel times south of Bridgewater, where the main north/south railway line follows the River Derwent through Hobart's northern suburbs, across 21 level crossings which require slow train speeds to minimize the risk of accidents. The Macquarie Point site features a poor quality surface with uneven levels which creates difficulties for the loading, unloading and manoeuvring of freight across the site. The site configuration does not allow for efficient truck consolidation and <b>deconsolidation</b> and adds to the delays borne by transport companies waiting for containers to be unloaded.Management and security is also difficult because of numerous entry points and the poor rail layout.|$|E

40|$|Initially {{undamaged}} polymer-bonded explosives can {{transition from}} conductive burning to more violent convective burning via rapid <b>deconsolidation</b> at higher pressures. The pressure-dependent infiltration of cracks and pores, i. e., damage, by product gases at the burn-front {{is a key}} step in the transition to convective burning. However, the relative influence of pre-existing damage {{and the evolution of}} deflagration-induced damage during the transition to convective burning is not well understood. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the role of microstructure and initial pressurization on <b>deconsolidation.</b> We performed simulations using the multi-physics hydrocode, ALE 3 D. HMX-Viton A served as our model explosive. A Prout-Tompkins chemical kinetic model, Vielle's Law pressure-dependent burning, Gruneisen equation-of-state, and simplified strength model were used for the HMX. The propensity for <b>deconsolidation</b> increased with increasing defect size and decreasing initial pressurization, as measured by the increase in burning surface area. These studies are important because they enable the development of continuum-scale damage models and the design of inherently safer explosives...|$|E

40|$|Both {{heating and}} solvent-spray methods {{are used to}} {{consolidate}} the standard grains of double-base oblate sphere propellants plasticized with triethyleneglycol dinitrate (TEGDN) (TEGDN propellants) to high density propellants. The obtained consolidated propellants are deterred and coated with the slow burning multi-layer coating. The maximum compaction density of deterred and coated consolidated propellants can reach up to 1. 39  g/cm 3. Their mechanic, <b>deconsolidation</b> and combustion performances are tested by the materials test machine, interrupted burning set-up and closed vessel, respectively. The static compression strength of consolidated propellants deterred by multi-layer coating increases significantly to 18  MPa, indicating {{that they can be}} applied in most circumstances of charge service. And the samples are easy to deconsolidate in the interrupted burning test. Furthermore, the closed bomb burning curves of the samples indicate a two-stage combustion phenomenon under the condition of certain thickness of coated multi-layers. After the outer deterred multi-layer coating of consolidated samples is finished burning, the inner consolidated propellants continue to burn and breakup into aggregates and grains. The high burning progressivity can be carefully obtained by the smart control of <b>deconsolidation</b> process and duration of consolidated propellants. The preliminary results of consolidated propellants show that a rapid <b>deconsolidation</b> process at higher <b>deconsolidation</b> pressure is presented in the dynamic vivacity curves of closed bomb test. Higher density and higher macro progressivity of consolidated propellants can be obtained by the techniques in this paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{composite}} processing, a compressible dry fiber preform is in {{many cases}} impregnated by a molten polymeric matrix. The impregnated part is sometimes used as produced, but most often it requires a reheating step before stamping, flow molding or even painting of the part. This latter step {{may lead to the}} release of locked-in stresses, a phenomenon often called lofting or <b>deconsolidation.</b> The aim of the present thesis is to analyze the mechanisms and provide tools for predicting the kinetics of consolidation and <b>deconsolidation</b> in order to produce cost-effective and sound composite materials. To achieve this, the two fundamental stages of composite processing, consolidation and <b>deconsolidation,</b> have been studied. The influence of both processing parameters and materials systems have been quantified. A Glass Mat reinforced Thermoplastic (GMT) was selected and characterized for the case study. The first part of this work concerns the consolidation stage, emphasizing the influence of processing parameters such as applied pressure or processing temperature on the final microstructure of the composite products. Experimental impregnation processes were carried out and were completed by parallel theoretical simulations. A model accounting for the saturated infiltration of compressible preform was used to predict the residual fiber content gradient in a part, and its influence on the mechanical properties. It was observed that a gradient of the reinforcement in a GMT part, if controlled by impregnation times, can improve the bending modulus by 50 %. Furthermore, a new infiltration model accounting for multi-phase flow in compressible preforms showing a dual-scale porosity was elaborated. The aim was {{to take into account the}} porosity by considering not only the solid and liquid phases, but also air as a third phase. The local fiber and void content can then be precisely predicted as a function of the infiltration time and position. The radial micro-impregnation of the fiber bundles was also taken into account by adding a sink term of micro-impregnation to the macro-impregnation. The predictions have shown that the time required to provide full micro-infiltration is about four times longer than the time to provide full macro-infiltration. Special care therefore has to be taken when infiltrating a dual-scale porosity system: residual voids may remain even if time to provide macro-infiltration is attained. Once the consolidation state of the part was well defined in terms of void content, fiber content profile and stress state, a study of the post-processing steps was carried out. To achieve this, model experiments of compression and unloading of a stack of mats embedded in a model matrix were carried out. This springback experiment enabled the unloading behavior of the fiber preform to be studied; for instance, the influence of the matrix viscosity on the kinetics of the process. <b>Deconsolidation</b> experiments were also carried out for GMT parts: the consolidated samples were reheated at processing temperatures for different times. Comparing these different experimental results with theory has shown that the <b>deconsolidation</b> phenomenon is mainly governed by the stress/strain behavior of the preform upon unloading. However, the kinetics of <b>deconsolidation</b> are also influenced by the void formation and growth that appear during reheating. Moreover, it was found that the springback effect of the preform leads to tensile forces in the matrix, which enhance void growth. A correlation between the elastic behavior of the fiber and the growth of air bubbles in the matrix was then demonstrated. Since it was observed that the mechanical behavior of the preform plays a major role in the <b>deconsolidation</b> phenomenon, the study on the springback effect was completed by a comparison between two different glass fiber and polypropylene systems. The classic GMT studied previously was compared with a new type of commingled glass and polypropylene fibers. Compressive tests on both dry preforms, as well as consolidation and <b>deconsolidation</b> experiments showed that the commingled system presents a higher void content after <b>deconsolidation</b> than the classic GMT. A porosity of respectively 72 % and 55 % was measured. It was demonstrated that differences in glass fiber arrangement are at the origin of the result. Finally, the <b>deconsolidation</b> of a GMT part in the solid sate was investigated. The role of the matrix which often exhibits a viscoelastic behavior and which may lead to distorsion of the part, was emphasized. After, for instance, 3 months at 100 °C, the part showed no significant void content increase whereas, it was observed that thermal effects may affect the adhesion between the matrix and the fibers, thereby leading to decohesion of the part. This study demonstrated that a combination of numerical approach and experimental observations leads to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms governing consolidation and <b>deconsolidation</b> and then opens the path for an optimization of processing parameters and choice of materials...|$|E

40|$|The burning {{behavior}} of pressed binderless HMX laterally confined in 6. 4 mm i. d. steel cases was measured over the pressure range 1. 45 to 338 MPa {{in a constant}} pressure strand burner. The measured regression rates are compared to those reported previously for unconfined samples. It is shown that lateral confinement results in a several-fold decrease in the regression rate for the coarse particle size HMX above the transition to super fast regression. For class E samples, confinement shifts the transition to super fast regression from low pressure to high pressure. These results are interpreted {{in terms of the}} previously proposed progressive <b>deconsolidation</b> mechanism. Preliminary holographic photography and closed bomb tests are also described.

40|$|In recent decades, {{the most}} {{remarkable}} feature of East-Central European (ECE) states has been their engagement in a <b>deconsolidation</b> process that necessitates the reconceptualising of European Studies and the theory of democracy. In the early ’ 90 s, during the “revolution of high expectations,” consolidation was the key term in the conceptual framework of the transitology paradigm, but this approach was questioned increasingly in the 2000 s and rejected in the 2010 s. In its place, <b>deconsolidation</b> was introduced {{as one of a}} wide array of similar terms referring to the decline, backsliding or regression of democracy and later as one of a whole “other” family of opposite terms like (semi-) authoritarian system and competitive/elected autocracy. Indeed, rather than a transition to democracy, a tendency to transition to authoritarian rule has been observed in the ECE states in general and in Poland and Hungary in particular. In the last quarter century, the twin terms of Europeanisation and democratisation, which denote normative approaches, have been the main conceptual pillars of analyses of the ECE states. It turns out, however, that the opposite processes of de-Europeanisation and de-democratisation can now also be observed in these countries...|$|E
40|$|For years, many {{political}} scientists and research institutes endorsed South Korea (Korea hereafter) as a fully consolidated liberal democracy. This non-Western icon {{of liberal democracy}} recently underwent a series of setbacks due to the restoration of autocratic governance by the President Park Geun-hye government. Why did liberal democracy backslide in the highly globalized and modernized country, contrary to what is expected from modernization and other prominent theories of democratization? To explore this question, we propose a cultural theory of democratic <b>deconsolidation,</b> and test it with the latest wave of the Asian Barometer Survey conducted in Korea in 2015. The analysis indicates that socioeconomic development under the sponsorship {{of the state and}} big businesses has failed to “emancipate” both the ruling class and the masses from the Confucian legacies of political paternalism and social harmony. Moreover, it has failed to instill them with “the bourgeois impulse” to become a free and equal being. As the habits of their hearts and minds, these legacies powerfully motivate both groups to reembrace or condone the resurgence of autocratic political practices. Theoretically, therefore, the <b>deconsolidation</b> of liberal democracy in Korea and the prevalence of affinity for paternalistic autocracy among its people can be considered two solid pieces of evidence confirming the thesis of “No bourgeois, no democracy”. They can further be considered to support the orthodox Asian Values Thesis that Confucianism is inherently incompatible with liberal democracy...|$|E

A review of theoretical frameworks on democratic transition and consolidation reveals a rich choice of possible approaches to explaining the varied experiences summed up by the categories. A reversal of political liberalisation, a stalling or the unpicking of democratic transition, failures to consolidate democracy, and <b>deconsolidation</b> are all analytically distinct. In regard to their explanation, there are both symmetries and asymmetries with the many approaches to understanding successful democratisation. Any framework of analysis should be sensitive to possible new challenges to democratisation and to the established democracies...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{advances}} a deflationary {{interpretation of}} populism, Donald Trump and the United States Constitution. It accepts that Trump utilises a populist pose but rejects populism as too reductive for understanding his ascension and constitutional challenge. First, it argues {{that although he}} merits the designation, Trump reveals more about populism than populism does about him. Trump illustrates populism’s conceptual elasticity but employing it as a frame to understand him imposes coherence upon a figure whose monetised politics are chaotic, shallow and unanchored by principle. Second, populism provides a necessary but insufficient condition for critically explaining Trump’s ascension, either in terms of electoral populism or populism in power. Third, while democratic <b>deconsolidation</b> under Trump’s presidency cannot be discounted, the Constitution remains resilient in most important respects. A dispassionate constitutional sociology counsels a deflationary understanding rather than an uncritical alarmism that too frequently reproduces and reinforces the darker aspects of Trump’s populist political logic...|$|E
40|$|Stamp forming is a rapid {{manufacturing}} technology used to shape flat blanks of thermoplastic composite material into three-dimensional components. Currently, expensive autoclave and press consolidation {{are used to}} preconsolidate blanks. This study investigates the influence of preconsolidation on final consolidation quality after stamp forming and explores the potential of alternative blank manufacturing methods that could reduce part costs. Blanks were manufactured using various blank manufacturing methods and subsequently were stamp formed. The consolidation quality {{both before and after}} stamp forming was compared, where the focus was on void content as the main measure for consolidation quality. The void content was characterized through thickness and density measurements, as well as by microscopy analysis. Results indicate that preconsolidation quality does have an influence on the final consolidation quality. This is due to the severe <b>deconsolidation</b> and limited reconsolidation during stamp forming. Nevertheless, the potential of automated fiber placement and ultrasonic spot welding as alternative blank manufacturing methods was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the process of gender policy reform. It sought to explain how and when gender policy reform {{has taken place in}} Venezuela across time. The study entailed observations of gender policy reform during specific periods of Punto Fijo democracy (1958 - 1998) characterized by democratic consolidation and <b>deconsolidation,</b> and during the transition towards a new type of hybrid democracy, the Chávez era (1999 - 2007). The policies considered were the ones addressing women’s equality at home and at work, reproductive rights, women’s economic rights, and political participation. The analysis showed that the likelihood of gender policy reform depends on the combination of certain institutional configurations that provide women access to the decision-making process of the state, but most importantly to women’s groups’ capacity to organize a broad coalition of women from civil society and from within the state apparatus behind to push for a reform by using frames based on international agreed norms that legitimized their struggle. In addition, the analysis reveals the negative influence of religious groups with decision-making power on the process of gender policy reform...|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensioning}} of the {{locking device}} of a switch is made essentially {{as a function}} of the applied loads during the switch rails movement or considering a false route. The phenomena related to the vibrations induced by the track are therefore normally not taken into account. Such vibrations are particularly accentuated by the ballast bed <b>deconsolidation</b> in the sleeper panel supporting the locking device. Unfortunately, there is no specific technical reference in order to control these aspects, even though the most frequent cause of locking device components failures is relied to the vertical oscillations induced by the trains, rather than to the effort to commute the switch rails. In this study, the results of a field investigation carried out at two levels of ballast tamping are reported and discussed. It is found that the ballast compaction plays a fundamental role for the component to be prone to the early attainment of critical mechanical conditions. Procedures for the monitoring of the stability and efficiency of the ballast bed to ensure the required reliability of the locking device are also envisaged...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a potential role that tariff policy {{can play in}} encouraging countries {{to take part in}} a multilateral effort to mitigate climate change: it complements discussions on border tax adjustment which in law is limited to domestic taxation. It assesses whether increasing tariffs on products from polluting industries amounts to a violation of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and whether protectionism in this case can be differentiated from genuine environmental concerns. It argues that while lowering tariffs on environmental goods may serve as a carrot to promote dissemination of cleaner technologies, tariff <b>deconsolidation</b> is a legitimate stick to encourage polluting countries to move towards an international climate agreement. The article further explores this view by undertaking a partial equilibrium analysis to examine the impact of a unilateral 5 % tariff increase on the most carbon-intensive imports from countries not committed to climate polices. Our results, however, suggest that plurilateral action would be more effective than countries pursuing tariff policy in isolation, with the former leading to an average 1. 4 % net reduction in carbon-intensive imports from a 5 % increase in their tariffs...|$|E
