40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} a {{phenomenon}} created by an imbalance {{in the amount of}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) created within a cell, and the ability of its defence mechanisms to effectively deal with ROS. Oxidative stress is extremely deleterious to the cell, and is known to cause damage to DNA, proteins and lipids (Turrens, 2003). Mitochondria are the cell’s predominant producer of ROS (Murphy, 2009), but it has also been shown that increased protein folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) results in an increase in ROS levels (Malhotra, 2008), an issue particularly pertinent as developers move towards hard-to-express proteins. As well as many enzymes dedicated to the eradication of ROS, such as caspases, peroxidases and superoxide dismutases (SODs) the cell maintains a glutathione pool to buffer the increase of ROS (Lu, 2009). Design of Experiment models were designed and implemented using the growth, productivity and ROS content data from batch experiments in order to design anti-oxidant supplementation strategies. Two rounds of fed-batch screening were performed and a feeding strategy identified that improved the growth and ROS burden of three cell lines producing the same recombinant MAb product. A directed evolution strategy was employed to engineer oxidative stress resistant host cell lines through chronic exposure to Hydrogen Peroxide. Following transfection with a recombinant MAb product, the novel engineered cell line consistently outperformed the original cell line in terms of growth and ROS content, in both transient and stable transfection processes. Doubling time of stably transfected evolved cell line was reduced to 23 hours, a substantial time frame reduction. A link between ROS level reduction and improvement in cell line performance was demonstrated, with <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>needed</b> to unpick the mechanistic underpinnings of the oxidative stress resistance as well as to attempt to address the imbalance of improvements in growth compared to productivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{provided}} a one half hour session on our most recent study (See attached paper) methodology and findings. The presentation {{was very well}} received and audience members asked several pertinent questions both {{at the end of}} our session and afterwards about our findings. For the most part, these questions (and comments) confirmed our findings concerning the implementation of mobile learning in Nursing practice education, that is, other researchers have focused on the use of mLearning in health care and have reported having similar issues and experiences in their implementation efforts. They agreed that, as per our research agenda, we should now move to a more complete (non-pilot) study of the use of mobile devices in nursing practice education and also to examine this use from a more theoretical perspective. We are planning another study for January, 2009, which will address these issues. This paper focuses on an exploratory evaluation of the use of m-learning in nursing education. We report on Stage 2 of the formative evaluation of a project to integrate mobile learning into the Bachelor of Science Nursing curriculum in a Western Canadian college program. Third year nursing students and instructors used Hewlett-Packard iPAQ’s provided WiFi and GPRS wireless capability and were loaded with programs such as Microsoft Office Mobile 6. 0 and the 2007 Lippincott Nursing Drug Guide. Our participants found the mobile devices supplied to be easy to learn and comfortable to use. They felt that the devices were readily portable and the screen size sufficient for programs designed for this medium. However, they nonetheless had difficulty using the wireless connectivity afforded by the devices and found that, despite an initial orientation, they did not have time to fully learn the devices in the context of a busy course. We concluded that it was feasible to implement mobile devices in nursing practice education, but that <b>further</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>needed</b> on the use of m-learning for communication and interactive purposes.
