Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

More recent research from the same source has found that tort costs as a percentage of GDP dropped between 2001 and 2009, and are now at their lowest level since 1984. Jury Verdict Research, a database of plaintiff and defense verdicts, says awards in medical liability cases increased 43 percent in 1999, from $700,000 to $1,000,000. However, more recent research from the U.S. Department of Justice has found that median medical malpractice awards in states range from $109,000 to $195,000.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{acupuncture}} in Germany {{increased by}} 20% in 2007, after the German acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses. In 2011, {{there were more}} than one million users, and <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> estimated that two-thirds of German users are women. As a result of the trials, German public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not tension headache or migraine. This decision was based in part on socio-political reasons. Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials. For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments. Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{thriving}} {{venture capital}} industry has {{played an important}} role in funding the country's booming high-technology sector. The country is now teeming with hundreds of prosperous Israeli private equity and venture firms looking to invest in the next potential million or billion dollar business startup. Many of Israel's venture capital firms have billions of dollars under management that are seeking to invest in domestic Israeli companies in order to create value by marking a strong presence across the country. The financial crisis of 2007–08 also affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 mergers and acquisitions in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired. Numerous Israeli high tech companies have been acquired by global corporations for its reliable corporate management and quality personnel. In addition to venture capital funds, many of the world's leading investment banks, pension funds, and <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> a strong presence in Israel committing their funds to financially back Israeli high-tech firms and benefit from its prosperous high tech sector. These institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Credit Swiss First Boston, Merrill Lynch, CalPERS, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, and AIG.|$|E

500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals {{to decide when}} and how to receive their results and also to whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses are faced with the question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E

Further, the <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> their own overhead functions and profit margins, much of which could be eliminated with a single payer system. [...] Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would save $200 billion per year, primarily via insurance company overhead.

2500|$|The {{financial}} stability {{and strength of}} an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise {{many years in the}} future. [...] For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangement with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{incentives}} for people to take up private health insurance. Since 1999, the government has subsidised private health insurance premiums through the Private Health Insurance Rebate.

The rebate cuts out when a member's [...] "income for MLS purposes" [...] exceeds $140,000, and double for a family. Critics argue that the rebate is an unfair subsidy to those who can afford health insurance, claiming the money would be better spent on public hospitals where it would benefit everyone. Supporters argue that people must be encouraged into the private health care system, claiming the public system is not universally sustainable for the future. Similarly, even after the introduction of the rebate, some private health <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> <b>have</b> raised their premiums most years, to an extent negating the benefit of the rebate.|$|E
