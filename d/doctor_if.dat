5|$|In the TARDIS, the Doctor {{agrees to}} take Rose {{to the day}} her father died {{so that she can}} be there when it happens. Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987, they witness the {{accident}}, but Rose is unable to move when the Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father. Rose asks the <b>Doctor</b> <b>if</b> she can try again, and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former selves have left to prevent a paradox. As the accident is about to happen, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. The Doctor takes Rose's TARDIS key back and storms off without her. Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the TARDIS only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.|$|E

25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications {{should see a}} <b>doctor</b> <b>if</b> they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine {{may be used to}} block hormone synthesis before surgery.|$|E

50|$|Joe Spinell, {{who played}} Willi Cicci in The Godfather and Stallone's boss in Rocky, is {{featured}} as Nicky, a hired thug for Frances Amthor. Spinell was in poor health {{but it was}} his friend Robert Mitchum, who made sure that Spinell's scenes were filmed first so that he could get to the <b>doctors</b> <b>if</b> required.|$|R
25|$|When Phillips {{arrived in}} China, medical {{practices}} contrasted with Western practice. Instead of scientific methods, Chinese medicine {{was made up}} of mostly traditional methods derived from ancient times. Diagnosing patients was much different in China, where doctors diagnosed patients from observing them from the outside rather than using tests to examine internal parts of the body that may need attention (ARTICLE). As for overall well being, the Chinese believed that {{it had to do with}} a person’s internal harmony of yin and yang. The devil was blamed for all illness, but the real cause had to do with poor standards of hygiene. Phillips encountered many herbal medications in China; herbal remedies and acupuncture were both very popular treatments around this time. She also noted the practice developed by the locals in which they would simply hop from doctor to <b>doctor</b> <b>if</b> one did not provide an immediate cure.|$|E
25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production of that story, leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many ways, she might be claimed to be the companion most like her <b>Doctor</b> (<b>if</b> Romana I were not more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they flashed a light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his <b>doctor</b> <b>if</b> the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E

25|$|Moran asked Lafarge's {{doctors to}} perform a {{post-mortem}} examination on Lafarge. He had also learned of a new test {{for the presence of}} arsenic that pathologists in Paris were using and asked Lafarge's <b>doctors</b> <b>if</b> they could apply the same test in this case. Dr. Lespinasse hastily replied that they could, hiding their ignorance of the test and the intricacies of its procedure.|$|R
500|$|As Tubman aged, the seizures, headaches, and {{suffering}} from her childhood head trauma continued to plague her. At {{some point in}} the late 1890s, she underwent brain surgery at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Unable to sleep because of pains and [...] "buzzing" [...] in her head, she asked a <b>doctor</b> <b>if</b> he could operate. He agreed and, in her words, [...] "sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable". She had received no anesthesia for the procedure and reportedly chose instead to bite down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.|$|E
500|$|Moffat {{also brought}} back the {{character}} of River Song from his fourth series episodes [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". In the former, River asks the <b>Doctor</b> <b>if</b> he had done the [...] "crash of the Byzantium" [...] with her yet. Actress Alex Kingston did not expect the return, but stated that Moffat [...] "always intended that she would come back". Moffat was influenced by Audrey Niffenegger's novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, {{in which a woman}} {{falls in love with a}} man who unintentionally moves through time. Moffat used this inspiration in his episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace", but Alex Kingston, as well as reviewers have compared River to The Time Traveler's Wife.|$|E

Gautham surrenders to the police after [...] "killing" [...] the man, confessing that he killed three men: one in Belfast, one in Pune and one just now in Hyderabad. He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television. According to his <b>doctor,</b> <b>if</b> Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men, he can be treated. Gautham goes to Goa on vacation. Sameera stalks him, convincing him that two people are stalking him: a journalist who wants to interview him (imaginary), and a person claiming to be his fan (real). Gautham begins {{to fall in love with}} Sameera. He saves her from a group of people trying to murder her; on an isolated island together Gautham learns the truth behind the fourth imaginary person and writes Sameera off as a disturbed journalist.

50|$|Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active {{ingredient}} is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver upsets, which can produce jaundice (yellowing {{of the skin}} and the whites of the eyes). This condition will almost always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed.Patients taking the drug should tell their <b>doctors</b> <b>if</b> they notice these side effects.|$|R
40|$|Lawyer Karen Capen says funding cutbacks {{that have}} {{affected}} the services physicians can provide may cause legal problems for Canada's <b>doctors.</b> <b>If</b> cutbacks affect the care that is being provided, they should be discussed with the patient and noted on the chart. She says physicians have "good reason to be concerned" about increasing pressures that create an imbalance between health care resources and the demand and need for services. For some doctors, these have resulted in court cases...|$|R
2500|$|Jemison began {{dancing at}} the age of 11. [...] "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a {{professional}} dancer," [...] said Jemison. At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of [...] "Maria" [...] in West Side Story. She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer. [...] "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts," [...] says Jemison. [...] "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream." [...] Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, [...] "You can always dance if you're a doctor, but you can't <b>doctor</b> <b>if</b> you're a dancer." ...|$|E

The Fifth Doctor {{claims to be a}} doctor [...] "of everything" [...] in Four to Doomsday (1982), and a message is related from the Tenth Doctor in [...] "Utopia" [...] (2007). In talking with Harry in Robot (19741975) the Doctor states [...] "You may be a doctor, but I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say." [...] In The Ark in Space, aired later that year, the Doctor states that his doctorate is only honorary; the Tenth Doctor, however, considers the name to be his legitimate academic rank in [...] "The Waters of Mars" [...] (2009), describing his [...] "name, rank and intention" [...] as [...] "The Doctor; doctor; fun." [...] In an interview with The Age in 2003, Tom Baker mentioned that the Doctor is called so because he is [...] "a doctor of time and relative dimension in space".
