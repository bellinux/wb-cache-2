5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade <b>deals,</b> <b>and</b> with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E

Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he {{developed}} a staff of executives that – {{by the use of}} accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk accounting practices, but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Richard {{attempted}} a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke had slowed down his reaction time and weakened his depth perception.

After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found succor in a local church and later became a Christian minister.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office for {{personal}} gain, of taking part in questionable land speculation <b>deals,</b> <b>and</b> needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers renewed quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's {{contract}} with an eight-year, $102million agreement, {{the largest in}} franchise history.

5|$|The cost of {{operating}} Ars Technica {{has always been}} funded primarily by online advertising. Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now managed by Condé Nast. In addition to online advertising, Ars Technica has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and receive benefits including {{the ability to see}} exclusive articles, post in certain areas of the Ars Technica forum, and participate in live chat rooms with notable people in the computer industry. To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by IBM, and the site's Exploring Datacenters section is sponsored by data-management company NetApp. In the past, Ars Technica collected shared revenue from affiliate marketing by advertising <b>deals</b> <b>and</b> discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of Ars Technica-branded merchandise.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such <b>deals,</b> <b>and</b> the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E
