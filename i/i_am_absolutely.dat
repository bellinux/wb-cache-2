2500|$|IGN's Douglass C. Perry {{reviewed}} an import {{version of}} the game prior to its release in North America, and was disappointed {{with the lack of}} depth, but impressed by [...] other aspects. He praised the graphics, character design and CGI cutscenes. He was also impressed with the [...] "glowing" [...] effect used throughout the game; [...] "DreamFactory employs a Playboy-like filter that smoothes out every single bit on the screen. The effect is consistent throughout the game, and rids the PS2 of aliasing or flickering, but also provides a unique gloss that's never been used before with such success." [...] He concluded that, [...] "despite the disappointments, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>absolutely</b> having a great time with The Bouncer." [...] In his official review of the game upon its North American release, Perry scored it 7 out of 10, writing [...] "The game is a letdown, but not a catastrophic one. [...] It's a good game, not a great one, and it's worth a look." [...] He referred to Story Mode as a [...] "mixed bag of good ideas executed ineffectively," [...] although he praised multiplayer mode. He concluded [...] "The Bouncer is not the next messiah, it's not the next wave of fighting, and frankly, it's not the paradigm for anything really new, except perhaps incredible-looking graphics. These things said, The Bouncer is a decent game. It's not horrible, it's not brilliant. It's pretty average." ...|$|E

We had done a lot of homework on the start and the tyre degradation and I think we nailed them both. He described the race as [...] "tough" [...] and drove more conseratively with the knowledge he acculated from the previous [...] day's race and also made set-up and balance changes. Trummer said it felt [...] "really good" [...] to finish in second place and knew beforehand that he would achieve a good result in the sprint race. He stated he did not defend excessively against Palmer on the second lap because of his fast pace and was aware he had to conserve tyre life, [...] "But I was a bit wrong because he kept this strong pace all race long. Even {{at the end of the}} race I thought he would struggle more but he didn’t. It was really hard to attack him. That was a great race. I had a great pace and I’m happy with P2." [...] Third-place finisher Leal spoke of an [...] "unbelievable" [...] start of the season for himself and his team but focused their attention to the next race of the season. He said after the first corner, he was maintaining third place and praised Trummer for his performance in spite of not overtaking him in the first three laps.|$|E
