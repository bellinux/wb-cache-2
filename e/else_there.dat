5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or <b>else</b> <b>there</b> will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5|$|When {{the attack}} fails, the {{terrorist}} leader decides to target Jagadish himself. He kills Jagadish's friend and asks Jagadish {{to surrender to}} him or <b>else</b> <b>there</b> would be more terrorist attacks. Jagadish decides to sacrifice his life and devises a plan with his fellow army men. Jagadish meets the leader in a ship, which has been rigged with a bomb planted by Jagadish's friend. When he learns about the leader's plan of infiltrating the Indian Army with sleeper agents {{with the help of}} a traitor in the Indian Defense— Kameeruddin IAS, the current deputy secretary, Jagadish decides to abandon his suicidal plan. He mocks the leader and compels him to a fight before escaping in a boat, with the leader as hostage. After the ship explodes, he kills the bewildered leader. Jagadish confronts Kameeruddin and forces him to commit suicide, before returning to Kashmir along with his fellow army men.|$|E

25|$|The gezerah shavah ("Similar laws, similar verdicts") is {{the second}} rule of Hillel and of Rabbi Ishmael, and the seventh of Eliezer ben Jose HaGelili. This may be {{described}} as argument by analogy, which infers from the similarity of two cases that the legal decision given for the one holds good for the other also. The term gezerah shavah originally included arguments based on analogies either in word or in fact. Before long, however, the latter class was designated as hekkesh, while the phrase gezerah shavah was limited to analogy {{in the case of}} two different Biblical laws containing a word common to both. The gezerah shavah was originally restricted to a δὶς λεγόμενον, i.e., a word occurring only in the two passages offering the analogy. Since such a word is found nowhere <b>else,</b> <b>there</b> is no reason to assume that it bears different meanings in the two passages. The gezerah shavah consequently attaches to the word in the one passage the entire sequence of ideas which it bears in the other. Such a gezerah shavah is purely lexicographical, as seeking to determine the exact signification of a word by comparison with another passage in which the full meaning of such word is clear. The rule thus demonstrates itself.|$|E

[...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything <b>else...</b> <b>There</b> is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does {{say something about the}} springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E
