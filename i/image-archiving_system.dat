40|$|Marsviewer is a {{multi-platform}} application {{designed to}} aid in quality control, browsing, and analysis of original science product images (Experiment Data Records, or EDRs) and derived image data products (Reduced Data Records, or RDRs) returned by the Mars Explorer Rover (MER) mission. Marsviewer offers an abstraction of the products organization via a file finder. For example, the application understands the file structure and filename conventions of the MER Operational Storage Server, helping the user to navigate this complex file system to find desired images. Marsviewer also works with a flat file system, remote-operations file <b>systems,</b> <b>image-archive</b> file <b>systems,</b> and others. All EDRs found for a given solar day (Sol) are displayed in a list, optionally with thumbnail images. Once the user selects an image from the list, a tabbed pane conveniently displays the original source image and all associated RDRs. Marsviewer provides the option of overlaying derived images upon the source image, resulting in an easier-to-interpret color representation of the data. Display manipulations such as zoom, data range adjustment, contrast enhancement, and contour control are available. Image metadata (labels) from the current image can be displayed and searched. The architecture {{of the program is}} extensible: new types of RDRs can be installed and new file finders can be added to adapt the program to different file structures and different filename conventions. This keeps the application flexible and provides an opportunity for reuse with future rover missions...|$|R
