These ‘eyespots’ typically function to startle or otherwise deter predators, but few studies have examined how eyespots have evolved. We study the evolution of the posterior larval eyespot in the charismatic New World hawkmoth genus Eumorpha. While Eumorpha has a range of posterior larval eyespot shapes and sizes, little is known of how this trait has evolved because phylogenetic relationships of Eumorpha remain largely unknown. In this study, we included 62 individuals from 23 of 26 described Eumorpha species, and sequenced four genes (CAD, EF- 1 α, Wingless and COI), totaling 3773 base pairs. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods produced largely congruent trees with well-supported relationships. Our analyses reveal that Eumorpha probably had an ancestor with a posterior larval eyespot and that the eyespot was subsequently lost in at least three lineages. Eumorpha appears to have originated in Central and South America and expanded its distribution to North America...|$|R

Principal component and/or discriminant functions revealed that meristic characters were highly correlated with pectoral fin ray count, number of lateral line scales, as well as number of anal fin rays. The results indicate that T. chatareus can be distinguished from T. jaculatrix by having a greater number of lateral line scales, a lower number of pectoral fin rays, and a higher number of anal fin rays. In contrast, morphometric discriminant analyses gave relatively low distinction: 76. 1 % of fish were ascribed to the correct species cluster. The observed morphometric differences came from the dorsal and anal spines lengths, with T. chatareus having shorter dorsal and longer anal spines than T. jaculatrix. Overall, meristic traits were more useful than morphometrics in differentiating the two species; nevertheless, meristics and morphometrics together provide information about the morphological differentiation between these two closely related archer fishes...|$|E

There are two types of technology currently employed to help identify the container <b>external</b> <b>markings</b> with detailed cargo information, namely, (1) Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and (2) Radio Frequency Identification Tag (RFID). According to the author’s knowledge, there is no academic study to compare the cost and benefit of the two container monitoring technologies systematically. This research employed the AHP methodology to find out the major criteria influence the container yards ’ monitoring system selection decision by distributing AHP expert questionnaires to major stakeholders in the ocean container shipping industry in Taiwan. The initial finding indicates using an OCR system could result in a higher benefit /cost ratio, which means OCR is perceived to be the better container monitoring systems by most of the major carriers in Taiwan...|$|E
