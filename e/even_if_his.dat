5|$|Desertion was {{a problem}} for the 24th Infantry; the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 24th Infantry during August, {{compared}} to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, including its poor performance at the battle of Sangju several weeks earlier, and found its performance was affecting other units of the division. After the 24th's performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, Kean suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops be used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> other units were reinforced, he did not feel they could be extended to cover the entire line.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} here is that, {{from this}} time onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired to an even tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. There seems to {{be little doubt that}} the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E

25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try {{to hide from the}} media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if he {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E

500|$|Following the battle, the {{commander}} of the Numidian cavalry, Maharbal, urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: [...] "Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you {{do not know how to}} make use of your victory." [...] Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian Hans Delbrück pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy. Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, and the fact that he first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.|$|E
500|$|As a precautionary measure, in 1596 {{they were}} each arrested during Queen Elizabeth I's illness. [...] They were incarcerated at the White Lyon prison in 1601 for their {{involvement}} in the Earl of Essex's rebellion. Both were skilled swordsmen, and John was renowned for his courage. The Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond wrote that he possessed a [...] "good physique and sound constitution. [...] Rather on the tall side, his features were pleasing. [...] He was somewhat taciturn in manner, but very loyal to his friends, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>his</b> friends were few". Christopher's appearance was slightly {{different from that of}} his brother, [...] "not like him in face, as being fatter and a lighter coloured hair and taller of person". According to Father John Gerard, John's involvement with Essex coincided with his conversion to Catholicism. [...] Gerard also noted that John's household, Twigmoor Hall in Lincolnshire, was a place where [...] "he had Priests come often, both for his spiritual comfort and their own in corporal helps", although the government's description, [...] "a Popish college for traitors", was somewhat less favourable. Following his conversion John became [...] "a man of exemplary life". Two years later, as the queen's health waned, a nervous government ensured that John and Christopher were again imprisoned, the English antiquarian William Camden describing them as men [...] "hunger-starved for innovation". [...] Christopher may have travelled to Spain in 1603 using the alias Anthony Dutton, seeking Spanish support for English Catholics, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that Dutton's role may have been attributed to Christopher by Fawkes and Thomas Wintour, held in the Tower of London after the failure of the plot.|$|E
