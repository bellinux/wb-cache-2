She asks Samar for <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her film and develops a friendship {{with him and his}} team. She falls in love with Samar but he does not reciprocate her feelings because of his unresolved passion for Meera. Akira makes a successful film and prepares to leave for London. She wants Samar to come along to help her publicize the documentary. After he reluctantly agrees to come to London, he is struck by a car.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the inner membrane impermeable. Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

We would, however, {{have to accept that}} an autonomous agent is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century carvers gave up natural foliage {{treatment}} to a great extent, and took to more conventional forms. The oak and the maple no longer inspired the designer, but the vine was constantly employed.

25|$|The 1985 {{season was}} very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws {{struggling}} after a quick start. The team jumped out to a 4-2 start, including a 31-13 pounding of the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did not get enough <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs, and finished 8-10.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{adding more}} memory can <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a program run faster. For example, a {{filtering}} program will commonly read each line and filter and output that line immediately. This only uses enough memory for one line, but performance is typically poor, {{due to the}} latency of each disk read. Performance can be greatly improved by reading the entire file then writing the filtered result, though this uses much more memory. Caching the result is similarly effective, though also requiring larger memory use.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Federal Trade Commission in the USA {{considered}} {{the lack of}} privacy for children on the Internet, and created the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA limits the options which gather information from children and created warning labels if potential harmful information or content was presented. In 2000, Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was developed to implement safe Internet policies such as rules, and filter software. These laws, awareness campaigns, parental and adult supervision strategies and Internet filters can all <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Internet safer for children around the world.|$|E

All command names and parameter keywords {{are based upon}} uniform standardized and mostly 3-letter abbreviations for verbs and subjects, making for easy rendering and interpretation by the application developer, as opposed to other operating systems with often cryptic or inconsistent command names for related functions or command parameter switches. For instance, the parameter keyword to apply a text description to any object to be created or changed is spelled the same way for all such commands.|$|E

Those two venues are at a square northwest of Taipei Railway Station and the other is at Daan Forest Park. The reason to choose the park because the park is located just across the Taipei Grand Mosque. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin made a remark urging Taiwanese to be more considerate to foreign workers, telling them that those workers have <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Taipei a better city to live, thus Taiwanese should treat them like families.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{political}} abuse {{can be achieved}} through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections {{in order to ensure}} a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to put down their weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.|$|E

500|$|Many of Shelley's {{stories are}} set in places or times far removed from early 19th-century Britain, such as Greece and the reign of Henry IV of France. Shelley was {{particularly}} interested in [...] "the fragility of individual identity" [...] and often depicted [...] "the way a person's {{role in the world}} can be cataclysmically altered either by an internal emotional upheaval, or by some supernatural occurrence that mirrors an internal schism". In her stories, female identity is tied to a woman's short-lived value in the marriage market while male identity can be sustained and transformed through the use of money. Although Mary Shelley wrote twenty-one short stories for the annuals between 1823 and 1839, she always saw herself, above all, as a novelist.
