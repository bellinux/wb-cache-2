5|$|According to {{linguistic}} sources, the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland, in {{the forest}} zone regions far from the sea, and only later settled the near Baltic Sea areas, <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin. This westbound expansion resulted {{in the establishment of}} the two main Baltic branches: The Western Balts, represented by the extinct Old Prussians and Yotvingians, and the Eastern Balts including the modern nations of Lithuanians and Latvians.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route43, an {{unsigned}} legislative route <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern village line of Stillwater to {{the western}} village line of Schuylerville via the hamlet of Quaker Springs. On March 1, 1921, Route43 was renumbered to Route44 to eliminate numerical duplication with another legislative Route43 in western New York. At the same time, Route44 was extended southwest from Stillwater to Clifton Park via Mechanicville and west from Schuylerville to Saratoga Springs.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century sources {{refer to}} Palestine as <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route {{east of the}} Jordan River valley. Others {{refer to it as}} <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the {{partitioning}} of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.|$|E
5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were {{too small to be}} felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them.

5|$|The Mono–Inyo Craters form a {{volcanic}} chain in Eastern California that sits along a narrow north–south-trending fissure system <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north shore of Mono Lake through the western Long Valley Caldera, south of Mammoth Mountain. The chain {{is within the}} Inyo National Forest and Mono County; the nearest incorporated community is Mammoth Lakes.

5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surface to the depth {{where the light}} intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. <b>Extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E

5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> side of the flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa <b>extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rift Valley from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological {{evidence of the}} shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, flakes, flaked tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the Lunga {{perimeter}} was {{defended by}} four American regiments comprising 13 infantry battalions. The 164th Infantry Regiment guarded the easternmost sector. <b>Extending</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 164th {{south and west}} across Edson's Ridge to the Lunga River was the 7th Marine Regiment. Covering the sector west of the Lunga to the coast were the 1st and 5th Marine Regiments. Defending {{the mouth of the}} Matanikau for the Americans were two battalions under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William J. McKelvy: the 3d Battalion, 1st Marines, and the 3d Battalion, 7th Marines. McKelvy's force was separated from the Lunga perimeter by a gap that was covered by patrols.|$|E
