40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for estimating discharge {{in a river}} cross-section based on the combined use of dimensionless <b>isovels</b> and point velocity measurements. Specifically, taking the Biot–Savart law on the magnetic field induced by an electric current in a wire as their basis like Maghrebi (2003, 2006), the authors propose a different formulation of the relationship characterizing {{the effect of the}} wetted perimeter on the range of velocities in a cross-section in order to take explicit account of roughness, expressed by means of Manning’s coefficient. Once appropriately nondimensionalized, the isoeffect contours can be read as dimensionless <b>isovels.</b> Assuming in situ velocity measurements are available, discharge at a cross-section can be computed using two different methods. The proposed procedure was applied to six case studies characterized by river cross-sections which differed greatly from one another. The results show that the two methods proposed for estimating discharge lead to equivalent outcomes, and in all the cases the procedure as a whole enables a sufficiently accurate estimation of discharge, even when it is based on a limited number of velocity measurements or on the measurement of maximum surface-water velocity alone...|$|E
40|$|In tidal rivers with {{comparatively}} large width, {{estimation of}} the instantaneous discharge is a formidable task. In order to estimate the discharge {{a large number of}} measured velocity points are needed. Each point should be collected in a reasonable time interval. The flow characteristics in a tidal river with partially reverse flow are much more complicated. Maghrebi (2006) has previously introduced a model for the production of isovel contours in a normalized form, which can be used for estimation of discharge in artificial and natural channels. It is assumed that the velocity at each arbitrary point in the flow section is affected by the hydraulic characteristics of the boundary. In the present study, for the first time, the model is applied to a tidal river with partially reverse flow, which is caused by opening a sluice gate located asymmetrically close to the right bank of the Ohta floodway in Hiroshima, Japan. An acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) was used to measure the velocity profiles at different verticals. Then, the actual discharge in the river is estimated as the summation of the product of point velocity multiplied by the representative area over the whole section. In addition, the estimated discharge based on each measured point and the predicted <b>isovels</b> of flow cross section is obtained. The results show that the corresponding errors for the measured points away from the solid boundaries and the boundary of flow between the two opposite directions along a vertical, which are associated with lower absolute values of <b>isovels,</b> are reasonable...|$|E
40|$|In the {{scientific}} literature {{it is possible to}} find at least two methods for estimating discharge in an open channel which represent a valid alternative to the Velocity-Area method; both offer a considerable advantage in that they are simple to apply and require knowledge solely of the channel bathymetry and maximum surface velocity. The first method is based on the entropy concept introduced into hydraulics by Chiu in the 1990 s, whilst the second is focused on the reconstruction of dimensionless <b>isovels</b> in the channel cross-section. Both the methods have been extensively described in previous works and validated for medium/large-sized cross-sections where surface measurements are taken by current-meter or Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) sensor. In this technical paper, they are instead applied to a water drainage channel in a reclamation territory characterized by a very low velocity which required a particular measuring technique, called “total station”. This technique demonstrated to be reliable in situations where the velocity is very low and cannot be measured with other “no-contact” techniques, such as those based on the Doppler method, which are normally used when the use of current meters is not possible...|$|E

The Maximum velocity region in the river cross section could be identifying when the interest is hydrokinetic energy generation in rivers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the maximum velocities variation in the transverse section of Maracá River, near by a sustainable development protection region. O objective is to estimate the potential hydrokinetic energy generation. The quantification methodology of <b>isovel</b> and seasonal flow was based in hydrometric techniques using propeller reel along vertical profile. The experimental measurements were performed twice: the first in October 2007 (minimum flow) and seconde in February 2008 (near maximum flow). In the analyzed period was observed a significant variation in the geometric positioning <b>isovel,</b> which occurred probably due to change in the flow characteristics and of influence on geometry of wet perimeter over the flow. The variation of the position of maximum <b>isovel</b> was significant, indicating need for lateral repositioning of the turbine axis hydrokinetic for each season. This study has observed that the seasonally variation could be considerate a relevant parameter in projects of structures of support of turbine axis, improving the turbine operational efficiency and the electric generation capacity.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for estimating discharge {{in a river}} cross-section based on the combined use of dimensionless <b>isovel</b> contours and one or more point velocity measurements is presented. The procedure {{is derived from the}} Biot Savart law; in particular a specific formulation of the relationship characterizing the “effect” of the wetted perimeter on the range of velocities in a cross-section which depends on roughness, expressed by means of Manning’s coefficient is proposed. Once appropriately nondimensionalized, the “isoeffect” contours can be read as dimensionless <b>isovel</b> contours. At this point, assuming that a number of velocity measurements are available, it is possible to estimate discharge.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{equations}} {{have been proposed}} to determine dispersion coefficient of stream analytically since 1950. However, it is realized {{that it is difficult}} to use these equations for predicting the dispersion coefficients because they require the detailed information on velocity profile and cross-sectional geometry. To solve the problem, researchers tried to introduce empirical equations. This research presents an attempt to get back to the fundamental analytical equations, because it is believed that a simple model proposed by Maghrebi can provide a good prediction of the normalized <b>isovel</b> contours in the cross-section of open or closed channels that are irregular in roughness as well as geometry. The input data for the model are the bed profile and its shear and roughness distributions. Having obtained the <b>isovel</b> contours, the depth-averaged velocity profile at a cross-section can be extracted. In order to extract the parameters that characterize the longitudinal dispersion coefficients, applications of the model to the cross-sections of the Sacramento Delta in the Northern California and Clinch River near Speers Ferry in the US are presented. The evaluated parameters are the velocity deviation intensity ratio r, a dimensionless parameter I and the dispersion coefficient K, which is derived from the depth-averaged velocity profile by triple integration suggested by Fischer. The results of this study show that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient predicted by the use of <b>isovel</b> contours is close to the coefficients produced by measurement as well as theoretical methods...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{velocity}} gradients and secondary currents {{on the distribution of}} the shear force between the walls and bed of rectangular open channels. We show that neglecting the effect of secondary currents and assuming zero-shear division lines does not yield acceptable results. We, accordingly, introduce a method to determine the percentage of the total shear force acting on the walls and bed of rectangular open channels, which takes both the velocity gradients and secondary currents into account. Using the channel bisectors, along which there is no secondary flows effect, and orthogonal trajectories to <b>isovels,</b> along which there is no shear stress, we divide the channel cross section into three major subsections, namely bed area, walls area, and shared area. The geometry of each subsection is derived given the location of the maximum velocity. The share of the bed and wall shear forces from the shared area, are calculated afterward. The results for bed and walls shear forces agree well with the experimental data with an average relative error less than 5 % for both regular flows and flows carrying suspended sediment. This method also provides a physics-driven range for the wall and bed shear forces which nicely covers the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|We present CO(1 - 0) and CO(2 - 1) {{maps of the}} Seyfert galaxy NGC 7217, {{obtained}} with the IRAM interferometer, at 3 " and 1. 5 " resolution respectively. The nuclear ring (at r= 12 "= 0. 8 kpc) is predominant in the CO maps, with a remarkable surface density gradient between the depleted region inside the ring and the inner border of the ring. The CO nuclear ring is significantly broader (500 - 600 pc) than the dust lane ring. The CO(2 - 1) /CO(1 - 0) ratio is around 1, typical of optically thick gas with high density. The overall morphology of the ring is quite circular, with no evidence of non-circular velocities. In the CO(2 - 1) map, a central concentration might {{be associated with the}} circumnuclear ring of ionised gas detected inside r= 3 " and interpreted as a polar ring by Sil'chenko and Afanasiev (2000).

40|$|In this study, {{steady-state}} turbulent {{forced flow}} and heat transfer in a horizontal smooth semi-circular cross-sectioned duct was numerically investigated. The study {{was carried out}} in the turbulent flow condition where Reynolds numbers range from 1 · 104 to 5. 5 · 104. Flow is hydrodynamically and thermally developing (simulta-neously developing flow) under uniform surface heat flux with uniform peripheral wall heat flux (H 2) boundary condition on the duct's wall. A commercial CFD pro-gram, ANSYS Fluent 12. 1, with different turbulent models was used to carry out the numerical study. Different suitable turbulence models for fully turbulent flow (k-e Standard, k-e Realizable, k-e RNG, k-w Standard, and k-w SST) were used in this study. The results have shown that as the Reynolds number increases Nusselt num-ber increases but Darcy friction factor decreases. Based on the present numerical solutions, new engineering correlations were presented for the average Nusselt number and average Darcy friction factor. The numerical results for different tur-bulence models were compared with each other and similar experimental investi-gations carried out in the literature. It is obtained that, k-e Standard, k-e Realiz-able, and k-e RNG turbulence models are the most suitable turbulence models for this investigation. <b>Isovel</b> contours of velocity magnitude and temperature distribu-tion for different Reynolds numbers, turbulence models and axial stations in the duct were presented graphically.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the link between haemodynamics and atherosclerosis is reported in this thesis. A model of a C-shaped tortuosity of the cervical portion of the human internal carotid artery (ICA) was constructed from perspex and {{the flow of water}} through the model studied by dye visualisation and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA), for both steady and pulsatile flow conditions. Dynamic similarity between water flow in the model and blood flow in the artery was scaled by the Reynolds number and the frequencies of unsteady flow components scaled by the Strouhal number. Dye visualisation results are presented in a series of photographs, which illustrate the flow features in the model at given Reynolds numbers. Several differences from classical Dean-type motions in curved pipes were observed, including axial flow separation, flow asymmetry and an unexpected region of reverse flow, situated at the outer wall of the first bend in the model. A series of axial <b>isovel</b> contour maps were generated from LDA measurements, for planar slices located throughout the straight sections of the tortuosity. These are presented in the form of cross-sections, normal to the pipe's central axis for steady flow conditions, for a Reynolds number of 1500. The contours show the existence of separation regions, bounded by free shear layers, which are located along the walls downstream of the inner bends. Axial <b>isovel</b> contour maps are also presented for planar slices near the walls of the tube, under pulsatile conditions, for a mean Reynolds number of 1500 and a flow variation of ± 50 % about the mean. The flow features were qualitatively similar to those seen under steady flow conditions but the intensities of the separated flows were lower during pulsatile flow than during steady flow. The separation regions were observed to move back and forth along the walls of the tube. Steady flow conditions did not allow the quantitative prediction of the locations or magnitudes of pulsatile flow features at the same instantaneous Re. Shear rates at the walls of the tube were estimated from the contours, giving an estimate of the wall shear stresses. Regions in the model where flow separation was observed, consistently matched reported sites of proliferative atheroma in the tortuous ICA. It is concluded that regions subjected to low mean shear stresses but high fluctuating components of shear stress are associated with the proliferative lesion. Stress fluctuation fatigue of the arterial wall {{may play a role in}} initiating the proliferative lesion, by stimulating reparative processes, as suggested by Stehbens (1979). Pressure fluctuations are also implicated in the etiology of proliferative lesions. Separated shear layers in these regions are thought to be a source of pressure fluctuations, felt at the wall, especially near the reattachment position. Regions subjected to unidirectional, high shear rates, matched reported sites of atrophic atherosclerotic lesions and sites of calcification in early atheroma. The magnitude of the shear stresses in these regions does not appear to be as important, in relation to atrophic lesions, as the presence of a unidirectional shear stress. Stress fluctuation fatigue was not indicated as the cause of degenerative changes to the wall in these regions. A modification has been suggested of the unified hypothesis, described by Steinberg (1983), for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, allowing for the action of haemodynamic influences, especially in the initial stages of the disease. It has been postulated that haemodynamic factors may act in three ways: by inducing endothelial injury; by causing stress fluctuation fatigue of the blood vessel wall material; and/or by altering the transmural permeability to macromolecules, in particular low density lipoproteins. The transendothelial transport of macromolecules, in particular Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL's), via pinocytotic vesicles was examined. An exponential factor, allowing for hindered diffusion through the vesicle neck was derived and included into Arminski et al's (1980) equation, describing the permeability of an endothelial cell. The effect of convective perturbations on the observed diffusion coefficient of LDL within the short vesicle neck was found to be negligible. A mechanism for the convective enhancement of vesicular loading is postulated, which depends crucially on the spontaneous curvature of the vesicle wall material. Convective movements through the vesicle neck may overide a geometric equilibrium concentration partitioning effect, which limits the internal vesicle LDL concentration resulting from diffusional loading, to about one third of the plasma concentration. Hence, transendothelial cholesterol transport may be increased by convective loading, in the presence of blood flow disturbances, to 3 times over that resulting from diffusional loading only...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. {{research}} analyses {{the flow}} in straight and meandering compound channels having wide floodplains of large width ratio of value of nearly 12 and main channel aspect ratio {{of more than}} 5, which is very significant {{in the field of}} river hydraulics. Experiments were conducted in the Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics laboratory of National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India by casting smooth and rigid, straight and meandering compound channels inside a tilting flume. The research investigates the distribution of longitudinal velocity; depth averaged velocity for inbank and overbank flow cases in both straight and meandering compound channels. The measurement of the boundary shear stress for those flow conditions was done by Preston tube technique. As a complementary study to the experimental research undertaken in this work, two numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. Conveyance Estimation System (CES) developed by HR Wallingford,UK and CCHE 2 D developed by NCCHE, University of Mississippi,US are applied to simulate the overbank flow cases for both straight and meandering compound channels, for large scale EPSRC-FCF experiments and for a natural river. All the important flow parameters are also extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values. From the study of <b>isovels</b> for straight and meandering compound channels, velocity distribution coefficients are measured and new models are suggested for energy coefficient and momentum coefficient values in straight compound channels and meandering compound channels by validating the developed models with present data and data sets from previous research projects. Integrating the distribution of boundary shear stress over different zones of compound section of straight channel and analyzing them with several data sets of other researchers, new models for subsection shear force are suggested in case of straight compound channels. Using these models, the stage–discharge relations in case of straight compound channels having different width ratios are then developed. These developed models are validated with new experimental data as well as data sets of large scale experimental facility of FCF (Series A),UK; small scale data sets from flume experiments of other past researchers and with some field data of real river flood cases. The flow distribution in straight compound channel is also modeled and validated with data sets from different past studie...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Flow mechanisms of compound meandering channels are recognised {{to be far more}} complicated than compound straight channels. The compound meandering channels are mainly characterised by the continuous variation of mean and turbulent flow parameters along a meander wavelength; the existence of horizontal shear layer at the bankfull level and the presence of strong helical secondary flow circulations in the streamwise direction. The secondary flow circulations are very important as they govern the advection of flow momentum, distort <b>isovels,</b> and influence bed shear stress, thus producing a complicated and fully three-dimensional turbulent flow structures. A great deal of experiments has been conducted in the past, which explains flow mechanisms, mixing patterns and the behaviour of secondary flow circulations. However, a complete understanding of secondary flow structures still remains far from conclusive mainly because the secondary flow structures are influenced by the host of geometrical and flow parameters, which are yet to be investigated in detail. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and continuity equations were solved using a standard Computational Fluid Dynamics solver to predict mean velocity, secondary flow and turbulent kinetic energy. Five different flow cases of various model scales and relative depths were considered. Detailed analyses of the measured and predicted flow variables were carried out to understand mean flow mechanisms and turbulent secondary flow structures in compound meandering channels. The streamwise vorticity equation was used to quantify the complex and three-dimensional behaviour of secondary flow circulations in terms of their generation, development and decay along the half-meander wavelength. The turbulent kinetic energy equation was used to understand energy expense mechanisms of secondary flow circulations. The strengths of secondary flow circulations were calculated and compared for different flow cases considered. The main findings from this research are as follows. The shearing of the main channel flow as the floodplain flow plunges into and over the main channel influences the mean and turbulent flow structures particularly in the crossover region. The horizontal shear layer at the inner bankfull level generates secondary flow circulations. As the depth of flow increases, the point of generation of secondary flow circulations moves downstream. The secondary shear stress significantly contributes towards the generation of streamwise vorticity and the production of turbulent kinetic energy. The rate of turbulence kinetic energy production was found to be higher than the rate of its dissipation in the crossover region, which demonstrates that the turbulence extracts more energy from the mean flu...|$|E
40|$|Magnitude of flood {{prediction}} {{is the fundamental}} for flood warning, determining the development for the present flood- risk areas and the long-term management of rivers. Discharge estimation methods currently employed in river modeling software are based on historic hand calculation formulae such as Chezy’s, Darcy-Weisbatch or Manning’s equation. More recent work has provided significant improvements in understanding and calculation of channel discharge. This ranges from the gaining knowledge to interpretation of the complex flow mechanisms to the advent of computing tools that enable more sophisticated solution techniques. When the flows in natural or man made channel sections exceed the main channel depth, the adjoining floodplains become inundated and carry part of the river discharge. Due to different hydraulic conditions prevailing in the river and floodplain, the mean velocity in the main channel and in the floodplain are different. Just above the bank-full stage, the velocity in main channel {{is much higher than}} the floodplain. Therefore the flow in the main channel exerts a pulling or accelerating force on the flow over floodplains, which naturally generates a dragging or retarding force on the flow through the main channel. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channel water and that of the floodplain. The interaction effect is very strong at just above bank full stage and decreases with increase in depth of flow over floodplain. The relative “pull” and “drag” of the flow between faster and slower moving sections of a compound section complicates the momentum transfer between them. Failure to understand this process leads to either overestimate or underestimate the discharge leading to the faulty design of channel section. This causes frequent flooding at its lower reaches. Due to transfer of momentum between the subsections of the meandering compound channel, the shear distribution is largely affected. For such compound channels, the apparent shear force at the assumed interface plane gives an insight into the magnitude of flow interaction. The results of some experiments concerning the velocity distribution and the flow distribution in a smooth and rough compound meandering channel of rectangular cross section are presented. The influence of the geometry on velocity and flow distribution and different functional relationships are obtained. Dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the velocity distribution and flow distribution between main channel and flood plain subsections. Once these equations get formed one can judge the exact flow in main channel and flood channel sections which could possibly guide in flood prediction. The experiments concerning the flow in simple meander channels and meander channel - floodplain geometry have been conducted at the Fluid Mechanics and Water Resources Engineering Laboratory of the Department Civil Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India. Channels of different shapes and sizes have been fabricated in the laboratory with different equipments installed in them. Water is allowed to flow through these channels and the flow is maintained smooth. The Acoustics Doppler Velocitimeter (ADV) installed in the lab is worth mentioning. Taking the aid of a laptop terminal, this equipment helps in determining the three- dimensional velocities (Vx, Vy, Vz) at any point in the water channel. All the velocity readings obtained are recorded and finally velocity contours (i. e. <b>isovels)</b> are plotted with a software 3 D-Field. Depending on the flow pattern and shape of the channel, contours are obtained. All the contours are converted to bitmap image and finally inputted in MATLAB software. Now with this software discharge through a channel cross-section is generated which when compared to the actual flow discharge gives a very less percentage of error. Finally equations related to the flow distribution are formed based on the given datas. These formed equations are validated with datas collected from IIT Kharagpur (Bhattacharya, A. K. (1995) and those from Knight and Demetriou(Knight, D. W., and Demetriou, J. D., (1983) which satisfies them as well...|$|E
