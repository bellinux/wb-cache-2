5|$|Abu'l-Aswar or Abu'l-Asvar Shavur ibn Fadl ibn Muhammad ibn Shaddad was {{a member}} of the Shaddadid dynasty. Between 1049 and 1067 he was the eighth Shaddadid ruler of Arran (today in western Azerbaijan) from <b>Ganja.</b> Prior to that, he ruled the city of Dvin (in what is now Armenia and northeastern Turkey) from 1022 as an {{autonomous}} lord. A capable warrior, and a wise and cunning ruler, Abu'l-Aswar was engaged in several conflicts with most of his neighbours. During his rule over Dvin, he was mostly involved in the affairs of the Armenian principalities. He collaborated with the Byzantine Empire in its conquest of the last remnants of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, but when the Byzantines later turned on him, he survived three successive offensives that sought to take <b>Ganja.</b> In 1049, a revolt in <b>Ganja</b> overthrew his infant great-great-nephew, Anurshirvan. The rebels invited him to take up the family's emirate, and he moved from Dvin to <b>Ganja.</b> Under his rule, the Shaddadid dynasty reached its zenith. He undertook successful campaigns into Georgia and Shirvan, although the limits of Shaddadid power were exposed by his failure to take over the Emirate of Tiflis and by devastating raids by the Alans. At the same time, his reign witnessed the rapid rise of the Seljuk Empire and the extension of its control over the Transcaucasian principalities. Abu'l-Aswar became a Seljuk vassal in 1054/5. Although he gained control over the former Armenian capital of Ani through Seljuk patronage in 1065, this association also paved the way for the dynasty's decline after his death in November 1067.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{interest}} in the Caucasus soon waned after Peter's death in 1725 as its leaders pulled their forces back across the Terek River. and the gained territories in the North and South Caucasus were ceded back to Iran (now led by Nader Shah) per the treaties of Resht and <b>Ganja</b> of 1732 and 1735, respeticely.|$|E
5|$|Abu'l-Aswar died on 19 November 1067, and {{was buried}} {{at the main}} mosque of <b>Ganja.</b> He was succeeded by his eldest son, Fadl II, whom he had already {{announced}} as his heir, and to whom the oath of allegiance (bay'ah) had been taken by the Shaddadid family, {{the army and the}} people of Arran. Apart from Fadl, Abu'l-Aswar had four more sons—Ashot, Iskandar, Manuchihr, and Marzuban—as well as an unnamed daughter, wife of the Shirvanshah Sallar.|$|E
5|$|Defeats in late March {{already had}} the Azeri {{military}} evacuating civilians out of the region to the northern town of Yevlakh and Azerbaijan's second largest city, <b>Ganja.</b> The Armenians had assembled a force of several hundred men to enter Kelbajar from four different directions: Melkonian's own detachment of tanks and troops from Karabakh would attack from the southeast, one fifty-man unit {{from the town of}} Vardenis, Armenia would enter from the west; the third force would attack from the village of Aghdaban in the north, and the primary attacking force would come from the village of Narınclar.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, as demonstrated by the attack on <b>Ganja</b> by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
5|$|In 1030, the Rus' {{raided the}} region of Shirvan; the ruler of <b>Ganja</b> then paid them much money to help {{suppress}} a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus' raid into Shirvan; {{they were joined by}} the Alans and Sarir. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. Omeljan Pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near the Terek estuary and had their principal home in Tmutarakan. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the Oghuz in a power struggle in Khwarezm.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern <b>Ganja,</b> Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven children.

Then again in 1809, the Bozchalou and Ayromlou tribes of <b>Ganja</b> get to Nakhchivan, and they were renamed to Qarapapaq (Black hat in Azeri language), and finally after Nakhjavan was ceded to Russia, they went to Solduz (Naqadeh), that is a place in Iranian West Azerbaijan Province.
