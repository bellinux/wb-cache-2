5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim {{that it is}} not fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E
5|$|Mystery Science Theater 3000 had {{the design}} of its main setting, the {{starship}} Satellite of Love, based on the bone-shaped satellite featured in the match cut from prehistoria to the future. The one-eyed design of the robot Gypsy led the show to do various scenes comparing it to HAL 9000, including {{a scene from the}} , where the opening featuring Mike Nelson jogging along the walls of the Satellite of Love parodies the scene where Frank Poole <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in the Discovery.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peter {{practices}} his web slinging in his bedroom, when Aunt May walks in. He {{stops and}} she suggests he takes their neighbor Mary Jane Watson to the upcoming Fall Formal. Peter cringes {{at the idea}} and heads off to school. There, it is announced football practices will be held that day and Harry wants to try out. Peter passes on joining him as he feels it will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try out anyway. They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> using his extra abilities.|$|E

5|$|The ship can {{be moved}} {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a set number of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to decide if the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E
5|$|Rudy's {{attraction}} to the veterinarian's wife leads to them having consensual sex {{in front of her}} husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in a motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to Fran.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is well {{adapted to}} dry environments, and M.l. leuconotus is found {{throughout}} arid and semi-arid environments between latitudes 19 and 32oS in mainland Australia. It occupies coastal Western Australia from around Port Hedland south to Perth, and stretches eastwards over to Mount Isa in Queensland, {{and along the}} western parts of the Great Dividing Range through central Queensland and central western New South Wales, into the northwestern corner of Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula and across the Nullarbor. It commonly cohabits with other species of fairywren, including the purple-backed fairy-wren (M. lamberti assimilis). White-winged fairywrens often inhabit heathlands or treeless shrublands dominated by saltbush (Atriplex) and small shrubs of the genus Maireana, or grasses such as tussock grass (Triodia) and cane-grass (Zygochloa), as well as floodplain areas vegetated with lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). M.l.leucopterus inhabits similar habitats on Dirk Hartog Island and M.l.edouardi <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on Barrow Island. The white-winged fairywren is replaced {{to the north of}} its range on mainland Australia by the red-backed fairywren.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in the other universe, {{as if trying to}} listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of Annie Wheaton {{is similar to}} another Stephen King character, Carrie White—the main character from Stephen King's first published novel, Carrie.

Likewise, the epilogue of Carrie contains a brief appearance of a young girl named Annie who, it appears, has the same powers as Carrie.|$|E

Using the BNSF trackage, Amtrak provides passenger rail service on its Southwest Chief line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Amtrak's Lawrence station is a few blocks east of downtown.|$|E

A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their beaks.|$|E

25|$|Foote's {{substantive}} commentary in the Burns film {{dealt with}} a wide variety of battles, characters military and civilian, and issues. He also explained a puzzling question on nomenclature: why <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> battle often have two names? Foote's answer: Northerners are usually from cities, so rivers and streams are noteworthy; whereas Southerners are usually rural, so they find towns noteworthy. Some examples are the First and Second Battles of Bull Run, known as First and Second Manassas, and the Battle of Antietam, also called the Battle of Sharpsburg.|$|E

Nisia <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but the flame expires {{and there is a}} clap of thunder. The people are astonished at this portent and the priests withdraw from the table. Gyges, enraptured with Nisia, ignores the warning, takes the Queen towards the gardens and commands the festival to begin.|$|E

The Walt Disney Company, which sold off ABC Radio in 2007 to Citadel Broadcasting (which was merged into Cumulus in 2011) still owns two networks, ESPN Radio and Radio Disney. ESPN has only a few owned-and-operated stations in mostly major markets, but almost all of Radio Disney's outlets were owned by Disney itself prior to its transition to a mainly digitally distributed service in 2014 (leaving Los Angeles flagship KDIS as the network's only remaining O until 2017, when it became affiliated with spin-off network Radio Disney Country).|$|E
