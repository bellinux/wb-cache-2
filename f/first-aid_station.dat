25|$|The {{military}} officially {{named the}} camp Elliott Combat Base, {{but more often}} than not it was simply known as the Rockpile. The location seemed vulnerable to many of the soldiers that defended it due to its location in the center of an open valley, along a river, with elephant grass growing much closer to the perimeter of the base than most other camps located throughout northern South Vietnam. Once inside the barbed wire boundary, the congested and disorganized layout of the base area was immediately noticeable. Tents, low bunkers, and trenches commingled across the camp in no particular order or arrangement. The three largest tents at the Rockpile all possessed dirt floors with canvas sides and served as a kitchen, a mess hall, and a <b>first-aid</b> <b>station.</b> The dining tent had no chairs or tables, but instead long planks were positioned slightly over waist high so soldiers could stand and eat.|$|E

25|$|The funeral on 12 November 1970 was {{the biggest}} such event in French history, with {{hundreds}} of thousands of French people—many carrying blankets and picnic baskets—and thousands of cars parked in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations</b> at the rear. The General was conveyed to the church on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.|$|R
50|$|Most of the time, {{there were}} vacant beds. It did not suit {{the crew and}} staff that the beds were unused, when they {{observed}} the hardship and misery in the civilian population. The female nurses were not allowed ashore, but the doctors and male nurses sometimes helped on improvised <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations.</b> Quite unofficially the local population got some aid, and in certain cases patients were brought on board. A number of orphans were found, some of those were sent on board for some care, too. A small childrens department was created in an unused corner of the officers ward. The American captain McKeon had started a small childrens hospital, Happy Mountains, {{on the outskirts of}} Pusan. He got assistance from the ships doctors. It went so far that medicine disappeared from the storage - later to be refound at the childrens hospital. General MacArthur certainly got the initiative he had craved.|$|R

5000|$|The {{workload}} of the Commune leaders {{was usually}} enormous. The Council members (who were not [...] "representatives" [...] but delegates, subject in theory to immediate recall by their electors) {{were expected to}} carry out many executive and military functions {{as well as their}} legislative ones. Numerous organizations were set up during the siege in the localities (quartiers) to meet social needs, such as canteens and <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations.</b> For example, in the 3rd arrondissement, school materials were provided free, three parochial schools were [...] "laicised", and an orphanage was established. In the 20th arrondissement, schoolchildren were provided with free clothing and food. At the same time, these local assemblies pursued their own goals, usually under the direction of local workers. Despite the moderate reformism of the Commune council, the composition of the Commune as a whole was much more revolutionary. Revolutionary factions included Proudhonists (an early form of moderate anarchism), members of the international socialists, Blanquists, and more libertarian republicans.|$|R
5|$|Local {{chapters}} of the American Red Cross organized <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations</b> and shelters; transportation was provided {{to those who were}} unable to reach the shelters. In advance of the storm, Pan American World Airways suspended flights departing from and arriving at Miami and redirected them to Havana, Cuba. The United States Navy also prepared its bases in the Florida Keys for the arrival of the storm by securing boats to piers and canceling all shore leaves, while the United States Army Air Corps moved its planes from Morrison Field to a safer location inland. The state of Florida stockpiled food for those affected by the storm, establishing depots in West Palm Beach, Miami, and Fort Myers, and the Governor of Florida, Spessard Holland, ordered state agencies to prepare for relief work. A detachment of officers from the Florida Highway Patrol was sent to Miami and patrolled along highways to provide gasoline to motorists evacuating the storm.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} deal with the urgent public {{security}} incidents timely, to meet the requirements of the shortest emergency time, to consume the least emergency resources and rescue points, it’s necessary to achieve a compromised site selection scheme that reflects a decision maker’s preference on time and cost, in the decision about a city’s layout of fire station is to probe into the site selection of safe emergency station under the emergency restrictions. This research used an improved heuristics to explore the solving of combination model about multi-rescue points under the limitation of time and resource, provided the emergency restrictions and a cost model about establishment of the safety emergency facilities, and proved the correctness of the model solution method theoretically. In a limited emergency time, this paper analyzed and obtained selection method on emergency service facility points. Through a numerical example illustrated that specific application of the calculation method, this method is suitable for the planning and construction of the public facilities, such as fire control, hospital <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations.</b> Providing Problem If the number of emergency service facility points are given, how to chose a fire station to make facilities can reach the emergency site in the shortest possible time when any emergency sites onc...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe a 12 -year (1997 – 2008) observation of substance-related incidents occurring at rave parties in the Netherlands, including length of visits to <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations,</b> substances used, and severity of the incidents. During rave parties, specifically trained medical and paramedical personnel staffed first aid stations. Visitors were diagnosed and treated, and their data were recorded using standardized methods. During the 12 -year period with 249 rave parties involving about 3, 800, 000 visitors, 27, 897 people visited a first aid station, of whom 10, 100 reported having a substancerelated problem. The mean age of these people was 22. 3 +/ 25. 4 years; 52. 4 % of them were male. Most (66. 7 %) substancerelated problems were associated with ecstasy or alcohol use or both. Among 10, 100 substance-related cases, 515 required professional medical care, and 16 of these cases were life threatening. People with a substance-related problem stayed 20 min at the first aid station, which was significantly longer than the 5 min that those without a substance-related health problem stayed. These unique data from the Netherlands identify a variety of acute health problems related to the use of alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, and GHB. Although most problems were minor, people using GHB more often required professional medical care those using the other substances. We recommended adherence to harm and ris...|$|R

40|$|Problem: The Great East Japan Earthquake, which {{occurred}} in Tohoku, Japan on 11 March 2011, {{was followed by}} a devastating tsunami and damage to nuclear power plants that resulted in radiation leakage. Context: The medical care, equipment and communication needs of four Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMAT) during four missions are discussed. DMATs are medically trained mobile teams used in the acute phase of disasters. Action: The DMATs conducted four missions in devastated areas from the day of the earthquake to day 10. The first and second missions were to triage, resuscitate and treat trauma victims in Tokyo and Miyagi, respectively. The third mission was to conduct emergency medicine and primary care in Iwate. The fourth was to assist with the evacuation and screening of inpatients with radiation exposure in Fukushima. Outcome: Triage, resuscitation and trauma expertise and equipment were required in Missions 1 and 2. Emergency medicine in hospitals and primary care in <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations</b> and evacuation areas were required for Mission 3. In Mission 4, the DMAT assisted with evacuation by ambulances and buses and screened people for radiation exposure. Only land phones and transceivers were available for Missions 1 to 3 although they were ineffective for urgent purposes. Discussion: These DMAT missions showed that there are new needs for DMATs in primary care, radiation screening and evacuation after the acute phase of a disaster.

40|$|In a mine {{emergency}} where refuge is necessary, miners may sustain {{injuries that}} will render them {{unable to walk}} or crawl. In this situation, a miner may {{have to rely on}} others for transportation into the mobile refuge alternative (RA) while on a stretcher. Since requirements for mine <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations</b> were developed before RAs, stretchers should be evaluated to determine whether they are usable in an RA and within the physical capabilities of miners in a refuge. The size of the RA airlock is a concern, as it has not been determined if current airlocks will accommodate a miner on a stretcher. This study evaluated the time required to move three types of stretchers into two commercially available RAs. The splint stretcher had the longest average time to move into each RA as compared to the backboard and soft stretcher. This increase was mostly due to the increased time requirements for getting the splint stretcher into the airlock. For all stretchers, it took approximately two to three times longer to enter the inflatable tent-type RA compared to the rigid steel RA. Mining companies should consider how well their current first-aid implements work with their RAs and manufacturers of inflatable RAs should maximize the size of the outer doors leading into the airlock to allow an easier entry for stretchers.

40|$|This paper proposes an effective, {{reusable}} {{solution for}} modeling and simulation. The {{approach is to}} develop a Software Product Line (SPL) architecture that explicitly captures the commonality and variability in a family of similar simulation systems. First responders and incident management personnel need better training resources to prepare for possible catastrophic events, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. Live exercises are often very expensive to organize and conduct. With modeling and simulation technology, simulation-based exercise and training models could be developed. The SPL technology enables the simulation system to easily adapt to multiple contexts and allows the simulation system to reconfigure quickly. SPL models can be developed at different levels of scope and depth to suit the emergency responder’s needs. By reusing the system requirement analysis, software architectures, and design, the development time is shorter, the development cost is lower, and the quality is easily maintained. This paper focuses on the application of SPL technology to simulation systems of emergency facilities, such as hospital emergency rooms, on-site emergency triage <b>stations,</b> decontamination <b>stations,</b> <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations,</b> and ambulances. The paper also introduces a prototype simulation of the SPL member system – a hospital emergency room simulation system that has been developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The first was the coastline itself, fairly straight, covered with hard sand and offering no particular difficulties. However, a bare 100 meters beyond began the dunes, varying in height from 15 to 60 feet, very hard to climb and ending on the land side in veritable ditches or precipices.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{conservation}} biology is recognizing and {{bridging the gap}} between scientific results and specific action. We examine sea turtles—charismatic yet endangered flagship species—in the Mediterranean, a sea with historically high levels of exploitation and 22 coastal nations. We take sea turtle rescue facilities as a visible measure for implemented conservation action. Our study yielded 34 confirmed sea turtle rescue centers, 8 <b>first-aid</b> <b>stations,</b> and 7 informal rescue institutions currently in operation. Juxtaposing these facilities to known sea turtle distribution and threat hotspots reveals a clear disconnect. Only 14 of the 22 coastal countries had centers, with clear gaps in the Middle East and Africa. Moreover, the information flow between centers is apparently limited. The populations of the two species nesting in the Mediterranean, the loggerhead Caretta caretta and the green turtle Chelonia mydas, are far below historical levels and face a range of anthropogenic threats at sea and on land. Sea turtle rescue centers are acknowledged to reduce mortality in bycatch hotspots, provide a wealth of scientific data, and raise public awareness. The proposal for a Mediterranean-wide rescue network as published by the Regional Activity Centre for Specially Protected Areas a decade ago has not materialized in its envisioned scope. We discuss the efficiency, gaps, and needs for a rescue network and call for establishing additional rescue centers and an accompanying common online database to connect existing centers. This would provide better information on the number and types of rescue facilities on a Mediterranean scale, improve communication between these facilities, enhance standardization of procedures, yield large-scale data {{on the number of}} treated turtles and their injuries, and thus provide valuable input for targeted conservation measures...|$|R
