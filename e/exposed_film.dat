When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of <b>exposed</b> <b>film</b> to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the problem could have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E

500|$|Keechaka Vadham was {{the first}} silent film made in South India. According to film {{historian}} Randor Guy, Nataraja Mudaliar established a film laboratory of his own in Bangalore to process the film negatives as there was no film laboratory in Madras. Nataraja Mudaliar believed that Bangalore's colder climate [...] "would be kind to his <b>exposed</b> <b>film</b> stock". He processed the film negatives there each weekend and returned on Monday morning to resume the film's shooting.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{of actors}} was {{completed}} in September 1967, and from June 1966 until March 1968 Kubrick {{spent most of his}} time working on the 205 special effects shots in the film. The director ordered the special effects technicians on 2001 to use the painstaking process of creating all visual effects seen in the film [...] "in camera", avoiding degraded picture quality from the use of blue screen and traveling matte techniques. Although this technique, known as [...] "held takes", resulted in a much better image, it meant <b>exposed</b> <b>film</b> would be stored for long periods of time between shots, sometimes as long as a year. In March 1968, Kubrick finished the 'pre-premiere' editing of the film, making his final cuts just days before the film's general release in April 1968.|$|E
500|$|On January21 Hemingway {{chartered}} a sightseeing {{flight of}} the Congo Basin as a late Christmas present to Mary; two days later, {{on their way to}} photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane hit an abandoned utility pole and crashed, with the passengers sustaining minor injuries. That night they camped in the bush waiting for a response to their distress call. The crash site was seen by a passing airliner that reported no survivors, and the news of Hemingway's death was telegraphed around the world. [...] The next day they were found and picked up by a bush pilot, but his de Havilland caught fire during take-off, crashed and exploded, which left Hemingway with a concussion, scalp wound, double-vision, intermittent hearing in his left ear, a crushed vertebra, ruptured liver, spleen and kidney, and burns. The explosion burned their passports, [...] "thirty rolls of <b>exposed</b> <b>film,</b> three pairs of Ernest's bifocals, all of their money, and their $15,000 letter of credit." [...] The group traveled to Entebbe by road, where journalists from around the world had gathered to report his death. On January26 Hemingway briefed and joked with the reporters, and spent the next few weeks in Nairobi recuperating and reading his obituaries. During his recuperation Hemingway immediately prepared the piece for Look. The magazine paid him an additional $20,000 for an exclusive about the plane crashes. Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that the piece, [...] "ran for twenty magazine pages spread out over two issues", with the first issue bearing a publication date of 26January.|$|E

500|$|Even as the Wall Street {{crash of}} October 1929 helped plunge the United States and {{ultimately}} the global economy into depression, {{the popularity of the}} talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune. The 1929–30 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous, with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs. Reality finally struck later in 1930, but sound had clearly secured Hollywood's position {{as one of the most}} important industrial fields, both commercially and culturally, in the United States. In 1929, film box-office receipts comprised 16.6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation; by 1931, the figure had reached 21.8 percent. The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half. Hollywood ruled on the larger stage, as well. The American movie industry—already the world's most powerful—set an export record in 1929 that, by the applied measure of total feet of <b>exposed</b> <b>film,</b> was 27 percent higher than the year before. Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded. In fact, the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers, relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards. The production of multiple versions of export-bound talkies in different languages (known as [...] "Foreign Language Version"), as well as the production of the cheaper [...] "International Sound Version", a common approach at first, largely ceased by mid-1931, replaced by post-dubbing and subtitling. Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets, by 1937, American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe.|$|E

The lens cap left on the camera, Geller would take {{pictures}} of his forehead and then have the pictures developed. Geller claimed that subsequent images had come directly from his mind. James Randi claimed Geller had performed the trick by using a [...] "handheld optical device" [...] or by taking photographs on already <b>exposed</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The second search flight {{took off}} at 2310 AT, 21 February 1947, in B-29 45-21761 (Boeing's Boner). [...] As the Kee Birds navigators were {{constantly}} making celestial observations {{in order to}} aid the search planes in locating them, the mission was much easier since more information was received as to the lost airplane's approximate position. [...] In addition, more time was available in which to plan the mission, and a direct course was set to Greenland. [...] On reaching the area where Kee Bird had landed at 0745 AT, a search was started and with information from the lost crew. [...] The first actual sighting was made at 0830 AT. [...] Eight runs were made over the downed plane, dropping the supplies carried for that purpose. [...] Kee Birds crew requested that some coal be dropped to them in order that they could build a fire for warmth and cooking. [...] The crew was instructed to destroy the radar, Loran, and the IFF sets, and to bring back, when they were evacuated, all <b>exposed</b> <b>film,</b> airplane files and all maps. [...] 21761 then returned to Ladd and landed safely.|$|E
