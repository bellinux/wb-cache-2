Germination of seeds was conducted in the growth chamber at the light and temperature regime – day/night – 12 / 12 hours, 23 / 15 ˚C, rh 70 %, for 42 days. Extracts significantly affected the total germinability and germination rate of Poa annua L. seeds (p = 0. 000). The lowest germinability (27. 3 ± 7. 1 %) and germination rate (0. 7 ± 0. 2 seeds per day) had Poa annua L. seeds germinated in Poa pratensis L. aqueous extract. Used extracts (except for <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> extract) had significantly inhibitory effect on length of Poa annua L. roots in comparison with control variant.

Festuca juncifolia St. Amans is {{considered}} to be a typical grass of Ammophiladunes. <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> subsp. arenaria (Osb.) Richt. could be found on almost fixed dunes. The only usable character mentioned in morphological descriptions, is formed by the sclerenchyma in the leafblades. In Festuca juncifolia the sclerenchyma must be present in a thick continuous layer. In <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> subsp. arenaria the sclerenchyma must consist of separate strands. In 1966 and 1967 58 samples of Festuca-plants, both vegetative shoots and culms, were collected on the outmost dune ridge on the island of Voorne (Netherlands). Almost all plants investigated appeared to possess separate sclerenchyma strands. From this it could be concluded that the Voorneplants belong to the taxon <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> subsp. arenaria. However, the authors prefer to follow KJELLQVIST (1964).

Dehardening resistance and rehardening capacity are important traits for survival of low freezing temperatures following warm spells during winter and early spring. Our {{objective was to}} determine plant hardiness {{at the start of}} winter and dehardening resistance of six cool-season turfgrass species/subspecies commonly used on golf greens. Plant material was collected on an experimental green at Bioforsk Landvik, SE Norway in late November 2011 and 2012 and subjected to six or twelve days of dehardening at 10 °C in a growth chamber. The ranking order for freezing tolerance (measured as lethal temperature for 50 % plants (LT 50)) of turfgrasses taken from the field in late November was: annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) (− 13 to − 14 °C) < colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) (− 18 to − 20 °C) ≤ slender creeping fescue (<b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> trichophylla <b>L.)</b> (− 19 °C) ≤ chewings fescue (<b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> commutate <b>L.)</b> (− 21 °C) < velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canina L.) (− 23 to − 27 °C) ≤ creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) (<− 30 °C). The main dehardening occurred during the first 6 days at 10 °C and dehardening rates increased in the order: slender creeping fescue < chewings fescue < colonial bentgrass < annual bluegrass < creeping bentgrass. The dehardening rate of velvet bentgrass was inconsistent in the two years. An additional rehardening treatment at 2 °C for 23 days was included in 2012. None of the species were able to reharden to their original freezing tolerance after 12 -d dehardening at 10 °C. Low overall freezing resistance and less capacity to reharden in annual bluegrass than in the other species was associated with more leaf growth during both hardening and dehardening. The results indicate that hardening ability and dehardening resistance are not necessarily positively correlated and that the turfgrasses studied have developed different strategies to survive the winter...|$|R

Analysis of mean results concerning the structure of the floristic composition of mixtures based on <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> (60 %) shows that in all 9 types of mixtures there was balance between the degree of participation of (creeping) red fescue and the share of the other two legume species studied.

These values decreased, on the average, with 10 % when applying a rate of N 50 and with 14 % when applying a rate of N 100. In the complex mixture, there was a mean value of the degree of participation of the two species of legumes of 46 % (with a higher share of the bird’s-foot trefoil) in the control variant, of 34 % in the variant treated with N 50 and of 30 % in the variant treated with N 100...|$|E

Simultaneously, measurements of Chl-F and total chlorophyll content (Chl a+b) were made on a single leaf at ground level were collected. A specifically designed 2 ̆ 7 shade removal 2 ̆ 7 experiment revealed the influence of dynamic physiological plant processes on hyperspectral reflectance of three wavelengths: 532, 686 and 740 nm. Based on this information, the vegetation indexes R 686 /R 630, R 740 /R 800 and PRI calculated as (R 532 R 570) /(R 532 +R 570) were tested for statistical significance with directly measured Chl-F parameters (maximum fluorescence yield, Fv/Fm; steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence, Chl-Fs and actual quantum yield, ΠII). The grassland species under investigation were: <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> agg. (<b>L.),</b> Hieracium sp., Plantago sp., Nardus stricta (L.) and Jacea pseudophrygia (C. A. Meyer). The coefficients of determination (R 2) for best-fit relationships between PRI-ΠII and PRI-Chl-Fs, measured in the daily course, show a high variability of 0. 230. 78 and 0. 200. 65, respectively.

However, school systems have limited budgets, which reduce their access to resources and labor hours. Therefore, the objective of this project is to identify ground covers that can compete with weeds and maintain aesthetic quality while under minimal maintenance. To explore this objective, a field experiment was initiated in May 2015 at Corvallis, OR. Experimental design was a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. Factors include year (2015 and 2016) and ground cover taxa. Taxa included 3 turfgrasses (<b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> ssp rubra ‘Chantilly’, <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> spp. commutata ‘Longfellow II’, Agrostis tenuis Sibth ‘Puritan’) and 7 forb or shrub plants (Vinca minor ‘Illumination’, Cotoneaster dammeri ‘Coral Beauty’, Euonymus fortunei ‘Kawensis’, Juniperus horizontalis ‘Blue Chip’, Herniaria glabra ‘Green Carpet’, Sedum spurium ‘Tri-Color, and Ceanothus glorious ‘Point Reyes’), which were selected using a school system stakeholder group.

40|$|The {{semi-natural}} grasslands in Apuseni Mountains {{are particularly}} important for the sustainable development of this region. The future development strategies must {{take into consideration the}} conservation of grassland plant diversity. In Apuseni Mountains there are numerous caves and a traditional landscape, these forming the area’s wealth. Their joining with agro-tourism and performing a sustainable agriculture would significantly level up the wellbeing of the local population, who are in need of new income sources considering that the wood resources are more and more reduced. In Gârda de Sus there are considerable areas of semi-natural grasslands which lately have been traditionally used. Nowadays, some of them have been abandoned and others irrationally intensified. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of mineral and organic fertilization upon the sward in order to recommend certain versions which have minor repercussions upon the plant diversity. The research was carried out in Apuseni Mountains, in an experimental field with two experiences: one with mineral fertilizers (T 1 control, T 2 50 N 25 P 25 K, T 3100 N 50 P 50 K, T 4 150 N 75 P 75 K) and the other with organic fertilizers (T 1 control, T 2 10 t ha- 1 manure, T 3 20 t ha- 1 manure, T 4 30 t ha- 1 manure). Administrating mineral fertilizers on the <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> - Agrostis capillaris L. grassland induced the installation of <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> and Trisetum flavescens L. at 50 N 25 P 25 K treatment, whereas 100 N 50 P 50 K and 150 N 75 P 75 K treatments induced the installation of Agrostis capillaris L. and Trisetum flavescens L. grassland subtype. The plant diversity decreased as the system was intensified, especially at the treatment with 100 N 50 P 50 K and 150 N 75 P 75 K. Administrating 50 N 25 P 25 K did not induce any significant changes in plant diversity. Giving organic fertilizers caused installation of <b>Festuca</b> <b>rubra</b> <b>L.</b> and Trisetum flavescens L. at the treatment using 10 t ha- 1 manure and Trisetum flavescens L. at using 20 and 30 t ha- 1 manure. The treatment with 10 t ha- 1 manure induced a growth of the plant diversity and by raising the manure quantity did not cause important changes with respect to the species’ number. For future management actions that are meant to maintain the plant diversity in Apuseni Mountains, the organic fertilization with 10 t ha- 1 manure quantities annually administrated or once in two years is recommended first of all, and, secondly, the fertilization with 50 N 25 P 25 K performed annually or once in two years.
