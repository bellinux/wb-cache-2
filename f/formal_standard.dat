25|$|The SPI bus is a {{de facto}} standard. However, {{the lack of a}} <b>formal</b> <b>standard</b> is {{reflected}} {{in a wide variety of}} protocol options. Different word sizes are common. Every device defines its own protocol, including whether it supports commands at all. Some devices are transmit-only; others are receive-only. Chip selects are sometimes active-high rather than active-low. Some protocols send the least significant bit first.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> and regulation on firms’ innovation efficiency, considering different levels of market uncertainty. We argue that <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> and regulation have different effects, depending {{on the extent of}} market uncertainty derived from theoretical considerations about information asymmetry and regulatory capture. Our empirical analysis is based on the German Community Innovation Survey (CIS). The results show that <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> lead to lower innovation efficiency in markets with low uncertainty, while regulations have the opposite effect. In cases of high market uncertainty, we observe that regulation leads to lower innovation efficiency, while <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> have the reverse effect. Our results have important implications for the future application of both instruments, showing that their benefits heavily depend on the market environment...|$|R

25|$|The Valencian {{people speak}} {{a variety of}} Catalan called Valencian, {{accounting}} for {{a third of all}} Catalan speakers. Valencian is a diglossic language that has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish, more recently during Franco's dictatorship. Since it regained official status in 1982, Valencian has been implemented in public administration and the education system, leading to an exponential increase in knowledge of its <b>formal</b> <b>standard.</b> However, its social use continues to be threatened by Spanish due to migration from other parts of Spain, especially in the cities of Valencia and Alicante. Furthermore, the linguistic conflict continues to be pressing, with some groups opposing the official standard based on Catalan orthography.|$|E

40|$|Several European countries, {{as well as}} the European Commission, have {{acknowledged}} the importance of open standards (under various definitions of that term) and have taken steps accordingly. Formal (e. g. ISO) standards are often referred to in software development and procurement, but may not necessarily also be open standards. The authors consider the application of <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> where national policy promotes their use, and, since much contemporary software development involves open source software, they further consider the interaction between the requirement to comply with open standards, and the implementation of open and <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> in open source software, with particular reference to patent licensing. It is shown that not all <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> are open standards. SSO policies and procedures regarding the notification of standards-essential patents (SEPs) present challenges for organisations wishing to implement standards in software since such policies and procedures need to be compliant with procurement requirements, patent licences and open source software licences. This paper draws out some implications for those organisations (differentiating where appropriate between small companies and other organisations) and suggests a number of ways of addressing the challenges identified. Use of <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> may create barriers for implementation in open source software and inhibit an open and inclusive business-friendly ecosystem, and to avoid such barriers is of particular importance for small companies that are essential players in an innovative and international society...|$|R

40|$|For {{most of its}} history, the United States {{graphic arts}} {{industry}} has had a cautious relationship with <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> activities. The earliest formal activities were {{in the area of}} printing equipment safety. Outside of the safety area, <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> activities were usually ignored by the graphic arts industry and even trade association specifications were looked at with suspicion. The formation of ISO TC 130 in the 70 s was ignored by the US industry. The arrival of color electronic prepress systems (CEPS) in 1980 became the motivation for a number of people to begin a drive to develop <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> activities in the US. This resulted in the creation of IT 8 and CGATS. The need to gain international recognition of the early graphic arts data exchange standards, created by IT 8, became the motivation for the reactivation of ISO/TC 130 - Graphic technology. Unfortunately, most of the records of these activities are in the form of oral history. This report will try to summarize some of that history in written form...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether establishing consensus standards for the treatment of particular medical conditions increases a physician's exposure to legal liability. The conclusion reached is that the legal effects of standard setting, rather than representing a significant threat of liability, should be seen as beneficial to the medical profession. A fundamental point is that the legal test for liability is entirely dependent on the medical profession's definition of what constitutes adequate care. The law incorporates the standard of care defined by the medical profession and does not impose an external norm. In the absence of formally stated standards, the process of defining relevant medical criteria will involve a great deal of uncertainty. Outcomes of legal contests will be affected by such extraneous factors as the relative experience of the lawyers involved, their access to knowledgeable expert witnesses, and their strategic decisions made with respect to tactics and procedures. Establishment of <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> has the salutory effect of limiting the influence of these factors and thus reducing the randomness of the results reached. <b>Formal</b> <b>standards</b> also have the advantage of being easily replicated in unrelated proceedings and thereby {{contribute to the development of}} a consistent, evenly applied rule of liability. Finally, even if <b>formal</b> <b>standards</b> are either more, or less, progressive than the actual state of medical practice, there is relatively little risk that they will produce untoward results...|$|R
