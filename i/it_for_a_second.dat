5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, he {{took the}} New York Philharmonic {{on a tour of}} Europe and the Soviet Union, {{portions}} of which were filmed by CBS Television. A highlight of the tour was Bernstein's performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, {{in the presence of the}} composer, who came on stage at the end to congratulate Bernstein and the musicians. In October, when Bernstein and the orchestra returned to the U.S., they recorded the symphony for Columbia. He recorded <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time with the orchestra on tour in Japan in 1979. Bernstein seems to have limited himself to only conducting certain Shostakovich symphonies, namely the numbers 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 14. He made two recordings of Shostakovich's Leningrad Symphony, one with the New York Philharmonic in the 1960s and another recorded live in 1988 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (one of the few recordings he made with them, also including the Symphony No. 1).|$|E
500|$|By early 1925, Yeats's health had stabilised, {{and he had}} {{completed}} most of the writing for A Vision (dated 1925, it actually appeared in January 1926, when he almost immediately started rewriting <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> version). He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922, and was re-appointed {{for a second term}} in 1925. Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position, the Irish Times countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and [...] "crystallise" [...] the partition of Ireland.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno {{believed}} the episode had [...] "false starts" [...] but still [...] "enjoyed the trippy places the writers took us." [...] While disliking the initial scenes with Charlie and Locke, Fenno thought the episode [...] "found its groove" [...] after Locke {{entered into the}} trance, and called the final scene between Eddie and Locke the episode's [...] "strongest moment." [...] The Record gave a negative review, noting that [...] "Unfortunately, 'Instructions' seemed devoid of everything that made 'The Glass Ballerina' hum. It was disjointed, it was graceless, and it seemed filled with gaping holes and not terribly helpful information." [...] In a 2008 review, Ryan McGee of Zap2It gave the episode another negative review and considered it the weakest of the season's first three episodes. He explained that after watching <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, it [...] "just feels off to me in hindsight. Maybe it's the lack of forward movement, maybe it's the lackluster flashback, maybe because the central plot is rendered moot in just two more episodes...I can't quite say." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beatles for Sale was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on EMI's Parlophone label on 4 December 1964. On 12 December, it began a 46-week run in the charts, and a week later displaced A Hard Day's Night from the top position. After seven weeks at number 1, the album's time at the top seemed over, but Beatles for Sale made a comeback on 27 February 1965, by dethroning The Rolling Stones No. 2 by the Rolling Stones and returning to the top spot for a week. After being again displaced by The Rolling Stones No. 2, Beatles for Sale [...] would overtake <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time on 1 May, remaining there for another three weeks before being displaced by Dylan's The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Eight of the album's tracks were later issued on two four-song EPs: Beatles for Sale and Beatles for Sale No. 2, released in April and June 1965, respectively.|$|E

I've had a colourful life, but I'm not finished". Before the race Dettori had requested some [...] "lucky white tape" [...] for his stirrup: the tape had previously been used to repair Willie Carson's saddle before his win on Nashwan and had been applied to Dettori's stirrup when he won on Authorized in 2007. Gosden, who was winning the race for the second time, after Benny the Dip's success in 1997, commented [...] "The last thing I said to Frankie was ride a cool race and he rode a cool race—he waited and waited. He's a proper horse." [...] On the following day Gosden indicated that the Eclipse Stakes would be the colt's most likely next target.|$|E

2500|$|Some photographers {{have found}} {{creative}} ways around these limitations. Louie Liotta of The New York Post told John Tierney {{he holds his}} camera near the ground, pointing upward, and walks with it for a short distance, {{in order to get}} a shot of the defendant's face as he or she is ducking downwards to avoid the cameras. Andrew Savulich of the Daily News looks for unusual angles and juxtapositions, once putting the station house's sleeping cat in the foreground. To catch the defendant's face, he stands near the front door at the top of the steps. [...] "For some reason, even when a guy has decided to duck his head, he usually lifts <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> when he starts to go down steps", he explains. [...] "You sometimes catch this lost-in-space look, the eyes fixed at a distance, as if he's trying very hard to be somewhere else." [...] Jim Estrin of the Times says the police officers at the door sometimes block that shot for him, so he starts in the middle, shooting as he runs, and then gets on the other side of the police car for a shot as the defendant enters.|$|E
