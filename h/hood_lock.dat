50|$|Bertone {{was placed}} in charge of styling the prototype, which was {{finished}} just days before its debut at the 1966 Geneva motor show. None of the engineers had found time to check if the engine fit inside its compartment. Committed to showing the car, they decided to fill the engine bay with ballast and keep the <b>hood</b> <b>locked</b> throughout the show, as they had three years earlier for the début of the 350GTV. Sales head Sgarzi was forced to turn away members of the motoring press who {{wanted to see the}} P400's power plant. Despite this setback, the car was the highlight of the show, immediately boosting stylist Marcello Gandini's reputation.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} features of the '71-'73 Mustangs is the optional (standard on Boss 351) NACA (NASA) hood design with dual scoops. Though available as a visual, non-functional item, they could be made fully functional on models ordered with the Ram Air option, which included vacuum controlled 'flaps' inside each scoop, and a fiberglass under-hood 'plenum' that directed cool, outside air through a modified, rubber-ringed air filter housing and into the carburetor. The ram-air option included a two-tone hood paint treatment in either 'matte black' or 'argent' (matte silver), coordinated to the base color of the Mach 1 and its decals and striping. In addition, all Ram Air-equipped Mustangs of this generation came equipped with twist-style, chrome-plated <b>hood</b> <b>locking</b> pins.|$|R

50|$|The car {{was based}} on the XB Falcon 500 Hardtop and {{featured}} a 302 in³ (4.9 L) Cleveland V8, and some specific options including the GS Rally Pack which featured full dash instrumentation, a 3-spoke steering wheel, vented bonnet (<b>hood)</b> with <b>locking</b> pins, and 12-slot steel road wheels. A separate item featured on all John Goss Special hardtops were the cosmetic side body vents that were also a feature of contemporary Falcon GT hardtops.|$|R
50|$|The {{other big}} {{story of the}} race was that Michael Waltrip was parked by NASCAR. With 46 laps left a caution flew when Casey Mears crashed. It was seen that Waltrips <b>hood</b> was <b>locked</b> on Mears rear and Waltrip was trying frantically to crash Mears. The hits caused Casey Mears to crash and bring out the yellow. Prior to the hits with Casey, Waltrip had hit the wall because of Caseys racing moves. NASCAR {{instantly}} parked Michael Waltrip causing Waltrip to face his first disqualification of his career.|$|R
50|$|The car's rolling chassis, {{featuring}} {{an unusual}} transversely mounted mid-engine layout, {{was displayed at}} the Turin Salon in 1965, impressing showgoers. A version with bodywork styled by Bertone was finished only days before its debut at the 1966 Geneva motor show. As had happened three years earlier at the debut of the 350GTV, an ill-fitting engine meant the prototype's engine bay was filled with ballast, and the <b>hood</b> kept <b>locked.</b> The favorable reaction to the P400 at Geneva led Lamborghini to slate the car for production by 1967, under the name Miura. The Miura's layout and styling would become the standard for mid-engine two-seat high-performance sports cars, a trend that continues today.|$|R
5000|$|The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), 340 {{of which}} were {{produced}} from August 1987 to September 1989, is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera that, with engine and suspension modifications, was purpose built for club racing. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two unit), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front <b>hood</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid [...] "Carrera" [...] logo, all {{in order to save}} an estimated 70 kg in weight. With the exception of CSs delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the [...] "CS Club Sport" [...] decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS's did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all CS's have a [...] "SP" [...] stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK CS's were all [...] "Grand Prix White" [...] with a red [...] "Carrera CS" [...] decal {{on each side of the}} car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the stock 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, the Soviet Union {{captured}} {{millions of}} Mauser Karabiner 98k rifles and re-furbished them in various arms {{factories in the}} late 1940s and early 1950s. These rifles, referred to by collectors as RC ("Russian Capture") Mausers, can be identified by an [...] "X" [...] stamp {{on the left side}} of the receiver. The Soviet arsenals made no effort to match the rifle's original parts by serial number when reassembling them, and some metal parts (the cleaning rod, sight <b>hood,</b> and <b>locking</b> screws) omitted after rebuilding, and instead were melted down and recycled, presumably with the other parts that weren't suitable for re-use.Many of these rifles (along with the Mosin-Nagant rifle) served in conflicts after World War 2.|$|R

2500|$|According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey {{conducted}} {{in the last quarter}} of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology. In particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances that can already [...] "spy on people in their own homes" [...] including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras, and thermostats. Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, <b>locks,</b> <b>hood</b> and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely. By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. David Pogue wrote that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for it.|$|R
50|$|Outside {{the sacred}} city of 'Eth Alth'eban, December Graystone discovers someone {{he was not}} expecting to see waiting outside and curses himself for not realizing that this person had {{something}} to do with the battle currently underway in the subterranean city. Red Hood is currently leading the League of Assassins in a charge against the evil Untitled, who had the gall to use Jason's friend Arsenal against him to get into the city. Jason is confused when his swords tell him that by taking bronze shards from the great fountain at the centre of the city, they will be able to drive off the Untitled, but he hopefully passes on the information to his companions. Red <b>Hood</b> finds himself <b>locked</b> in combat with Drakar and the man discovers that what was done to Red Hood's mind was more than a simple mind-wipe. He senses Ducra somewhere within his mind. Red Hood uses Drakar's confusion to steer him toward the fountain, which hides the Well of Sins (the pool that filled the Untitled with evil). Drakar struggles, but collapses into the murky fluid. Having fallen into the Well of Sins, Drakar begs to be removed from it as he can feel the arcane power reaching back inside him, and taking the evil energy within him away. The pool strips Drakar of his power and life-force, spitting him back out as a withered old man. Turning to the remaining Untitled, Red Hood warns that they will all suffer the same fate if they do not surrender. The Untitled respond that he cannot hope to defeat them alone, but Lady Shiva responds by unleashing a swarm of Man-Bats warning that the League of Assassins is death incarnate. When the Untitled have been cast back into the Well of Sins by the League of Assassins, Drakar plans to take Red Hood with him only for Bronze Tiger to snap Drakar's neck. Following Drakar's death, Red Hood admits that killing Drakar was necessary....a key realization for a member of the League of Assassins. Lady Shiva comments that tonight, they will see all the remaining Untitled dead as well, but Jason responds that they cannot simply kill without his say-so if he is to be the League's leader. Suddenly, a cloaked figure appears, noting that he expected more after coming all this way, just to find a leader of assassins who orders his warriors to sheathe their blades. The man warns that the game is over, and Jason's part in it is done, as he makes his way toward the Well of Sins. Jason stands in his way, demanding to know who this man is. The man responds that he is the one who gave the Untitled the location of the Acres of All knowing that they would kill Ducra and return to this place. He knew they would fall here, and imbue the Well of Sins with a greater power than he had ever tasted - a power that he would now take for himself, having planned this moment for three centuries. Emerging from the pit, the man introduces himself as Ra's al Ghul.|$|R
