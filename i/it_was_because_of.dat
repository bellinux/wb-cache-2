5|$|In September 2009, Tharoor and S. M. Krishna {{were accused}} of staying in luxurious 5-star hotels. Tharoor said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the delayed {{readiness}} of his official residence {{and that he had}} paid out of his own pocket for the accommodation. Later, on Pranab Mukherjee's request, Tharoor and Krishna moved out of the hotels.|$|E
5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and was {{a suspect in the}} murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Square {{showed an}} {{interactive}} SGI technical demonstration of Final Fantasy VI for the then {{next generation of}} consoles. The demonstration used Silicon Graphics's prototype Nintendo 64 workstations to create 3D graphics. Fans believed the demo was of a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 console; however, 1997 saw the release of Final FantasyVII for the Sony PlayStation. The switch was due to a dispute with Nintendo over its use of faster but more expensive cartridges, {{as opposed to the}} slower and cheaper, but much higher capacity Compact Discs used on rival systems. Final FantasyVII introduced 3D graphics with fully pre-rendered backgrounds. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this switch to 3D that a CD-ROM format was chosen over a cartridge format. The switch also led to increased production costs and a greater subdivision of the creative staff for Final FantasyVII and subsequent 3D titles in the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} the announcement, the Harvey-led Victorians met Craig's New South Welshmen at the SCG. Harvey {{admitted}} to being irked by the board's snub and felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his blunt nature. The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat. At the same time, Colin McDonald broke his nose while practising in the nets and was taken to hospital. Harvey asked Craig for a gentleman's agreement to allow a substitute, but the home skipper refused. An angry Harvey struck 209 in five hours, but Craig scored 45 and 93 to help secure a draw and therefore win the Sheffield Shield.|$|E
5|$|The deputies and the Junta met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of the Junta. Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within the Junta, Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Moreno's frail health.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{decided to}} {{concentrate}} on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added cellulose. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the Hahnemühle paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in ultraviolet light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water {{in order to make the}} colours match.|$|E

5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.|$|E
5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

After his performance, rumour has it that 1D personnel have come knocking for Mutucumarana to replace Malik in One Direction, some say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his ethnicity and others say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his celebrity status in Sri Lanka and India.|$|R

25|$|Britain {{throughout}} the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods {{was an almost}} entirely Christian society (with the only exception being a small Jewish population), although during this period there was a gradual shift from adherence to Roman Catholicism to forms of Anglicanism and Protestantism following the English Reformation in the sixteenth century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this that the cunning folk operating in this era typically worked within a Christian framework and world view.|$|E
25|$|In June, 2009, the University of the Cumberlands {{rescinded}} its {{invitation to}} a youth group from Broadway Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, to help build homes for the poor, stating they did so because the church {{had been removed from}} the Southern Baptist Convention.
