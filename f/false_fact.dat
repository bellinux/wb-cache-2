They here assume a <b>false</b> <b>fact,</b> which Mr. Hastings stated in his representation of the business to them. They assume a variety of other false facts: they assume that the amount of the jaghires of the Begums were to be paid them in regular pensions; whereas they were totally confiscated, without any compensation at all. And yet, upon Mr. Hastings's own showing, they found the transaction to be so dishonorable to the British government, that they desire him to make inquiry into it, and give redress accordingly.|$|E
6000|$|I shall beg leave, before I go any further, to {{take notice}} of some paltry artifices which the abettors of {{election}} as the only lawful title to the crown are ready to employ, in order to render {{the support of the}} just principles of our Constitution a task somewhat invidious. These sophisters substitute a fictitious cause, and feigned personages, in whose favor they suppose you engaged, whenever you defend the inheritable nature of the crown. It is common with them to dispute as if they were in a conflict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery who formerly maintained, what I believe no creature now maintains, [...] "that the crown is held by divine, hereditary, and indefeasible right." [...] These old fanatics of single arbitrary power dogmatized as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful government in the world,--just as our new fanatics of popular arbitrary power maintain that a popular election is the sole lawful source of authority. The old prerogative enthusiasts, it is true, did speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too, as if monarchy had more of a divine sanction than any other mode of government,--and as if a right to govern by inheritance were in strictness indefeasible in every person who should be found in the succession to a throne, and under every circumstance, which no civil or political right can be. But an absurd opinion concerning the king's hereditary right to the crown does not prejudice one that is rational, and bottomed upon solid principles of law and policy. If all the absurd theories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which they are conversant, we should have no law and no religion left in the world. But an absurd theory on one side of a question forms no justification for alleging a <b>false</b> <b>fact</b> or promulgating mischievous maxims on the other.|$|E

3000|$|Extending partial closed-world assumption. Following rule {{discovery}} in incomplete knowledge base [15], we extend partial closed-world assumption (PCA) {{to characterize the}} confidence of OGFCs. Given a triple pattern r(x, y) and a true instance 〈v_x, [...] r, v_y〉 ∈ r([...] ^+), an ontology-based [...] PCA assumes that a missing instance 〈v_x, [...] r, v_y'〉 of r(x, y) is a <b>false</b> <b>fact</b> if L(v_y')∈osim (L(v_y), O). In other words, for a given entity v_x, it assumes that r([...] ^+) contains all the true facts about v_x that pertain to specific r. Given the ontology and the function osim (· [...]) that tolerates concept label dissimilarity, it will identify a fact as false only when it claims a fact that connects v_x and v_y' via r, and v_y' is not ontologically close to any known entity that is connected to v_x via r. This necessarily extends the conventional PCA (where osim (· [...]) simply enforces label equality, i.e., β = 1) to reduce the impact of facts {{that may not be}} counted as “false” due to the true facts that are ontologically close to them.|$|E
3000|$|Generating {{training}} facts. Given {{a knowledge}} graph G = (V, E, L) and a triple pattern r(x, y), we generate training facts [...] as follows. (1) For each fixed r(x, y), {{a set of}} true facts [...] ^+ is sampled from the matches of r(x, y) in the knowledge graph G. For each true fact 〈v_x, [...] r, v_y〉 ∈ ^+, we further introduce “noise” by replacing their labels to semantically close counterparts asserted by ontology labels from O and osim (· [...]). This generates a set of true facts that approximately match r(x, y). (2) Given [...] ^+, a set of false facts [...] ^- is sampled under the ontology-based PCA (Sect.  3). A missing fact t= v_x, [...] r, v_y' is considered as a <b>false</b> <b>fact</b> only when (a) there exists a true fact 〈v_x, [...] r, v_y〉 in [...] ^+, and (b) L(v_y) ∈osim (L(v_y'), O).

30|$|Given a {{knowledge}} graph and a fact (a triple statement), fact checking {{is to decide}} whether the fact belongs to the missing part of the graph. Facts in real-world knowledge bases are typically interpreted by both topological and semantic context that is not fully exploited by existing methods. This paper introduces a novel fact checking method that explicitly exploits discriminant subgraph structures. Our method discovers discriminant subgraphs associated with a set of training facts, characterized by a class of graph fact checking rules. These rules incorporate expressive subgraph patterns to jointly describe both topological and ontological constraints. (1) We extend graph fact checking rules (GFCs) to a class of ontological graph fact checking rules (OGFCs). OGFCs generalize GFCs by incorporating both topological constraints and ontological closeness to best distinguish between true and <b>false</b> <b>fact</b> statements. We provide quality measures to characterize useful patterns that are both discriminant and diversified. (2) Despite the increased expressiveness, we show that it is feasible to discover OGFCs in large graphs with ontologies, by developing a supervised pattern discovery algorithm. To find useful OGFCs as early as possible, it generates subgraph patterns relevant to training facts and dynamically selects patterns from a pattern stream with a small update cost per pattern. We verify that OGFCs can be used as rules and provide useful features for other statistical learning-based fact checking models. Using real-world knowledge bases, we experimentally verify the efficiency and the effectiveness of OGFC-based techniques for fact checking.|$|E

40|$|We prove {{a number}} of results related to a problem of Po-Shen Loh, which is {{equivalent}} to a problem in Ramsey theory. Let a=(a_ 1,a_ 2,a_ 3) and b=(b_ 1,b_ 2,b_ 3) be two triples of integers. Define a to be 2 -less than b if a_i<b_i {{for at least two}} values of i, and define a sequence a^ 1, [...] .,a^m of triples to be 2 -increasing if a^r is 2 -less than a^s whenever r<s. Loh asks how long a 2 -increasing sequence can be if all the triples take values in { 1, 2, [...] .,n}, and gives a _* improvement over the trivial upper bound of n^ 2 by using the triangle removal lemma. In the other direction, a simple construction gives a lower bound of n^ 3 / 2.
