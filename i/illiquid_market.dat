40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the hedging of {{derivatives}} in <b>illiquid</b> <b>markets.</b> More specifically we consider a model where {{the implementation of}} a hedging strategy a#ects the price of the underlying security. Following earlier work we characterize perfect hedging strategies by a nonlinear version of the Black-Scholes PDE. The core of the paper consists of a simulation study. We present numerical results on the impact of market illiquidity on hedge cost and Greeks of derivatives.

40|$|One of the {{shortcomings}} of the Black and Scholes model on option pricing {{is the assumption that}} trading of the underlying asset does not affect the price of that asset. This assumption can be fulfilled only in perfectly liquid markets. Since most markets are illquid, this assumption might be too restrictive. Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an important issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for <b>illiquid</b> <b>markets</b> by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion. However, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock markets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the stochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps. Nonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the continuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with <b>illiquid</b> <b>markets.</b> The contribution {{of this paper is to}} tackle the pricing problem for options in <b>illiquid</b> <b>markets</b> with jumps as well as the hedging strategy within this context, which is the first of its kind to the best knowledge...|$|R

50|$|Market rules set {{the times}} and {{duration}} for trades and settlement. Some markets may not have many participants as the assets being traded do not have much appeal (the formal term is market interest - participants express interest in the underlying asset). Such markets are often called illiquid, for example minor currencies. In <b>illiquid</b> <b>markets,</b> price discovery might take place at a predefined auction time or even whenever participant wants to trade. In such cases {{there may be no}} executions for days or months. In such examples there is no price discovery for long periods so the last traded price is used.

5000|$|In business, {{economics}} or investment, {{market liquidity}} is a market's ability to purchase or sell an asset without causing drastic {{change in the}} asset's price. Equivalently, an asset's market liquidity (or simply [...] "an asset's liquidity") describes the asset's ability to sell quickly without having to reduce its price to a significant degree. Liquidity is about how big the trade-off is between {{the speed of the}} sale and the price it can be sold for. In a liquid market, the trade-off is mild: selling quickly will not reduce the price much. In a relatively <b>illiquid</b> <b>market,</b> selling it quickly will require cutting its price by some amount.|$|E
5000|$|A {{moral hazard}} concern {{generally}} provides a rationale {{that government should}} not intervene in a financial crisis. The argument is that a market participant who expects government bailouts or emergency financing would engage in excessive risk taking. However, various government policy tools have been proposed to alleviate the effect of flight-to-quality phenomenon. The argument for government intervention is that flight-to-quality phenomenon {{is a result of}} insufficient risk taking generated by Knightian uncertainty. There is also an inefficiency issue generated by externality that supports rationale for prudential policy. The externality is generated when in presence of <b>illiquid</b> <b>market,</b> each firm forced to sell illiquid assets depresses prices for everyone else but does not take this effect into account in its decision-making. The externality also enables strategic and speculative behaviors of liquid investors.|$|E
5000|$|Liquidity - The {{liquidity}} of {{a market}} affects the performance of scalping. Each product within the market receives different spread, due to popularity differentials. The more liquid the markets and the products are, the tighter the spreads are. Some scalpers like to trade in a more liquid market since they can move in and out of large positions easily without adverse market impact. Other scalpers like to trade in less liquid markets, which typically have significantly larger bid-ask spreads. Whereas a scalper in a highly liquid market (for example, a market maintaining a one-penny spread) may take 10,000 shares to make a 3 cent gain ($300), a scalper in an <b>illiquid</b> <b>market</b> (for example, a market with a 25 cent spread) may take 500 shares for a 60 cent gain ($300).

50|$|ISE was {{launched}} with an objective of converting small, fragmented and illiquid markets into large, liquid national-level markets. ISE {{is also a}} professionally managed stock exchange with the Chairman of the Exchange being also a Public Representative Director from its inception. Unfortunately for the RSEs, particularly small brokers, the ISE experiment did not succeed. The daily turnover, {{which used to be}} Rs. 1 to 2 crore in the first six months, gradually declined to virtually zero level. Failure of ISE was, due to the bigger brokers of the participating RSEs failing to support any interest in trading on ISE due to commercial considerations. As a result, it becomes virtually impossible for ISE to create any worthwhile liquidity in its markets in competition with the breadth and depth of NSE and BSE. Markers continued to be fragmented as the participating RSEs did not close down their regional segments. All the while the small fragmented and <b>illiquid</b> <b>market</b> failed to emerge. ISE has also not succeeded in getting companies listed on it despite the stipulation by SEBI that the State of Maharashtra constituted the regional area for ISE due to lack of regulatory support for making it applicable to over 3,000 already listed companies in the State of Maharashtra.|$|E
