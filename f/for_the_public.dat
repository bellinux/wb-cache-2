In this paper I give {{an overview of the}} main points of criticism, and use these to develop a positive account of what good philosophy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general <b>public</b> could be. As a first step towards such an account, I outline different views on how philosophy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general <b>public</b> can relate to academic philosophy. Subsequently, I argue that what makes philosophy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general <b>public</b> ‘good’, is just what makes philosophical work in general ‘good’: good philosophical work has a philosophical aim, employs philosophical methods and employs these methods in a sound way. Finally I argue that communicability of philosophical ideas should not be seen as a bonus feature but as {{the sine qua non of}} philosophical thinking: if academic philosophy paid more attention to communicability, we might not even need a distinct discipline of philosophy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general <b>public.</b> I conclude with some concrete suggestions for improving such communicability...|$|R
