40|$|It {{is shown}} that space travel, {{even in the}} most distant future, will remain {{confined}} to our own planetary system, and a similar conclusion will hold forth for any other civilization, no matter how advanced it might be, unless those <b>extra-terrestrial</b> species have <b>life</b> spans order of magnitude longer than ours. Even in such a case it is unlikely that they will travel much farther than their immediate stellar neighbourhood, as each such excursion will exhaust the resources of their home planet so much that those will dwindle rather fast and there might not be much left for the further scientific and technological advancements. So the science-fiction fancy of a "Galactic Empire" may ever remain in our fantasies only. And as for the mythical UFOs, whose quiet appearances do get reported in the press once in a while, recent explorations have shown no evidence that any such thing could have an origination within our own solar system itself. And a "quiet trip" back and forth from a distant star is almost impossible as the exhaust in any such trip will dazzle the sky like another sun or perhaps more like a gamma ray burst occurring but not in a distant part of the universe instead going off right in our own solar backyard.

40|$|International audienceAssuming an <b>extra-terrestrial</b> {{formation}} of <b>life's</b> molecular building blocks such as amino-acids, a possible abiotic {{explanation for the}} selection of the L enantiomers could be the exposure to an asymmetric bias such as far UV Circularly Polarized Light (CPL), during their journey towards Earth, inducing some enantiomeric excess (e. e) that could then be amplified on Earth via suitable autocatalytic mechanisms. Synchrotron Radiation (SR), with its intense flux and broad tunability, is a unique tool which mimics such an interstellar far UV CPL. We have recently employed it to study : (1) The irradiation of solid films of the amino acid D,L-leucine, i. e. under relevant astrophysical conditions.

(2) CPL-induced gas phase photoionization of chiral molecules. By measuring the angular distribution of photoelectrons ejected from pure enantiomers, we observed a strong anisotropy (up to 16 %) in the forward/backward direction with respect to the light propagation axis. Because of momentum conservation, such an effect is accompanied by an asymmetric recoil of the corresponding ions that could lead to a high e. e.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{possibility}} space of scenarios of 'contact' [...] the discovery of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>life,</b> whether intelligent or not [...] using a morphological approach utilising seven principal parameters, chosen both for their descriptiveness of the scope of possibilities, as well as for their relevance in examining potential societal impacts arising from different scenarios, including, for example, the proximity of the discovery. Several classes of contact scenario are examined, and existing approaches to the search for <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>life</b> and intelligence are situated within the range of possible search strategies and targets illuminated by this particular choice of parameters, as are some examples of contact scenarios from popular culture. The resulting possibility space can also suggest new search strategies and potential targets, one of which is highlighted [...] that of 'galaxy-scale macro-engineering'. It is hypothesised that an example of this might already be known to us, namely the intriguing galaxy 'Hoag's Object' (PGC 54559), and some specific empirical observations are suggested in order to test this hypothesis. Some possible extensions to the parameters used, as well as some preliminary observations about modelling the range and extent of human societal responses to contact, are also made.
