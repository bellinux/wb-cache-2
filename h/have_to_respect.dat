However, the federal government would have to enter into negotiations with the Quebec government if Quebecers expressed a clear will to secede.

2500|$|The Kuvasz breed is for {{experienced}} handlers only. The {{combination of}} intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating {{the environment and}} taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices {{and those who do}} not have time to train and socialize them properly.
