40|$|Abstract. Due to {{its good}} {{biocompatibility}} and its high corrosion resistance, Platinum and its alloys {{have been widely}} used in implantable medical devices, including neurovascular devices, cardiac rhythm management devices and neurological devices. Implantable neurostimulators have provided therapies to patients with chronic pain, movement disorders, and overactive bladder symptoms. For these therapies, well-controlled stimulation current is delivered to the target nerves through <b>implantable</b> <b>leads.</b> The <b>implantable</b> <b>leads</b> must have sufficient fatigue durability to last for many years of implantation. Although coils made with Pt- 20 Ir wire {{have been widely used}} in conductor leads from major medical device companies, its fatigue performance and microstructure has not been well studied. In this study, a newly developed axial fatigue test method was used to study the fatigue behavior of Pt- 20 Ir coil, and the fatigue behavior of the corresponding Pt- 20 Ir wire was studied using a rotary beam fatigue testing method. The fracture surfaces of Pt- 20 Ir wires and fractured coil filars were analyzed in SEM and compared. The slanted fracture surface was observed for Pt- 20 Ir coils, indicating that the axial fatigue of Pt- 20 Ir is multiaxial in nature. Multiaxial fatigue theory should be used to analyze coil axial fatigue behavior. The microstructure of Pt- 20 Ir cold worked wire for coil was also studied. The detailed microstructure such as crystallography texture and grain structures was analyzed by using SEM/EBSD method...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) to evaluate the effect of different right atrial electrode locations on the efficacy of low energy transvenous defibrillation with an <b>implantable</b> <b>lead</b> system; and 2) to qualitate and quantify the discomfort from atrial defibrillation shocks delivered by a clinically relevant method. Background. Biatrial shocks result in the lowest thresholds for transvenous atrial defibrillation, but the optimal right atrial and coronary sinus electrode locations for defibrillation efficacy in humans have not been defined. Methods. Twenty- eight patients (17 men, 11 women) with chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) (lasting ≤ 1 month) were studied. Transvenous atrial defibrillation was performed by delivering R wave-synchronized biphasic shocks with incremental shock levels (from 180 to 400 V in steps of 40 V). Different electrode location combinations were used and tested randomly: the anterolateral, inferomedial right atrium or high right atrial appendage to the distal coronary sinus. Defibrillation thresholds were defined in duplicate by using the step-up protocol. Pain perception of shock delivery was assessed by using a purpose-designed questionnaire; sedation was given when the shock level was unacceptable (tolerability threshold). Results. Sinus rhythm was restored in 26 of 28 patients by using {{at least one of the}} right atrial electrode locations tested. The conversion rate with the anterolateral right atrial location (21 [81 %] of 26) was higher than that with the inferomedial right atrial location (8 [50 %] of 16, p 0. 05). The mean defibrillation thresholds for the high right atrial appendage, anterolateral right atrium and inferomedial right atrium were all significantly different with respect to energy (3. 9 ± 1. 8 J vs. 4. 6 ± 1. 8 J vs. 6. 0 ± 1. 7 J, respectively, p < 0. 05) and voltage (317 ± 77 V vs. 348 ± 70 V vs. 396 ± 66 V, respectively, p < 0. 05). Patients tolerated a mean of 3. 4 ± 2 shocks with a tolerability threshold of 255 ± 60 V, 2. 5 ± 1. 3 J. Conclusions. Low energy, transvenous defibrillation with an implantable defibrillation lead system is an effective treatment for AF. Most patients can tolerate two to three shocks, and, when the staffing shock level (189 V) is close to the defibrillation threshold, they can tolerate on average a shock level of 260 V without sedation. Electrodes should be positioned in the distal coronary sinus and in the high right atrial appendage to achieve the lowest defibrillation threshold, although other locations may be suitable for certain patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>lead</b> has under-gone {{numerous}} {{design and}} manufacturing changes {{over the last}} 25 years aimed at improving patient care and outcomes. It is widely accepted that <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>leads,</b> similar to pacemaker leads, have a finite life. The design of an <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>lead</b> {{is more complex than}} that of a pacemaker lead, and the propensity for failure is greater. Estimates of the rate of failure vary, but during follow-up at 10 years, the failure rate may be as high as 20 %. 1 Factors that affect <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>lead</b> performance include the im-planting physician, the patient, and specific characteristics related to lead design. Most lead failures are multifactorial. Article see p 358 In October 2007, Medtronic voluntarily discontinued sales of the Sprint Fidelis family of leads because of a trend toward decreased survival of the lead compared with an earlier model, the Sprint Quattro. At the time of discontinuation, the lead had been implanted in 268 000 patients worldwide; by October 2010, an estimated 166 000 Fidelis leads remained active worldwide. Fidelis lead failure can be traced to fracture of the pace/sense electrodes, the shocking coils, or both. Failure is usually the result of fracture of either the cable to the anode (ring electrode) near the lead tip or the coil to the cathode (tip electrode) near the anchoring sleeve. The most common complication of lead fracture is rapid oversensing of electrical noise and delivery of inappropriate shocks, but failure to deliver bradycardia pacing and antitachycardia pacing due to elevated impedance or inhibition of pacing by oversensing has also been reported. 2 The most concerning complication when fracture of the high-voltage electrode occurs, however, is failure to deliver the lifesaving therapy intended: defibrillatory shock(s). Since the first reports of failure of this lead, 3 numerous case reports and series have substantiated an increasing incidence, while editorialists in the lay and professional press focused on broader outcome issues in managing patients with Fidelis leads. Among these are the risks and costs associated with their revision and extraction. 4, 5 A recent PubMed search with the key word “Fidelis lead ” returned a list of 3...|$|R

This article demonstrates the frequency effects and the influence of antiarrhythmic drugs on both signals simultaneously recorded in dog. At higher stimulation rates MAP and VER shortened (60 ppm: MAPd 90 : 285 ± 19 ms, 180 ppm: MAPd 90 : 202 ± 16 ms). The T+-duration lied between MAPd 50 and MAPd 90. VER duration was 23 - 28 % longer. The effects of 2 mg/kg isoproterenol to the intrinsic rhythm and MAP duration of mongrel dogs were the same as reported in literature (MAPd 90 -shortening: 175 ± 7 to 157 ± 11 ms, MAPd 50 : 160 ± 9 to 110 ± 23 ms).

The simulated full-cohort analysis triggered a sustained alert for Fidelis leads beginning 13 months after the first implant and 2 years before Fidelis leads were removed from the market. Of the 1035 patients who had Fidelis leads, up to 969 (93. 6 %) were successfully matched to Quattro patients. In the propensity-matched analysis, the alert triggered 22 months after the first Fidelis implant and more than 1 year before the lead was recalled. Conclusions—An active automated safety surveillance system could have identified this implantable cardiovascular device problem substantially sooner than was achieved through existing postmarket surveillance methods. Such a tool, when applied to clinical registries and remote monitoring databases, may limit the exposure of large populations t...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine at autopsy the effect of {{multiple}} defibrillations on the myocardium and the pathologic consequences of short- and long-term placement of the intravascular and interpericardial leads of the automatic implantable cardioverterdefibrillator. Twenty-five patients were examined at autopsy; 8 of them underwent lead implantation only and 17 received both leads and the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Twelve patients (48 %) died of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation; seven (28 %) died of other causes. Acute pericarditis occurred in all patients, resulting in a localized, progressive fibrosis around the apical patch lead without giving rise to pericardial restriction. Thrombus formation was associated with the superior vena cava spring electrode in four patients (17 %) and the right ventricular rate-sensing electrode in one patient (4 %). Asymptomatic pulmonary emboli occurred in two patients (8 %). In one patient who underwent defibril- lation 59 times, superior vena cava changes consisted of vein wall destruction, fibrosis and thrombus formation. Pathologic changes under the apical patch related to defibrillation were observed in seven patients; two of these had fewer than 5 defibrillations, one had 8 defibrillations and four had 21 to 74 defibrillations. These changes consisted of contraction band necrosis in four patients, vacuolar cytoplasmic clearing and loss of myocytes confined to the myocardium under the patch electrode in five patients who had multiple defibrillations. The observed pathologic changes were estimated to affect < 2 % of the total myocardial mass. Thus, the automatic <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>lead</b> system and multiple defibrillations result in localized myocardial injury confined to the tissue under the patch electrode. Superior vena cava lead-associated thrombosis may occur as with other long-term implanted transvenous catheters...|$|R
40|$|T-wave alternans (TWA) {{testing has}} been {{associated}} with an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmic events, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD), 1 during medium- and long-term follow-up. 2, 3 Clinical Perspective on p 826 However, beyond medium- and long-term risk prediction, several lines of preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the presence of heightened TWA may play a more proximal role in creating the substrate necessary for malignant ventricu-lar arrhythmias. 4 – 6 Analysis of intracardiac electrograms from <b>implantable</b> cardioverter-defibrillator <b>leads</b> has demonstrated a sharp increase in TWA magnitude immediately before spon-taneous ventricular arrhythmias, 7 – 9 without a similar upsurge in TWA before induced ventricular arrhythmias or preceding inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. 7 Simultaneous measurement of TWA from body-surface and intracardiac electrograms by our group 10 and others 11 has shown a high degree of correlation, suggesting that these measurements are detecting the same electric phenomenon. In aggregate, the clinical and experimental data suggest that the heart either passes through a state of heightened TWA on the way to VT and VF, or heightened TWA occurs in close conjunction with developing ventricular tachyarrhyth-mic events. 12, 13 In either scenario, these findings suggest that detecting significantly elevated levels of TWA may serve as an important short-term predictor of impending arrhythmias and also raise the possibility for a therapeutic role where TWA suppression therapies are delivered upstream to sup-press the arrhythmogenic substrate and abort VT/VF prior to the arrhythmia onset. 2, 14 The clinical application of TWA, whether it serves a diag-nostic role for medium- and long-term risk prediction or a therapeutic role for guiding short-term upstream antiarrhyth-mic therapy, requires the ability to estimate TWA accurately. It has been reported that abnormal beats with altered morphol-ogy or timing present inherent difficulties in the estimation o...|$|R
