5|$|The chapter {{asserts that}} the king should be truthful, avoid anger, be virtuous and lead by example. The king, ministers and {{citizens}} should, states the Manasollasa's first sub-book, refrain from injury to others, practice self-restraint and generosity, have faith in gods, feed and support the poor and <b>helpless,</b> <b>and</b> be friendly. The king, according to the text, should honour his ancestors and all guests.|$|E
5|$|Born <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> {{unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are {{constantly}} brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days of age in the wild and up to 30days of age in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Vn.Shankar Narayan {{suggests}} that the origin of vegetarianism in India developed from the idea that balance needed to be restored. He claims, “Along with the development in civilisation, savagery also increased {{and those who were}} <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> voiceless among both humans and non-human animals were more and more exploited and killed to satiate human needs and greed thus disturbing the balance of nature. But fortunately, there were many serious attempts to bring back the humanity to sanity and restore balance from time to time.” He also says that the idea of living in harmony with nature became central to the leaders.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} {{presentation}} to Charles' official mistress, Barbara Palmer, she fainted away upon realizing {{who had been}} brought before her and Charles's insistence on making her Catherine's Lady of the Bedchamber. Initially, not realizing who was presented to her, she accepted Barbara graciously, but upon comprehension changed her bearing. She withdrew from the king's society, {{and in spite of}} Clarendon's awkward attempts to appeal to her, declared she would return to Portugal rather than consent to a base compliance. To overcome her resistance the king dismissed nearly the whole of her Portuguese retinue. She was <b>helpless,</b> <b>and</b> the violence of her grief and anger soon changed to passive resistance, and then to a complete forbearance and complaisance which gained the king's regard and favour. In the midst of Charles's debauched and licentious court, she lived neglected and retired.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the US made {{a secret}} {{agreement}} with the Shah of Iran to begin covertly funding Kurdish rebels against Bagdad through the Central Intelligence Agency and in collaboration with Mossad, both {{of which would be}} active in the country through the launch of the Iraqi invasion and into the present. By 1974, the Iraqi government retaliated with a new offensive against the Kurds and pushed them close to the border with Iran. Iraq informed Tehran that it was willing to satisfy other Iranian demands in return for an end to its aid to the Kurds. With mediation by Algerian President Houari Boumediene, Iran and Iraq reached a comprehensive settlement in March 1975 known as the Algiers Pact. The agreement left the Kurds <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> Tehran cut supplies to the Kurdish movement. Barzani went to Iran with many of his supporters. Others surrendered en masse and the rebellion ended after a few days.|$|E
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{pterosaur}} biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century {{debate over how}} pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that they walked on their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France {{were similar to those}} reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was <b>helpless</b> <b>and</b> could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in times of emergency. A Wireless transmitter-receiver station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide ships and boats through the jagged rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E

25|$|After the {{repeated}} failures, Toungoo used a stratagem {{to create a}} split in the Hanthawaddy camp, providing misinformation about the loyalty of the ministers. Surprisingly, Takayutpi believed Toungoo's misinformation, and executed the ministers who had been his tutors since childhood and were absolutely devoted to him. Then when Toungoo launched another invasion, Takayutpi was <b>helpless,</b> <b>and</b> decided to evacuate his capital rather than fight. Toungoo forces took Pegu without firing a shot in late 1538 or early 1539. Hanthawaddy's hopes for a counterattack vanished after the Battle of Naungyo in which Gen. Kyawhtin Nawrahta's Toungoo troops, despite being vastly outnumbered, decimated Hanthawaddy armies in the delta. Tabinshwehti now bestowed Kyawhtin Nawrahta the title of Bayinnaung ("King's Elder Brother"). Toungoo forces followed up to Prome where Takayutpi had taken refuge but the siege was broken up by Prome's overlord Confederation. Fortunately for Toungoo, Takayutpi died soon after c. March 1539, and many lords from the delta came over to Tabinshwehti, who reappointed them to their posts. Moreover, Tabinshwehti now controlled much of Lower Burma's manpower and trade wealth, and gained access to Portuguese mercenaries and their firearms.|$|E
25|$|On the 18th The Mexican Imperial General O'Horán, persuaded Díaz to {{meet him}} halfway at night and used red light signals to {{identify}} himself while sneaking out undiscovered from the capital. Díaz escorted by drummers and buglers responded with the same signal, that unfortunately revealed his position to the Imperialist shooters who instantly opened fire on him. O'Horán blamed Márquez for the incident and swore his innocence. The second night O'Horan {{came out of the}} capital and met Díaz, which they did this time. He offered to surrender the city, including Márquez and the other principal officers, with the sole condition of obtaining a passport to go abroad. Díaz felt that such an offer is pointless considering the city was <b>helpless,</b> <b>and</b> that as for the other leaders I would fulfill my duty. O'Horán insisted that however the city would fall the capture of the wanted officers was uncertain, but his offer guaranteed both. Díaz refused again and warned the General that although he let him get away that time he would put him under custody as soon as the city was to be captured.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and <b>helpless,</b> <b>and</b> {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|E
