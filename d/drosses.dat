40|$|Dross is the {{inevitable}} waste product {{generated by the}} world-wide primary and secondary aluminium industries. Around 3. 5 million tonnes of white dross and 0. 85 million tonnes of black dross are produced per year. <b>Drosses</b> are classified depending on metal content. White dross contains 40 % and black dross contains 10 % of aluminium. About half of the white dross is currently landfilled along with {{almost all of the}} black dross, and the annual cost to the UK industry of landfilling this waste is about ¬£ 90 million per year. There is no commercially viable method of recovering the aluminium, which is potentially recyclable from these <b>drosses,</b> and no current conventional process has the custom-built capability to avoid their disposal to landfill. The practice of landfilling aluminium dross has raised problems for both industry and environment, because of potential leaching of heavy metals into groundwater from the landfill. The black dross has been physically and chemically characterised. The results show that the dross contains mostly metallic aluminium, aluminium nitride, alumina, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and silica with almost 50 % of the dross being a mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride. A counter current leaching process has been developed to recycle the salts back to the secondary furnace. The environmental impact of black dross has been investigated using simulated landfill conditions. Leachability studies were carried out using water, and other leach media to model the following conditions: humic acid-containing systems, acid rain (pH 2. 5), and acetic acid solutions (pH 5). Up to 60 % of the dross was leached out in all media with the production of the saline solution providing the major impact. Only small amounts of aluminium were leached out under all these condition. No leachability behaviour was detected once the black dross was washed. So landfilling washed black dross can minimise both environmental and economical problems. Black dross residue, after washing with water, is enriched with alumina. Added value chemicals (of > 95 % purity) including aluminium hydroxide, alumina, aluminium chloride, aluminium nitrate, aluminium sulphate and aluminium carboxylates have been prepared using the washed black dross. Preliminary calculations have shown that the technology developed to recycle black dross to added-value chemicals is economically viable. A methodology has been developed which enables low grade alumnium waste, black dross, to be treated, commercially viable chemicals to be prepared, reagent use to be minimised through recycle and the diversion of millions of tonnes of furnace residue from landfill.

The formation of AlON is induced by the exothermic reaction between Al and nitrogen. On the occasion of using high-grade <b>dross,</b> unreacted Al was detected in the combustion products. This may be originated from Al in the <b>dross</b> because Al in <b>dross</b> exists in the dispersed oxide layer. Therefore, its reactivity with nitrogen is relatively lower, compared to Al powder mixed with the <b>dross</b> in the beginning. It is noted that, on the occasion of using low-grade <b>dross,</b> unreacted Al in the product can be controlled by means of adjusting particle size of <b>dross,</b> resulting in improvement of the permeation of nitrogen gas into the compact through the well established open pore channels...|$|R

Calcium oxide-containing materials, such as de-sulfur slag produced from steel manufacturing process, {{are used as}} stabilizing agents for secondary aluminum <b>dross.</b> The de-sulfur slag was first hydrolyzed. Due to the high content of calcium oxide (about 45 %), hydration of de-sulfur slag can produce a solution with strong alkalinity (pH‚âß 12). In the strong alkaline environment, the residual pernicious components in the aluminum <b>dross,</b> such as aluminum nitride, aluminum carbide and metal aluminum, are hydrolyzed and decomposed rapidly, resulting in the stabilization of secondary aluminum <b>dross.</b> The stabilized aluminum <b>dross,</b> therefore, {{was used as the}} raw material for preparing concrete bricks.

40|$|This {{contribution}} presents numerical {{investigations into}} some aspects affecting {{the formation of}} <b>dross</b> during continuous galvanizing. It {{is well known that}} <b>dross</b> formation depends on the bath composition, temperature and flow dynamics. However, experimental observation indicates that top <b>dross</b> formation is affected by oxidation at the surface of the bath as the use of an inert gas in air knifes greatly reduces <b>dross</b> generation. In this work numerical simulations are used to investigate the flow dynamics of the gas {{in the vicinity of the}} bath surface in order to obtain correlations between the gas velocity and the propensity for oxidation and <b>dross</b> formation. Simulations are first shown for a bench scale experiment simulating top <b>dross</b> formation for which experimental data are available. The experiment consists of a crucible containing liquid zinc with various aluminum and iron contents. The flow in the crucible is generated by the rotation of a propeller immersed into the liquid zinc and then air or inert gas is projected to the surface of the liquid metal to determine the effect on oxidation and <b>dross</b> formation. <b>Dross</b> formation is then correlated to the size of the exposed surface and to the relative velocity between the liquid zinc and the gas. Numerical results are also shown for the gas flow dynamics inside air knifes and in the vicinity of the bath surface. This provides a map of the relative gas/liquid velocity at bath surface which then can be used to estimate the propensity for oxidation and top <b>dross</b> formation.

For materials where the <b>dross</b> is a similar density to the base material, such as aluminium, runner extensions and runner wells can be advantageous. These take advantage of the fact that the <b>dross</b> is usually located at the beginning of the pour, therefore the runner is extended past the last gate(s) and the contaminates are contained in the wells. Screens or filters may also be used to trap contaminates.|$|R

Recycling and reutilisation of industrial waste and by-products {{is of paramount importance}} in cement and concrete industry. In view of rapid infrastructure growth, there is an emerging need for development of cementitious materials or fillers either to replace cement or fine aggregate for stable growth. One of the industrial wastes is secondary aluminium <b>dross.</b> In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the mechanical and durability aspects of concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium <b>dross.</b> Cement has been partially replaced by secondary aluminium <b>dross</b> in different proportions to study the mechanical and durability aspects. Various properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, sorptivity, water absorption, rapid chloride penetration have been studied for the usefulness of secondary aluminium <b>dross</b> as construction material. It is observed that up to 15 % replacement of cement by secondary aluminium <b>dross,</b> the responses are comparable with the conventional concrete. Studies have also been carried out by adding other supplementary cementitious materials such as fly ash and silica fume in various proportions along with secondary aluminium <b>dross</b> and found the improved mechanical and durability properties. From the overall study, it can be concluded that the concrete incorporated with secondary aluminium <b>dross</b> can be used for making paver blocks, refractory bricks and for normal concrete strength applications...|$|R

[...] "Son of man," [...] said God to the prophet, [...] "the {{house of}} Israel {{is to me}} become <b>dross,</b> all they are brass and tin, and iron and lead, {{in the midst of}} the furnace they even are the <b>dross</b> of silver." [...] (Eze 22:18) God had silver there, some silver, but it was but little; the bulk of that people was but the <b>dross</b> of the church, though they were the members of it. But what doth he mean by the <b>dross?</b> why, he looked upon them as no better, {{notwithstanding}} their church-membership, than the rabble of the world, that is, with respect to their latter end; for to be called <b>dross,</b> it is to be put amongst the rest of the sinners of the world, in the judgment of God, though at present they abide in his house: [...] "Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore I love thy testimonies."
