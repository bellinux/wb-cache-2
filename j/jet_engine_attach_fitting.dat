40|$|Abstract—A {{scattered}} {{radar signal}} by a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet involves engine information of the target. The <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS {{due to the}} engine inlet is therefore significant in radar target recognition. Accordingly, several accurate analyses of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS have been reported. Reduction of the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS is also required for stealth technology. We suggest a new approach for <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> RCS reduction that involves the insertion of many small corrugations into the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> inlet. The proposed <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> structure {{is assumed to be}} a circular waveguide cavity with many corrugations. The structure is analyzed by combining a mode matching technique with a scattering matrix analysis. The proposed closed-form RCS solutions of the corrugated engine structure are validated with a MoM simulation using FEKO. The proposed closed-form solution has numerical efficiency and rapid convergence. Using the characteristics of the solution, we simply apply a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the structure of the corrugations in terms of minimizing the RCS. 1...|$|R

50|$|An airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> (or ducted <b>jet</b> <b>engine)</b> is a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> {{propelled}} by a jet of hot exhaust gases formed from heated and expanded air that is {{drawn into the}} engine via a compressor, typically a centrifugal or axial type.

The opposite of airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> are non-airbreathing <b>jet</b> <b>engines,</b> such as rocket engines, for example, which are {{propelled by}} a jet of hot gases created by the chemical reaction {{of two or more}} compounds internally.

40|$|The turbine-less <b>jet</b> <b>engine,</b> in {{its fourth}} {{iteration}} at California State University, Los Angeles, looks {{to improve the}} efficiency of jet propulsion. This iteration of the turbine-less <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> focused on adding a combustor to the engine assembly to improve thrust performance. By testing various sized combustors with the turbine-less <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> this gave insight on how they affect engine performance. It was found that while shorter combustors initially outperformed longer combustors, longer combustors are more fuel efficient in achieving thrust at higher fan power output. However, the turbine-less <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> can still benefit from better designing and more extensive testing. Since the turbine-less <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> performs best when the air flow from the ducted fan is not impeded, a better method of securing the combustor and fuel injector would greatly improve thrust performance.
