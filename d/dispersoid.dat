5000|$|Spray forming offers certain {{advantages}} over both conventional ingot metallurgy and more specialized {{techniques such as}} powder metallurgy. Firstly, it is a flexible process {{and can be used}} to manufacture a wide range of materials, some of which are difficult to produce by other methods, e.g. Al-5wt% Li alloys or Al-SiC, Al-Al2O3 metal matrix composites (MMCs). The atomisation of the melt stream into droplets of 10-500 µm diameter, some of which, depending on diameter, cool quickly to the solid and semi-solid state provide a large number of nucleants for the residual liquid fraction of the spray formed material on the billet top surface. The combination of rapid cooling in the spray and the generation of a large population of solid nucleants in the impacting spray leads to a fine equiaxed microstructure, typically in the range 10-100 µm, with low levels and short length scales of internal solute partitioning. These microstructural aspects offer advantages in material strength because of fine grain size, refined distribution of <b>dispersoid</b> and/or secondary precipitate phases, as well as tolerance to impurity ‘tramp’ elements. This fine structure in the ‘as sprayed’ condition means homogenising heat treatments can often be avoided. Because of the complex solidification path (i.e. the rapid transition from superheated melt to solid, liquid or semi-solid droplet to temperature equilibration at semi-solid billet top and final slow cooling to fully solid) of the spray formed material, extended solubility of alloying elements and the formation of metastable and quasi-crystalline phases has also been reported.|$|E

40|$|The creep and {{fracture}} of dispersion strengthened materials is reviewed. A compilation of creep data on several alloys {{showed that the}} reported values of the stress exponent for creep varied between 3. 5 and 100. The activation energy for creep exceeded that for lattice self diffusion in the matrix {{in the case of}} some materials and a threshold stress behavior was generally reported in these instances. The threshold stress is shown to be dependent on the interparticle spacing and it is significantly affected by the initial microstructure. The effect of particle size {{and the nature of the}} <b>dispersoid</b> on the threshold stress is not well understood at the present time. In general, most studies indicate that the microstructure after creep is similar to that before testing and very few dislocations are usually observed. It is shown that the stress acting on a <b>dispersoid</b> due to a rapidly moving dislocation can exceed the particle yield strength of the G sub p/ 1000, where G sub p is the shear modulus of the <b>dispersoid.</b> The case when the particle deforms is examined and it is suggested that the dislocation creep threshold stress of the alloy is equal to the yield strength of the <b>dispersoid</b> under these conditions. These results indicate that the possibility that the <b>dispersoid</b> creep threshold stress is determined by either the particle yield strength or the stress required to detach a dislocation from the <b>dispersoid</b> matrix interface. The conditions under which the threshold stress is influenced by one or the other mechanism are discussed and it is shown that the particle yield strength is important until the extent of dislocation core relaxation at the <b>dispersoid</b> matrix interface exceeds about 25 pct. depending on the nature of the particle matrix combination.

40|$|The present {{work have}} {{investigated}} variants of an AA 6082 aluminium alloy. Five different alloys with various amounts of Mn, Cr and Zr {{have been subjected}} to three homogenization procedures. After homogenization, the aluminium billets were extruded into plates that were artificially aged to T 6 -temper. Further, the profiles were MIG welded to obtain a heat affected zone. The effect of these parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties of the various alloys in welded state have been studied. The microstructure after extrusion and welding were investigated by optical microscope and hardness measurements. In addition, subsequent heat treatments have been performed in an attempt to further increase the density of <b>dispersoids</b> for one specific alloy. Welding of age-hardened aluminium alloys change the microstructural hardening phase that can be a challenge for the mechanical properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ) and lead to a reduction of the yield strength. The strength of the ageing effect is crucial for the load-bearing capacity of welded structure. The degree of work hardening in the HAZ is important to achieve the same yield strength level as the base material. Introduction of <b>dispersoids</b> in the alloys can affect the microstructure and strength of the aluminium alloys, and in the present work, an attempt to increase the strength by the introduction of <b>dispersoids</b> is carried out.

The influence of the different microchemistries, with special focus on different particle structures (constituents and <b>dispersoids),</b> on the softening behavior during annealing after cold rolling and the final grain structure has been systematically studied. Time-Temperature-Transformation diagrams with respect to precipitation and recrystallization {{as a basis for}} analysis of the degree of concurrent precipitation during back-annealing have been established. Densely distributed fine pre-existing <b>dispersoids</b> and/or conditions of significant concurrent precipitation strongly slows down recrystallization kinetics and lead to a grain structure of coarse and strongly elongated grains.

Strong concurrent precipitation suppresses nucleation and retards recrystallization, which finally leads to a coarse and pan-cake shaped grain structure, accompanied by strong P { 011 }〈 566 〉 and/or M { 113 }〈 110 〉 texture components and a relatively weaker ND-rotated cube { 001 }〈 310 〉 component. A refined grain structure with medium strength P and cube { 001 }〈 100 〉 components is obtained when the pre-existing <b>dispersoids</b> are coarser and fewer, and concurrent precipitation is limited. P-oriented grains are less affected by second phase particles and experience a growth advantage at low annealing temperatures (< 350 °C), while M-oriented grains appear at higher temperatures. The intensity of the P texture does not necessarily increase with increasing supersaturation of Mn as observed during isothermal annealing, whereas the level of supersaturated Mn promotes the strength of the M texture.

40|$|Quench {{sensitivity}} in Al-Mg-Si alloys {{has been}} largely attributed to the solute loss at the heterogeneous nucleation sites, primarily <b>dispersoids,</b> during slow cooling after extrusion. As such, the number density of <b>dispersoids,</b> the solute type and concentration {{are considered to be}} the key variables for the quench sensitivity. In this study, quench sensitivity and the influence of natural ageing in a lean Al-Mg-Si alloy, AA 6060, which contains few <b>dispersoids,</b> have been investigated by hardness measurement, thermal analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). It is shown that the quench sensitivity in this alloy is associated with the degree of supersaturation of vacancies after cooling. Due to vacancy annihilation and clustering during natural ageing, the quench sensitivity is more pronounced after a short natural ageing time (30 min) compared to a longer natural ageing time (24 h). Therefore, prolonged natural ageing not only leads to an increase in hardness, but can also {{have a positive effect on}} the quench sensitivity of lean Al-Mg-Si alloys...|$|R
