5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When gay activists <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E
5|$|Castelli and Martín Rodríguez {{moved to}} the Fort for an {{interview}} with Cisneros. Juan Florencio Terrada, commander of the Infantry Grenadiers, joined them, because their barracks were located under Cisneros' window, and his presence would not allow the Viceroy to request military aid to take Castelli and Martín Rodríguez prisoners. The guards let them pass unannounced, and they found Cisneros playing cards with Brigadier Quintana, prosecutor Caspe and aide Coicolea. Castelli and Rodríguez demanded once again the convening of an open cabildo, and Cisneros reacted angrily, considering their request an outrage. Rodríguez <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> and forced him to give a definitive answer. After a short private discussion with Caspe, Cisneros reluctantly gave his consent.|$|E
5|$|On the August 23 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Orton spoke about his match against Lesnar and {{declared}} that he and Lesnar would cross paths again, before Bray Wyatt <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> therefore resuming their feud. The following week, Orton accepted Wyatt's challenge for a match at Backlash. At Backlash, Orton was attacked backstage by Wyatt before the show and subsequently lost the scheduled match by forfeit. It was later revealed that Orton was not cleared to wrestle at the event due to a legitimate concussion that occurred the previous month at SummerSlam. Orton later battled Lesnar again at a house show in Chicago in a no disqualification match, but lost once more. Orton resumed his feud with Wyatt and faced off against him at No Mercy, a match he lost due to a distraction by the returning Luke Harper. On the October 11 episode of Smackdown, Orton was paired with Kane in a tag team match against Wyatt and Harper, but once again lost the match due to distraction by Harper. On the October 25 episode of SmackDown, Orton interfered on Wyatt's behalf in his match with Kane, leading to speculation that he had joined the Wyatt Family, though this was neither confirmed nor denied by WWE or Orton. On the November 1 episode of SmackDown, Wyatt and Harper helped Orton win his match against Kane, thus confirming Orton's alliance with the group, turning heel in the process {{for the first time}} since 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
25|$|Also on the post-WrestleMania SmackDown, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon {{addressed}} the Superstar Shake-Up. His WrestleMania opponent, AJ Styles, <b>interrupted</b> <b>him,</b> {{saying that he}} wanted to stay on SmackDown, and then shook Shane's hand out of respect. The following week, Styles was confirmed to stay on SmackDown and he defeated Baron Corbin and Sami Zayn, who had moved over from Raw, to become the number one contender for the United States Championship at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{police and}} other {{security}} forces in Iraq began making similar displays of suspected insurgents and other criminals. Two defendants {{were taken to}} crime scenes to recount their role in a massacre to assembled media, while alleged members of a gang of robbers were posed behind tables stacked with the goods they had supposedly stolen. In one instance that officials later admitted they lost control of, suspected terrorists were led into an auditorium where the acting Minister of the Interior attempted to detail their crimes before not only the media but an audience {{of the family members}} of the victims. He was unable to finish as members of the latter group <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> with calls for the defendants' execution and shoeing attempts.|$|E

500|$|Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots {{made him}} target for some mild jeering. He {{spoke with a}} high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited, so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West [...] "Tweety Bird". His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> {{and asked him to}} speak English. Baylor once commented: [...] "Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can {{understand}} you." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Anderson and Rowell {{confirmed}} the calculations, the American physicist John Bardeen, who had shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics (and who shared {{it again in}} 1972), objected to Josephson's work. He submitted an article to Physical Review Letters on 25 July 1962, arguing that [...] "there can be no such superfluid flow." [...] The disagreement led to a famous confrontation in September that year at Queen Mary College, London, at the Eighth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics. When Bardeen (then {{one of the most}} eminent physicists in the world) began speaking, Josephson (still a student) stood up and <b>interrupted</b> <b>him.</b> The men exchanged views, reportedly in a civil and soft-spoken manner.|$|E
500|$|After briefly {{performing}} {{with a band}} named Kintana, Jaojoby moved to Antananarivo where he studied sociology for two years at the University of Antananarivo before accepting an offer {{to work for the}} national radio station as a journalist at the end of 1980. The following year, Jaojoby met the manager of the local Hilton hotel by chance while the two were waiting together at a bus stop. Accepting the manager's invitation to audition at the hotel's Papillon bar that same night, Jaojoby performed a cover of James Brown's [...] "Sex Machine". The manager <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> mid-song to offer Jaojoby a contract to give regular evening performances there with the Rabeson family, a popular jazz act. For the next three years Jaojoby spent his days at the national radio and his evenings singing at the Papillon {{with the exception of a}} short interlude in 1982 when he was sent to East Berlin to complete an advanced course at the International Institute of Journalism. Jaojoby was promoted to Director of the Regional Information Service in Diego-Suarez in 1984, necessitating his relocation back to the northwest coast and bringing his cabaret performances to an end.|$|E

500|$|Another major rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. This feud began the night after SummerSlam, where Michaels lost a match to Hulk Hogan. Michaels {{admitted}} he fell victim to Hogan's leg drop, a move where Hogan drops his legs across the opponent's head or chest. He concluded that Hogan was the better man {{and it was time}} to get [...] "back to reality". Midway through Michaels' speech, Masters <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> and informed Michaels that individuals like Hogan and Michaels did not know how to pass the torch to new wrestlers. Michaels went along with Masters' comments and warned Masters to not group him with Hogan. Masters concluded by stating that he was not [...] "trying" [...] to steal the spotlight from Michaels, but that he was going to [...] "take it". Michaels responded by saying that he knew where Masters was coming from, which led to Michaels slapping Masters. The two then brawled, thus turning Michaels into an on-screen hero, as he had been a villain in rivalry between Hogan. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Michaels was involved in the Masterlock Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master's full Nelson submission hold, which he calls the Master Lock. Despite Michaels' best efforts, he could not break free. Upset at the vigorous resistance of Michaels, Masters released the hold and hit Michaels with a steel chair before re-applying the hold. The following week, Michaels issued a challenge to Masters at Unforgiven, in which he vowed to get revenge on Masters for his actions the previous week.|$|E

2500|$|During President George W.

[...] He responded [...] "There's a difference Helen, {{and that is}} --". [...] "What is the difference?", she asked. He responded: [...] "The targeting of innocents {{through the use of}} terror, which is a common enemy for Yasir Arafat and for the people of Israel, as well as --". She <b>interrupted</b> <b>him,</b> saying: [...] "Palestinian people are fighting for their land." [...] He responded: [...] "I think that the killing of innocents is a category entirely different. Justifying killing of innocents for land is an argument in support of terrorism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Gary Alcock punched, slapped and pinched his partner's 15-month-old {{daughter}} in the three {{weeks leading up to}} her death before he delivered a fatal blow to the stomach which tore her internal organs because she <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> playing his Xbox. She died from internal bleeding after suffering thirty-five separate injuries including multiple bruises, rib fractures and brain damage, which were comparable to injuries suffered in a car crash. Alcock was jailed for life and must serve at least 21 years. In May 2010, French gamer Julien Barreaux located and stabbed a fellow player known only as [...] "Mikhael" [...] who had stabbed Barreaux in the game Counter-Strike 6 months earlier.

Lu Su told Guan Yu, [...] Before Lu Su could finish what he was saying, an unnamed person <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> and said, [...] "Whoever has the ability to govern the land shall have control over it.

2500|$|After a {{fair amount}} of turmoil, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were elected to the consulship for 55 BC. [...] Marcus Porcius Cato was put forward by the optimates for the praetorship. [...] To counter him, Pompeius and Crassus secured the {{election}} for Vatinius and thus successfully defeated Cato. [...] After his year in office, Vatinius was accused of bribery by Licinius Calvus. [...] Calvus had previously accused Vatinius, but this was his most eloquent speech. [...] Vatinius even <b>interrupted</b> <b>him</b> to exclaim, [...] " [...] I ask you, judges, if I am to be condemned because the accuser is eloquent." [...] Cicero, despite his previous attacks against Vatinius, defended him. He did this because he was afraid of offending the triumvirs and wanted their protection from Publius Clodius. [...] His acquittal though was more likely due to bribery by his patrons instead of Cicero's speech.|$|E
