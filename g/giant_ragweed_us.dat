Confirmation of glyphosate-resistant (GR) common and <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> in Nebraska justified the need to determine the mechanism of resistance, dispersal of resistance genes via pollen, and to develop an integrated management program. The objectives of this research were to: 1) determine the mechanism of glyphosate resistance in a common ragweed biotype from Nebraska; 2) evaluate the effect of varying growth temperatures on efficacy, absorption, and translocation of glyphosate or 2, 4 -D in GR and susceptible (GS) common and <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> biotypes; 3) quantify the pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) from GR to GS <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> under field conditions; and 4) evaluate the integrated management of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> with preplant tillage followed by PRE and/or POST herbicide programs in corn and soybean. Experiments were conducted to determine mutation(s), and amplification of the EPSPS gene (target-site mechanisms), as well as differences in uptake/translocation and the metabolism of glyphosate (non-target site mechanisms) between GR and known GS common ragweed biotypes. The results suggest that a slow rate of glyphosate absorption and translocation likely prevents the build-up of the minimum inhibitory glyphosate concentration required at the target site, resulting in resistance to glyphosate in a common ragweed biotype from Nebraska.

40|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia trifida L.) is {{an annual}} plant that {{persists}} in crop and non-crop areas. Agronomic producers often use glyphosate, {{the most widely}} used herbicide in the world, to control <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> in glyphosate resistant crops. Glyphosate inhibits EPSP synthase, the key enzyme of the shikimate pathway. Repeated use of glyphosate has resulted in the occurrence of glyphosate resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> populations in Indiana. ^ Initial studies confirmed glyphosate resistance in a <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> population from Noble County, IN at multiple rates (0. 7 kg ae ha− 1, 1. 4 kg ae ha− 1, and 2. 8 kg ae ha− 1) and growth stages. Prior to glyphosate treatment, no observational differences existed between the sensitive and resistant populations, however, after treatment a unique phenotype with rapid necrosis of mature leaves was observed in resistant plants. To classify resistance, a method was developed using fluorescence to measure photosynthetic activity. Rapid mature leaf necrosis occurred on resistant but not sensitive plants within 12 hours of glyphosate treatment. Biochemical experiments, investigating possible mechanisms for glyphosate resistance, showed no difference in EPSPS protein abundance or transcript levels between resistant and sensitive plants. 14 C-glyphosate uptake and translocation showed resistant plants translocated 28 % of absorbed glyphosate whereas sensitive plants translocated 54 % of absorbed glyphosate. NMR studies using glyphosate infiltrated leaves indicated rapid cell death in resistant plants but not in sensitive plants. To further investigate if the rapid necrosis mechanism was associated with the hypersensitive disease response pathway in plants, mass spectroscopy was used but showed no difference between glyphosate sensitive and resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> plant in salicylic acid and jasmonic acid levels after mechanical wounding.

"May 2013 "In recent years, glyphosate-resistant (GR) <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia trifida L.) has become an increasingly problematic weed of soybean production systems in Missouri and throughout the Midwest. As of 2013, <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> has been confirmed with resistance to glyphosate in 11 states and one Canadian province. The objectives of this research were to determine the effect of herbicide application timing and glyphosate tank-mix combinations on the survival of GR <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> and the influence of pre-plant (PREPLT) followed by (fb) 2 -pass post-emergence (POST) herbicide programs in GR and glufosinate-resistant soybean on GR <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> density, soybean yield, and net economic return. Results from this research indicate that POST applications to smaller plants can reduce the survival of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> compared to applications to larger plants. For a POST only management strategy, fomesafen plus glyphosate applied to 10 -cm plants fb glyphosate late post-emergence (LPOST) resulted in 37 % survival and was the lowest survival observed. Overall, <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> was nearly eliminated with PREPLT fb 2 -pass POST programs.

40|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> is one {{the most}} {{competitive}} and problematic weeds in corn and soybean fields in the Midwest. <b>Giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> is difficult to control because of an early and extended germination period, rapid growth rate, inherent tolerance to herbicides, and has now evolved resistance to glyphosate. The main goal {{in this study was}} to determine the fate of glyphosate resistance in a <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> population. Our objectives were to determine the inheritance of glyphosate resistance, fitness, and control of a glyphosate-resistant (GR) <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> biotype from Indiana. In a glyphosate dose response experiment, the LD 50 values of GR, glyphosate-susceptible (GS), R[female]S[male] F 1, and S[female]R[male] F 1 plants at 21 DAT were 3, 142 g, 73 g, 2, 181 g, and 774 g ae ha- 1, respectively. At 400 g ae ha- 1 of glyphosate, the backcross progeny of GS x S[female]R[male] F 1 segregated according to our null hypothesis of 1 R: 1 S for mortality at 21 DAT, but not for necrosis at 3 DAT. The results indicated glyphosate resistance is manifested by a single major, semi-dominant to dominant gene, depending on the maternal parent, and is transferable through pollen and/or seed. Also, our results demonstrated that rapid necrosis did associated with plant survival at 21 DAT, but the continuous phenotypic variation observed suggested resistance is influenced by environmental conditions, epistatic interactions, or by additional minor genes. In the absence of glyphosate, GR and GS plants had a similar growth pattern, but during reproduction, GR plants flowered earlier and produced 25 % less seed than GS plants. In the presence of glyphosate at 840 g followed by 2, 520 g ae ha- 1, plants with the GR trait were the superior biotype and required additional methods of control, rather than glyphosate alone. Tank mixtures of glyphosate plus fomesafen controlled 15 cm tall GR plants ≤ 65 %; however, reduced rates of fomesafen tank mixed with glyphosate or glufosinate at the label field use rate did provide ≥ 90 % control of 20 to 30 cm tall GS <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed.</b> Our results demonstrate control of GR <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> will not be easy and the fate of glyphosate resistance in <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> will continue to persist, and could potentially spread rapidly via pollen and/or seed mediated gene flow in our current glyphosate-dominated agricultural ecosystem. ...|$|R

The introduction of herbicide glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine in early 19702 ̆ 7 s provided farmers with a better and low-cost tool to control weeds. The use of glyphosate drastically increased after the development of glyphosate resistant agronomic crops in 1996 and was use as a post-emergence selective herbicide. This led to overreliance and repeated use of glyphosate for weed control especially in roundup ready corn and soybean cropping systems and resulted in tremendous selection pressure for evolution of glyphosate resistant weeds and specifically <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> in Indiana. Our research investigated the response of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-susceptible (GS) <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> to glyphosate treatment under varying environmental conditions and the fitness and competitiveness of glyphosate resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed.</b> Greenhouse studies investigated response of GS and GR <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> biotypes to various doses of glyphosate and to light and temperature. GR plants had a unique response when treated with glyphosate, exhibiting initial rapid necrosis of mature leaves within 12 hours of treatment.

There was definite variation in the degree of reactivity to the various pollens in different patients. One additional patient reacted to dwarf ragweed but not to <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> or to four other composites. Antibody neutralization studies in six cases indicated that (a) in four cases dwarf ragweed could have been the only sensitizing allergen. (b) In one case either dwarf or <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> could have been the only sensitizing allergen. (c) In one case cosmos plus either of the ragweeds or some undetermined pollen could have been the sensitizing allergen, (d) In none of the six cases studied could cosmos, sunflower, goldenrod, or dandelion have been the only sensitizing allergens. The evidence presented supports the following concepts: (1) Hypersensitiveness of this type develops as the result of allergenic stimulation. (2) The pollens of the ragweeds and their botanic relatives contain, in addition to species-specific allergens, multiple common allergenic determinants which vary in their distribution among related species. (3) A person exposed simultaneously to a group of allergens may become sensitized to certain members of the group and not to others, while another person, exposed to the same group of allergens, may become sensitized to different members of the group...|$|R

40|$|Glyphosate-resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> can {{be found}} in {{agricultural}} fields throughout the mid-western United States and southwestern Ontario. Environmental factors can influence growth and herbicide efficacy in C 3 plant species. I measured the aboveground injury to resistant and susceptible seedlings for 28 d following glyphosate treatment to test the hypothesis that young leaf stages would be more susceptible to glyphosate under warm, dry, low-CO 2 conditions. Glyphosate-resistance was not affected by environmental factors, leaf stage, or glyphosate dose, but plants grown at the highest temperature after spray had the least glyphosate injury. Resistant alleles may be associated with fitness penalties because they are rare in populations without herbicide selection pressures; however, in a greenhouse trial, resistant biotypes recovered from glyphosate injury and produced seeds. My results suggest that potentially stressful growth conditions and treatment at young growth stages will not improve the control of resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> biotypes...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{glyphosate}} use {{has contributed}} to {{an increasing number of}} problematic glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds. The mechanism of resistance in many GR weeds is poorly understood, in part, due to a poor understanding of how exactly glyphosate kills a plant. In previous research, the efficacy of glyphosate was demonstrated to be strongly influenced by root invading soil-borne microorganisms. However, this interaction among plants, glyphosate, and soil microorganisms has only been studied in a number of crop plants, but not in weed species. This is surprising since the soil biotic environment has a strong impact on the activity of this important herbicide. Gaining a better understanding of these interactions may shed more light on the performance of glyphosate in the field and the evolution of glyphosate resistance. The objective of this research was to determine the role of soil microbes in the resistance to glyphosate of three problematic weeds of the midwestern United States: <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia trifida L.), horseweed [(Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq. ], and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.). Through a series of greenhouse and lab experiments we determined that root colonization by soil microorganisms increased the activity of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant (GR) and -susceptible (GS) biotypes of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> and a GS common lambsquarters biotype, but not in horseweed biotypes. The GS biotypes of each weed species were colonized by a greater number of soil microorganisms, specifically oomycete (e. g. Pythium spp. and Phytophthora spp.) pathogens, when treated with glyphosate, compared to the GR biotypes. These data suggested that the ability of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> to tolerate a glyphosate application may involve differences in the susceptibility to soil microbial colonization, specifically Pythium spp. However, the degree of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> susceptibility to two Pythium species, P. ultimum and P. aphanidermatum, did not differ between the GR and GS biotypes grown in disease conducive conditions, in the absence of glyphosate. Utilizing next-generation sequencing revealed that the rhizosphere microbial community of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> is different between the GR and GS biotypes, and the microbial community is perturbed by a glyphosate treatment. Glyphosate does cause changes to the diversity of the rhizosphere microbial community 3 days after treatment, and this needs to be investigated further. Overall, the results of this research demonstrate that rhizosphere interactions are important to the mode of action of glyphosate, in the weed species selected. These findings suggest that the range of tolerance to glyphosate observed in weeds and the evolution of resistance in weed biotypes may also be influenced by rhizosphere interactions. Understanding these interactions are crucial in understanding the biology of these weed species and the resistance to this herbicide. ...|$|R

Overall distribution and frequency of these resistant species is unknown. The objectives of this research were to understand the frequency and distribution of glyphosate-resistant weeds in Nebraska. Common and problematic weeds of Nebraska were arbitrarily collected from fields in 77 counties during the fall of 2013 - 2015. From our statewide collection, five species including: horseweed (Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronq.), kochia (Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.), Russian-thistle (Salsola tragus L.), <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> (Ambrosia trifida L.), and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) were selected and subjected to a dose response study at the Pesticide Application Technology Laboratory in North Platte, NE. With these collected populations, a dose response screening was conducted for their resistance to glyphosate, if present, and determine the statewide distribution of glyphosate-resistance. Resistance was again confirmed in horseweed, <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed,</b> and kochia, with resistant populations being found throughout the eastern, north eastern, and south western portions of the state. No glyphosate resistance was observed among collected populations of common lambsquarters and Russian thistle. Adviser: Greg R. Kruge...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} was to {{understand}} how plants reacted to environmental stress and evolved to overcome it. The land plants that we see today evolved from a green algal ancestor around 510 million years ago. Plants had to make significant changes to their cellular, morphological, regulatory and physiological processes during their adaptation to the terrestrial environment from an aquatic environment. The first part {{of the project was}} to find out how these changes were reflected on the protein makeup of the early land plants. The gene model sequence data of two early land plants, Physcomitrella patens (moss) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae). We specifically focused on the protein family expansion of protein kinases due to their roles in various important functions that would affect the transition from water to land. We developed a gene model quality evaluation method to score the gene models of P. patens and C. reinhardtii using well-studied plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) to improve the poor quality gene models that currently exist. The resulting corrected gene models were analyzed using functional annotation methods to understand how the proteomics of the early land plants varied from modern land plants. ^ The second part of the project was to identify the genes responsible for herbicide resistance in Ambrosia trifida (<b>giant</b> <b>ragweed).</b> <b>Giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> {{is one of the most}} competitive annual weeds in corn and soybean production across the eastern Corn Belt in the United States. The use of glyphosate (commercial name: Roundup) and glyphosate-ready crop systems managed to keep <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> populations under control. Glyphosate-ready crop systems consist of seeds that are resistant to glyphosate, which enables farmers to use glyphosate to control the population of weeds. But in the last decade, glyphosate-resistant <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> populations have been reported across the world. It is a huge problem to farmers since it results in unusable glyphosate-ready cropping systems and huge yield losses. Glyphosate-resistant and sensitive plants were identified from across the Midwestern United States and a RNA-seq experiment was performed by isolating the total mRNA from leaf material, and obtaining the expressed messenger RNA sequences. The genetic makeup of the sensitive and resistant strains was thus compared based on their transcriptome data, and a list of potential genes that were differentially expressed between them was identified. We also analyzed how much the quality of the transcriptome can be improved by using the transcriptome and genome of sunflower, a closely-related plant. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify regional-scale variation in vital rates of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> and common sunflower. To accomplish this objective, a common field experiment was conducted across seven sites between 2006 and 2008 throughout the north central U. S. maize belt. Demographic parameters of both weed species were measured in intra- and interspecific competitive environments, and environmental data were collected within site-years. Site was the strongest predictor of below ground vital rates (summer and winter seed survival and seedling recruitment), indicating sensitivity to local abiotic conditions. However, biotic factors influenced above ground vital rates (seedling survival and fecundity). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) indicated that demography of both species was most strongly influenced by thermal time and precipitation. The first PLSR components, both characterized by thermal time, explained 63. 2 % and 77. 0 % of variation in the demography of <b>giant</b> <b>ragweed</b> and common sunflower, respectively; the second PLSR components, both characterized by precipitation, explained 18. 3 % and 8. 5 % of variation, respectively.
