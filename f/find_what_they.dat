25|$|The {{public library}} {{was one of}} the most {{important}} points of access for interviewees, along with the internet and bookstores. Interviewees often relied heavily on online library catalogs as safe, anonymous searches to explore lesbian fiction. Participants often did not <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking for in online catalogs, but were not surprised by the lack of materials. Rothbauer suggests making materials more visible, and also improving the scope and currency of library holdings to reach these users.|$|E

2500|$|The huge {{explosion}} of workers coming {{to live in}} cities like Richmond, caused intense strain on city infrastructure. One of these strains was the severe lack of housing. Workers arriving in these rapidly expanding urban centers were forced to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could.

2500|$|Women {{with larger}} breasts (cup size greater than D) {{can have a}} {{difficult}} time finding a correctly sized bra because many stores do not offer a sufficient range of bras in greater sizes. Many salespeople are not trained in how to properly fit a bra, and when the customer can not <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, will sell the customer the next largest or smallest size. Some salespeople measure customers over their shirt and bra, adding errors to every measurement. Elisabeth Squires, an author of a breast-health and bra guide, says [...] "Most really good fitters will tell you this is an art, not a science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Aristotle {{believes}} people receive {{all kinds}} of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or [...] "imprints", people are continually weaving together new [...] "imprints" [...] of things they experience. In order to search for these [...] "imprints", people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are looking for. Recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of [...] "images" [...] is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of [...] "images" [...] is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated {{the one that was}} needed.|$|E

2500|$|Another legend {{involves}} {{a group of}} teenagers who, while drunk and/or tripping {{on some sort of}} hallucinogen, <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> perceive to be a gnome (sometimes a dwarf, hobgoblin or smurf), capture it, and bring it home. [...] They sleep off the drug's effects, and the next morning they find out that the [...] "gnome" [...] was really a lost (and very frightened) child. [...] Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a missing child whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. [...] According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and as of 2007 the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable. [...] In some versions of a legend the [...] "gnome" [...] is not a child but a midget or a person with Down Syndrome; some have even gone as far to say it was a dead baby.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Manaus were {{neighbors of}} a large lake, & even several Great Lakes; because they are very {{frequent}} in a low country [...] subject to flooding. The Manaus pulled gold from the Yquiari & seized small flakes: these are real facts, which were used in exaggeration, giving rise to the fable {{of the city of}} Manoa & Golden Lake. If we find that there {{is still a long way}} from the small flakes of gold of the Manaus, to the [...] roofs of the town of Manoa, & that there is nonetheless far from the glitter of this metal, ripped from the waters of the Yquiari, to the fable of Parime gold; one cannot deny that on the one hand greed & concern of Europeans who wanted by any force to <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking for, and on the other, clever liars & exaggerating Indians , interested in sending away the uncomfortable visitors, might alter & deface [...] to the point of making them unrecognizable. The history of the discoveries of the new world provides more than one example of similar metamorphoses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumplestiltskin {{emerges from}} the vault with the box and Anna tells him {{to tell her what}} {{happened}} to her parents since she helped him retrieve the box. [...] Rumplestiltskin tells Anna that the King and Queen of Arendelle arrived on his doorstep seeking a way to take away Elsa's powers forever. Anna argues that her parents loved Elsa, but Rumplestiltskin argues that their actions implied that they feared her. He tells her that they did not <b>find</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking for, but the box contains a sorcerer's hat which can take away any person's magic. Rumplestiltskin states that the hat will make him unstoppable when the hat has enough power. Anna tells him that the Apprentice could stop him, but Rumplestiltskin states he is no longer there. However, the Apprentice, now {{in the form of a}} mouse, jumps onto Rumplestiltskin's hand and bites him, causing him to drop the dagger. Anna picks up the dagger and realizes that she can control him with the dagger. Anna uses the dagger to force Rumplestiltskin to give her the box, and saying he will never harm either of the sisters and their family, as well as commanding him to turn the Apprentice back into his human form. He agrees and sends Anna away in a puff of red smoke, before screaming in a fit of a rage.|$|E
