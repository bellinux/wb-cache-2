40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent or calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent modified by CaO <b>expanding</b> agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|R

40|$|WO 2003069002 A UPAB: 20030910 NOVELTY - Production of an {{expandable}} metal body comprises compacting {{a mixture}} containing {{at least one}} metal {{and at least one}} gas-splitting <b>expanding</b> agent to form a semi-finished product, in which the particles of the metal are tightly bound to one another and form a gas-tight seal for gas particles released from the gas <b>expanding</b> agent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A mixture of powdered or liquid metal and powdered or liquid metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is treated with a liquid or gaseous non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material. The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is added to the metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material to form the <b>expanding</b> agent. Preferred Features: The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is a hydrating agent and the <b>expanding</b> agent is a metal hydride. The hydrating agent is hydrogen gas or a gas mixture containing hydrogen. The reaction of the non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material with the metal -containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is carried out at 300 - 700, preferably 400 - 600 deg.

A similar characterization is also given for the infra-nilmanifolds with a non-trivial self-cover, which corresponds to determining which almost-Bieberbach groups are co-Hopfian.

The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway. US113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE1 from Milford to Dover. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) plans to upgrade US113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.|$|E
