50|$|The movie {{begins on}} a rainy night. We see the infamous Amityville Horror house. Six priests, led by Father Manfred (Norman Lloyd) enter the house and start to exorcise it. One of the priests, Father Dennis <b>Kibbler</b> (Fredric Lehne) is in an upstairs bedroom and begins to bless it when he sees a glowing brass floor lamp. As he begins to chant, {{a burst of energy}} emerges from the outlet, through the cord, and into the lamp. A demonic face appears in the large round bulb. <b>Kibbler</b> is knocked across the room and is unconscious.|$|E
50|$|The police {{investigate}} {{though they}} do not find the plumber's body. Father <b>Kibbler</b> contacts Nancy and tries to convince her that the evil has taken possession of an object from the Amityville house. They rush home {{only to find that}} the lamp used a window to knock out Amanada and has brainwashed Jessica, who stabs Father <b>Kibbler</b> in the shoulder, while the lamp's extension cord tries to stop him from exorcising it. The day is saved by Alice who grabs the lamp and throws it out of the window, shattering it on the rocky shore.The movie ends with the family thinking their ordeal is over, not realizing that the dead plumber is still inside their house. The camera pans to the remains of the lamp, showing the evil within has now possessed the family's cat.|$|E

Storm:Andrew had certain things that he wanted, which I had to accommodate, but within that I was trying to make a comedy about acceptance and prejudice. But even though it was hugely unsuccessful, it was my first attempt at comedy, which I really enjoyed. Some people still come up and say they like it and have it in their collections and talk about it being hugely underrated.The producers originally wanted to import Tom Conti to play the lead but Actors Equity objected.

40|$|From {{the patient}} to the {{clinical}} mycology laboratory: how can we optimise microscopy and culture methods for mould identification? Timoleon-Achilleas A Vyzantiadis, 1 Elizabeth M Johnson, 2 Christopher C <b>Kibbler</b> 3 The identification of fungi relies mainly on morphological criteria. However, {{there is a need}} for robust and definitive phenotypic identification procedures in order to evaluate continuously evolving molecular methods. For the future, there is an emerging consensus that a combined (phenotypic and molecular) approach is more powerful for fungal identification, especially for moulds. Most of the procedures used for phenotypic identification are based on experience rather than comparative studies of effectiveness or performance and {{there is a need for}} standardisation among mycology laboratories. This review summarises and evaluates the evidence for the major existing phenotypic identification procedures for the predominant causes of opportunistic mould infection. We have concentrated mainly on Aspergillus, Fusarium and mucoraceous mould species, as these are the most important clinically and the ones for which there are the most molecular taxonomic data...|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{artisans}} {{produced and}} refined {{a set of}} pre-conceived images of Japanese landscapes that includes a particular cultural vision and spatial typology that is unique to this culture. 1 This thesis will examine the Cowra Japanese Garden, NSW, during 1972 – 2014 through an Australian heritage framework, applying a set of values to determine significance. In order to view the ‘Japanese Garden fabric’ through an Australian/Western lens, cultural significance is crucial to bridge the cultural East/West gap and interpret the Cowra Japanese Garden with a greater depth of recognition, meaning and appreciation. The garden is situated high above the town of Cowra on Bellevue Hill. This is in propinquity to the only Japanese War Cemetery outside of Japan, and geographically located next to the old Prisoner of War (POW) Camp (NSW Heritage Listed), offering a landscape sprinkled with remnants of wartime state-controlled relics. The objective to conserve places of heritage significance, identifying key values in a culturally rich landscape with contrasting social inputs and fabric. Exploring how WWII captured Japanese soldiers dealt with stigma, shame and regaining honour through death, contrasts the social conflicts that underlie historical markers. The Japanese garden itself, constructed as a commemorative garden resulting from the ‘Cowra Breakout’ (1944) event, provides a persistent impact on Cowra, and Australia. Reciprocal social gestures of good will, peace, and reconciliation symbolise the Garden fabric. The dichotomy of treatment of inmates from Cowra POW camp and those at Featherston, New Zealand, to the trauma Australian POW survivors suffered under the Japanese military at Naoetsu POW camp highlights issues of equality and respect. The thesis will document and interpret the cultural heritage significance of the Cowra Japanese Garden in order to disclose how this landscape was ‘reproduced’. It will do this from interviewing the local initiator, visionary and Garden Chairman, Don <b>Kibbler,</b> who saw {{the concept of a}} Japanese Garden to reality, and studying the designer, celebrated Japanese Landscape Architect, Ken Nakajima (1914 – 2000). By pursuing the transformation of a landscape tradition, from bonsai to stroll garden, and in turn revealing how a culture is shaped, and how an Australian town’s identity has grown because of the intercultural exchange with Japan. Compared to other stroll gardens in Australia, the Cowra Japanese Garden represents an outstanding, authentic Japanese stroll garden, inclusive of an emerging Australian East/West cultural perspective...|$|E

5|$|The {{challenge}} with <b>Kibble</b> balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of <b>Kibble</b> balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's <b>Kibble</b> balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the <b>Kibble</b> balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} <b>Kibble</b> balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of <b>Kibble</b> balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern for the {{long-term}} health effects of selenium (Se) over- or underfeeding. The efficiency of utilization of dietary Se is subject to many factors. Our study in dogs evaluated the effect of diet type (canned versus <b>kibble)</b> and dietary protein concentration on Se digestibility and bioactivity. Canned and <b>kibble</b> diets are commonly used formats of dog food, widely ranging in protein concentration. Twenty-four Labrador retrievers were used and four canned and four <b>kibble</b> diets were selected with crude protein concentrations ranging from 10. 1 to 27. 5 g/MJ. Crude protein concentration had no influence on the digestibility of Se in either canned or <b>kibble</b> diets, but a lower Se digestibility was observed in canned compared to <b>kibble</b> diets. However, the biological activity of Se, as measured by whole blood glutathione peroxidase, was higher in dogs fed the canned diets than in dogs fed the <b>kibble</b> diets and decreased with increasing crude protein intake. These results indicate that selenium recommendations in dog foods need to take diet type into account...|$|R
