25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E

500|$|Labyrinth {{took five}} months to film, {{and was a}} {{complicated}} shoot due to the myriad of puppets and animatronic creatures involved. In the making-of documentary Inside the Labyrinth, Henson stated that although Jim Henson's Creature Shop had been building the puppets and characters required for around {{a year and a}} half prior to shooting, [...] "everything came together in the last couple weeks." [...] Henson noted, [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> characters together, the puppeteers start working with them, they find problems or they try to figure out what they're going to do with these characters." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{dealing with}} the {{dialogue}} in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters {{as if they were}} actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: [...] "If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> rest of the troop talk their heads off about them." [...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E
500|$|Oklahoma Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, then-chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, didn't plan to see {{the film}} (which he appears in), and {{compared}} it to Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf. [...] "If you say the same lie over and over again, and particularly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> media's support, people will believe it," [...] Inhofe said, adding that he thought Gore was {{trying to use the}} issue to run for president again in 2008. In contrast to Inhofe, Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, did not criticize Gore's efforts or the movie, which he planned to see. Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, said [...] "Because (Gore) was a former vice president and presidential nominee, he brings a lot of visibility to (the issue)," [...] Alexander said. [...] "On the other hand it may be seen as political by some, and they may be less eager {{to be a part of}} it." [...] Alexander also criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film. [...] "Maybe it needs a sequel: 'An Inconvenient Truth 2: Nuclear Power.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mountain of Madness" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the script underwent many rewrites. According to Josh Weinstein, [...] "a Swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy German machine and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> wrong engineers try to fix it, it blows up. And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] {{but a lot of}} the more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that this was one of the first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E

2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} at the moment. He received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it." [...] The voice of the talking fox was also supplied by Dafoe, although the recording was heavily manipulated.|$|E

I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I {{wanted to be part}} of a new {{beginning}} for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them — but I'm ready and training hard. I like the pressure," [...] he said, making it clear that the USA and Qatar hardly excited him as much as India. Pirès is a regular at Arsenal's training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: [...] "He told me if you have it in you and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> passion to go play in India, then do it.

[...] "The reception at the airport was amazing," [...] he said, on his unveiling in India, before adding, [...] "Thank you for the welcome India... and the spicy food." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} the Titan's Training Camp in Clarksville & Nashville, Tennessee which started July 25. Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...
