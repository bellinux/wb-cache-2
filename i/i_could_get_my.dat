500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with 60 Minutes, Hoffman revealed he {{had engaged in}} {{drug and alcohol abuse}} during his time at New York University, saying he had used [...] "anything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on. I liked it all." [...] Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a drug rehabilitation program at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about 10 days in May of that year.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{influences}} behind The Operative: No One Lives Forever {{were primarily}} 1960s spy-themed films, novels, television shows, {{as well as}} historical references. When {{it was decided that}} NOLF {{was going to be a}} 1960s spy game, lead designer Craig Hubbard started immersing himself in the subject matter, in order to [...] "develop some fluency" [...] in it. As he explained, he [...] "was a big fan of early Bond films, but didn't know a lot about the whole spy craze. So I watched the Derek Flint movies , Modesty Blaise, Matt Helm, , Avengers – anything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on." [...] Other influences included books, such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, TV shows like The Saint, The Pink Panther films, commando movies, such as The Guns of Navarone, as well as [...] "lots of historical references, encompassing everything from books and documentaries on the spy trade to fashion catalogs and interior-design books." [...] The basis for the biological explosives plot was the 1967 film Casino Royale. According to Hubbard, [...] "the idea was to create a game that would make you feel like a superspy, so we tried to come up with situations, characters, and settings to support that goal." [...] During the course of the game, the player can hear explicit popular culture references, including the TV series The Prisoner and The Fugitive, the Matt Helm films The Silencers and The Ambushers, and exotica musicians Les Baxter and Sondi Sodsai. Other conversations allude to major events of the time, such as the studio years of The Beatles, and the commercial failure of the Edsel automobile.|$|E

6000|$|... "If he {{afterward}} {{got in my}} way--that is, thrust himself {{between me}} and something I wanted to do--I would try all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> foot on him, and then perhaps keep it there {{a little longer than}} was necessary." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{my parents}} made a partial living weaving baskets, the two {{concepts}} of 'profession' and 'art' never {{came together in}} my mind until... college... I read everything <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [...] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical lesson was that art could be a profession {{as well as a}} passion.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{ought to}} have spoken first, that is certain; but ere <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> phrases well arranged, the young lady, {{rendered}} desperate I suppose by my hesitation opened the conversation herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should say," [...] another said, [...] "that we had best {{make him}} our cook. Old Rollo is always grumbling at being kept at the work, and his cooking gets worse and worse. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>my</b> jaws into the meat this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|But now {{my voice}} was fainter. It was all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> breath. The room swam round and round before my eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} has {{something}} to do with poachers." [...] Fitzpiers was still so shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile, and it was not until Grace said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> <b>my</b> skirt out nobody would know anything about it," [...] that he bestirred himself.|$|R
6000|$|I lit in {{the middle}} of the floor, shot there by the {{electric}} suddenness of the surprise. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> voice I said, apologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Curse you, I {{have wished}} {{a hundred million}} times that you were tangible, and that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on your throat once! Oh, but I will wreak a deadly vengeance on--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has joined}} his friends without losin' any time. I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> fingers around his throat {{for a couple}} of minutes!" [...] Jerry cried, shaking his fist in {{impotent}} rage.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It {{was painted}} {{when you were}} a young man, four years before you were an associate, Smee. Had some success in its time, and there's good pints about that picture,' Gandish goes on. 'But <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> price for it; and here it hangs in my own room. Igh art won't do in this country, Colonel--it's a melancholy fact.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The cayuse wouldna carry {{a weight}} like mine across the bench belt and Green Lake's a two-days' hike.

6000|$|Jefferson drummed {{with his}} fingers upon the table. [...] "That's the trouble. I have a little left, but I'm not quite sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> it into <b>my</b> hands without the mailing to and fro of signed papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not to}} {{be blamed}} in the slightest; but if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on him at this moment he would regret most {{sincerely}} ever having such a thought in his head." ...|$|E
6000|$|Reinhart's {{battered}} {{face was}} dark with hate. [...] "I should have killed all of you. All of you!" [...] An ugly sneer twisted across his shredded lips. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands loose--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I haven't {{forgotten}} about that money belt," [...] returned Shamhaven. [...] "And I wouldn't mind taking it if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on it. But Russell must wear it {{most of the}} time." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{their honeymoon}} in Switzerland in 1947, Eric and Salome Estorick met Arturo Bryks, {{a former teacher}} at the Bauhaus, who {{introduced}} them to Umberto Boccioni's book on Italian Futurism. Before returning from their honeymoon they visited Mario Sironi in Milan from whom they bought a large quantity of his work. Estorick wrote: [...] I just bought hundreds of drawings, and as many pictures as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into <b>my</b> Packard convertible Roadster.|$|R
60|$|They ran before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into <b>my</b> stride, so I {{told the}} dog Harvey what I {{thought of them}} and his mistress. He never shifted his position, but stared at me, an intense, {{lopsided}} stare, eye after eye. Malachi came along when he had seen his sister off, and from a distance counselled me to drown the brute and consort with gentlemen again. But the dog Harvey never even cocked his cockable ear.|$|R
60|$|How he and Jim and Emett {{rolled and}} cracked the stone! For a moment <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> off <b>my</b> horse; I was chained to my saddle by a strange vacillation {{that could have}} been no other thing than fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if those}} boys stole the box, they {{will most likely}} {{turn it over to}} the {{professor}} and Brown," [...] said Uncle Barney. [...] "Oh, if only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on them!" [...] and his eyes flashed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; by {{the time}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hat on she had heard it, poor thing, and was gone to Backsworth; for he's there, in the county gaol; was taken at the station, I believe; I don't half {{understand}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a rank shame, Songbird!" [...] he cried, at the {{conclusion}} of the narrative. [...] "I know just how you feel. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on that Blackie Crowden, I think I'd put him in the hospital first and in prison afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{much prefer}} that she should, for then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up on <b>my</b> legs and answer {{her off the}} reel." [...] Of course {{everybody}} there understood what she meant,--including old John Bates, who stood at the sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, John! {{not for the}} world. Gracie must stay, {{and keep}} house for you. She's such a help to you, {{that it would be}} a shame to take her away. But I think mamma would go with me,--if you could take me there, and engage my rooms and all that, why, mamma could stay with me, you know. To be sure, it would be a trial not to have you there; but then if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> up <b>my</b> strength, you know,"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's lovely. Suppose {{it had to}} be cut {{off when}} she had the fever. Wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> rid of <b>my</b> mop, it's such a bother;" [...] and Becky was seen tying a clean towel over the great knot that made her head look very like a copper kettle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot go with you, Halbert," [...] {{answered}} Mary, [...] "because I must {{study this}} lesson--it {{will take me}} long to learn it--I am sorry I am so dull, for if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> task as fast as Edward, I should like to go with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|There he was, {{just the}} same old Jack, with his splendid big {{shoulders}} and his lovely brown eyes. And his necktie was crooked, too; as soon as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands free I put them up and straightened it out for him. How nice and old-timey that was! ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he said hoarsely, “I had a notion. That man {{never meant}} to wipe us out to‐day. We were to taste death, and live with the grit crushed out of us, because he figured we would be of some use to him. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> hands on him I’d kill him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was riding}} {{through the mist}} to find the marshal; whom I had not seen for two hours, as I was with the {{regiment}} that defended the church at Hochkirch, and then cut its way out through the Austrians. The mist was so thick that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see ten yards ahead, and rode plump into an Austrian battalion. They fired a volley that killed poor Turk, and before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> on <b>my</b> feet <b>I</b> was surrounded and taken prisoner--not a very heroic way, I must admit." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{presently}} {{the wall}} of fire rolled by and took the roar with it. Dense billows of smoke followed, and hid everything in opaque darkness. I heard the hiss of failing sparks and the crackle of burning wood, and occasionally the crash of a failing branch. It was intolerably hot, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stand the heat better than the air. I coughed and strangled. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> <b>my</b> breath. My eyes smarted and burned. Crawling close under the bank, I leaned against it and waited.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>my</b> business. Judas, but I {{get tired}} of it! When I left the farm I never s'posed I'd find myself nailed {{down to the floor}} of a barber-shop, but here I am and making good money. How'd you like to go on a ranch?" [...] he asked, meaningly.|$|R
