25|$|Win16 is the API for the first, 16-bit {{versions}} of Microsoft Windows. These were initially {{referred to as}} simply the Windows API, but were later renamed to Win16 {{in an effort to}} distinguish them from the newer, 32-bit version of the Windows API. The functions of Win16 API reside in mainly the core files of the OS: kernel.exe (or krnl286.exe or krnl386.exe), user.exe and gdi.exe. Despite the <b>file</b> <b>extension</b> of exe, these actually are dynamic-link libraries.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the classic}} Mac OS did not {{recognize}} <b>file</b> <b>extensions</b> at all, leading to unrecognized file errors when files were transferred from DOS/Windows systems. OPENSTEP, which {{formed the basis of}} Mac OS X, used extensions, and early versions of Mac OS X followed suit. This led to some controversy with users and developers coming to OS X from NeXT or Windows origins advocating for continued use of <b>file</b> <b>extensions,</b> and those coming from Classic Mac OS urging Apple to replace or supplement <b>file</b> <b>extensions</b> with type and creators.|$|R

2500|$|The [...]FileFunction {{attribute}} is {{the standardized}} method to link each layer in the PCB with its corresponding Gerber file in the fabrication data. If attributes are not supported only informal methods are available. A simple informal {{method is to}} express the file function clearly in the file name. Sometimes the <b>file</b> <b>extension</b> is abused to indicate the file function - e.g[...]BOT for the bottom layer rather than the standard extension [...]GBR. This is very impractical as the customary link between format and extension is lost.|$|E
2500|$|An {{address locator}} is a dataset in ArcGIS that stores the address attributes, {{associated}} indexes, and rules {{that define the}} process for translating nonspatial descriptions of places, such as street addresses, into spatial data that can be displayed as features on a map.

2500|$|Although GIF {{allows for}} animation, {{it was decided}} that PNG should be a single-image format. [...] In 2001, the {{developers}} of PNG published the Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format, with support for animation. [...] MNG achieved moderate application support, but not enough among mainstream web browsers and no usage among web site designers or publishers. [...] In 2008, certain Mozilla developers published the Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) format with similar goals. APNG is a format that is natively supported by Gecko- and Presto-based web browsers and is also commonly used for thumbnails on Sony's PlayStation Portable system (using the normal PNG <b>file</b> <b>extension),</b> and as of 2017, usage of APNG remains minimal despite being supported by all major browsers but Microsoft Edge.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{the lack}} of formal video support in Ogg {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} the OGM file format, a hack on Ogg that allowed embedding of video from the Microsoft DirectShow framework into an Ogg-based wrapper. OGM was initially supported only by closed source Windows-only tools, but the code base was subsequently opened. Later, video (and subtitle) support were formally specified for Ogg but in a manner incompatible with OGM. Independently, the Matroska container format reached maturity and provided another alternative for people interested in combining Vorbis audio and arbitrary video codecs. As a result, OGM is no longer supported or developed and is formally discouraged by Xiph.org. Today, video in Ogg is found with the [...]ogv <b>file</b> <b>extension,</b> which is formally specified and officially supported.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless is a {{lossless}} {{incarnation of}} Windows Media Audio, an audio codec by Microsoft, released in early 2003. It compresses an audio CD {{to a range}} of 206 to 411MB, at bit rates of 470 to 940 kbit/s. The result is a bit-for-bit duplicate of the original audio file; in other words, the audio quality on the CD will be the same as the file when played back. WMA Lossless uses the same [...]WMA <b>file</b> <b>extension</b> as other Windows Media Audio formats. It supports 6 discrete channels and up to 24-bit/96kHz lossless audio. [...] The format has never been publicly documented, although an open source decoder has been reverse engineered for non-Microsoft platforms by the libav and ffmpeg projects.|$|E
