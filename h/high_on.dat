40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine the sport orientations and goal {{perspectives}} of wheelchair adult athletes who differed on gender and type of sport. Participants were 34 male and 14 female marathoners and 166 male and 29 female basketball players. Instruments were the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ) and the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ). Separate 2 x 2 (Gender x Sport) multivariate analysis of variance revealed that on the SOQ, males scored <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> competitive orientation, females scored <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> goal orientation, and no gender differences occurred on win orientation. Basketball players scored <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> win orientation, marathoners scored <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> goal orientation, and no differences occurred between sport groups on competitiveness orientation. On the TEOSQ, there were no gender differences;; marathoners scored <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> ego orientation, and no differences occurred between sport groups on task orientation...|$|R

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} links between narcissism, unethical behavior, and undergraduate business majors. It has been theorized that altruism {{has a negative}} relationship with narcissism and research {{has suggested}} that religiosity is linked to disapproval of the unethical. Based on this information, the current study hypothesized that business majors would score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> narcissism than religion majors, measured as selfism using the Phares and Erskine Selfism Test. The current study also hypothesized that religion majors would score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> altruism than business majors, measured by Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s Self-Report Altruism Scale. Forty-one male and 27 female undergraduates majoring in either business or religion participated in the study. Results revealed that business majors did score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> narcissism measured as selfism, though religion majors did not score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> altruism...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton <b>high</b> <b>on</b> his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. The English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories <b>high.</b> <b>On</b> each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction.

40|$|I {{conducted}} a meta-analysis of 121 samples (N = 18, 694) that examined {{the relation between}} age and job performance with job complexity as a moderator.

5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are <b>high</b> <b>on</b> the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are <b>high</b> <b>on</b> the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

40|$|In {{studies on}} gender {{differences}} {{with respect to}} Holland's (1997) vocational interests, men often score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Realistic (and sometimes also on Investigative and Enterprising) interests, and women score <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Social and Artistic interests. In research and practice, vocational interests are almost exclusively assessed by means of questionnaires. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether these results are also stable across assessment methods. Thus, a questionnaire and a nonverbal interest inventory were administered to a sample of N = 448 participants. Results were in the expected direction for both inventories, men scoring <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Realistic interests and women scoring <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> Artistic and Social interests. However, the structure of interests varied between men and women. The structural assumptions of Holland's theory fit the data for men better than the data for women. Thus, mean-level gender differences should be interpreted conservatively...|$|R
