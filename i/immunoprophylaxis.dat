50|$|The {{solutions}} {{that can help}} malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than the challenges, {{but if they are}} effective they can truly change the areas currently affected. There are number of groups working on a vaccine, some are looking to control the transmission of the parasite to the host, or control transmission from human back to the vector. These vaccines are not very effective currently, and lose their effectiveness over time, so are not ideal. But, the development is still progressing in the hopes of finding a better, more effective long lasting vaccine. An alternative to vaccines is vectored <b>immunoprophylaxis</b> (VIP) that is a form a gene therapy.

Patient level data on adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) <b>immunoprophylaxis</b> recommendations are limited. This study characterizes adherence to AAP guidelines in privately insured and Medicaid populations. Methods. We performed a retrospective birth cohort study of 211 174 privately insured children in Northern California; and 458 837 publicly insured children in Tennessee born between January 1, 1996 and December 31, 2008.

40|$|Since age at {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{infection is}} a major risk factor associated with the chronicity of HBV, it is of great importance to evaluate the effect of <b>immunoprophylaxis</b> {{as early as possible}} in the mother-to-child transmission.

Serum HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in all the infants were determined at 7 months of age. Of the 621 infants, 2. 9 % were <b>immunoprophylaxis</b> failure (positive for HBsAg), 1. 4 % were non-responders (anti-HBs undetectable), 95. 7 % were responders.

Resistance-conferring mutations within the palivizumab binding site occurred in 8. 7 % of palivizumab recipients and none of the nonrecipients. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the most common cause of}} acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and a major cause of hospital admission and death among children < 5 years of age worldwide (1).
