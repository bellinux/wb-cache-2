25|$|The VEF Riga has a three-element <b>flat</b> <b>film</b> plane lens. Performance {{could be}} improved, so the {{short-lived}} Minox II (1948-1951) {{had a new}} 5 element lens (called complan) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the pressure plate pushed the film onto the lens. Customers complained of film scratches with this new design, so most of these lenses were replaced by MINOX with the later curved-field compensating lens. Consequently, original 'film lens' Minox II are exceptional.|$|E
25|$|Electro-wetting display (EWD) {{is based}} on {{controlling}} {{the shape of a}} confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a <b>flat</b> <b>film</b> between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.|$|E

500|$|Burgess shale type {{preservation}} {{is defined}} as the fossilization of non-biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales. When the animals started to decompose, their tissues collapsed {{under the weight of the}} sediment that buried them. The typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws, which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized. Soft elements, such as muscles and gut contents, were sometimes squeezed out of the decomposing organism to produce dark stains on the fossils. Organisms that lack tougher structures, such as flatworms, nemerteans and shell-less molluscs, were not preserved by this process. Very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes. For instance during decomposition, bacteria modify the chemically unusual mid-gut glands of some organisms into the durable mineral phosphate. This change happens extremely quickly, before the corpse is compressed, and leaves a three-dimensional mold of the tissues. Gills can also be preserved in something close to their original three-dimensional shape by this process. Both preservation mechanisms can appear in the same fossil. In Burgess-like shales, organisms and parts that are only quite soft, such as muscles, are generally lost, while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved. The preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists, by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb (preserved as <b>flat</b> <b>film)</b> or very soft and chemically active, like a part of the gut (preserved as a solid piece of mineral). These differences may also help to identify fossils, by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match the combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed.|$|E

40|$|Controlled {{differentiation}} of {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESC) is necessary to their use as a cell source for tissue engineering or regeneration. To date, most studies have concentrated on chemical cues to direct ESC differentiation. However, during normal embryonic development, multiple factors beyond chemical cues play a role, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) in bone development. In this study, we use nanofibrous (NF) matrices to mimic the morphology of the ECM to examine {{the contribution of the}} ECM morphology to the {{differentiation of}} mouse ESC. After 12 h of differentiation culture, mouse ESC form protrusions interacting with NF matrices, while they appear not to interact with <b>flat</b> <b>films.</b> Immunofluorescence staining after 26 days of differentiation culture indicates a greater degree of differentiation for mouse ESC on NF matrices compared to <b>flat</b> <b>films.</b> Polymerase chain reaction results, also, show greater degree of osteogenic differentiation on NF matrices compared to <b>flat</b> <b>films</b> when osteogenic supplements are added to the culture. Overall, these results demonstrate that NF morphology contributes to the controlled differentiation of mouse ESC...|$|R

Since chemical modifications of materials' surfaces have poor long-term performance in preventing bacterial buildup, approaches using bactericidal physical surface topography have been investigated. The authors used Nanoimprint Lithography was used to fabricate a library of biomimetic nanopillars on the surfaces of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films. After incubation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on the structured PMMA surfaces, pillared surfaces {{were found to have}} lower densities of adherent cells compared to <b>flat</b> <b>films</b> (67 %- 91 % of densities on <b>flat</b> <b>films).</b> Moreover, of the E. coli that did adhere a greater fraction of them were dead on pillared surfaces (16 %- 141 % higher dead fraction than on <b>flat</b> <b>films).</b> Smaller more closely spaced nanopillars had better performance. The smallest most closely spaced nanopillars were found to reduce the bacterial load in contaminated aqueous suspensions by 50 % over a 24 -h period compared to flat controls. Through quantitative analysis of cell orientation data, it was determined that the minimum threshold for optimal nanopillar spacing is between 130 and 380 nm. Measurements of bacterial cell length indicate that nanopillars adversely affect E. coli morphology, eliciting a filamentous response. Taken together, this work shows that imprinted polymer nanostructures with precisely defined geometries can kill bacteria without any chemical modifications. These results effectively translate bactericidal nanopillar topographies to PMMA, an important polymer used for medical device...|$|R

50|$|Film {{embossing}} is {{a mechanical}} {{process in which}} a <b>flat</b> <b>film</b> is transformed into an embossed product. During the process, thermal and stress fields are applied to the polymer, causing changes in the microstructure and physical dimensions of the material. The engineering analysis of the process requires the study of various aspects relating to the characterization of the microstructure before and after embossing, A variety of techniques were employed to characterize the properties and microstructure of the embossed film in relation to crystallinity, orientation, mechanical properties, and dimensions of the embossed films. The thermal treatment of the polymer film was shown {{to be the most}} significant factor in the process. By controlling the thermal treatment of the film, it is possible to manipulate the properties and dimensions of the embossed film. The important aspects: influencing thermal treatment include the radiation heater temperature, preheat roll temperature, line velocity, and film thickness. The initial film orientation and embossing pressure have a minor effect on the final properties of the embossed film. The main effect of the embossing pressure is on the bulk thickness of the embossed film.|$|E
50|$|The early {{photographic}} experiments of Thomas Wedgwood, Nicéphore Niépce, Henry Fox Talbot, and Louis Daguerre {{all used}} simple single-element convex lenses. These lenses were found lacking. Simple lenses could not focus an image {{over a large}} <b>flat</b> <b>film</b> plane (Field curvature) and suffered from other optical aberrations. Their severe longitudinal chromatic aberration meant the light the photographers were seeing (generally yellow light) and the light to which the early photographic mediums were sensitive not converge to the same point, {{making it difficult to}} focus.Charles Chevalier's Paris optical firm produced lenses for both Niépce and Daguerre for their experiments in photography. In 1829, Chevalier created an achromatic lens (a two-element lens made from crown glass and flint glass) to cut down on chromatic aberration for Daguerre's experiments. Chevalier reversed the lens (originally designed as a telescope objective) to produce a much flatter image plane and modified the achromat to bring the blue end of the spectrum to a sharper focus. Reversing the lens caused severe spherical aberration so a narrow aperture stop was necessary in front of the lens. On 22 June 1839, Daguerre contracted Alphonse Giroux (France) to manufacture his daguerreotype apparatus. The Giroux Le Daguerreotype camera used an almost 16-inch (40 cm) focal length reversed achromatic lens with a f/16 stop in front of it made by Chevalier to take 6½×8½ inch (about 16.5×21.5 cm) images.|$|E
