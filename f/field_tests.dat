The Chief of Naval Operations authorized {{the use of}} the obsolete destroyer , but placed so many restrictions on its use, Newport was forced to decline the offer. As a result, neither the Mark 6 exploder nor the Mark 14 torpedo ever underwent a live test, and their shortcomings would not become apparent until the outbreak of hostilities. It would be twenty months before the problems were corrected, over Christie's objections.|$|E

He told {{investigators}} he and Maura went car-shopping that afternoon and later went {{to dinner with}} a friend of Murray's. Murray dropped her father off at his motel room and, borrowing his Toyota Corolla, she returned to campus to attend a dorm party. She arrived at 10:30 pm. At 2:30 am on Sunday, February 8, she left the party. At 3:30 am, en route to her father's motel, she struck a guardrail on Route 9 in Hadley causing nearly $10,000 worth of damage to her father's car. The responding officer wrote an accident report but there is no documentation of sobriety <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> being conducted. She was driven to her father's motel and stayed in his room the rest of the morning. At 4:49 am, there was a cell phone call placed to Murray's boyfriend from Fred's phone.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Field</b> <b>testing</b> of {{software}} {{is necessary to}} find potential user problems before market deployment. The large number of users involved in <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> along with the variety of problems reported by them increases the complexity of managing the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> process. However, most <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> processes are monitored using ad-hoc techniques and simple metrics (e. g., the number of reported problems). Deeper analysis and tracking of <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results is needed. This paper introduces visualization techniques which provide a global view of the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results. The techniques focus on the relation between users and their reported problems. The visualizations help identify general patterns to locate the problems. For example, the technique identifies groups of users with similar problem profiles. Such knowledge helps {{reduce the number of}} needed users since we can pick representative users. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> results for four releases of a large scale enterprise application used by millions of users worldwide...|$|R

The {{purposes of this study}} are: (1) to describe and analyze sound field stimuli, sound <b>field</b> <b>test</b> conditions, and sound field calibration procedures currently employed by audiologists nationwide, and (2) to investigate the extent of agreement between current practice and suggested practice from the current literature. Respondents to the survey were 418 ASHA certified audiologists, who answered questions on demographic variables, sound <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> conditions, and sound field calibration procedures. Eighty-one percent of the respondents use sound field audiometry as part of their audiological practice. Demographic characteristics of the respondents indicate that they were representative of the population of ASHA certified audiologists. Most respondents use two loudspeakers for sound <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> and use warbled pure tones for the stimuli. Forty-two different models of audiometers are in use, although three models account for over one-half of the responses. Electroacoustic calibration of the sound field stimuli is done most often by an equipment technician, and {{only a small percentage of}} the respondents knew how the calibration was done. No pattern of significant interactions was found among the calibration methods, sound <b>field</b> <b>test</b> conditions, and demographic variables of the subjects. Results show a lack of standardization among sound <b>field</b> <b>test</b> rooms, great diversity in the stimuli used for sound <b>field</b> <b>testing,</b> and inconsistent calibration methods.

500|$|The show's {{extensive}} use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool. <b>Field</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing. In 1999, Anderson {{and a team of}} researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored. They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children paid more attention to unfamiliar material, and because it was more cognitively demanding to understand and solve the problems presented. After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions. Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them. Repetition, which the researchers called [...] "an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension," [...] improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation. Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were [...] "positively enthusiastic" [...] about it. Nielsen ratings of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time. Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings and called it a success.|$|E
