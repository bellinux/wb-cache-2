30|$|Nevertheless, smaller {{particle}} size {{shown in the}} HRTEM and FWHM is concerned with Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DVLO) theory [12]. In DLVO theory, the potential energy of van der Waals attraction and the potential energy of the electrical double layer interaction [13] are summed to provide a total interaction potential energy between colloidal particles. Due to differences in the surface chemistries of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> and ITO-NPs, obtaining a stable dispersion of polymeric <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> and ITO-NPs can be challenging. The importance of the colloidal stability of starting dispersions on the final properties of ink pastes has been demonstrated. Zhao et al. [14] found {{that the presence of}} aggregated titanium dioxide particles in dispersions deleteriously affects the optical and mechanical properties. Researchers have found that the colloidal stability of dispersions can be disrupted by changes in surface potential of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> [15], ionic strength [15], concentration of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> [13] and {{particle size}} [13]. One way to address the questions about clustering and stability in ink paste is through predictions using DLVO theory [15]. Under drying above the latex glass transition temperature, particles consolidated and compacted, forcing the ITO-NPs to segregate into the boundary regions between <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent,</b> PVP.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryCharles StarkExperiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate particle size methodology and flow-ability of fractionated corn. The first experiment compared five variations of the current approved method to determine geometric mean diameter (d[subscript]gw) and geometric standard deviation (S[subscript]gw) described by ANSI/ASAE S 319. 4 “Method of determining and expressing fineness of feed materials by sieving”. This method controls many variables, including the suggested sample size and the type, number, and size of sieves. However, the method allows for variations in sieving time, sieve agitator inclusion, {{and the use of}} <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent.</b> The variations were tested with three grains (corn, wheat, and sorghum). There was no method × grain (P> 0. 05) interaction for d[subscript]gw, so it was removed. Ten minute sieving time with sieve agitators and <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> resulted in the lowest d[subscript]gw and greatest S[subscript]gw (P< 0. 05). The second experiment evaluated particle size analysis on ground corn using a 3 -sieve method with varying sieving time (30, 60, and 90 s) with the addition of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent.</b> The sieving time for the 3 -sieve method referred to the time sieves were hand shaken side to side. Ninety seconds sieving time with <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> (0. 25 g) resulted in the lowest d[subscript]gw (P< 0. 05). The 3 -sieve method was not developed to calculate the S[subscript]gw, so means and main effects were not determined. Experiment three evaluated particle size and flow-ability by grinding corn at two moisture (10 and 12 %) with three screenings levels (0, 2. 5, and 5 %). Results suggested cleaning corn prior to grinding with a roller mill does not change particle size or flow-ability. Experiment four continued the evaluation of flow-ability with corn ground to three target particle sizes (400, 500, and 600 µm) and fractionated into fine, medium, and coarse segments. Target particle size impacted d[subscript]gw, S[subscript]gw, and bulk density (P< 0. 05), prior to fractionation. Based on the results of this experiment, flow-ability can be improved if fine particles (< 282 µm) are removed. Results of these experiments indicated that particle size analysis should use sieve agitators, <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent,</b> and 10 or 15 min sieving time for the standard 13 -sieve method and 90 s sieving time with <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> for the 3 -sieve method...|$|R
