60|$|L. XIV. Continual sneer, continual irony, all excellent, if it {{were not}} for the 'all;'--but a countenance, with a {{malignant}} smile in statuary <b>fixure</b> on it, becomes at length an object of aversion, however beautiful the face, and however beautiful the smile. We are relieved, in some measure, from this by frequent just and well expressed moral aphorisms; but then the preceding and following irony gives them the appearance of proceeding from the head, not from the heart. This objection would be less felt, when the Letters were first published at considerable intervals; but Junius wrote for posterity.|$|E
60|$|The {{ideal of}} earnest poetry {{consists}} {{in the union}} and harmonious melting down, and fusion of the sensual into the spiritual,--of man as an animal into man as a power of reason and self-government. And this we have represented to us most clearly in the plastic art, or statuary; where the perfection of outward form {{is a symbol of}} the perfection of an inward idea; where the body is wholly penetrated by the soul, and spiritualized even to a state of glory, and like a transparent substance, the matter, in its own nature darkness, becomes altogether a vehicle and <b>fixure</b> of light, a mean of developing its beauties, and unfolding its wealth of various colors without disturbing its unity, or causing a division of the parts. The sportive ideal, on the contrary, consists in the perfect harmony and concord of the higher nature with the animal, as with its ruling principle and its acknowledged regent. The understanding and practical reason are represented as the willing slaves of the senses and appetites, and of the passions arising out of them. Hence we may admit the appropriateness to the old comedy, as a work of defined art, of allusions and descriptions, which morality can never justify, and, only with reference to the author himself, and only as being the effect or rather the cause of the circumstances in which he wrote, can consent even to palliate.|$|E
40|$|Thoracic aortic {{emergencies}} (TAE) - <b>fixured</b> thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), acute type b dissection - {{are associated}} with high risk of mortality and morbility. Endovasular surgery (ES) of TAE has been considered as an alternative procedure. From March 2001 to July 2003, 26 patients with TAE were admitted to our department and submitted to ES: 8 pts (30. 7 %) for <b>fixured</b> TAA, 18 pts (69. 3 %) for acute type b dissection evolving to rupture. AngioCT scan was diagnostic in all pts. A stented-graft was placed by femoral arteriotomy. TAA and type B pts were submitted to a multiple stent-graft procedure to cover the entire descending thoracic aorta (2. 2 ± 1. 2 grafts/pt). There were no perioperative deaths and open surgical conversions. The intraoperative angiography and Ctscan at the discharge showed no significant endoleaks and good seating of the aortic dissection. Average ICU and hospital stay was 1. 7 ± 0. 8 and 5. 9 ± 3. 0 days. Follow up ranged between 4 and 23 months, included clinical examination and serial CT scan at 3, 6 and 12 months, and every 6 months successively. An 84 years old TAA pt died of septic shock from pneumonia 78 days after endovascular surgery. Endovascular surgery is a safe technique for treating TAE with encouraging early and mid-term results. This therapeutic approach seem to be particulary efficacious in high risk subsets, as those represented by elderly patients...|$|R
