500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
2500|$|Bolland {{notes that}} while he tends not to reuse cover ideas, he does {{occasionally}} produce [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> as homages to my own covers." [...] Particularly, for [...] "the first issue of the Eagle Judge Dredd comic" [...] – which repackaged 2000 AD stories for the American market – on which the positioning of the figures echoed similar covers Bolland had drawn [...] "two or three times for different companies with different characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} said ... about birth control. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the {{positive}} side of the equation, of the meaning and sanctity of life, of the purpose of this estate in our eternal journey, of the need for the experiences of mortal life under the great plan of God our Father, of the joy that is to be found only where there are children in the home, of the blessings that come of good posterity. When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord.|$|E
60|$|All {{through the}} happy time that has followed, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that through all our trials and {{difficulties}} affliction brought us safely together at last.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't say that; for {{you have}} come--let me {{think the reason}} of your coming what <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it. It can do you no harm. Come once more!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am," [...] she said. [...] "Mother {{says there}} is no such thing as a mermaid, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> there is. Have you ever seen one?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{one thing}} these two {{different}} women share is their name: Holly Solomon. Solomon the art dealer {{was one of}} Nelson’s major influences, helping him find his style, which often features shapes, patterns, and words. His 2013 exhibition title “Polka Dots for Holly Solomon," [...] is fitting. Based heavily on pattern and decoration, Nelson uses the polka dot as both object and non-object, while incorporating “affirmations” as text jargon and a nod to society’s obsession with the pursuit of happiness. Taking its cue from its name, Polka Dots For Holly Solomon is a large-scale installation of polka dot patterns and subliminal messages presented across an array of two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces. Nelson says that the intention behind his new work is to “mean something and mean nothing at all. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as ‘non-conceptualism’.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, {{and when he saw}} Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is said to}} be Madam's wedding ring. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so, and am {{very proud}} to be named for her, because she was a good woman as well as a"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell another story, Mother, {{one with}} a moral <b>to</b> it, <b>like</b> this. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy," [...] said Jo, after a minute's silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not young, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am," [...] he answered. [...] "I'm afraid there's pretty {{nearly a}} generation between us, Miss Clara. By the bye, where's your uncle this morning?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Prior to {{deciding}} {{to become a}} full time storyteller, Irwin worked as a stand-up comedian [...] "for a few minutes". [...] During this time, Irwin won the Farber Invitational stand-up competition at the Punchline comedy club in Atlanta. [...] However, Irwin came {{to see that the}} days of storytelling comedians had passed. Irwin also realized that his style of performance was at odds with the main venue available to comedians today: comedy clubs. (Irwin joking refers to comedy clubs as [...] "evil, smelly places".) [...] Some of his stories are an hour in length, and Irwin notes, [...] "here was a time when comedians could do that but they can't anymore because the clubs give them three minutes, and they are timing the laughs per minute." [...] Using storytelling as a theatrical form allows Irwin to create more fully drawn characters and to explore darker subject matters as well. [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my storytelling as funny, I can have these serious moments. I’m not depending on the audience to laugh the whole time... I hope there’s content with the form." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that," [...] she said, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> people {{doing the things}} they tell about. But I suppose we can't have that every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{ran across}} it at a sale in Boston. The old settler must have owned one like that. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him, away off {{here in the}} {{wilderness}} in those early days." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wyllard seized this opportunity. [...] "He is a {{great friend}} of mine, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it means the same thing. In fact, it's {{reasonably}} certain that he saved my life for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> how {{thoroughly}} <b>I</b> {{was taken}} with her, and how right I was, and how fortunate, {{to have that}} for my basis. I told her all the good I thought of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were children. She {{was good}} and sweet and kind. I know nothing of him, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that then at all events he was ingenuous and frank. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that his soul was as comely as his body. But I daresay he had no more soul than the creatures {{of the woods and}} forests who made pipes from reeds and bathed in the {{mountain}} streams when the world was young, and you might catch sight of little fawns galloping through the glade {{on the back of a}} bearded centaur. A soul is a troublesome possession and when man developed it he lost the Garden of Eden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he added, [...] "these {{are only}} {{theories}} of mine. I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man. Levitation {{may not be}} possible, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him so, {{with brown}} books before him {{lit by the}} light of candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter of [...] "The Prince," [...] with a grey quill in his clean fine hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but sometimes, if only I {{could manage}} it, I think that I {{should like to}} get away from here, and take another line, {{something}} bigger. I do not suppose that I ever shall, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} {{you had no}} friends," [...] she said. [...] "I {{am pleased}} that there's nobody to find fault with {{you for what you}} have done. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> am in no one's way." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{see these}} {{magnificent}} dandies yawning out of [...] "White's," [...] or caracoling in the Park on shining chargers, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Brummell {{was the greatest}} of them all, and that Brummell's father was a footman.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Palencia is a pleasant, {{environmentally}} friendly city, {{with plenty of}} pedestrian and green areas. Actually, it is the Spanish city with the largest extent of parks and green zones {{in relation to the}} total area.|$|R
60|$|TIMOTHY. Yes, sir, it's when <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him best. There's a great {{comfort in}} childher, {{and when they}} grow up we lose them anyway. But it's fair beset I'll be now, with nothing to do but think of him.|$|E
6000|$|Carol {{found herself}} going about rejoicing, [...] "How neighborly the town is!" [...] She drew {{up with a}} dismayed [...] "Am I {{falling in love with}} this boy? That's ridiculous! I'm merely {{interested}} in him. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> helping him to succeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stop, stop; don't {{drink it}} yet,' he said, laying {{his hand on}} Newman's; 'it was given to me, twenty years ago, and when I take a little taste, which is ve--ry seldom, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it beforehand, and tease myself. We'll drink a toast. Shall we drink a toast, Mr Noggs?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so {{glad when}} you brought the little dress; and since I had to lose little Joyce <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the dress she wore {{was the one}} you made for her when you let {{yourself}} love me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Describing his {{approach}} to training, Cecil told The Daily Telegraph: [...] "I do everything by instinct really, not by the book. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I’ve got a feeling for and understand my horses, that they {{tell me what to}} do really." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We was on {{that island}} for longer than <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wotton, who had a wholesome dread of dates. [...] "But we was rescued at last, and ever {{since then he has}} been hunting high and low for his wife." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{there is}} really {{something}} in the mackintosh of the military qualities of the Highlander. The proper cheap mackintosh has a blue and white sheen as of steel or iron; it gleams like armour. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as the uniform of that ancient clan in some of its old and misty raids. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all the Macintoshes, in their mackintoshes, descending on some doomed Lowland village, their wet waterproofs flashing in the sun or moon. For indeed {{this is one of}} the real beauties of rainy weather, that while the amount of original and direct light is commonly lessened, the number of things that reflect light is unquestionably increased. There is less sunshine; but there are more shiny things; such beautifully shiny things as pools and puddles and mackintoshes. It is like moving in a world of mirrors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mappin {{has more}} sense. He stays in his office, {{which is how}} money is made. You don't, as a rule, get much for {{doing this kind of}} thing. Still, he has to take some chances, and one he didn't size up right is going back on him. When I'm feeling tired and hungry <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> my meeting with that man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went to a}} orsepittle in London," [...] said Mr. Lister. [...] "I’ve been to two {{or three}} altogether, while the money I’ve spent on doctors is more than <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and they’re all {{surprised}} to think that I’ve lived so long. I’m so chock-full o’ complaints, that they tell me I can’t live more than two years, and I might go off at any moment." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the preface, Ballard himself wrote: [...] "Vermilion Sands {{has more}} than its full share of dreams and illusions, fears and fantasies, but the frame for them is less confining. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> too, that it celebrates the {{neglected}} virtues of the glossy, lurid and bizarre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} me very happy," [...] said the storekeeper, tremulously. [...] "I--I {{have no right to}} be proud--I have taken his money--he has {{supported}} my daughter and myself all these years. But he had never asked me to--to do anything, and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that he never would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am more {{interested}} in your anonymous friend," [...] she said quaintly, [...] "than in Sir Percy Blakeney. But he too is kindness itself and Lady Blakeney is an angel. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the happiest days of my life--our honeymoon, my dear lord--will be spent in their house." ...|$|R
