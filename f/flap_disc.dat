40|$|The essay {{concerns}} issues {{connected with}} modelling of flow in a non-return flap and determination of force {{effects on the}} <b>flap</b> <b>disc.</b> The task was researched in collaboration with ARMATURY Group, a. s. The flow is non-compressible and the flow medium is water. Boundary conditions determined by a measurement were applied in the modelling. The target of the project is finding a suitable mathematical model and comparison of the measured and calculated values dissipation factor of the non-return flap for various opening angles of the <b>flap</b> <b>disc...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Chipmunk makes heavy use of metal, {{the majority of the}} airframe being composed of a stress-skinned alloy; this allowed the adoption of thinner wings and consequently provided for increased performance as well as a greater degree of durability. Numerous features were incorporated in order for the type to better perform in its trainer role, including hand-operated single-slotted wing <b>flaps,</b> anti-spin strakes, <b>disc</b> brakes on the wheeled undercarriage, a thin propeller composed of a solid lightweight alloy, the adoption of an engine-driven vacuum pump in place of external venture tubes to power cockpit instrumentation, electric and Coffman cartridge engine starters as alternative options, cockpit lighting, onboard radio system, and an external identification light underneath the starboard wing.|$|R
