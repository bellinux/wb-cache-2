40|$|A couple buys a couch. After delivery, {{they notice}} that {{the legs of the}} couch are not rectangular, like they ordered, but circular. After some angry calls and letters they {{introduce}} an action before the court to terminate the contract in order to get their money back. Against all expectations, the Belgian court of appeal of Ghent decides completely against the couple. According to the court, the couple disregarded the consumer sales rules in the Civil Code, implementing the <b>EU</b> Consumer <b>Sales</b> Directive. They did not respect the strict hierarchy of remedies which favors repair or replacement over termination and price reduction: the buyers should have sued for repair or replacement instead of trying to terminate the contract. Moreover, they transgressed the notification rules: they should have notified the seller about the shortcoming, before invoking a remedy. This case and many others, show that confusion reigns {{in the area of the}} organization of consumer sales remedies. The strict hierarchy of remedies imposed by the <b>EU</b> Consumer <b>Sales</b> Directive might be insufficiently protective for consumers. Moreover, after withdrawing the CESL -proposal, the EU Commission issued new projects, treating, among others, the contractual remedies in the e-commerce sector. Also in the US there is an on-going debate about the organization of remedies in contract law and the UCC. Over the last decades, many publications appeared about the irreparable injury-rule and adequacy-rule favoring damages over specific performance. It has drawn the attention of law & economics specialists, legal philosophers, and more recently the behaviorists have expressed their interest in the topic. At the same moment, academics are working on a restatement of US consumer contract law. The organization of remedies is a vivid topic, both in the US and EU. Nevertheless, a thorough cross-examination of the <b>EU</b> consumer <b>sales</b> law system (mainly based on the civil law tradition) and the US common law system is not sufficiently present in the current debate. Therefore, this paper will address this on the basis of in-depth comparative research. The paper firstly assesses the so-called 'hierarchy' of remedies that is prescribed by law. Another aspect that has an important impact on the aforementioned hierarchy of remedies are the different notification duties and their limitation periods. The last element that will be assessed and which greatly influences the hierarchy of remedies is the ability (or not) to invoke remedies extrajudicially. The main question is: what is the best possible organization of remedies to move forward to protect consumers? Answer to this question will be based on the principles of coherence of the legal system, legal certainty and the level of consumer protection. status: publishe...|$|R
