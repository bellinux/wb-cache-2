25|$|Most mammals such as calves, sheep, goats, foals, pigs, cats, cavies, rats, {{mice and}} humans can be infested by the Australian Paralysis Tick. Fatalities {{resulting}} from a single engorged adult female tick are mostly reported in the young animals of the larger species and all ages and sizes of the pet species (dogs and cats). Larvae and nymphs can also produce toxic reactions in the host. Fifty larvae or five nymphs can kill a 40g rat, larger numbers of either can induce paralysis in dogs and cats. They can be quite easy to find on short-haired animals, but very difficult to find on long-haired animals like Persian cats. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tick-prone area, and your pets are allowed outdoors, {{it is suggested that}} you physically check your pets daily for ticks. Unfortunately they are often not discovered until the tick is large enough to be felt. By this time the tick has subjected the animal to a large amount of toxins. One adult female can kill four susceptible rats during engorgement. Although it is not typical, an engorging adult female apparently can re-attach several times to different dogs.|$|E

In general, all banks are beautiful things, and will reward work better than large landscapes. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lowland country, you must look for places where the ground is broken to the river's edges, with decayed posts, or roots of trees; or, if by great good luck there should be such things within your reach, for remnants of stone quays or steps, mossy mill-dams, etc. Nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful bits of broken bank at its sides; better in form and color than high chalk cliffs. In woods, one or two trunks, with the flowery ground below, are at once the richest and easiest kind of study: a not very thick trunk, say nine inches or a foot in diameter, with ivy running up it sparingly, is an easy, and always a rewarding subject.|$|E

What this all means for the dog is that it becomes cold very easily. Also, they will very likely need to have some extra covering inside during the winter <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particularly cold area. These dogs need warm clothing when out in cold weather. Precautions must be taken when exercising during hot or humid weather, as they are prone to heat stroke.

5000|$|The World's End {{began as}} a {{screenplay}} titled Crawl {{about a group of}} teenagers on a pub crawl; it was written by Edgar Wright at the age of 21. He realised the idea could work with adult characters to capture [...] "the bittersweet feeling of returning to your home town and feeling like a stranger". Wright said he wanted to satirise the [...] "strange homogeneous branding that becomes like a virus", explaining: [...] "This doesn't just extend to pubs, it's the same with cafés and restaurants. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small town and you move to London, which I did when I was 20, then when you go back out into the other small towns in England you go 'oh my god, it's all the same!'

Especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city, it just becomes this commonplace thing, nobody thinks twice about it anymore. Even though there's so much awful stuff going on in the world, and horrible things that happen to people, it's kind of like 'out of sight, out of mind.' It's just kind of a sad thing. So it's kind of a commentary on that. It also works on a couple levels. It can be taken as the Greek mythology example with the Sirens that lure sailors in with their singing, so being on the receiving end of those sirens isn't a great thing. It works both ways." ...|$|E

5000|$|Temperature affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> centrally heated house, while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E

"Custom and use change, and any {{comparison}} limps or is {{only half}} truth; but eternity’s custom, which never becomes obsolete, {{is that you are}} a single individual, that even in the intimate relationship of marriage you should have been aware of this. ….

If you do not live in an out-of-the-way spot in the world, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavily populated city and you then turn your attention outward, sympathetically give heed to people and events, do you bear in mind, every time you relate yourself in this way to the outside world, that in this relation you are relating yourself to yourself as a single individual with eternal responsibility? Or do you filter yourself into the crowd, where the one blames another, where one moment there are, as they say, a great many, and where at the next moment, every time responsibility is mentioned, there is no one? Do you judge as the crowd judges, in the capacity of the crowd? You are not obligated to have an opinion about something that you do not understand. No, on the contrary, you are eternally exempted, but as an individual you are eternally obligated to make an accounting of your opinion, of your judgment. And in eternity you will not be pryingly and busily asked, as by a journalist, whether there were a great many who had the same - wrong opinion, but only whether you had it; whether you have pamperingly accustomed your soul to judge light-mindedly and unthinkingly along with the others because the crowd judged unthinkingly; whether you perhaps have corrupted the better part in you by boasting along with the crowd that you were many and that you were justified because you were many, that is, you were many who were wrong.
