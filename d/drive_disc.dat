40|$|Models of discs around low-mass stars which couple photoevaporative mass-loss with viscous {{evolution}} {{have recently}} become important, {{as they are}} able to reproduce a number of observed disc properties successfully. However these models are subject to few observational constraints, and a number of issues remain unresolved and/or unexplored. In particular, the origin of the ionizing radiation required to drive the photoevaporation is not well-understood. In this contribution we review existing photoionization models, before going on to discuss recent and current work. Theoretical models of the accretion shock are considered, and we suggest a new observational diagnostic to quantify the chromospheric ionizing ux. We also consider the eects of X-ray photoionization in these models. We conclude that accretion powered UV and coronal X-rays are unlikely to in uence disc evolution signicantly. However the chromospheric Lyman continuum appears to be sucient to <b>drive</b> <b>disc</b> photoevaporation, and so these models may indeed provide a realistic mechanism for dispersing circumstellar discs...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} how discs around young stars, such as T Tauri stars (TTs), evolve, I concentrate on models which combine photoevaporation by ionizing radiation with viscous {{evolution of the}} disc, as previous work suggests that such models can reproduce the rapid disc dispersal seen in observations of TTs. However these models require that TTs produce a rather large ionizing flux (of order 10 41 ionizing photons per second), {{and it is clear}} if TTs can produce such a large flux. It first consider the ionizing flux resulting from the accretion of disc material on to the stellar surface; and if does not {{have a significant effect on}} the disc evolution. My next chapter considers whether or not TT chromospheres can provide sufficiently large ionizing fluxes and I conclude that TT chromospheres can provide ionizing fluxes sufficient to <b>drive</b> <b>disc</b> photoevaporation. I then consider the effect of X-rays on disc evolution. I use radiative transfer modelling, combined with a simple hydrostatic disc model, to study the effects of X-rays on the disc. The X-rays heat the disc, producing a warm (~ 5000 K) layer above the cold disc midplane. However, this attenuates the X-rays significantly, and I find that most of the X-rays are absorbed close to the star. Consequently the disc wind that can be driven by X-ray absorption at large radii has a rather low mass-loss rate, and will not influence disc evolution significantly. Having thus shown that TTs produce ionizing fluxes which have a significant effect on disc evolution, I apply this result to models of disc evolution. It first set up a simple disc model and show that a basic photoevaporation model breaks down at late times in the evolution (as the geometry of the radiative transfer problem changes). I construct hydrodynamic models of the wind produced by direct ionization of the outer part of TT discs, and show that this wind dominates the evolution at late times. I then incorporate this wind into the disc evolution model, and show that my model is consistent with current observational data. To date this is the only model which has successfully reproduced the rapid disc dispersal seen in observations of TTs, and this has important consequences for theories of disc evolution and planet formation.

40|$|We {{consider}} continuum free-free {{radio emission}} {{from the upper}} atmosphere of protoplanetary discs as a probe of the ionized luminosity impinging upon the disc. Making use of previously computed hydrodynamic models of disc photoevaporation {{within the framework of}} EUV and X-ray irradiation, we use radiative transfer post-processing techniques to predict the expected free-free emission from protoplanetary discs. In general, the free-free luminosity scales roughly linearly with ionizing luminosity in both EUV and X-ray driven scenarios, where the emission dominates over the dust tail of the disc and is partial optically thin at cm wavelengths. We perform a test observation of GM Aur at 14 - 18 Ghz and detect an excess of radio emission above the dust tail to a very high level of confidence. The observed flux density and spectral index are consistent with free-free emission from the ionized disc in either the EUV or X-ray driven scenario. Finally, we suggest a possible route to testing the EUV and X-ray driven dispersal model of protoplanetary discs, by combining observed free-free flux densities with measurements of mass-accretion rates. On the point of disc dispersal one would expect to find a M_dot^ 2 scaling with free-free flux in the case of EUV <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> dispersal or a M_dot scaling in the case of X-ray <b>driven</b> <b>disc</b> dispersal.
