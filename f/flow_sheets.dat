Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash <b>flow</b> <b>sheets</b> constitute as much as 40percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} conversion in a methanol reactor is restricted by equilibrium, therefore the synthesis loop is operated at high pressure and unconverted gas is recycled. Such a synthesis loop consumes {{large amounts of}} compression work. In this paper a new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> for methanol synthesis is presented. In this <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> the high recycle and operating pressure of the reactor is exploited to produce power. A turbine expander and compressor pair {{is placed in the}} recycle stream and utilises the reactor heat at the maximum possible temperature in a process gas power cycle. In conventional systems the reaction heat is often transferred to generate steam to drive steam turbines, but the heat is reduced in quality due to the temperature-driving forces in the heat exchange equipment. Simulation models of the new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> and a conventional <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> are created to compare the systems based on energy consumed per kg methanol produced. In the conventional <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> the reaction heat is used to generate steam for use in steam turbines. In the new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> a portion of the reaction heat is still transferred to a steam cycle to limit the temperature in the reactor. The remaining heat is used to drive the process gas cycle. The simulation results showed that the new <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> consumed overall 24 % less energy than the conventional <b>flow</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R
40|$|The U. S. nonproliferation policy 'to minimize, and to {{the extent}} possible, {{eliminate}} the use of HEU in civil nuclear programs throughout the world' has resulted in the conversion (or scheduled conversion) of many of the U. S. research reactors from high-enriched uranium (HEU) to low-enriched uranium (LEU). A foil fuel appears to offer the best option for using a LEU fuel in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) without degrading the performance of the reactor. The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed conceptual fabrication process <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> for a new, foil-type, 19. 75 %-enriched fuel for HFIR. The preparation of the <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> allows {{a better understanding of the}} costs of infrastructure modifications, operating costs, and implementation schedule issues associated with the fabrication of LEU fuel for HFIR. Preparation of a reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> is one of the first planning steps needed in the development of a new manufacturing capacity for low enriched fuels for U. S. research and test reactors. The <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> can be used to develop a work breakdown structure (WBS), a critical path schedule, and identify development needs. The reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> presented in this report is specifically for production of LEU foil fuel for the HFIR. The need for an overall reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> for production of fuel for all High Performance Research Reactors (HPRR) has been identified by the national program office. This report could provide a starting point for the development of such a reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> for a foil-based fuel for all HPRRs. The reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> presented is based on processes currently being developed by the national program for the LEU foil fuel when available, processes used historically in the manufacture of other nuclear fuels and materials, and processes used in other manufacturing industries producing a product configuration similar to the form required in manufacturing a foil fuel. The processes in the reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> are within the bounds of known technology and are adaptable to the high-volume production required to process {approx} 2. 5 to 4 tons of U/Mo and produce {approx} 16, 000 flat plates for U. S. reactors annually ({approx} 10, 000 of which are needed for HFIR operations). The reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> is not intended to necessarily represent the best or the most economical way to manufacture a LEU foil fuel for HFIR but simply represents a 'snapshot' in time of technology and is intended to identify the process steps that will likely be required to manufacture a foil fuel. Changes in some of the process steps selected for the reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> are inevitable; however, no one step or series of steps dominates the overall <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> requirements. A result of conceptualizing a reference <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> was the identification of the greater number of steps required for a foil process when compared to the dispersion fuel process. Additionally, in most of the foil processing steps, bare uranium must be handled, increasing the complexity of these processing areas relative to current operations. Based on a likely total cost of a few hundred million dollars for a new facility, it is apparent that line item funding will be necessary and could take as much as 8 to 10 years to complete. The infrastructure cost could exceed $ 100 M...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{post-combustion}} capture (PCC) {{technology is}} a promising possibility to reduce CO 2 emissions of fossil fuel fired power plants. One of the main concerns for the PCC is the loss in electric power output. A reduction in efficiency penalty for solvent based PCC {{can be achieved by}} improving the solvent properties as well as by improving the process design. There are many different process <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> modifications with an improvement in process design reported in literature. In this work two of these modifications for a capture plant are evaluated. To be able to compare these process modifications it is necessary to evaluate them on identical solvent and process conditions.

The solvent used in the capture plant is a generic improved solvent, representing possible future solvents. The main advantages of the <b>flow</b> <b>sheet</b> modifications are pointed out.
