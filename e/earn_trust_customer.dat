40|$|If {{companies}} aim to <b>earn</b> the <b>trust</b> of <b>customers</b> and {{the general}} public, they must first establish a culture of trust within their own organization. From an intra-organizational perspective, trust has many benefits, including reduced transaction costs. A thus far overlooked benefit {{may lie in the}} effects that trust has on the relationship between demographic diversity and intra-organizational outcomes. Due to demographic changes, globalization, and other forces, increasing diversity (e. g., with respect to gender, age, nationality, as well as cultural, educational, and functional background) is not only inevitable, but also constitutes a potential competitive advantage, as it broadens the range of task-relevant knowledge and perspectives. Trust is likely to be one factor that helps to unlock this potential, for example by enhancing the degree of intra-organizational knowledge sharing among dissimilar individuals, which in turn may foster innovation and performance. Thus, by establishing a culture of intra-organizational trust, companies are better equipped to meet {{some of the most important}} challenges they are about to face in the upcoming years. At the same time, by fostering intra-organizational trust they establish one of the preconditions for restoring trust in their company on the part of customers and other stakeholders...|$|R

50|$|As a {{means of}} {{building}} social employees, some social advocates have also called for a broader definition of customer to include the employees themselves. In the book The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence, authors Vala Afshar and Brad Martin made the following argument: A social business operates with the guiding principle that each employee’s responsibility is to serve one another, and that those we serve, even internally, are our customers. To <b>earn</b> internal <b>customer</b> <b>trust</b> and loyalty, each employee must be dependable, available, responsive, and committed {{to the success of}} the whole.In The Social Employee, authors Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess echo this sentiment:The social employee understands that every customer is an employee somewhere, and that every coworker is a customer in many other places as well. No one likes feeling ignored or otherwise disregarded by a brand. The rise of social media means that every employee with a Twitter profile is a de facto brand ambassador. Social employees are not only aware of this, they work to maximize its impact. By prizing authentic engagement and rich exchanges, the social employee is able to leverage virtual platforms toward real-world results.|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} call for managers in the Nigerian insurance industry to espouse higher level of ethical behaviour to <b>earn</b> the <b>trust</b> of <b>customers,</b> regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders. Arguably, this will enhance market penetration, increase patronage and higher level of profit. Theoretically however, ethical behaviour can be institutionalized in organizations if the top management support ethical behaviour through punishment and reward (high ethical climate). Other than corporate ethical values, managers’ beliefs about the rightness and wrongness of an action in a particular situation {{could also be a}} function of his/her personal moral philosophy. With respect to financial services, one aspect of marketing which have been empirically shown to have influence ethical judgement and behaviours of managers is sales quotas. When salespersons are assigned higher sales quotas, which are perceived as difficult, the tendency to engage in unethical behaviour to achieve this target becomes higher. In this study, we assess and extend the theoretical relationship between moral judgement of salespersons and perceived quota difficulty in the insurance industry. The study also explores the moderating effects of salesperson’s ethical values (idealism and relativism), corporate ethical climate, and quota failure consequences on the proposed relationship. With a structured questionnaire, data was collected from respondents in the target industry through a multi-stage sampling strategy. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the factorial structure of the measures used in the study, their reliability and validity. Using correlation and regression analysis, the results were presented and discussed with managerial implications for the Nigerian insurance industry...|$|R

40|$|While the {{importance}} of customer loyalty has been recognized in the marketing literature {{for at least three}} decades, the conceptualization and empirical validation of a customer loyalty model for e-service context has not been addressed. This paper describes a theoretical model for investigating the three main antecedent influences on loyalty (attitudinal commitment and behavioral loyalty) for e-service context: <b>trust,</b> <b>customer</b> satisfaction, and perceived value. Based on the theoretical model, a comprehensive set of hypotheses were formulated and a methodology for testing them was outlined. These hypotheses were tested empirically to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical model. The results indicate that <b>trust,</b> <b>customer</b> satisfaction, perceived value, and commitment are separate constructs that combine to determine the loyalty, with commitment exerting a stronger influence than <b>trust,</b> <b>customer</b> satisfaction, and perceived value. Customer satisfaction and perceived value were also indirectly related to loyalty through commitment. Finally, the authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these results...|$|R

Outsourcing is {{a growing}} {{industry}} that is used in both {{the private and public}} sectors, from banking to pharmaceuticals, insurance to energy, retail to software, and social security to entertainment. It is an industry that has drawn argument from both sides in economically developed and developing countries. Supporters believe it is necessary and good for global economic development for everyone, whereas opponents in developed economies point out the shipping of jobs from their countries. Some in developing economies consider it an extension of colonization despite the short-term economic benefits to their economies. In three essays, this research examines outsourcing in its historical context in India, its development across three industries over decades, and the management practices in outsourced organizations through strategies such as National Identity Management (NIM). Outsourcing came into existence along with the first major multinational company of the world, the East India Company. Essay one examines how outsourcing is embedded in the context of power imbalance, unequal status, and the legacy of colonization that affects outsourcing today in India. Essay one shows that the context in which firms operate is important and that it is shaped significantly by history. In essay two, the development of outsourcing is examined in three industries: advertising, the semiconductor industry, and business process outsourcing (BPO). Using comparative historical analysis and path dependence method, common and unique factors across each industry are identified. This allows a nuanced understanding of the outsourcing industry that has been missing from the scholarly literature. Essay three uses the existing knowledge of trust in e-commerce and inter-personal deception theory. It also examines the effects of the location of call centers, the context of interaction, the type of call center, and the practice of NIM on the trusting belief and <b>trusting</b> intentions of <b>customers</b> in a call center. It was found that the trusting beliefs and intentions are lower in international call centers, but even lower when firms practice NIM. It appears that a more honest, subtle, and customized approach towards customers can do better at <b>earning</b> their <b>trust</b> than engaging in practices like NIM to <b>earn</b> <b>customer</b> <b>trust...</b>|$|R
