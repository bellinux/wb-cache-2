5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before <b>her</b> <b>table,</b> money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E

60|$|There was a buzz of subdued {{sound from}} more than twelve hundred telegraphists, male and female, in that mighty telegraph-hall of Saint Martin's-le-Grand, but May heard it not. Dozens upon dozens of tables, each with its busy occupants--tables to right of <b>her,</b> <b>tables</b> to left of <b>her,</b> <b>tables</b> in rear of <b>her,</b> <b>tables</b> in front of her,--swept away from her in bewildering perspective, but May saw them not. The {{clicking}} of six or seven hundred instruments broke upon her ear as they flashed {{the news of the}} world over the length and breadth of the land, pulsating joy and sorrow, surprise, fear, hope, despair, and gladness to thousands of anxious hearts, but May regarded it not. She heard only the booming of the great sea, and saw her mother seated by the fire darning socks, with Madge engaged in household work, and Phil tumbling with baby-brother on the floor, making new holes and rents for fresh darns and patches.|$|R

25|$|Alma-Tadema was a perfectionist. He worked assiduously to {{make the}} most of his paintings, often {{repeatedly}} reworking parts of paintings before he found them satisfactory to his own high standards. One humorous story relates that one of his paintings was rejected and instead of keeping it, he gave the canvas to a maid who used it as <b>her</b> <b>table</b> cover. He was sensitive to every detail and architectural line of his paintings, as well as the settings he was depicting. For many of the objects in his paintings, he would depict what was in front of him, using fresh flowers imported from across the continent and even from Africa, rushing to finish the paintings before the flowers died. It was this commitment to veracity that earned him recognition but also caused many of his adversaries to take up arms against his almost encyclopaedic works.|$|E
25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved <b>her</b> <b>table</b> scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when <b>her</b> <b>table</b> was already full.|$|E

She is the only {{daughter}} of Feng Qingzhi, a granary worker, and his wife Li Chunping, an employee of a department store. Feng's parents, who were poor, lived frugally for years to pay for <b>her</b> <b>table</b> tennis training. Her father suffered from multiple sclerosis, {{but she was not}} told how severe his illness was. He died in 2002, weeks before Feng tried out for China's national B squad. Although Feng topped the qualifying matches a month later and was called up for the national team in 2003, she suffered from a long illness; a source close to her said it was [...] "because she missed her father too much". Feng left China in 2005 to play in the Japanese professional league. While there she was spotted by Liu Guodong, then a coach with the Singapore Table Tennis Association, in 2006. In March 2007 she was invited to train in Singapore under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. She became a Singapore citizen in January 2008.|$|E

[...] "When it was over, I came over to <b>her</b> <b>table</b> and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
