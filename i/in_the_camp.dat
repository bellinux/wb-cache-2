5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> Detainees usually spent several days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> during which some of them were interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through the camp before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at the camp, though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who are missing and presumed dead. The events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two of the trials are ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Cyprus detainees were intercepted before reaching Palestine, usually by boat. Some were on vessels that had successfully run the British blockade, but {{were caught in}} Palestine. Most of them were Holocaust survivors, about 60% from <b>the</b> displaced person <b>camps</b> and others from the Balkans and other Eastern European countries. A very small group of Moroccan Jews was also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> prisoners were mostly young, 80% between 13 and 35, and included over 6,000 orphan children. About 2,000 children were born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> births took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jewish wing of the British Military Hospital in Nicosia. Some 400 Jews died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> and were buried in Margoa cemetery.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may have been killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> {{the detainees}} {{suffered}} from tropical diseases and inadequate food and clothing. Jewish {{organizations such as}} the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Jewish Agency, and the Zionist Federation, sent food, clothing, medicine, and religious items to the detainees. Initially, a ban on interaction between the sexes was enforced; the men were held in a former jailhouse and the women in adjacent iron huts. After the ban was lifted, 60 children were born <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> In total, 128 prisoners died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> and were buried in the Jewish section of St. Martin Cemetery. At the end of World War II, the detainees were given the choice of returning to their former homes in Europe or immigrating to Palestine. Most chose Palestine, and on August 6, 1945, 1,320 landed in Haifa.|$|E

5|$|The mutineers divided {{themselves}} into three groups. A party of 100 went to obtain ammunition from Tanglin Barracks, where 309 Germans, including crew {{members from the}} German light cruiser SMS Emden, had been interned by the British. The mutineers fired on the camp guards and officers without warning, killing ten British guards, three Johore troops present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and one German internee. Amongst the dead were Second Lieutenant John Love Montgomerie, Rifles; Sergeant G. Wald, (Reserve) Engineers; Corporal D. McGilvray, Rifles; Corporal G.O. Lawson, Cyclist Scouts; Lance Corporal J.G.E. Harper, Rifles; Private B.C. Cameron, Rifles; Private F.S. Drysdale, Rifles; Private A.J.G. Holt, Rifles and Stoker 1st Class C. F. Anscombe, HMS Cadmus. Three British and one German were wounded but survived the attack, as did eight Royal Army Medical Corps personnel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> hospital, including one who managed to escape under heavy fire to raise the alarm. The mutineers tried to persuade the Germans to join them, {{but many of the}} latter were shaken by the sudden violence and reluctant to do so. Some German sailors and reservists wanted to join with the mutineers, but the majority adopted a neutral stance, refusing to accept rifles from the Indians. Thirty-five Germans escaped but the rest remained in the barracks.|$|E
