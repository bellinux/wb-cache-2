25|$|On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists {{played in}} Pittsburgh, PA at the Benedum Center. During the show, {{the band members}} {{performed}} a skit where they ran up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt.|$|E
25|$|Women {{also were}} working on the platform, distributing the basics of fruit, matches, and candy bars for those who were unable to go inside. One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another important job was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who went inside. Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would walk up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} was finished, a showing was planned at the Museum of Modern Art. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) {{surrounded}} the building, in a protest led by Elaine Parker. Gregg Kilday of the Los Angeles Times interviewed Larry Kardish, a museum staff member, and Kardish recalled that [...] "About halfway into the film about ten members of CORE showed up. They walked up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and were very belligerent. In my estimation they were determined not to like the film. Apparently some of their friends had read the script of the movie and in their belief it was detrimental {{to the image of}} blacks [...] The question-and-answer session with Bakshi that followed quickly collapsed into the chaos of a shouting match." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck did not recall any disturbance during the screening, but said there were racist catcalls during the question-and-answer session, and Bakshi's talk was cut short. [...] "It wasn't much of a madhouse, but it was kind of wild for the Museum of Modern Art." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{aspects of}} gay {{identification}} with Garland were being {{discussed in the}} mainstream as early as 1967. Time magazine, in reviewing Garland's 1967 Palace Theatre engagement, disparagingly noted that a [...] "disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual." [...] It {{goes on to say}} that [...] "he boys in the tight trousers" [...] (a phrase Time repeatedly used to describe gay men, as when it described [...] "ecstatic young men in tight trousers pranc <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> to toss bouquets of roses" [...] to another gay icon, Marlene Dietrich) would [...] "roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats" [...] during Garland's performances. Time then attempted to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual, consulting psychiatrists who opined that [...] "the attraction [...] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria" [...] and that [...] "Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her." ...|$|E
2500|$|From December 26 to December 31, 1969, Weatherman {{held the}} last of its National Council {{meetings}} in Flint, Michigan. Flying to the event, Dohrn and Jacobs ran up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of the airplane, seizing food, frightening the passengers. The meeting, dubbed the [...] "War Council" [...] by the 400 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the [...] "armed struggle." [...] Reminding the delegates {{of the murder of}} Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by members of the Manson Family. [...] "Dig it," [...] Dohrn said approvingly. [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner {{in the same room with}} them, they even shoved a fork into a victim’s stomach! Wild!" [...] She then held up three fingers in what she called the [...] "Manson fork salute." [...] Over the next five days, the participants met in informal, random groups to discuss what [...] "going underground" [...] meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass [...] "wargasm"—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches. The [...] "War Council" [...] ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. J.J. condemned the [...] "pacifism" [...] of white middle-class American youth, a belief which they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of [...] "repersonalization" [...] brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. [...] "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," [...] Jacobs said in his most oft-quoted statement. [...] "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{an instant}} people had risen in their seats, men were hurrying <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> while a {{peculiar}} human murmur or wail persisted like an undertone beneath {{the confusion of}} noises, striking the very note of my own feelings.

60|$|Nevertheless on {{this bright}} autumn morning {{there was a}} glamour over valley and ridge, black slope and snowy peak, and the dim distant ranges. The sky was as blue as {{the inside of a}} columbine, a rich and {{beautiful}} light of gold gilded the wall of rock that boldly cropped out of the mountainside; and the wide sweeping expanse of sage lost itself in a deep purple horizon. Ravens and magpies crossed Pan's glad eyesight. Jack rabbits bounded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> between the sage bushes. Far out on the plain he descried antelope, moving away with their telltale white rumps. The air was sweet, intoxicating, full of cedar fragrance and the cool breath from off the heights.|$|E

60|$|Ahead of Slone, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> low {{under the}} trees {{spreading}} over the running King, floated swiftly some medium, like a transparent veil. It was neither smoke nor air. It carried faint pin points of light, sparks, that resembled atoms of dust floating in sunlight. It was a wave of heat driven before the storm of fire. Slone did not feel pain, {{but he seemed to}} be drying up, parching. And Lucy must be suffering now. He goaded the stallion, raking his flanks. Wildfire answered with a scream and a greater speed. All except Lucy and Sage King and Wildfire seemed so strange and unreal--the swift rush between the pines, now growing ghostly in the dimming light, the sense of a pursuing, overpowering force, and yet absolute silence.|$|E
60|$|Ladd {{pursued a}} zigzag course southward across the desert, {{trotting}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> cantering in wide, bare patches, {{walking through the}} clumps of cacti. The desert seemed all of a sameness to Dick--a wilderness of rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges, always looking close, yet never growing any nearer. The moon slanted back toward the west, losing its white radiance, and the gloom of the earlier evening began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas. By and by Ladd entered an arroyo, and here the travelers turned and twisted with the meanderings of a dry stream bed. At {{the head of a}} canyon they had to take once more to the rougher ground. Always it led down, always it grew rougher, more rolling, with wider bare spaces, always the black ranges loomed close.|$|E

I daresay he was conjuring up pictures of {{the days when the}} old Abbey was full of grey-hooded monks, and the chapel was echoing day and night to their solemn chants and prayers. Sometimes, in the gloaming, I can almost fancy myself that I see them kneeling in long rows in those rich stalls, and hear the rustle of their gowns as they pass slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> I think he must have found it sad to linger about in that beautiful chapel, so cold, and empty, and bare. That is why I like Roman Catholics. They have such a strong reverential affection for their places of worship, and take such a delight in adorning them. It is almost like a personal love." ...|$|E

She was to go to the Cathedral service on the morning of every week-day, and on Sundays in the afternoon. On Sunday mornings she was to attend the little church of St. Margaret. On Sunday evenings it was the practice of Miss Stanbury to read a sermon in the dining-room to all of whom her household consisted. Did Dorothy like daily services? Dorothy, who was more patient than her brother, and whose life had been much less energetic, said that she had no objection to going to church every day when there was not too much to do.|$|E
6000|$|This confidence, so {{far from}} inspiriting Douglass, still further {{depressed}} him, and he passed in and on up into the second gallery, where he had privately purchased a reserved seat with intent to sense for himself {{the feeling of the}} upper part of the house during the first act. Keeping his muffler pinned close so that his evening dress escaped notice, he found his way down to the railing quite secure from recognition by any one at the peep-hole of the curtain or in the boxes, and there took his seat to watch the late-comers ripple <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> He was experienced enough to know that [...] "first-nighters" [...] do not always count and that they are sometimes false prophets, and yet he could not suppress a growing exaltation as the beautiful auditorium filled with men and women such as he had himself often called [...] "representative," [...] and, best of all, many of the city's artists and literarians were present.|$|E
