Antioxidant activity of water kefir never reported in the scientific literature. The objective {{of this study was}} to detect and investigate the antioxidant potency of water kefir. Water kefir was prepared by fermentation of sugar solution with kefir grains for 24 h. Antioxidant activity of fresh water <b>kefir</b> <b>drink</b> and its extract with (0. 125 – 5 mg/ml) was evaluated using 2, 2,-diphenyl- 1 -pricrylhydrozyl (DPPH) scavenging method, and inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation and the reducing power of water kefir were determined, Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and ascorbic acid were used for comparison. Water kefir demonstrated great ability to DPPH scavenging ranged (9. 88 - 63. 17 %). And inhibit ascorbate oxidation by (6. 08 - 25. 57 %) increased in consequent with concentration raising. These results prime to conclude that water kefir could be promisor source of natural antioxidants with good potency in health developing...|$|E
40|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} types of hereditary metabolic disorders which is caused due to an absence or reduction of the activity of the Phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme in the liver which in turn, inhibits the transformation of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. In clinical terms, this disorder is displayed with severe, permanent and irreversible mental retardation. This research was aimed at development of a highly nutrient and acceptable suitable analogue <b>Kefir</b> <b>drink</b> for these patients. The mentioned drink is based on milk permeate, cream powder and includes glycomacropeptide (GMP) as a source of protein, starter as a fermentation source, the trance glutamines (TG) enzyme, dough stabilizer and modified corn starch as tissue maker, salt and water. The GMP used in this analogue drink is intended for enrichment of the product and therefore it was added by 3 % to one formula. The aforementioned sample had a lower calculated amount of pH and alcohol percentage in comparison with the 16 samples which did not have GMP. The results of this study showed that the analog kefir has a low level of phenylalanine (30. 40 mg/ 100 g) and in that regard, it can be considered to be useful for patients with PKU...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Molecular Biology and Genetics, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 66 - 73) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiv, 80 leavesKefir is {{a traditional}} fermented milk beverage which is produced by adding kefir grains into milk and is allowed for fermentation. Grains contain vital complex flora of microorganisms (bacteria and yeast) that live in harmony. Since health and food safety of fermented milk products is important, population structure of food-type microbes involve in fermentation should be known very well. Rapid determination of kefir bacterial composition may accelerate the determination of food quality and also may facilitate specification of bioactive products that obtain from kefir. The goal of this thesis was to analysis the genomic structure of bacterial communities of the fermented <b>kefir</b> <b>drink</b> and grains by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods (metagenomic approach). Total Genomic DNA was purified from each analysis methods and the partial small subunits of 16 S rDNA were amplified {{by a pair of}} universal bacterial primers. 16 S rDNAs fragments were cloned and then sequenced. The vast quantities of data were screened in NCBI database by BLASTN program according to similarity scores with related sequences. 7 different bacteria were identified to species level composed of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter syzygii, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterococcus faecium and 1 bacteria to genus level named Lactobacillus kefiri or parabucheri. The results of this study showed that the combination of both methods is more efficient to identify high percentage of species than using only one of them. Finally, phylogenetic relationships among identified species inferred from partial 16 S rRNAs gene sequencing were determined by Neighbor-joining algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Considering the {{importance}} of quality and bacterial contamination in food products, a rapid, accurate and able method to deliver consistent results for counting bacteria is an essential. Application of image processing in the measurement of quality is one of important research topics. This method is very accurate and non-destructive with constant results. The {{aim of this study}} was the use of image processing in bacterial count (Quail flora, sourdough and <b>drinks</b> <b>kefir)</b> and comparison with Colony Counter method. Materials and Methods: First, of intestinal microbial flora Quail, sourdough and <b>drink</b> <b>kefir,</b> Dilutions were prepared from 10 - 1 to 10 - 9. Then respectively in plate count agar, YGC agar and MRS agar were cultured surface (Quail flora and lactic acid bacteria in <b>drink</b> <b>kefir</b> at 37 ° C and yeast in sourdough at 25 °C). After 24 hours, colonies grown by Colony Counter and Image J software were counted in triplicate. Results: The results showed that in dilutions of 10 - 5 to 10 - 9, don’t difference between the numbers reported by the two methods but in dilutions of 10 - 1 to 10 - 4, there were significant difference between the numbers reported by the two methods. Conclusions: According to the results of this research can be introduced image processing an accurate and rapid method for bacterial count...|$|R

The method used in this research was experiment with Completely Randomized Design (CDR) by used 4 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments were P 0 = without the honey added, P 1 =added by 20 % honey, P 2 = added by 30 % honey and P 3 = added by 40 % honey (v/v). The data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), if there were significantly difference, the data would analyzed by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. The results showed that honey addition gave highly difference significant (P< 0. 01) on organoleptic quality (colour, aroma, taste), turbidity and lightness (L*). Honey addition didn’t give significantly difference (P< 0. 05) on redness (a*) and yellowness (b*).

40|$|Background: Kefir is {{fermented}} milk and {{comes from the}} Caucasus. Kefir is made by inoculating cow milk, goat or sheep with kefir grain. Kefir contains 0. 5 – 1. 0 % alcohol and 0. 9 to 1. 1 % lactic acid. This product is very popular in the Soviet Union, where the consumption of kefir reach 4. 5 kg per capita per year. Kefir made from pasteurized milk and fermented with kefir grain, kefir grain is white seeds from bacteria colony, such as Streptococcus sp., Lactobacilli and some types of yeast/yeast apatogen. As a probiotic <b>drink,</b> <b>kefir</b> contains bacteria of lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria in kefir are giving acidity and produces secondary metabolites that bacteriocins that kill pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus. Method: This study used cow milk and goat milk kefir as a starting material, to produce a cow milk kefir and goat milk kefir. Cow milk kefir and goat milk kefir were compared antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus. Previously each made 3 variations of the concentration of 2 %, 4 %, and 6 % kefir grains were added cow milk and goat milk. Antibacterial activity tested using Kirby Bauer method so that the observation a clear zone formed on the media was the inhibition activity of the bacterium Bacillus cereus. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Mann Whitney, and Tukey with a significance of 95 %. Result: The results showed that goat milk kefir has better antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus compared to cow milk kefir. Goat milk kefir with kefir seeds concentration of 6 % has the best antibacterial activity with inhibition zone diameter of 6 mm...|$|R
