500|$|... "Die Another Day" [...] is an electroclash number, {{starting}} with strings which continues for eleven seconds, when Madonna's vocals {{starts with the}} lines [...] "I'm gonna keep this secret / I'm gonna close my body now..." [...] It follows with the stuttered editing on her voice, which keeps cutting the main signal, especially on the chorus [...] "I <b>guess..</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> die... another day". The strings again gain prominence at around the 2:20 mark. During the intermediate verse, a [...] "raucous" [...] laugh by Madonna can be heard. The song ends with interpolating electronic swirls and the orchestra fading out. Sterling Clover from The Village Voice explained that the ending recalled the snare drums and bass usage in songs of the microhouse genre, describing it as [...] "cacophony of harmonic fragments". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time with a fast tempo of 130 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes B3 to D5.|$|E
2500|$|First of all, I don't think it's {{within the}} power of human beings {{to assure that the}} climate does not change, as {{millions}} of years of history have shown, and second of all, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." ...|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was decided}} to make the movie about his life called Serpico, Al Pacino invited Serpico to stay with him at a house that Pacino had rented in Montauk, New York. When Pacino asked why he had stepped forward, Serpico replied, [...] "Well, Al, I don't know. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to say it would be because... if I didn't, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?" [...] He has {{credited}} his grandfather who had once been assaulted and robbed and his uncle, a respected policeman in Italy, with his sense of justice.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BRO,--Barstow {{wrote that}} if I wanted the place I could have it. I wrote him that <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take it, {{and asked him}} how long before I must come up there. I have not heard from him since.|$|R

2500|$|Regarding his {{political}} views, Carolla has stated, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be Republican, {{in the sense}} that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." [...] He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically liberal causes such as the legalization of marijuana and support for as well some progressive causes such as [...] "... against semi-automatic and automatic weapons. I'm not an NRA guy {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants." [...] (He is a member of the advisory board of the Marijuana Policy Project.) Elsewhere, he has stated, [...] "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence." [...] In an interview with Reason TV, Carolla described his views as libertarian.|$|E

6000|$|Leland's face hardened. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> and that, {{if it has}} to be, {{is going}} to hurt me. If I stood as I did last fall, I could carry over, but now the market and the season are both against me. But I must be getting home. You'll fix it up with Bruce?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{would wish}} that a serene {{gratification}} might flow from my pages, unsullied {{by a single}} start. Now I am aware that there {{is that in the}} last chapter which appears to offend against the spirit of calm recital which I profess. People will begin to think that they are to be kept in the dark as to who is who; that it is intended that their interest in the novel shall depend partly on a <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> wish to have no guessing, and therefore I at once proceed to tell all about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} not. I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> starve if I {{depended}} on birds for my daily food," [...] retorted Spooky. [...] "I catch a Sparrow now and then, to be sure, but usually {{it is an}} English Sparrow, and I consider that I am doing the Old Orchard a good turn every time I am lucky enough to catch {{one of the family}} of Bully the English Sparrow. But I live mostly on Mice and Shrews in winter and in summer I eat a lot of grasshoppers and other insects. If it wasn't for me and my relatives I guess Mice would soon overrun the Great World. Farmer Brown ought to be glad I've come to live in the Old Orchard and I guess he is, for Farmer Brown's boy knows all about this house of mine and never disturbs me. Now if you'll excuse me I think I'll fly over to Farmer Brown's young orchard. I ought to find a fat Mouse or two trying to get some of the bark from those young trees." ...|$|E
6000|$|We had {{a lovely}} {{time at the}} chalet--two girls alone, messing just as we pleased in the kitchen, and {{learning}} from Ursula how to concoct pot-au-feu in the most approved Swiss fashion. We pottered, as we women love to potter, half the day long; the other half we spent in riding our cycles about the eternal hills, and ensnaring the flies whom Lady Georgina dutifully sent up to us. She was our decoy duck: and, in virtue of her handle, she decoyed to a marvel. Indeed, I sold so many Manitous that I began to entertain a deep respect for my own commercial faculties. As for Mr. Cyrus W. Hitchcock, he wrote to me from Frankfort: 'The world continues to revolve on its axis, the Manitou, and the machine is booming. Orders romp in daily. When you ventilated the suggestion of an agency at Limburg, I concluded at a glance you had the material of a first-class business woman about you; but I reckon I {{did not know what}} a traveller meant till you started on the road. I am now enlarging and altering this factory, to meet increased demands. Branch offices at Berlin, Hamburg, Crefeld, and Düsseldorf. Inspect our stock before dealing elsewhere. A liberal discount allowed to the trade. Two hundred agents wanted in all towns of Germany. If they were every one of them like you, miss--well, I <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hire the town of Frankfort for my business premises.' ...|$|E

5000|$|An American bioethicist {{and medical}} historian, Jacob M. Appel {{has argued that}} sex toys are a [...] "social good" [...] and that the devices, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "marital substitutes", play [...] "an {{important}} role in the emotional lives of millions of Americans". [...] Appel has written: [...] I cannot say whether more Alabama women own vibrators than own Bibles. If <b>I</b> were <b>guessing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> suspect that a majority derive more use out of the vibrators. Certainly more pleasure. Nor does there appear to be any remotely rational basis for keeping sex toys {{out of the hands of}} married adults, or single adults, or even children. Now that we are relatively confident that masturbation does not make little girls go blind, or cause palms to sprout hair, exposure to sex toys shouldn't harm them. On the list of items that I might not want children to be exposed to in stores—guns, matches, poisons, junk food—sex toys are way down the list.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's so," [...] agreed Carnally. [...] "Still <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it <b>would</b> {{be safer}} {{on the other}} side, where we'll strike it sooner coming back. It's wise to take no chances in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not as a}} {{practical}} thing, of course," [...] Fulkerson admitted. [...] "But as something retrospective, speculative, <b>I</b> believe it <b>would</b> make a hit.

5000|$|Although he {{was offered}} a new {{contract}} by the club {{at the end of}} the 2010-11 season, Tranmere manager Les Parry expected Cresswell to turn down the contract offer saying [...] "Aaron has got four or five Championship clubs trying to sign him; if I had to <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say Aaron might be leaving us this summer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris Marker has said: [...] "On a more matter-of-fact level, I {{could tell}} you that the film {{intended}} to be, and {{is nothing more than a}} home movie.

He decided to devote himself fully to criticism in the mid-1980s.
