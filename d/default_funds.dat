40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} against the potential losses {{in case of a}} participant's default and to contain systemic risk, central counterparties (CCPs) need to maintain sufficient financial resources. Typically, these financial resources consist of margin requirements and contributions to a collective <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> Based on a stylized model of CCP risk management, this article analyzes the main factors affecting the trade-off between margins and <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> The optimal balance between these two risk management instruments is found to depend on collateral costs, participants' default probability, {{and the extent to which}} margin requirements are associated with risk-mitigating incentives.

40|$|This {{draft report}} was {{released}} to assist participants in preparing a submission {{to the public}} inquiry into default superannuation funds in modern awards. Default superannuation arrangements exist because many employees do not actively choose a superannuation fund. <b>Default</b> <b>funds</b> are currently listed in most modern awards.   Current default fund arrangements have provided stability, and investment returns of <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> have generally exceeded those of non-default funds.   However, the arrangements could be improved to promote {{the best interests of}} members. The primary objective of <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> should be the best interests of members, and for modern awards that list <b>default</b> <b>funds,</b> the selection and ongoing assessment of those funds should be merit based.   The criteria that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will use for MySuper product authorisation provide a sound basis for the selection and ongoing assessment of superannuation funds for listing as <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> in modern awards.   While the Commission does not consider {{there is a need for}} additional criteria, there are factors that should be considered as a second stage when selecting funds to be listed in modern awards.   These are: as primary factors, the appropriateness of the MySuper product 2 ̆ 7 s investment return and risk profile for employees to whom the superannuation provisions in that modern award apply, and the fund 2 ̆ 7 s expected ability to deliver on the MySuper product 2 ̆ 7 s investment objectives the appropriateness of the fees charged by the MySuper product, given its stated investment return objective and risk profile the assessment of governance structures to test if they are, as far as legislative requirements allow, consistent with meeting the best interests of members the assessment of the mechanisms put in place by fund trustees to deal with conflicts of interest, and the transparency in disclosing those conflicts the likelihood of members being switched to higher cost divisions of a fund, or facing significantly higher fees upon exiting employment (2 ̆ 7 flipping 2 ̆ 7) the compatibility of the fund 2 ̆ 7 s insurance offerings with the characteristics of employees to whom the superannuation provisions in that modern award apply the quality of member- and fund-specific intra-fund advice the administrative efficiency of a fund against a set of benchmarks.   The process for the selection and ongoing assessment of superannuation funds for listing as <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> in modern awards also needs to be reformed. The Commission is seeking further comment on two alternative options.   Decisions being made by an expert panel within Fair Work Australia (FWA), and the selection process being opened up to allow all funds to present their case to be listed in awards to FWA, based on the factors identified by the Commission; or Establishment of a new expert body independent of FWA, with the sole purpose of selecting and assessing the funds to be listed in modern awards, based on the factors identified by the Commission.

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) This study {{investigates the}} best measure of extreme {{losses in the}} South African equity {{derivatives}} market, and applies this to estimate {{the size of a}} <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> for Safcom, the central counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivatives in South Africa. The predictive abilities of historic simulation Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), Extreme VaR (EVaR) calculated using a Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution and stress testing are compared during historic periods of stress in this market. The iterative cumulative sum of squares (ICSS) algorithm of Inclan and Tiao (1994) is applied to identify significant and large, positive shifts in the volatility of returns, thus indicating the start of a stress period. The FTSE/JSE Top 40 Index Future (known as the ALSI future) is used as a proxy for this market. Two key periods of stress are identified, namely the 1997 Asian crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. The maximum daily losses in the ALSI during these stress periods were observed on 28 October 1997 and 6 October 2008. For the VaR-based loss estimates, 2500 trading days’ returns up to 28 October 1997 and 2750 trading days’ returns up to 6 October 2008 is used. The study finds that Extreme VaR predicts extreme losses during these two historic periods of stress the most accurately and is consequently applied to the quantification of a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> for Safcom, using 2500 daily returns from 5 June 2003 to 31 May 2013. The EVaR-based estimation of a <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> shows that the current Safcom <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> is sufficient to provide for market losses equivalent to what was suffered during the 2008 global financial crisis, but not sufficient for the magnitude of losses suffered during the 1997 Asian crisis...|$|R

40|$|Compulsory superannuation is a core {{element of}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{retirement}} income system. In May 2009, the Government commissioned an independent review into the governance, efficiency, {{structure and operation}} of Australia’s superannuation system (the Cooper Review). The Cooper Review provided its final report to Government on 30 June 2010. As noted {{in the terms of}} reference for this inquiry (attachment A), a key finding of the Cooper Review was that many consumers do not have the interest, information or expertise required to make informed choices about their superannuation. Most consumers therefore rely heavily on the default superannuation system, with fewer than 10 per cent of workers actively choosing a superannuation fund. The Review recommended the establishment of a new default superannuation product, MySuper. At present, there are two main ways in which <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> are selected {{for those who do not}} choose their own fund: 	Most modern awards contain a list of default superannuation funds. Where more than one fund is listed, employers choose among those listed. If the award does not include a default fund, employers are free to choose any fund as a default fund. Employers may need to choose different <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> for workers reliant on different awards. 	For those employed under an enterprise agreement, employers choose the default fund in consultation with employees. The Government has stated in the terms of reference that it believes that <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> should continue to be included in modern awards.   This issues paper was released on 29 February 2012 and is intended to assist you in preparing a submission to the Commission.

40|$|AbstractThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has {{a policy}} {{framework}} for how clearing member banks should treat their exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). <b>Default</b> <b>funds</b> {{play a crucial}} role as a risk mitigant in this framework. Furthermore, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (together abbreviated as CPSS-IOSCO) produced a set of 26 principles for financial market infrastructures. For a CCP to be deemed a qualified CCP, it has to abide by these principles. Clearing member banks with trade exposures to a qualified CCP will get preferential capital treatment under the BCBS framework. None of the principles or the policy framework requires, or forces a CCP to have a default fund. However, regulators prefer CCPs to have <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> in place to enhance their credit risk management practices, as required by principles 4 and 6 of the CPSS-IOSCO, before they will be qualified. We consider the merits of the BCBS's requirements for a clearing house, in a developing country such as South Africa, to become a qualified clearing house and conclude that a CCP with prudent risk management processes and controls, should not be disqualified if a default fund is not established...|$|E

40|$|The UK Government's {{workplace}} pension reforms introduce {{major changes}} {{to the way in}} which employees save for retirement. Eligible employees will be automatically enrolled into a workplace-based pension scheme and, for the first time in the UK, employers will be legally required to contribute to employees’ pensions. This article critically examines the evidence from New Zealand and Australia, two countries that have undergone pension reforms similar in some ways to the UK reforms. We assess what we can learn from their experiences in two areas: firstly, how pension schemes are structured and, secondly, the outcomes for individuals. The evidence highlights the potential of automatic enrolment to overcome people's disinterest in pension saving. At the same time, relatively few UK employees are likely to choose where their pension savings are invested. As a result, <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> will play an important role in determining the pension outcomes for individuals...|$|E

The total cost of the clearance framework for a clearing member, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a CVA corresponding to the cost of its losses on the <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> in case of defaults of other member, an MVA corresponding to the cost of funding its margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital and also of the capital at risk that the member implicitly provides to the CCP through its <b>default</b> <b>fund</b> contribution.

40|$|Central {{counterparties}} (CCPs) {{have become}} {{pillars of the}} new global financial architecture following the financial crisis of 2008. The key role of CCPs in mitigating counterparty risk and contagion has in turn cast them as systemically important financial institutions whose eventual failure may lead to potentially serious consequences for financial stability, and prompted discussions on CCP risk management standards and safeguards for recovery and resolutions of CCPs in case of failure. We contribute to the debate on CCP default resources {{by focusing on the}} incentives generated by the CCP loss allocation rules for the CCP and its members and discussing how the design of loss allocation rules may be used to align these incentives in favor of outcomes which benefit financial stability. After reviewing the ingredients of the CCP loss waterfall and various proposals for loss recovery provisions for CCPs, we examine the risk management incentives created by different ingredients in the loss waterfall and discuss possible approaches for validating the design of the waterfall. We emphasize the importance of CCP stress tests and argue that such stress tests need to account for the interconnectedness of CCPs through common members and cross-margin agreements. A key proposal is that capital charges on assets held against CCP <b>Default</b> <b>Funds</b> should depend {{on the quality of the}} risk management of the CCP, as assessed through independent stress tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} superannuation (private pension systems) {{is a global}} phenomenon, which has been {{intended}} to counter the financial burden of an ageing population. Superannuation {{is part of the}} Australian government’s retirement income policy, as it is expected to supplement the Government Age Pension and other private savings in providing sufficient retirement funding for the nation. With the impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) leading to reduced share market asset values, corporate failures and consequently reduced retirement funds, superannuation is increasingly the focus of reform initiatives. In Australia, superannuation is the legislated process of employers depositing a percentage of employees’ earnings into superannuation accounts for the employees’ subsequent retirements. Employers are required to identify an ‘employer nominated fund’, or ‘MySuper’ fund, to receive deposits where no fund choice has been advised. Industry superannuation accounts represent 17 % of the overall trillion dollar asset base, with the majority of ‘industry’ superannuation fund members investing in high risk ‘default investment strategies’. Motivation for this research reflected concern for the increasing numbers of ‘baby boomer’ retirees not only impacted by the shortened time frame of legislated super savings opportunity, but also significantly impacted by the GFC on the cusp of their retirement. The need to understand how <b>default</b> <b>funds</b> cater for these types of ‘life cycle’ issues reinforced the imperative for this research...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{increasing}} {{efforts have been}} put into the development of effective stress tests to quantify the resilience of financial institutions. Here we propose a stress test methodology for central counterparties based on a network characterization of clearing members, whose links correspond to direct credits and debits. This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of financial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both exogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are amplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At {{the end of the}} dynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each clearing member, which represents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the Fixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy whose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two different scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock corresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default of the two most exposed clearing members). Although the two situations lead to similar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the distress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number of additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results thus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2 basis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very conservative <b>default</b> <b>funds,</b> such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to the shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a refined tool for calibrating default fund amounts...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} several years, many {{employers}} have decided to automatically enroll their new employees in the company 401 (k) plan. Using several years of administrative data from three large firms, we analyze the impact of automatic enrollment on 401 (k) participation rates, savings behavior, and asset accumulation. We find that although employees can {{opt out of the}} 401 (k) plan, few choose to do so. As a result, automatic enrollment has a dramatic impact on retirement savings behavior: 401 (k) participation rates at all three firms exceed 85 %, but participants tend to anchor at a low default savings rate and in a conservative default investment vehicle. We find that initially, about 80 % of participants accept both the default savings rate (2 % or 3 % for our three companies) and the <b>default</b> investment <b>fund</b> (a stable value or money market fund). Even after three years, half of the plan participants subject to automatic enrollment continue to contribute at the default rate and invest their contributions exclusively in the <b>default</b> <b>fund.</b> The effects of automatic enrollment on asset accumulation are not straightforward. While higher participation rates promote wealth accumulation, the low default savings rate and the conservative <b>default</b> investment <b>fund</b> undercut accumulation. In our sample, these two effects are roughly offsetting on average. However, automatic enrollment does increase saving in the lower tail of the savings distribution by dramatically reducing the fraction of employees who do not participate in the 401 (k) plan. ...|$|R
