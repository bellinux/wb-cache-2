40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} of negligible recombination within the thin epitaxial collector layer of an <b>integrated</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> switch in quasi-saturation, solutions to the collector minority can iel profile and transit time in the induced base are derived. In contrast to Dai and Yuan's analysis (1997), the present analysis takes both the drift and diffusion currents into account and is valid for all levels of injection. Dependence of transit time on characteristics of the epitaxial-substrate interface and recombination at the interface is studied for the transistor driven into hard saturation. At high effective surface recombination velocity, recombination at the interface cannot be neglected. The study shows that transit time increases more rapidly with collector current when the transistor operates in hard saturation and the interface is highly reflecting...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} method for measuring <b>integrated</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> forming part of an integrated circuit chip. These integrated circuits were produced at Plessey, Caswell. The measurement technique was then used to investigate the validity of the equivalent circuit at present used by Plessey's, over the frequency range up to and beyond fT. The measuring system was based on the Hewlett Packard microwave network analyser. A computer aided correction program has been implemented for calibrating the measuring system. This establishes the measurement plane at the terminals of the device, eliminating all the parasitic components. For calibrating the measuring system, purpose made standards of chip size were made. Ideally one of these would be a perfect matched load. This is difficult to achieve at microwave frequencies. Instead, a thin-film resistor was used. This was characterized and its frequency dependence taken into account in the calibration program. Using the above computer aided system, the complex S-parameters of the <b>integrated</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> were measured at several bias conditions. Optimization was used to obtain values for the equivalent circuit from the measured S-parameters. An appropriate objective function with suitable boundary conditions has been formulated in terms of the measured S-parameters and those calculated from the equivalent circuit. The component values of the equivalent circuit which give agreement between the measured and calculated S-parameters have been obtained by applying the Hooke and Jeeves optimization routine to minimize the objective function...|$|R

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> Gate <b>Bipolar</b> <b>Transistors</b> (IGBTs) {{generally}} {{have a high}} output power and generate significant amounts of heat, which needs {{to be removed from}} the chip to ensure continued operation. Since IGBT chips are commonly mounted on a layered assembly structure which is in turn mounted onto a heat sink assembly, the thermal dissipation properties of the layered structure are crucial in keeping temperatures within operational boundaries. Traditionally, the selection of materials for the layered structure has been largely influenced by the thermal conductivity for heat dissipation, the similarity of the coefficient of thermal expansion for physical integrity of the structure and to a lesser extent, the weight of the material. These principles of material selection are indeed adequate for steady state operation of IGBTs. However, IGBTs are often installed in applications where they are subjected to pulsed operation, which is predominantly transient. During transient operation, it was found that thermal conductivity was not necessarily the best criterion to use for material selection within the layered structure. In certain instances, materials that absorbed heat rather than conducting it yielded lower temperatures and higher cooling rates, which in turn resulted in lower start temperatures in the next pulse. This study therefore proposes an additional material selection criterion, one based on the density-specific heat capacity product that should be used in conjunction with thermal conductivity to guide the material selection process, opening the door to material combinations for specific applications that could enhance chip lifespan and reduce deliamination. Materials with high density-specific heat capacity products could also potentially be used to compensate for the thermal "bottlenecking" effect. This study was conducted with numerous simulations based on the well validated Transmission Line Matrix Modelling method. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The longitudinal vortices generated from the wing designs induce secondary mixing of the cooler free stream air entering the fin stack with the warmer fluid close to the fin surfaces. The change in angle of the attack of the active delta wings provide heat transfer enhancement while managing flow pressure losses across the fin stack. A heat transfer enhancement of 37 % compared to a plain fin stack was obtained from the 3 -D tabs in a staggered arrangement. The punched-out delta wings in the staggered and in-line arrangements provided enhancements of 30 % and 26 % respectively. Enhancements from the active delta wings were lower (16 %), however as these devices reduce the pressure drop through the fin stack by approximately 19 % in the deactivate position, over the activated position; a reduction in fan operating cost may be achieved for systems operating with inlet air temperatures below the maximum inlet temperature specification for the device.
