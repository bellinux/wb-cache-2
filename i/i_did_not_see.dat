25|$|I {{discovered}} {{a dark and}} hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{composer}} Edmund Rubbra, who studied under {{him in the}} early 1920s, Holst was [...] "a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of Petrushka or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams". He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. [...] "I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one {{would be better if}} it took such and such a course; if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> this, the point would not be insisted upon...

I still can't believe how well they pulled off the mystery. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>see</b> Aaron Echolls as the killer." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, praising the Keith-Veronica dynamic, the conclusions to the story arcs, and the final sequence after it is revealed that Aaron is the murderer. [...] "It’s also an interesting choice to have the reveal come {{about two-thirds of the}} way through the episode, and have the episode end with a dramatic chase and fight scene. Veronica has so rarely been in direct personal danger that having Aaron Echolls chase and capture her, and having Keith show up for a brutal fight and rescue, is jarring. And I think it is effective." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A".|$|E
500|$|Several {{writers and}} sports personalities {{consider}} this Sewanee team {{one of the}} greatest football teams ever to play.

Winning five road games in six days, all by shutout scores, has {{to be one of the}} most staggering achievements in the history of the sport. If the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) had been in effect in 1899, there seems little doubt Sewanee would have played in the title game. And they wouldn’t have been done in by any computer ratings." [...] Tony Barnhart in Southern Fried Football: The History, Passion and Glory of the Great Southern Game listed Sewanee as his number 1 Southern football team of all-time. A 16-team playoff to determine the best team in college football history with winners decided by fan votes was run by the College Football Hall of Fame, called the March of the Gridiron Champions.

[...] After receiving treatment {{on the bank}} of the river, he was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he made a complete recovery. [...] Oxford's coach Sean Bowden suggested that the loss of one of Oxford's blades had driven Woods to push himself [...] "beyond his limits". [...] As a result of the disruption and the concern for Woods' condition, the traditional award ceremony was cancelled. [...] Woods later apologised to the Cambridge crew and coach for his collapse that [...] "prevented their celebrations" [...] while thanking them for their [...] "sportsmanlike behaviour". Cambridge boat club president Nelson said [...] "I feel bad. Finishing the race there was a lot of raw emotion and some of the celebrations seem pathetic in retrospect" [...] while his coach Steve Trapmore commented [...] "it's not the way anyone wants to take away the win". [...] Oxford cox Zoe de Toledo made a request that the race be re-rowed as a result of the broken blade, but the appeal was dismissed by umpire Garrett, who said [...] "I listened to Oxford’s complaint but I explained <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the clash as being the reason for the eventual result".|$|E

Because of her relationship with Reynardine and the events with Coyote and Ysengrin, Antimony is nominated to begin training to become a medium, one of the individuals who moderate disputes between the Wood and the Court and communicates with etheric beings, and she decides to return to the woods to speak with Coyote. When Antimony visits Coyote, she learns that in the past Coyote had travelled across the sea to find Renard (called later Reynardine) and Ysengrin and make them into [...] "powerful being" [...] like himself.Antimony: [...] "Why were you looking for Renard in the first place? [...] Why bring him here?"Coyote: [...] "I sought to make him into a powerful being such as myself!" [...] He had given Ysengrin [...] "power over the trees" [...] and given Reynardine the power to take bodies, but bodies that Reynardine took always died after he left themCoyote: [...] "For some reason, when Renard had the ability , any body he took that was not his own would die when it was used up." [...] and Ysengrin was hardly strong enough to stand without the help of Coyote's tree armor. Reynardine had been in love with Antimony's mother, Surma,Coyote: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised if he cared very deeply about you, ! You see, Renard fell desperately in love with Surma!" [...] and had used his power to steal a young man's body and woo Surma; the man died, however, and Reynardine was imprisoned in Gunnerkrigg Court until the events surrounding his first meeting with Antimony.Coyote: [...] " [...] soon runs away!

2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
