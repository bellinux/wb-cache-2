40|$|The {{purpose of}} this inquiry was to {{construct}} a model for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> critical reflective practice, based on thorough analysis of the main concepts (critical thinking and reflection), related viewpoints, models and theories; and the data gathered and analyzed during, the naturalistic inquiry. The constructed model evolved from empirical observations, intuitive insights of the inquirer and from deductions combining ideas from several fields of inquiry. The model for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> critical reflective practice postualates that practitioners have the inherent potential to change from auto-pilot practice to critical reflective practice. The purpose of the model is the <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> heightened awarenss of the self, to enable health care professionals to consciously meet community needs and expectations. The desired outcome is transformative intellectuals who will strive to empower others to become critical reflective learners and practitioners themselves. The process followed during {{the construction of the}} model and the constructed model will be discussed in three (3) articles, namely: • A model for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> critical reflective practice: Part I - Introductory discussion and explanation of the phases followed to construct the model. • A model for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> critical reflective practice: Part II - Conceptual analysis within the context of constructing the model. • A model for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> critical reflective practice: Part III - Description of the model...|$|R

40|$|An {{increase}} in internal free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) in the presynaptic terminal is often assumed to directly produce <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter release. Using a Ca(2 +) -activated potassium conductance as a bioassay for free [Ca 2 +]i in the presynaptic terminal of the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) opener neuromuscular junction, we now demonstrate that free [Ca 2 +]i has a decay time constant (tau) of 1 - 4 msec, whereas <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter release has a decay tau of 7 - 43 msec. In addition, <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter release can be markedly different {{at times when}} free [Ca 2 +]i values and presynaptic membrane voltages are equal. We conclude that free [Ca 2 +]i in the presynaptic terminal is not directly responsible for <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> neurotransmitter release. Our data suggest that facilitation results from bound Ca 2 + or some long-lived consequence of bound Ca 2 +...|$|R
5000|$|In Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., the Supreme Court {{held that}} mere {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>complaints</b> by retailer competitors about price cutting {{did not permit}} inference of an agreement to fix prices. The Court held that [...] "a vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels." [...] The Court explained that some economic effect must be shown to depart from a rule-of-reason analysis: [...] "There is a presumption {{in favor of a}} rule-of-reason standard; and departure from that standard must be justified by demonstrable economic effect, such as the <b>facilitation</b> <b>of</b> cartelizing[...] [...] [...]" [...] A large part of the rationale of the holding of a Sherman Act violation in Parke Davis is that Parke Davis organized a horizontal cartel agreement among its direct customers to fix prices.|$|R
