500|$|A November 2005 demo {{contained}} thirteen songs, {{which included}} rough versions of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] and [...] "Halo". [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] contained what Flynn {{described as a}} [...] "totally fucking lame [...] "Angel of Death" [...] rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> part go!" [...] In mid August 2006, Machine Head announced that the title of their sixth studio effort would be The Blackening. Flynn and drummer Dave McClain spent August 18 and 19 jamming together, fine tuning songs chosen for the album and performing pre-production. Phil Demmel resumed lead guitar duties and Adam Duce returned as bassist.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Slanderous" [...] and [...] "Beautiful Mourning" [...] "Aesthetics of Hate" [...] was {{the third}} song that was written for Machine Heads album The Blackening. Flynn {{originally}} presented it to the band as [...] "The Thrashterpiece" [...] which became the songs working title, because according to Flynn [...] "it owes a huge debt to the band Exodus, (there's) a lot of Bay Area thrash worship {{going on in this}} song." [...] In February 2005, Machine Head had penned a rough version of [...] "Aesthetics of Hate". A 13-track November 2005 demo featured the song, although it contained what Flynn described as a [...] "totally fucking lame 'Angel of Death' rip off. I hated it every time we played it so I was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> part go!" [...] The band entered Sharkbite Studios, in Oakland, California on August 21, 2006 to begin recording. Production duties were handled by Flynn with assistance from Mark Keaton, and mixing by Colin Richardson.|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the usage}} of A Link to the Pasts version of Hyrule in A Link Between Worlds, Veloria thought that while revisiting {{familiar}} places was a nostalgic experience, the mystery of exploring new areas was absent and having to retread the same game world again was [...] "somewhat unsatisfying". Gaston called the loose structure and openness of the game a [...] "revelatory change", and was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> some restrictions in previous Zelda titles were not present in A Link Between Worlds. The introduction of the item rental system was well received, with many reviewers {{pointing out that the}} system granted players with more freedom. Ryckert loved having items available from the beginning, saying that it allowed him to experiment in combat. Both MacDonald and Gies agreed that losing rented items upon defeat added another layer of challenge and consequence to the game. Nintendo Life reviewer, Martin Watts found that streamlining the item system allowed the game to place a greater emphasis aspects such as exploration, solving puzzles and boss fights. However, Veloria expressed that not being able to find key items in dungeons was a drawback of the system.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come with me," [...] he directed, and {{together}} we moved off across the plaza to a building which I was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> adjoined <b>that</b> occupied by Sola and her charges.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] he returned. [...] "Just what I felt. Nothing {{can make}} me so <b>glad</b> as <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{you think the}} idea as socking as I do." ...|$|R
500|$|David Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News {{wrote that}} the show [...] "returns to its wicked wit, dialing back but {{certainly}} not eradicating the melodrama." [...] He complimented the four main actresses for their comedic relief and concluded: [...] "Rarely does a show unjump the shark this well; it's back in fine form, calibrating its humor and its menace just right." [...] New York Daily News writer David Bianculli compared the premiere to the show's second season, noting that the episode showed [...] "an assurance and a knowing playfulness that was missing most of last year." [...] He complimented Cherry and Greenstein's script and approved the storylines for each character. Bianculli opined that the episode returned {{the quality of the}} show's first season and concluded: [...] "Pass the word: If you've given up on 'Desperate Housewives,' it's time to return to the neighborhood." [...] Entertainment Weekly Lindsay Soll identified Eva Longoria as the episode's strongest performer, declaring that she [...] "definitely looks like the one to watch this season." [...] Soll was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Susan character was [...] "a little more toned down and less accident-prone than usual," [...] and called the scenes with Susan and Mike touching. Additionally, she opined that Laurie Metcalf [...] "did a brilliant job of playing the classic TV nosy neighbor," [...] but expressed her confusion over the Orson storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Omori and {{his colleagues}} spent time in the city {{measuring}} damaged buildings and taking photographs. [...] They were reportedly assaulted {{on more than one}} occasion. At least two authors state that Omori and colleagues were attacked on Mission Street, San Francisco by a gang of men and youths who were later hailed by the local press for their anti-Japanese racist stoning and slugging of random Japanese men, however contemporary sources indicate that one boy involved in the stoning of Dr. Omori worked for the Post Office as a messenger was fired by Postmaster Fisk of San Francisco when the Japanese Association of America protested. Other incidents alleged {{in a letter to the}} newspaper are unreferenced by any other sources, and Omori himself chose to forgive writing, [...] "referring to some trouble I had with hoodlums in San Francisco. [...] I was very <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the people of Hawaii did not like to have me treated in that way, but then it did me no injury and I bear no malice. [...] There are hoodlums in all countries. [...] The people of California treated me extremely well and I am very much pleased with my trip." ...|$|E

60|$|Sure enough, the Mexican {{appeared}} on the trail, leading my horses. I was so <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hal <b>that</b> I forgot I was a prisoner. But Greaser's sullen face and glittering eyes reminded me of it quickly enough. I read treachery in his glance.|$|R
60|$|That's right, my boy; I'm <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{you prepare}} {{yourself}} properly for your duties as a hereditary legislator.|$|E
