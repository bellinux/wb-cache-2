500|$|In December 1994, Antestor {{recorded}} {{their first}} full-length album titled Martyrium. Arctic Serenades Records was originally supposed to release that album, {{but because of}} unknown reasons that never happened, and the band tried to get another label to release the album. American-based label Morphine Records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of the album in 1997. In an interview, the drummer Armoth said: [...] "...we were in contact with a label called Morphine Records. But that was about signing a deal for the Martyrium album. But we never signed a contract but that guy, Burrito, made several promotapes and sold <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> illegally 'cause he didn't have a contract." [...] However, the tape copies circulated in up to fifth generation copies and their audience grew fast. Martyrium was the last album that emphasized the band's death/doom direction.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the stones}} forming {{the core of}} the pyramids were roughly cut, {{especially}} in the Great Pyramid, the material used to fill the gaps was another problem. Huge quantities of gypsum and rubble were needed. The filling has almost no binding properties, but it was necessary to stabilize the construction. To make the gypsum mortar, it had to be dehydrated by heating which requires large quantities of wood. According to Egyptologists, the findings of both the 1984 and 1995 David H. Koch Pyramids Radiocarbon Projects may suggest that Egypt had to strip its forest and scrap <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> wood <b>it</b> had to build the pyramids of Giza and other even earlier 4th Dynasty pyramids. Carbon dating samples from core blocks and other materials revealed that dates from the 1984 study averaged 374 years earlier than currently accepted and the 1995 dating averaging 100-200 years. As suggested by team members, [...] "We thought that it was unlikely that the pyramid builders consistently used centuries-old wood as fuel in preparing mortar. The 1984 results left us with too little data to conclude that the historical chronology of the Old Kingdom was wrong by nearly 400 years, but we considered this at least a possibility". To explain this discrepancy, Egyptologists proposed the [...] "old wood" [...] theory claiming the earlier dates were possibly derived from recycling large amounts of centuries old wood and other earlier materials.|$|R

The box could not have escaped his notice, because he had spread the ash thinly; he had, he thought, dug far enough into the pile to have reached it; but there was still no sign <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> This was disconcerting, and he worked until he had largely reduced the heap, and he scattered the next load so that <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> rubbish among <b>it</b> could be seen.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on March 3, 1989, it {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, journalists and academics. Taraborrelli commented that the track [...] "deserved <b>every</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the curiosity <b>it</b> generated. While being devilishly danceable, the song also shows Madonna's uncanny ability to inspire strong, conflicting emotions {{during the course of}} a single song, leaving the listener scratching his head for answers—and craving for more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, while writing about Madonna's re-invention of her image, observed how her sound had changed from the [...] "simple blaring dance-pop to the rich, fully rounded pop of 'Like a Prayer". Lucy O'Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] was Madonna's usage of liturgical words. [...] "There is the surface meaning, forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound so sweet. But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' really takes you there," [...] she concluded. This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that [...] "the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane. There-in lies Madonna's triumph with 'Like a Prayer'. It still sounds catchy and danceable." ...|$|R

6000|$|After all we {{got little}} of the sargasso. Only in a sailing ship, and in calms or light breezes, can its treasures be explored. [...] Twelve knots an hour is a pace {{sufficient}} to tear off the weed, as it is hauled alongside, all living things which are not rooted to it. We got, therefore, no Crustacea; neither did we get a single specimen of the Calamaries, {8} which may be described as cuttlefish carrying hooks on their arms as well as suckers, the lingering descendants of a most ancient form, which existed {{at least as far}} back as the era of the shallow oolitic seas, x or y thousand years ago. A tiny curled Spirorbis, a Lepraria, with its thousandfold cells, and a tiny polype belonging to the Campanularias, with a creeping stem, which sends up here and there a yellow-stalked bell, were all the parasites we saw. But the sargasso itself is a curious instance of the fashion in which one form so often mimics another of a quite different family. When fresh out <b>of</b> the water <b>it</b> resembles not a sea-weed so much as a sprig of some willow-leaved shrub, burdened with yellow berries, large and small; for <b>every</b> broken <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> seems growing, and throwing out ever new berries and leaves-- or what, for want of a better word, must be called leaves in a sea- weed. For it must be remembered that the frond of a sea-weed is not merely leaf, but root also; that it not only breathes air, but feeds on water; and that even the so-called root by which a sea-weed holds to the rock is really only an anchor, holding mechanically to the stone, but not deriving, as the root of a land-plant would, any nourishment from it. Therefore it is, that to grow while uprooted and floating, though impossible to most land plants, is easy enough to many sea-weeds, and especially to the sargasso.|$|R
