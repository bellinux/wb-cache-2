50|$|FRP (GRP): <b>Glass</b> <b>mats</b> in {{the form}} of chopped strand mat and woven roving is most common in hand lay-up method. These mats are laid on the mold and {{impregnated}} with 'initiated' resins like polyester, epoxy, vinyl ester, bisphenol epoxy vinyl ester, etc. The choice of resin is based on the chemical corrosion requirement of the equipment.|$|R

50|$|Deep-cycle {{lead-acid}} batteries generally {{fall into}} two distinct categories; flooded (FLA) and valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA), with the VRLA type further subdivided into two types, Absorbed <b>Glass</b> <b>Mat</b> (AGM) and Gel. The reinforcement of absorbed <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> separators helps to reduce damage caused by spilling and jolting vibrations. Further, flooded deep-cycle batteries {{can be divided into}} subcategories of Tubular-plated Opzs or flat plated. The difference generally affects the cycle life and performance of the cell. The structural difference between deep-cycle batteries and cranking batteries is in the lead battery plates. Deep cycle battery plates have thicker active plates, with higher-density active paste material and thicker separators. Alloys used for the plates in a deep cycle battery may contain more antimony than that of starting batteries. The thicker battery plates resist corrosion through extended charge and discharge cycles.|$|E

5000|$|BMW has {{developed}} the system {{such that the}} alternator is not activated most of the time. This means that electrical components in the vehicle are normally running on battery power. When the battery needs to be charged or when decelerating or braking, the alternator is activated to recharge the battery (regenerative braking). Since this battery experiences very different load characteristics than a normal car battery, BMW used an absorptive <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> type instead.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} primary types of VRLA batteries, Sealed VR wet cell, AGM and Gel. Gel cells add silica dust to the electrolyte, forming a thick putty-like gel. These are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "silicone batteries". AGM (Absorbent <b>Glass</b> <b>Mat)</b> batteries feature fiberglass mesh between the battery plates which serves to contain the electrolyte. Both designs offer advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional batteries and sealed VR wet cells, as well as each other.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Glass</b> wool <b>mat</b> {{is widely}} used {{in the fields of}} {{building}} engineering, transport facilities and refrigeration equipment. In this paper, the effect of material parameters such as density, thickness, porosity, and flow resistivity on the normal incidence absorption coefficient has been studied. In addition, fiber length is also investigated to achieve appropriate strength. The prediction error of normal incidence absorption coefficient by modified Johnson–Allard model is less than 5 % in the frequency range between 800 Hz and 5 kHz. We could use the modified Johnson–Allard model to determine the parameter of <b>glass</b> wool <b>mat</b> for better development...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{the market}} demand for {{environmentally}} friendly materials is rapidly increasing. Biodegradable fibres and biodegradable polymers mainly extracted from renewable resources {{are expected to}} be a major contribution to the production of new industrial high performance biodegradable composites, partially solving the problem of waste management. At the end of its lifetime, a structural biodegradable composite can be crushed and recycled through a controlled industrial composting process. Bodros et al. [1] showed that biodegradable PLLA (L-polylactide acid) /flax fibres mat composites exhibiting specific tensile properties equivalent to glass fibre polyester composites can be manufactured by an un-optimised film stacking process. In our study, the process has been investigated more extensively. Indeed, the compaction of flax mats requires a higher load than for <b>glass</b> <b>mats</b> of similar areal weight. The transverse permeability of flax mats has also been shown to be lower than for <b>glass</b> <b>mats.</b> In both cases, this is due to a higher degree of entanglement of the flax fibres within the mat. However, the range of permeability and compressibility values of the flax mats are well within the values that allow a good through-thethickness impregnation. Flax fibres cannot sustain long exposures at the impregnation temperature of the mats by PLLA resin. Through-the-thickness impregnation of flax mats processes such as film stacking are more suitable than in-plane impregnation processes such as Resin Transfer Molding because the flow of resin is limited on short distances and allows short times of impregnation...|$|R
25|$|In 1969, Bayer {{exhibited}} an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed <b>glass</b> <b>mats</b> into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|R
50|$|In the {{laying-up}} process, a {{layer of}} fiberglass mat is applied, and resin is applied over it. A special roller is then used to remove air bubbles. Air bubbles, if left in the curing resin, would significantly reduce {{the strength of the}} finished mold. The fiberglass spray lay-up process is also used to produce molds, and can provide good filling of corners and cavities where a <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> or weave may prove to be too stiff.|$|E
50|$|AGM {{batteries}} {{differ from}} flooded {{lead acid batteries}} in that the electrolyte is held in the glass mats, as opposed to freely flooding the plates. Very thin glass fibers are woven into a mat to increase surface area enough to hold sufficient electrolyte on the cells for their lifetime. The fibers that compose the fine <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> do not absorb nor are they affected by the acidic electrolyte. These mats are wrung out 2-5% after being soaked in acids, prior to manufacture completion and sealing.|$|E

50|$|There {{were four}} {{different}} floor plans: 8 x 8 m, 8 x 10 m, 8 x 13 m, and 8 x 16 m. The individual modules {{of the steel}} houses were assembled on site. The rectangular outer wall panels were made of 1 mm thick steel plate with a size of 1 x 2.51 m and were placed next to each other. The interior walls were made of hardboard or plywood panels, which were insulated by <b>glass</b> wool <b>mats</b> from the outer steel sheets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A hybrid {{composite}} associating natural fibers (curaua) and synthetic fibers (E-glass) {{was developed and}} investigated. The hybrid is destined for engineering applications as an alternative material to glass fiber composites, mainly in high moisture environments. Thus, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the degradation of the mechanical properties due to water absorption. The {{hybrid composite}} is formed of an orthophthalic polyester resin reinforced by layers of <b>glass</b> <b>mats</b> and continuous curaua fibers. Absorption tests were carried out and obtained the composite saturation curve for both distilled water and sea water conditions. A non-hybrid composite (just with curaua fiber), was also evaluated for comparison. The mechanical properties were evaluated through tensile and three-point-bend tests. After the mechanical tests, a fracture characteristics analysis of the tested specimens was carried out. KEY WORDS: hybrid composite, natural fiber, curaua fiber, moisture absorption...|$|R

5000|$|Using a gel {{electrolyte}} {{instead of}} a liquid allows the battery {{to be used in}} different positions without leakage. Gel electrolyte batteries for any position date from 1930s, and even in the late 1920s portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell vertical or horizontal (but not inverted) due to valve design (see third Edition of Wireless Constructor's Encyclopaedia by Frederick James Camm). In the 1970s, the valve-regulated lead acid battery (often called [...] "sealed") was developed, including modern absorbed <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> types, allowing operation in any position.|$|E
50|$|In the absorbed <b>glass</b> <b>mat</b> design, or AGM for short, {{the spaces}} between the cells is {{replaced}} by a glass fibre mat soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to keep it wet, and if the battery is punctured the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. Likewise, the mat greatly reduces evaporation, {{to the point that the}} batteries do not require periodic refilling of the water. This combination of features allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles.|$|E

40|$|F ig. 14. Change in {{discharge}} capacity vs. cycles a pasted-type lead-acid battery during deep {{charge and discharge cycles}} {{can be prevented}} by compres-sion on the positive plates with <b>glass</b> <b>mats.</b> With high compression, the structural changes in the active mass become smaller and the cycle life of the cell increases remarkably. LEAD-ACID CELL 2149 The structural change takes place due to the stress caused mainly by the volume change of the active mass during charge and discharge cycling, and con-sequently the active mass gradually expands with cycling. The rate of expansion is higher {{in the early stages of}} cycle testing. Once the coralloid structure is formed, it absorbs the stress of the volume change. It is considered that the reason why the cycle life' increases by compression is due to the suppression of structural changes in the positive active mass and the considerable suppression of the decrease in the cohesion between PbO 2 particles.
