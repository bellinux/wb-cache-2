5|$|As the {{fighting}} {{to the west}} proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the U.S. line ran <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the Union XI Corps, {{commanded}} by Major General Oliver Otis Howard, had arrived, and the Union position was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> from west to {{north of the}} town. The Confederate Second Corps under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell began a massive assault from the north, with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's division attacking across the open fields north of town. The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure, although the salient at Barlow's Knoll was overrun.|$|E
5|$|The British {{military}} finally decommissioned the fort's guns in 1906, {{although it}} remained a military establishment. It was {{included on the}} Antiquities List of 1925. The fort saw use again during World War II, when a battery of 3.7-inch heavy anti-aircraft guns was deployed there. The guns were mounted in concrete gun emplacements and deployed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> {{in and around the}} fort. The fort suffered considerable damage to its ramparts, barracks and chapel as a result of aerial bombing during the war. The fort was eventually decommissioned in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On {{each side of the}} head there are usually six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle.</b> Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, one on each side.|$|E
5|$|Having blocked Jourdan, Archduke Charles {{began moving}} troops south {{to oppose the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June. He {{received}} the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th. Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz, the archduke raced south. The last units of the Moreau's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June, though Delaborde remained guarding {{the west bank of}} the Rhine for a time. For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents. Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center. He also reorganized his army, reassigning some regiments that got lost in the confusion of the river crossing. Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle.</b> Desaix moved downstream (north), Ferino moved upstream (south) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills, ready to support either wing. The French irruption caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt.|$|E
5|$|The manus was {{composed}} merely {{of the five}} metacarpalia, which were orientated vertically and arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle.</b> Carpal bones were missing, as in other titanosaurs. Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs, these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size. In the foot, the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs, while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia. In contrast to the manus, the foot showed well developed digits and claws. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of phalanges (digit bones) beginning with the innermost digit, is 2-2-2-1-0. Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found, and besides Opisthocoelicaudia, completely preserved examples are known only from Epachthosaurus and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur, whose phalangeal formulas are 2-2-3-2-0 and 2-2-2-2-0, respectively. Of these three titanosaurs, Ophistocoelicaudia was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges, indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution. The claw of the first digit was not larger than {{than that of the}} second digit, as in other sauropods, but roughly equal in size.|$|E

5|$|Fort Donelson {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson, who {{selected}} its site and began construction in 1861. It was considerably more formidable than Fort Henry. Fort Donelson rose about 100 feet (30m) on approximately 100 acres of dry ground above the Cumberland River, which allowed for plunging fire against attacking gunboats, an advantage Fort Henry did not enjoy. The river batteries included twelve guns: ten 32-pounder smoothbore cannons, two 9-pounder smoothbore cannons, a 8-inch howitzer, a 6.5-inch rifle (128-pounder), and a 10-inch Columbiad. There were three miles (5km) of trenches <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> around the fort and {{the small town of}} Dover. The outer works were bounded by Hickman Creek to the west, Lick Creek to the east, and the Cumberland River to the north. These trenches, located on a commanding ridge and fronted by a dense abatis of cut trees and limbs stuck into the ground and pointing outward, were backed up by artillery and manned by Buckner and his Bowling Green troops on the right (with his flank anchored on Hickman Creek), and Johnson/Pillow on the left (with his flank near the Cumberland River). Facing the Confederates, from left to right, were Smith, Lew Wallace (who arrived on February 14), and McClernand. McClernand's right flank, which faced Pillow, had insufficient men to reach overflowing Lick Creek, so it was left unanchored. Through the center of the Confederate line ran the marshy Indian Creek, this point defended primarily by artillery overlooking it on each side.|$|E

25|$|The church, {{with the}} {{adjoining}} convent, {{was built in}} 1500. Restored several times, it maintains a baroque aspect. The exterior facade presents a staircase <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> that allows {{to come into the}} convent, where there are still some frescoes, sadly very faded. Inside the church are works of Cristoforo Santanna, Francesco De Mura and other valuable paintings by unknown author, and very precious sculptures in wood and marble.|$|E

25|$|Thales is {{the first}} known {{individual}} to use deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to his theorem, and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Indian and Babylonian mathematicians knew his theorem for special cases before he proved it.

25|$|Students usually sit at tables, not desks (usually two at one table), {{sometimes}} arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> {{or another}} geometric or functional shape. During exams in classrooms, {{the tables are}} sometimes arranged in columns with one pupil per table (if permitted by the room's capacities) {{in order to prevent}} cheating; at many schools, this is only the case for some exams in the two final years of school, i.e. some of the exams counting for the final grade on the high school diploma.|$|E

25|$|Offering 4 {{consists}} of sixteen male figurines positioned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> {{in front of}} six jade celts, perhaps representing stelae or basalt columns. Two of the figurines were made from jade, thirteen from serpentine, and one of reddish granite. This granite figurine one was positioned with its back to the celts, facing the others. All of the figurines had similar classic Olmec features including bald elongated heads. They had small holes for earrings, their legs were slightly bent, and they were undecorated– unusual if the figurines were gods or deities– but instead covered with cinnabar.|$|E
25|$|Every Greek {{town had}} an open-air theatre. These {{were used for}} both public {{meetings}} as well as dramatic performances. The theatre was usually set in a hillside outside the town, and had rows of tiered seating set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>semicircle</b> around the central performance area, the orchestra. Behind the orchestra was a low building called the skênê, which served as a store-room, a dressing-room, and also as a backdrop to the action {{taking place in the}} orchestra. A number of Greek theatres survive almost intact, the best known being at Epidaurus, by the architect Polykleitos the Younger.|$|E
25|$|Williamsburg {{is located}} {{adjacent}} to Interstate 64 and U.S. Route 60, which connect {{the city with}} Richmond to the northwest and Norfolk to the southeast.

State Route 31 provides a route to Jamestown and the toll-free Jamestown Ferry. The Colonial Parkway provides a bucolic low-speed link to Jamestown and Yorktown, passing under Colonial Williamsburg in a tunnel. With the exception of buses, commercial vehicles are not allowed on the Parkway.|$|E
