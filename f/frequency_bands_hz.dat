40|$|A {{strategy}} is devised for a semi-coherent cross-correlation {{search for a}} young neutron star in the supernova remnant SNR 1987 A, using science data from the Initial LIGO and/or Virgo detectors. An astrophysical model for the gravitational wave phase is introduced which describes the star's spin down {{in terms of its}} magnetic field strength B and ellipticity ϵ, instead of its frequency derivatives. The model accurately tracks the gravitational wave phase from a rapidly decelerating neutron star under the restrictive but computationally unavoidable assumption of constant braking index, an issue which has hindered previous searches for such young objects. The theoretical sensitivity is calculated and compared to the indirect, age-based wave strain upper limit. The age-based limit lies above the detection threshold in the <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> 75 <b>Hz</b> ≲ν≲ 450 Hz.

By using a passive enclosure with two open ends and fiberglass inner surface, a three-dimensional noise radiation problem of the engine noise is shaped to a simple problem of noise radiation from the open ends above 200 Hz. Below 200 Hz where the transmission loss of the lightweight enclosure is low, a spatial global active noise control (ANC) system is constructed inside the enclosure. To improve the performance of the system, the open ends are divided into four equal diameter size ducts each followed by a louver. A single channel ANC system is set up in each duct to eliminate the noise in the frequency range from 200 Hz to 400 Hz.
