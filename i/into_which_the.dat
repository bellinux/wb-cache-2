5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor investigates, {{he realizes}} that alien energy lifeforms were beamed onto the ship within the {{containment}} field <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> protostar samples were transported. The missing crew members have been converted to energy by the lifeforms from the protostar, presumably as hostages in retaliation for Voyagers actions. The Doctor releases the energy lifeforms on the holodeck; in kind, the missing crew are returned to their original forms. Afterwards, upon reflection, the Doctor decides not to keep the name Schweitzer, as his memories associated with it are too painful.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E

5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E

The majority, willing to accept an alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by Goukouni Oueddei. The latter group soon renamed itself People's Armed Forces (FAP).|$|E
5|$|Sharks and {{rays are}} basal fish with {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering which would make it possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E

5|$|The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking {{on its back}} and a greyish-brown rump and tail.

The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree <b>into</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E
