6000|$|... "There was no nastiness, and no beastliness, and no {{drunkenness}} about it. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> I went that I wouldn't take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our sailing, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> is {{day after}} to-morrow. But {{one of the}} other lines has a sailing to-morrow, at nine P. M." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out with it, my boy, {{how much}} do you want? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> I'd be your friend, and what Phil Newell says he means, every trip." ...|$|E

60|$|Judge Hale. To whom he said, Woman, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> {{could do}} thee no good; {{because they have}} taken that for a {{conviction}} which thy husband spoke at the sessions: and unless there be something done to undo that, I can do thee no good.|$|R
6000|$|... "It IS {{considered}} rather heretical in some quarters," [...] admitted Gilbert, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>before</b> <b>you</b> took it, Miss Cornelia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> you're a liar,' said Jonas, coolly. 'You'll {{stay here}} till I give you leave to go. Now, keep where you are, will you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want any, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> not {{to speak}} to me!" [...] {{she said in a}} low voice, and the tears almost came into her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{cold day}} to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my gray hairs." [...] They hung down to his shoulders, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> are in {{love with}} her, and yet you can't make her out; that's just where I was with regard to Madame de Salvi." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Foy, nay," [...] {{interposed}} Arentz, [...] "do not put it thus. Doubtless {{there is}} some mistake, and have <b>I</b> not <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> that <b>you</b> are over rash of tongue?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is that. I knew <b>you</b> <b>before</b> Graham did, {{and loved}} you quite as soon. I believe--though of course I don't mean to ask any questions--but <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so <b>before</b> he ever did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have not}} said that I am one, Judge Temple. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> say nothing egotistical. But a {{discovery}} has been made, {{and you are}} deeply interested in it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{have thought}} that a girl of {{eighteen}} would have wanted all these things,--a new corkscrew, for instance,--but if she does, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> you must get them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All {{this sort}} of talk," [...] cried the barber, still unmollified, [...] "is, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once <b>before,</b> not in my line. In a few minutes I shall shut up this shop. Will you be shaved?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was {{different}} when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> meant to stick to it, and I was determined that the governor should give way. But you couldn't know that. Mother and the girls were all against us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please don't be foolish," [...] she said, [...] "I cannot marry you; I {{can never}} marry <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> must please {{put it out}} of your head.

6000|$|... "I know," [...] she answered, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> how <b>I</b> {{feel about}} {{arriving}} in England.

6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped now," [...] said Lord Marchmont; [...] "but I wish <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> Selina.

6000|$|... "Buckle on your sword, lad, {{and leave}} your purse behind you. A fire ever attracts thieves and cut-throats, who flock round {{in hopes of}} {{stealing}} something in the confusion. Besides, as <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> <b>you</b> should never go out after dark without your sword, even were it but to cross the road." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You will see, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> Miss Delora," [...] he said, [...] "that {{there is}} no one here. Your uncle's rooms open out from the right. The {{bathroom}} is to the left there, and beyond are your apartments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "However {{these remarks}} {{do not apply}} to you and me, for as <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once <b>before</b> in that cedar wood in Kendah Land where you feared lest I should catch a chill, or become--odd again, it is another you with whom {{something}} in me seems to be so intimate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For several reasons, Virginie. <b>I</b> {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before,</b> {{but there is}} no reason why you should not know now, that Victor is still in Paris." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arnold," [...] she {{answered}} gravely, [...] "I can only repeat what <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>before.</b> <b>You</b> are interfering in greater concerns {{than you know}} of.
