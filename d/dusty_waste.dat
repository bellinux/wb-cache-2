[p.417]During {{the night}} three of Shaykh Hamid's brothers, who had entered as Muzawwirs with the Hajj, came {{suddenly}} to the house: they leaped off their camels, and lost {{not a moment}} in going through the usual scene of kissing, embracing, and weeping bitterly for joy. I arose in the morning, and looked out from {{the windows of the}} Majlis. The Barr al-Manakhah, from a <b>dusty</b> <b>waste</b> dotted with a few Badawi hair-tents, had assumed all the various shapes and the colours of a kaleidoscope. The eye was bewildered by the shifting of innumerable details, in all parts totally different from one another, thrown confusedly together in one small field; and, however jaded with sight-seeing, it dwelt with delight upon the variety, the vivacity, and the intense picturesqueness of the scene. In one night had sprung up a town of tents of every size, colour, and shape; round, square, and oblong; open and closed,-from the shawl-lined and gilt-topped pavilion of the Pasha, with all the luxurious appurtenances of the Harim, to its neighbour the little dirty green [...] "rowtie" [...] of the tobacco-seller. They were pitched in admirable order: here ranged in a long line, ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and analyse the current environmental health status of a children’s centre in Mongolia, and propose a stepwise series of improvements that are cost-effective, sustainable, and beneficial to the community. The children’s centre cares for abandoned children, in the coldest capital in the world. With no basic environmental health infrastructure, this socio-economically disadvantaged child population is at significant risk of poorer health outcomes and chronic diseases in adulthood when exposed to these environmental hazards. Limited resources, overcrowding, unimproved water sources, poor quality pit latrines {{and a lack of}} hygiene education have lead to poor environmental health indicators, including respiratory disease, infectious diarrhoea and skin complaints. The yard is <b>dusty,</b> <b>waste</b> disposal is unregulated, and inefficient stoves lead to high fuel costs and indoor air pollution. Solutions in the children’s centre must be simple to implement, suitable for the environment of Mongolia and appropriate for a child population, as well as being cost effective and maintainable. Most important is the development of a safe, on-site water source and upgrading of the simple pit latrines. Other suggestions include modification of health-related behaviour, renewable energy sources, improved heating systems and waste disposal...|$|E
50|$|Growing {{up in the}} <b>dusty</b> <b>wastes</b> of the Swartland, sold from orphanage into {{child labour}} on the farms, and later to a rural undertaker, Twist finally takes his fate {{into his own hands}} and escapes to Cape Town. Wide eyed at the wonders of the city, he falls in with Fagin - an ancient Ethiopian, Rastafarian, who runs a network of child thieves. His new friend Dodger teaches him the tricks of the trade, but the inexperienced Twist is caught trying to steal from Ebrahim Bassedien.|$|R
