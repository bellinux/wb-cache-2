TLR-4 is stimulated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and recruits neutrophils (PMN) which are important leukocytes to eliminate these bacteria.

As a neutrophil serine protease, was first identified as <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> that acts intracellularly to degrade ingested host pathogens and extracellularly in the breakdown of ECM components at inflammatory sites. It localizes to Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), via its high affinity for DNA, an unusual property for serine proteases. Transcript variants utilizing alternative polyadenylation signals exist for this gene. Cathepsin G was also found to exert broad-spectrum antibacterial action against Gram-negative and -positive bacteria independent of the function mentioned above. Other functions of cathepsin G have been reported, including cleavage of receptors, conversion of angiotensin Ⅰ to angiotensin Ⅱ, platelet activation, and induction of airway submucosal gland secretion. Potential implications of the enzyme in blood-brain barrier breakdown was also found.|$|E

Furthermore, the length of the filamentous bacteria could have a stronger attachment to the epithelial cells, with an increased number of adhesins participating in the interaction, making even harder the work for (PMN). The interaction between phagocyte cells and adopting filamentous-shape bacteria provide an advantage to their survival. In this relate, filamentation could be not only a virulence, but also a resistance factor in these bacteria.|$|E

While all of the viral gene products are involved in ultimately reaching this dramatic infection endpoint, this review focuses on two particular types of baculovirus-encoded proteins: <b>degradative</b> <b>enzymes</b> and protease inhibitors. Neither {{of these types of}} proteins is commonly found in other virus families, but they both play important roles in baculovirus infection.

40|$|The {{antiviral}} {{strategy of}} capsid-targeted viral inactivation (CTVI) {{was designed to}} disable newly produced virions by fusing a Gag or Gag-Pol polyprotein to a <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> (e. g., a nuclease or protease) that would cause the <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> to be inserted into virions during assembly. Several new experimental approaches have been developed that increase the antiviral effect of the CTVI strategy on retroviral replication in vitro. A Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) Gag-Escherichia coli RNase HI fusion has a strong antiviral effect when used prophylactically, inhibiting the spread of Mo-MLV and reducing virus titers 1, 500 - to 2, 500 -fold. A significant (approximately 100 -fold) overall improvement of the CTVI prophylactic antiviral effect was produced by a modification in the culture conditions which presumably increases the efficiency of delivery and expression of the Mo-MLV Gag fusion polyproteins. The therapeutic effect of Mo-MLV Gag-RNase HI polyproteins {{is to reduce the}} production of infectious Mo-MLV up to 18 -fold.

We have studied the modulation of the endocannabinoid system after a spinal cord contusion in rats. In early stages, lesion induced increases of anandamide and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) levels, an upregulation of the synthesizing enzyme NAPE-phospholipase D and a downregulation of the <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> FAAH. In delayed stages, lesion induced increases in 2 -arachidonoylglycerol and a strong upregulation of the synthesizing enzyme DAGL-α, that is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and immune infiltrates. The <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> MAGL was also moderately increased but only 7  days after the lesion. We have studied the cellular targets for the newly formed endocannabinoids using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry against CB 1 and CB 2 receptors. We observed that CB 1 was constitutively expressed by neurons and oligodendrocytes and induced in reactive astrocytes. CB 2 receptor was strongly upregulated after lesion, and mostly expressed by immune infiltrates and astrocytes. The endocannabinoid system may represent an interesting target for new therapeutical approaches to spinal cord injury. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{maximize}} the biodegradation of the commercial chlorinated paraffin Cereclor S 52 using an axenic culture of Pseudomonas sp. 273. Tests of the adherence of growing cultures to hydrocarbon substrates showed differences between Cereclor S 52 and a readily degradable chlorinated alkane, 1, 10 -dichlorodecane (DCD). In the bioreactor, Cereclor S 52 was degraded by up to 73 % by means of multiple additions of DCD. This is indicative of an upper limit for the degradation of Cereclor S 52 in this system.

40|$|The DegS-DegU protein kinase-response {{regulator}} pair {{controls the}} expression of genes encoding degradative enzymes {{as well as other}} cellular functions in Bacillus subtilis. Both proteins were purified. The DegS protein was autophosphorylated and shown to transfer its phosphate to the DegU protein. Phosphoryl transfer to the wild-type DegU protein present in crude extracts was shown by adding 32 P-labeled DegS to the reaction mixture. Under similar conditions, the modified proteins encoded by the degU 24 and degU 31 alleles presented a stronger phosphorylation signal compared with that of the wild-type DegU protein. This may suggest an increased phosphorylation of these modified proteins, responsible for the hyperproduction of degradative enzymes observed in the degU 24 and degU 31 mutants. However, the degU 32 allele, which also leads to hyperproduction of degradative enzymes, encodes a modified DegU response regulator which seems not to be phosphorylatable. The expression of the hyperproduction phenotype of the degU 32 mutant is still dependent on the presence of a functional DegS protein. DegS may therefore induce a conformational change of the degU 32 -encoded response regulator enabling this protein to stimulate <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis. Two alleles, degU 122 and degU 146, both leading to deficiency of <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis, seem to encode phosphorylatable and nonphosphorylatable DegU proteins, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{cellular}} differentiation encompasses many vital parts of biology and medicine. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are essential and ubiquitous macromolecules {{associated with the}} cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) {{of a wide range}} of cells and tissues. Heparan sulfate chains (HS) of HSPG bind and sequester a multitude of extracellular ligands, including growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, and lipoproteins. Enzymatic degradation of HS is therefore involved in processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Heparanase (HPSE- 1) is an HS <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> associated with inflammation and lipid metabolism and is a critical molecular determinant in cancer metastasis. The enzyme acts as an endo-beta-D-glucuroniclase, which degrades HS at specific intrachain sites, resulting in HS fragments of discrete molecular weights that retain biological function. HPSE- 1 's relevance as the only example of cloned/purified mammalian HS <b>degradative</b> <b>enzyme</b> led us to investigate its functionality in human olfactory epithelium (HOE) cells as a paradigm for HPSE- 1 's roles in neural cell differentiation.

Our data suggest that an augmented HPSE- 1 activity may represent a physiological mechanism involved in neural cellular differentiation. (C) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|How {{pathogenic}} bacteria infect {{and kill}} their host is currently widely investigated. In comparison, {{the fate of}} pathogens {{after the death of}} their host receives less attention. We studied Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) infection of an insect host, and show that NprR, a quorum sensor, is active after death of the insect and allows Bt to survive in the cadavers as vegetative cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NprR regulates at least 41 genes, including many encoding <b>degradative</b> <b>enzymes</b> or proteins involved in the synthesis of a nonribosomal peptide named kurstakin.

In this study, {{the impact of}} an acidic extracellular environment on lysosome size, number, and distance from the nucleus in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and breast cancer cells of different degrees of malignancy was characterized because the physiological microenvironment of tumors is frequently characterized by extracellular acidity. An acidic extracellular pH (pHe) resulted in a distinct shift of lysosomes from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery irrespective of the HMECs' degree of malignancy. With decreasing pH, larger lysosomal vesicles were observed more frequently in highly metastatic breast cancer cells, whereas smaller lysosomes were observed in poorly metastatic breast cancer cells and HMECs. The number of lysosomes decreased with acidic pH values. The displacement of lysosomes to the cell periphery driven by extracellular acidosis may facilitate exocytosis of these lysosomes and increase secretion of <b>degradative</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Filopodia formations, which were observed more frequently in highly metastatic breast cancer cells maintained at acidic pHe, may also contribute to invasion...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} osmotic shock, {{which has been}} used to release <b>degradative</b> <b>enzymes</b> from Escherichia coli, can be applied {{successfully}} to other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Cyclic phosphodiesterase (3 ′-nucleotidase), 5 ′-nucleotidase (diphosphate sugar hydrolase), acid hexose phosphatase, and acid phenyl phosphatase are released from Shigella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia strains. Some strains of Salmonella also release these enzymes. Members of Proteus and Providencia groups fail to release enzymes when subjected to osmotic shock and do not show a lag in regrowth, although they do release their acid-soluble nucleotide pools. In contrast to E. coli, release of enzymes from other members of the Enterobacteriaceae studied is affected by growth conditions and strain of organism. None of the organisms was as stable to osmotic shock in exponential phase of growth as was E. coli. Exponential-phase cells of Shigella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter could be shocked only with 0. 5 mm MgCl 2 to prevent irreparable damage to the cells.
