Data for this mixed-method research were obtained from questionnaires, interviews, observation, <b>documents</b> <b>sampling,</b> field notes (Creswell 2009). Questionnaires were administered physically. In-depth face to face interviews using structured and semi structured questionnaires were undertaken for the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. <b>Document</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>involved</b> the search and review of documents about the subject under investigation (Yin 1994).

It is dividend into two main parts: a) theoretical introduction to detect biological relationship at skeletal remains; b) practical verification of the biological kinship of individuals within genealogically <b>documented</b> <b>sample</b> and the anonymous <b>sample.</b> Genealogically <b>documented</b> <b>sample</b> consists of the remains of thirty seven members of related Andres, Cvrček, Vávra, Palma and Mizera families {{in the range of}} four generations in the years 1895 - 2006. The biological kinship is verified using several approaches: analysis of skeletal non-metric traits, analysis of non-metric dental traits, and assesment of morphological and metric similarities of frontal sinuses (sinus frontalis). Certain pathological conditions on the skeleton are taken into account as well. The degree of similarity between individuals from genealogically <b>documented</b> <b>sample,</b> recorded on the basis of skeletal non-metric traits, is further compared with the degree of similarity between randomly selected individuals from the early medieval Frankish necropolis Cherboug-Notre-Dame (7 th - 11 th centuries).

40|$|Abstract From {{a machine}} {{learning}} standpoint, the PAN 2012 Lab contest had one major challenge. In all authorship attribution tasks, {{the number of}} training documents was extremely low. We extended our previous work, in which com-pression distances to randomly selected prototype documents from the training corpus were used as feature representation. A supervised multi-class classifier was learned in the resulting feature space using the remaining documents. In-spired by the bootstrapped resampling method, we now drew <b>document</b> <b>samples</b> from the few source documents {{in order to obtain}} sufficient prototypes and sam-ples to learn a supervised classifier. Using internal validation, we tuned the size of the <b>document</b> <b>samples,</b> compression method, distance measure, classification method, and decision threshold (open-class tasks) for optimal F 1 score. With this scheme we submitted for the closed-class and open-class author identification tasks. In the overall results for these tasks we achieved a shared fourth ranking, based on the reported average recall of the 11 teams...|$|R

In this paper, we present a method for acquiring the generic model for a document class from <b>document</b> <b>samples</b> belonging to this class. Our method is based on Inference of Tree Grammars and combination of generic constructors of type ODA.

Metasearchers are helpful tools for searching over multiple such “hidden-web” text databases at once through a unified query interface.
