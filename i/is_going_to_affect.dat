So far as I can, I get back to the simple animal existence, where sun and air and food are the never-failing pleasures. I try to forget that I am a pursuer of criminals. I return to my work in the city, as I say, because it helps to keep my appetite for the rural things. I can't afford to let silence and green trees pall upon me. If I were a little more of a believer," [...] he smiled, [...] "I would say that you and your mother had been sent to me, for of late I have been in a deeper slough of despair {{than at any time since}} the death of my wife.

5000|$|Writing for the Press Gazette, Dominic Ponsford criticised Stop Funding Hate and its campaigners for {{encouraging}} people to influence the content of newspapers they don't read themselves, and raised concerns about advertisers influencing the content of newspapers.

In Spiked, Naomi Firsht described the campaign as [...] "entirely about censorship", arguing that consumers should simply not buy newspapers if they disagree with their content.

If it's in the groove, obviously, that becomes a safety issue, we're going to throw the caution each and every time when that happens. If someone would have run over that and it affected a tire and that driver had an incident, we'd be hearing it on the other end as well. That's something we've got to deal with it. That's our job to make the call. We will always {{err on the side of}} safety if we see something out there and can't confirm that it's moving or not.

Following the race, Richard Buck, director of competition for the Sprint Cup Series, met with the media to address a few of the late race calls.

50|$|When {{communicating}} with another person, individuals {{take into account}} the listener’s feelings. People acknowledge how their intended action <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the feelings of the other person. The concern the speaker displays for the hearer relates to what the speaker feels is necessary in order to help the hearer maintain positive self images. Positive face, identity goals, and “concern with support” are three labels that help determine {{the degree to which a}} strategy shows consideration for the hearer’s feelings. When a person requests an explicit action, it possesses a higher chance of hurting the listener’s feelings. On the other hand, {{communicating with}} a hint sends a more implicit message, thus, delivering the message successfully. Compared to task-oriented constraints, social relational constraints stress concern for others by withdrawing from injuring the hearer’s feelings. They are strongly concerned with how their communication may affect the hearer’s and reflect on their concern to successfully accomplish these communicative goals. Some of these communicative goals affect the hearer’s still, thus, threatening their autonomy. It has been found that “collectivism influences the importance members of cultures place on relational concerns in conversation” (Kim, 1995). Therefore, members of this culture place more emphasis on face-supporting behaviors, such as avoiding harming the other’s feelings than when members are pursuing goals. Compared to members of individualistic cultures, these members “have higher thresholds for face support and select strategies to maximize face support” (Kim, 1995). Individuals who highlight interdependent self-construals want to avoid face loss as much as possible and want to feel welcomed by particular social groups. These individuals see avoiding hurt feelings as more significant than individuals who use independent self-construals. Individuals who are more feminine and need more approval than others tend to put more focus on the concern for others than more dominant individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Sagan {{affects the}} way {{everyone}} races. He {{is the best}} bike rider in the world. What <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> how people race is how well or not he is going. Matt White Sagan began the 2017 season at the Tour Down Under where he finished in second place on stages 3, 4 and 6. [...] After training {{for the next few}} weeks, Sagan finished in second place at the 2017 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad to Olympic Road Race Champion Greg Van Avermaet. [...] The following day, Sagan attacked the breakaway in the final few hundred meters to take his first victory of the season at Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne. This also marked the first ever victory for the new Bora-Hansgrohe cycling team, and was Sagan's 90th win of his career. [...] Sagan entered the 2017 Strade Bianche as a race favorite, but following a crash roughly 75 km into the race, he abandoned 20 km later citing illness. Sagan claimed he possibly needed stitches to his hand following that crash and would hope to be ready for the start of his next race later in the week. [...] Sagan achieved his second victory of the season by sprinting to the line ahead of the pack in Stage 3 of Tirreno-Adriatico. [...] Two days later, Sagan sprinted to another victory in Stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico following a steep climb against a number of general classification opponents. The next day, he took second place to Colombian sprinter Fernando Gaviria and secured the Red Jersey of the Points Classification. [...] During the final time trial stage of the race, Sagan narrowly avoided injury by swerving out of the way when a woman and her dog abruptly crossed his path. He made light of the situation prior to the podium ceremony.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel tool, called S-Check, for {{identifying}} performance bottlenecks in parallel and networked programs. S-Check is a highly-automated sensitivity analysis tool for programs that extends benchmarking and conventional profiling.

This analysis is a sophisticated comparison that catches interactions arising from shared resources or communication links.

In practice, S-Check code analysis yields faster parallel programs. A case study compares and contrast...|$|R
