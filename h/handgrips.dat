Design: A criterion standard comparison study. Setting: A university campus in the Netherlands. Participants: Fifty-six healthy subjects (30 men, 26 women; mean age, 30 y; range, 19 - 60 y) voluntarily participated. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Maximal <b>handgrip</b> strength for the self-selected and non-self-selected <b>handgrip</b> position of the hand dynamometer (positions 2 or 3), while sitting and while standing. Results: The self-selected <b>handgrip</b> position resulted in the highest mean maximal grip strength compared with the non-self-selected <b>handgrip</b> strength, both for sitting (mean difference, 2. 3 kg; Pless than or equal to. 001) and for standing (mean difference, 2. 1 kg; Pless than or equal to. 001).

J Strength Cond Res 27 (3) : 616 - 623, 2013 -This {{study examined the}} development of peak <b>handgrip</b> strength from childhood to adulthood in wrestlers (n = 122) and nonathlete controls (n = 122). The effect of hand preference on <b>handgrip</b> strength {{and the relationship of}} anthropometrical characteristics with <b>handgrip</b> strength in wrestlers and controls were also evaluated. Participants were assigned into age groups: children, young adolescents, late adolescents, and adults. Body height and mass, hand dimensions (length, span, and width), and absolute <b>handgrip</b> (in kilograms) were measured. <b>Handgrip</b> strength was similar in wrestlers and controls in the younger age groups (i. e., in children and young adolescents), whereas late adolescent and adult wrestlers exhibited significantly greater peak <b>handgrip</b> strength (p < 0. 05) than their control peers. Nonathletes older than 15 years demonstrated an approximately 10 % greater peak <b>handgrip</b> strength (p < 0. 05) with their preferred hand compared with the nonpreferred hand. In contrast, late adolescent and adult wrestlers exhibited similar <b>handgrip</b> strength with both hands. Peak <b>handgrip</b> strength exhibited a significant linear correlation with all the anthropometric measures examined; however, a higher percentage in the variation in peak <b>handgrip</b> strength was explained by body height and hand length than the other anthropometric variables in both groups. In conclusion, wrestlers exhibit a sport-specific pattern of <b>handgrip</b> strength changes during the developmental years. Body height and hand length exhibited the strongest correlations with <b>handgrip</b> strength during the developmental years in wrestlers and in controls. The training adaptations of wrestling resulted in symmetrical <b>handgrip</b> strength development in both hands at late adolescence and adulthood.

METHODS: The sample included 288 consecutive elderly men (n= 93) and women (n= 195). Functional capacity was measured using the TUG test, and muscle strength was measured based on <b>handgrip.</b> Moreover, as a measure of current health status, PEF was evaluated. Linear regression procedures were performed to analyze the relationships between <b>handgrip</b> and both PEF and TUG test results, with adjustment for confounders, and to identify the possible mediating role of PEF in the association between <b>handgrip</b> strength and TUG test results. RESULTS: In men, <b>handgrip</b> strength was associated with both PEF and TUG performance (p< 0. 01). After adjustment for PEF, the relationship between <b>handgrip</b> strength and TUG performance remained significant. In women, <b>handgrip</b> strength was also associated with both PEF and TUG performance (p< 0. 01).

60|$|First a word {{as to the}} Italian soldier. He is a type {{by himself}} which differs from the earnest {{solidarity}} of the new French army, and from the businesslike alertness of the Briton, and yet has a very special dash and fire of its own, covered over by a very pleasing and unassuming manner. London has not yet forgotten Durando of Marathon fame. He was just such another easy smiling youth as I now see everywhere around me. Yet there came a day when a hundred thousand Londoners hung upon his every movement--when strong men gasped and women wept at his invincible but unavailing spirit. When he had fallen senseless in that historic race on the very threshold of his goal, so high was the determination within him, that while he floundered on the track like a broken-backed horse, with the senses gone out of him, his legs still continued to drum upon the cinder path. Then when by pure will power he staggered {{to his feet and}} drove his dazed body across the line, it was an exhibition of pluck which put the little sunburned baker straightway among London's heroes. Durando's spirit is alive to-day, I see thousands of him all around me. A thousand such, led by a few young gentlemen of the type who occasionally give us object lessons in how to ride at Olympia, make no mean battalion. It has been a war of most desperate ventures, but never once has there been a lack of volunteers. The Tyrolese are good men--too good to be fighting in so rotten a cause.

While <b>handgrip</b> strength {{is determined by}} lifestyle through nutrition and physical activity, it has almost exclusively been studied in western populations with a sedentary lifestyle. This study aims to investigate the relation between <b>handgrip</b> strength, ageing and mortality in a population characterised by a predominance of malnutrition and manual labour. Design: a population-based longitudinal study. Setting: a traditional African rural population in Ghana. Subjects: nine hundred and twenty-three community-dwelling individuals aged 50 and older. Methods: demographic characteristics were registered. At baseline, height, body mass index (BMI) and <b>handgrip</b> strength were measured and compared with those in a western reference population. Survival of the participants was documented {{during a period of}} up to 2 years. Results: <b>handgrip</b> strength was dependent on age, sex, height and BMI. Compared with the western reference population, <b>handgrip</b> strength was lower due to a lower height and BMI but declined over age similarly.

The isometric <b>handgrip</b> task is one such measure. The current study examined correlates of <b>handgrip</b> persistence using data drawn from a larger randomized controlled trial. <b>Handgrip</b> persistence was measured both at baseline and following a physical stressor (cold pressor test). Correlations were examined between <b>handgrip</b> performance and personality traits theoretically closely linked with self-regulation: conscientiousness and neuroticism. Baseline <b>handgrip</b> performance was correlated with several measures drawn from the nomological network of self-regulation including measures of trait neuroticism, mindfulness, anxiety sensitivity, perceived stress, and positive affect, although not with trait conscientiousness. Baseline <b>handgrip</b> predicted aversiveness experienced during the physical stressor, while changes in <b>handgrip</b> performance tracked changes in implicit and explicit negative affect (i. e., affective reactivity).
