The variation of various non-dimensionalized turbulence statistics over this stability range is presented {{and the results are}} compared with observations where possible. The robustness of the model results is also assessed by comparing those from high and low resolution simulations, and by reference to a number of additional sensitivity tests. The simulation results for the variation with stability of the mean wind and temperature profiles and various similarity coefficients are presented. The large-eddy model datasets are then used to evaluate critically the performance of a number of simple closure schemes suitable for use in boundary layer parametrizations in large-scale weather forecasting and climate prediction models. The potential significance of the shortcomings of the simplest mixing length schemes is discussed, and an assessment is made of the types of closure most likely to give a significant improvement in performance without an excessive computational overhead. Results are also presented from large-eddy {{simulations of}} the baroclinic boundary layer. The effects of the shear in the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> on <b>scaled</b> turbulence statistics and the mean wind profiles are discussed.

40|$|Yearly percentiles of <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds {{serve as}} a widely used proxy for {{assessing}} past storm activity. Here, daily <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds are derived from a geographical triangle of surface air pressure measurements and are used to build yearly frequency distributions. It is commonly believed, however unproven, that the variation of the statistics of strong <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speeds describes the variation of statistics of ground-level wind speeds. This study evaluates this approach by examining the correlation between specific annual (seasonal) percentiles of geostrophic and of area-maximum surface wind speeds {{to determine whether the}} two distributions are linearly linked in general. The analyses rely on bootstrap and binomial hypothesis testing as well as on analysis of variance. Such investigations require long, homogeneous, and physically consistent data. Because such data are barely existent, regional climate model generated wind and surface air pressure fields in a fine spatial and temporal resolution are used. The chosen regional climate model is the spectrally nudged and NCEP-driven regional model (REMO) that covers Europe and the North Atlantic. Required distributions are determined from diagnostic 10 -m and <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed, which is calculated from model air pressure at sea level. Obtained results show that the variation of strong <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed statistics describes the variation of ground-level wind speed statistics. Annual and seasonal quantiles of <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed and ground-level wind speed are positively linearly related. The influence of low-pass filtering is also considered and found to decrease the quality of the linear link. Moreover, several factors are examined that affect the description of storminess through <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> speed statistics. <b>Geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> from sea triangles reflects storm activity better than <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> from land triangles.

40|$|In {{boundary}} layer modelling, the Monin-Obukhov theory {{is widely used}} to parmeterize the wind proﬁles and the momentum ﬂuxes. During the IPY-THORPEX campaign at Andøya at 3. March 2008, a ﬂight was made across an arctic front, dropping several sondes to measure atmospheric parameters from about 7500 meters down to the surface. Due to the horizontal gradient in potential temperature, the vertical shear in the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>wind</b> was strongly reversed. This results in a low level jet with high wind velocities close to the surface. The task of this master thesis is to investigate the inﬂuence of this reversed shear on the momentum ﬂuxes in the turbulent atmospheric {{boundary layer}}. The main parameters are the wind stress τ, the drag coefﬁcient CD and the stability function φm (z/ L).

40|$|By {{arguing that}} the surface {{pressure}} field over the Arctic Ocean can be treated as an isotropic, stationary, homogeneous, Gaussian random field, Thorndike estimated a number of covariance functions from two years of data (1979 and 1980). Given the active interest in changes of general circulation quantities and indices in the polar regions during the recent few decades, the spatial correlations in sea ice velocity fields are of particular interest. It is thus natural to ask; "how persistent are these correlations?" To this end, a multi-fractal stochastic treatment is developed to analyze observed Arctic sea ice velocity fields from satellites and buoys for the period 1978 - 2015. Having previously found that the Arctic Equivalent Ice Extent (EIE) has a white noise structure on annual to bi-annual time scales, the connection between EIE and ice motion is assessed. The long-term stationarity of the spatial correlation structure of the velocity fields, and the robustness of their white noise structure on multiple time scales is demonstrated, which (a) combine to explain the white noise characteristics of the EIE on annual to biannual time scales, and (b) explain why the fluctuations in the ice velocity are proportional to fluctuations in the <b>geostrophic</b> <b>winds</b> on time <b>scales</b> of days to months.
