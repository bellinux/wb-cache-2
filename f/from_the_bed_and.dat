500|$|Helmed by Raul B. Fernandez, the {{principle}} filming {{of the video}} took place in just one day. While filming the bedroom scene for the video, Lewis fell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> injured her toe. A doctor was called on set to examine the injury, but Lewis was given the all clear and resumed filming barefoot {{for the rest of}} the video. On 29 August 2012, the official lyrics video was uploaded to Lewis' YouTube page. Two weeks later, Lewis uploaded some still images from the music video. On 14 September 2012, Lewis uploaded the official music video for [...] "Trouble" [...] to her VEVO account. Behind-the-scenes footage from the video shoot was released on 4 October 2012, and shows Lewis and Haynes filming each of the scenes with commentary from Fernandez, Haynes and Lewis.|$|E

60|$|He rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> yawned, <b>and</b> {{taking it}} in his hand, held it to the light. I watched him curiously.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, Dr. Earl Douglass {{discovered}} fossil plants, mollusks, and vertebrae at Bear Butte, {{northwest of}} Melville in Sweet Grass County's Fort Union Beds. In 1933, another fossil site called the Scarritt site opened in <b>the</b> Fort Union <b>beds.</b> By <b>the</b> {{publication of a}} 1937 paper on <b>the</b> Fort Union <b>beds</b> by George Gaylord Simpson, 57 different fossil sites were known <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> 25 were of significant quality. Among the finds were arctocyonids, insectivores, multituberculates, pantodonts, primates, and taeniodonts.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{movement}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> {{a moment later}} the Captain stood beside him.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly a {{sound was}} heard--a loud rattle. It was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> rang through the room, {{piercing}} the stillness.|$|E
60|$|Miss Roxy {{sprang up}} quickly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> turning her back began {{to arrange the}} bottles {{on the table with}} great zeal.|$|E
25|$|Williston {{published}} notable early {{observations on}} mosasaur biostratigraphy. He reported {{the first known}} mosasaur fossils <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pteranodon <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> apparent absence of Clidastes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rudistes <b>beds</b> of <b>the</b> lower chalk.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl who}} had {{conducted}} the party through the garden now began {{to lead the way}} back again, and they all followed her. As she walked along, the girl began to gather flowers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> borders, and finally made quite a pretty bouquet. When she got to the gate, and was ready to open it, she presented this bouquet in a very polite and graceful manner to Allie. Rollo took some money from his pocket, and put it into her hand; and then she opened the gate, and let them all out.|$|R
60|$|He dragged his {{portmanteau}} <b>from</b> beneath <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} pack it. When at last it was finished, he shut {{it with a}} snap. The click sounded final. He stood up, stretched himself, and sighed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who comes?" [...] she asked, {{below her}} breath, fearfully. I sprang <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> crouched, listening, by the window, and so lost {{precious}} time.|$|E
60|$|He too rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> drew up his tall lean {{figure with}} a gesture still {{expressive}} of that ruthless ambition with which Gilda had taunted him.|$|E
60|$|Thus ended that angry, fire-breathing epistle. I refolded it thoughtfully, then, {{having taken}} my resolve, I leapt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> desired Anatole to assist me to dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean, put 'em on and come! Obviously," [...] And with {{a sudden}} vehemence he dragged Bensington <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> began to dress him for his new {{impersonation}} of an elderly woman of the people.|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{facilities}} {{are a major}} source of ammonia emissions in California and the San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A program to monitor ammonia emissions using the USEPA Emission Isolation Flux Chamber began in 2006 and will continue through 2008. Data from two days of sampling in March will be discussed in this paper. Four sources within the animal housing are were evaluated which were <b>the</b> flush lane, <b>bedding,</b> feed, <b>and</b> open lot. The highest ammonia fluxes were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lowest were <b>from</b> <b>the</b> feed. Ammonia fluxes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> open lot were 3 % of previous emissions monitoring conducted at the same facility in the fall of 2004...|$|R

6000|$|The Major said {{to himself}} softly: [...] "Poor Boy! Poor, POOR devil!" [...] Then he turned away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "I want your help in this business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man doesn't {{talk about}} his own sister," [...] said Staveley, having got up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> walked to the window, [...] "and I know you don't mean anything." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} slipped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{crossed the room}} to where, on a very {{handsome}} little round table, a bottle of whisky and other appurtenances were attractively displayed.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 he {{published}} {{an account of}} the rocks and fossils of Uitenhage. He also studied many fossil reptilia <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Karroo <b>beds,</b> <b>and</b> sent specimens to the British Museum. These were described by Sir Richard Owen.|$|R

60|$|Out crept <b>the</b> {{young man}} <b>from</b> under <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> girl took the magic wand (which she found {{where the old}} man had told her), and, {{touching}} the twelve grey stones, transformed them at once into the six brothers and their brides.|$|R
60|$|Ruth made no reply. Rand descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and,</b> {{taking a}} piece of chalk from the shelf, drew a line on the floor, {{dividing}} the cabin in two equal parts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] Carrier {{revealed}} {{his teeth in}} a smile of ineffable wickedness. He slipped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> crouching slightly as if about to spring, he pointed a lean finger at his captive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it time?" [...] asked Galliard <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>And</b> {{as he put}} the {{question}} he softly thrust aside the trooper's breastplate, and set {{his hand to the}} fellow's heart. It still beat faintly.|$|E
50|$|Two-and-half {{years after}} the accident, the body of Necipoğlu was {{recovered}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> flown to Turkey. Her remains were laid to rest on 24 November 2011 in Kanlıca Cemetery, Istanbul following a religious service at the Teşvikiye Mosque.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the seven}} Clovis points {{found at the}} site, four were in place among the bones, {{including}} one with bone and teeth fragments above and below. The other three points had clearly eroded away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bone <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> were found scattered nearby." ...|$|R
50|$|The fluvial {{channelization}} {{continued for}} some time, {{and created a}} larger channel, originally {{thought to be a}} boudin. This is disproved however by channelization in the upper parts of the formation. At periods of higher sea level herein, the sandstone was covered by muddy shales and these layers are distinguishable {{due to the fact that}} they are able to grow trees. Once the normal faulting has occurred, the kerogen becomes cracked, allowing coalification to take place. Pyrite present in the system would be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> transported by <b>the</b> hydrothermal fluids as the iron(II) cation with dissolved sulfur in solution. This is the source of iron in the hydrothermal fluid.|$|R
60|$|She flung herself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{drew the}} blind. A chill, grey light {{penetrated}} the room. It {{was a little}} before five. She would go round to Phillips, wake him up. He must be told.|$|E
6000|$|FARQUHAR on {{one side}} of the bed, and TOMLINE on the other, are [...] spoken to by the dying man. The Bishop {{afterwards}} withdraws [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> comes to the landing where the others are.] ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} after this, Jackson Walters crawled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> began to don his {{clothing}} silently, but in great haste. He put on his stockings, but he placed his shoes in his coat pockets.|$|E
60|$|The {{laugh that}} {{followed}} was so cruel {{that the young}} girl shuddered. But the next moment she slipped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> erect, pale, <b>and</b> determined.|$|R
6000|$|Touching Antonio's arm he beckoned {{him in that}} direction. The Italian nodded, and {{the party}} went into the back room. Antonio drew <b>the</b> sheets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> knotted them. Jim {{went to the window}} and looked out. As he did so there was a yell of derision from below. A score of the natives had made their way through the {{adjoining}} houses, and taken up their station from behind to cut off their retreat. It needed no words to tell those in the room what had taken place. Antonio threw down the sheets and said to his brother, [...] "Let us sally out, Joseph; the sooner it is over the better. See, the smoke is coming up through the floor already. Let us go out before we are suffocated." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{again as}} part of the project to build the lock, 29 stones <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Euston Arch were raised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{presented}} to <b>the</b> Euston Arch Trust. One stone had already been salvaged in 1994 by Dan Cruickshank, {{as part of}} a BBC Television programme called 'One Foot in the Past'.|$|R
