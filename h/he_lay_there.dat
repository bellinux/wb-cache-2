60|$|And for {{the space}} of several minutes <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> quiet, indulging his {{grotesque}} fancy.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> under the holly-tree, his face all dreamy and boyish, very unusual.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> on the lime-kiln {{till the}} sun had already set, {{and then he was}} again driven into the cabin by the cold.|$|E
6000|$|... “That he don’t!” says Case. “It was {{the trouble}} about poor Adams. The last day, when <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> dying, <b>there</b> was young Buncombe round. Ever met Buncombe?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. How bold it was! A {{young man}} couldn't have done it! Yes, he's fascinating. But how old and sad he looked, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>there</b> in the chair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that McGuire {{goes off}} <b>there</b> and <b>lays</b> {{down with his}} head in the grass and bleeds. A hem'ridge they calls it. <b>He</b> <b>lays</b> <b>there</b> {{eighteen}} hours by the watch, and they can't budge him. Then Ross Hargis, who loves any man who can lick him, goes to work and damns the doctors from Greenland to Poland Chiny; and him and Green Branch Johnson they gets McGuire into a tent, and spells each other feedin' him chopped raw meat and whisky.|$|R
60|$|The {{baby was}} staring with round {{eyes at the}} dark of the heavens. Ameera placed him in Holden's arms, and <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> without a cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not forget, my son," [...] {{he gasped}} as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> {{on the ground}} with the broken rope about his neck, nor did Jan ever forget.|$|E
60|$|And as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> a weak phantom {{mentally and}} bodily, an endless {{succession}} and recurrence of anxieties {{for which he}} could find no reassurance besieged him.|$|E
60|$|At length {{he went to}} his own cell. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>there</b> {{and slept}} peacefully till the morning. And early in the morning they came to him and the {{anaesthetic}} was given him and the operation performed.|$|R
5000|$|Alternate ending, number 2: {{also has}} Charlie getting injured when Ned backs into him, but as <b>he</b> <b>lays</b> <b>there,</b> <b>he</b> recalls {{a day in}} Renata’s bar with Vic, when Vic asks Renata if she ever {{performs}} nude for her customers, as Charlie is curious. Renata asks Charlie if that’s what he wants, and he replies, ‘Gosh, only if you want to.’ She admonishes them to go home, but they talk a bit, and then Charlie pitches his ‘idea’ to Vic. Charlie is then back in the present, walking away into the empty field.|$|R
6000|$|Word is gane to our nobil king, [...] In Edinburgh, {{where that}} <b>he</b> <b>lay,</b> [...] That <b>there</b> was an Outlaw in Ettricke Foreste, [...] Counted him nought, nor a' his courtrie gay.|$|R
6000|$|And long {{in peace}} <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> [...] Brooding and still and weak, [...] Smiling {{from day to}} day there [...] At {{thoughts}} he would not speak.|$|E
60|$|Raised on his elbow, <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> for a spell, {{and gazed}} and gazed, his mind running on visions which godly men have had of saints from Paradise.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> waiting, listening, wrought {{up to the}} intensest {{pitch of}} fierce passion. Every nerve was alert, every tendon strung, and every muscle {{strained}} ready for the leap.|$|E
60|$|He {{struck out}} at his adversary's face with {{tremendous}} violence. Aspel parried the blow and returned it with such good-will that Abel Bones went headlong into the dark corner whence <b>he</b> had risen,--and <b>lay</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|Afore pore Ginger {{could move}} he {{suddenly}} clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth and flung 'im on the bed. Ginger {{was like a}} child in 'is hands, although he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes <b>'e</b> was <b>laying</b> <b>there</b> with a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord off of Sam's chest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; <b>he</b> only <b>lay</b> ill <b>there</b> a {{long time}} it seems. It was a {{companion}} who died at that date. But I'll read the account to your ladyship, with your permission:-- ...|$|R
60|$|And {{what were}} the {{thoughts}} of the wicked Ujarak as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> helpless and suffering, silently watching Nunaga? We can tell, for he afterwards made a partial confession of them.|$|E
60|$|Henery Walker {{was going}} to say {{something}} bad, but 'e thought better of it, and <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> arf busting with rage, and watching Bob {{out of the corner of}} one eye.|$|E
60|$|She {{became aware}} {{that he was trying to}} force his will upon her, {{something}}, there was something he wanted, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> dark and tense. And her soul sighed in weariness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, mother, I {{will shoot}} him,' said <b>he,</b> and <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> aiming, and then aiming again, for no sooner {{was the head}} up and {{he caught sight of}} it than it was gone again. At last he got a chance and fired, and the dead body fell with a loud thud to the ground, and down went the Master Thief too, as fast as he could.|$|R
60|$|They {{paid out}} the rope through their hands. Jimmy kicked off his boots and {{plunged into the}} cauldron. He swam barely a dozen strokes before he was caught {{on the top of}} an {{incoming}} wave, tossed about like a cork and flung back upon the beach, where <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> groaning. <b>There</b> was a little murmur amongst the fisherman, who rushed to lean over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{that never}} comes on {{together}} {{with this kind}} of fit. <b>He</b> just <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> full length on a mat, while a ragged, bare-legged boy that he had picked up in the street sat in the patio, between two oleanders near the open door of his room, strumming on a guitar and singing tristes to him from morning to night. You know tristes--twang, twang, twang, aouh, hoo! Chroo, yah!" ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not know}} how long <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> but it was very late when he rose with a little shiver and went back into the hall, where he wrote a note.|$|E
60|$|He {{tried to}} rise from the couch. With all his size he was very weak now. I thrust him back with one arm. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> glaring like a lion in a trap.|$|E
60|$|Edward spurned the Italian {{away from}} him with his foot until he sprawled among the rushes, but even as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> like a wounded snake his dark eyes never left the King's face.|$|E
60|$|Men did not stir, {{they only}} stared. Accustomed {{as they were}} to death in that wild land, the suddenness of this deed {{surprised}} them. The contrast between the splendid, brutal savage who had stood before them a moment ago, and the limp, black thing going to sleep upon the ground, was strange enough to move their imaginations. <b>There</b> <b>he</b> <b>lay,</b> and <b>there,</b> over him, the smoking pistol in his hand, Meyer stood and laughed.|$|R
60|$|While he {{was thus}} engaged, the sleeper, without any {{starting}} or turning round, awoke. There {{was a kind}} of fascination in meeting his steady gaze so suddenly, which took from the other {{the presence of mind to}} withdraw his eyes, and forced him, as it were, to meet his look. So they remained staring at each other, until Mr Chester at last broke silence, and asked him in a low voice, why <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> sleeping <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 5. 'A power {{which comes}} and goes like dream, And which none can ever trace-- Heaven's light on earth--Truth's {{brightest}} beam.' [...] 395 And when <b>he</b> ceased <b>there</b> <b>lay</b> the gleam Of those words upon his face.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} in that [...] "if" [...] which went with a thrill to Frank's heart, as <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> and realised vividly that his comrade was actually dying, and that he too might die.|$|E
60|$|They {{could say}} nothing against that, so Halvor {{sat down on}} the hearth, and began to rake about among the ashes just as he had done before, when <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there</b> idling away his time.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{had never}} risen from his little bed. <b>He</b> <b>lay</b> <b>there,</b> {{listening}} to the noises in the street, quite tranquilly; not caring much how the time went, but watching it and watching everything about him with observing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Whether Mr. K., in {{applying}} the deliverance of this {{people to the}} prayer of the queen and her maids, for <b>he</b> <b>lays</b> it only <b>there,</b> be not deceitfully arguing, and do not tend to puff up that sex, to their hurt and damage! Yea whether it doth not tend to make them unruly and headstrong? But if they be more gently inclined to obedience, no thanks to Mr. K.|$|R
60|$|While {{he rushed}} up and down, {{not knowing where}} to turn, and while <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> {{crouching}} <b>there,</b> the work went briskly on indeed. When they left the Maypole, the rioters formed into a solid body, and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren. Rumour of their approach having gone before, they found the garden-doors fast closed, the windows made secure, and the house profoundly dark: not a light being visible in any portion of the building. After some fruitless ringing at the bells, and beating at the iron gates, they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre, and confer upon the course {{it would be best}} to take.|$|R
6000|$|Will Osten {{was last}} {{to give way}} to the feeling of disappointment, and last to lie down under the folds of the rude tent. He was young, and strong, and sanguine. It was hard for one in whose veins the hot blood careered so vigorously to believe in the {{possibility}} of a few days reducing him to the weakness of infancy--harder still for him to realise the approach of death; yet, when <b>he</b> <b>lay</b> meditating <b>there</b> in the silence of the calm night, a chill crept over his frame, for his judgment told him that if a merciful God did not send deliverance, [...] "the end" [...] was assuredly drawing very nigh.|$|R
