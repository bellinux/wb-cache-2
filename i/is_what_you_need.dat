AllMusic writer Tim Sendra rated the album two-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and called it [...] "exactly what a Rancid fan would expect a Rancid album to sound like, which is both a blessing and a curse." [...] He continued, [...] "The former because if classic Rancid <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to fulfill your punk rock longings, as always they deliver the requisite gutter chants, spiky attitude, and spit-covered microphones. The latter because {{at this point the}} Rancid sound can't help but feel a little too safe and sanitized, especially given the sparkling production Brett Gurewitz gives to the album. It may be a little late in the game to expect the band to do anything but give the fans exactly what they want, or what the band thinks they want, but it's not too much to ask for songs that have a bit less studio gloss and a little more fire and grit." ...|$|E

He then went to Royal Ascot for the third successive year. He ran in the same race again, which had been renamed to the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in honour of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The 1/6 favourite for the race was the Australian mare Black Caviar. Society Rock started at 8/1 and was ridden by Johnny Murtagh. He missed the start and was at the very rear of the field, but made up ground in the final furlong to finish in fifth place, about two lengths behind winner Black Caviar. After this run he was made favourite for the July Cup, which was run on heavy ground. In the race he finished in third, 6 lengths behind surprise winner Mayson. Society Rock then started the Haydock Sprint Cup at 10/1 and was ridden by Kieren Fallon. Fallon settled him in the midfield and made up ground in the last furlong and a half. He then ran on to take the lead with 75 yards to run and went on to win by ¾ length from Gordon Lord Byron, with Bated Breath a further 1¼ lengths back in third.
