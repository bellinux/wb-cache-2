5000|$|Lange Powell was the {{designer}} of the building as his partner Claude Chambers had moved to Sydney in 1915. Powell responded to the toast to [...] "The Architects and Builders" [...] at the opening ceremony. Powell went on to do further architectural work for the BAFS, such as re-furbishing the building they purchased in 1919 at 146 Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley. Powell was an eclectic architect who understood well the <b>design</b> <b>canons</b> of the styles of the Interwar period. The best known of his surviving city buildings demonstrate considerable stylistic literacy, for example, the Ann Street Masonic Temple in Ancient Classical style and St Martins Hospital in Arts and Crafts style. The design of the BAFS Building has stylistic similarities, albeit on a smaller scale, with other examples of his commercial work in the city, such as Perry House, Preston House and Exton House.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to focus on similarities and differences between architectural types and domes in various cultures, between East and West, from symbolic, formal, geometrical, material, structural standpoint. The domes are architectural structures present in every age and country of the world, they represent meanings and characteristic goals of the local culture. Sometimes the related terminology changes according to the historical and geographical context. From long time our research group deepens studies about domes in different cultures with great attention to the territory of Mediterranean Sea, in particular to Islamic domes. Some recent studies have broadened the horizons of analysis to include Russia and India. Not all the domes respect the common <b>design</b> <b>canons</b> typical of our traditional Western conception: an example are the Dagobas in Sri Lank...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{many things}} have been called Dutch design, {{starting}} with national industrial exhibitions {{in the early nineteenth}} century and continuing in the last quarter of that century with debates about what constituted a characteristically Dutch style in the applied arts and Art Nouveau. Later, similar discussions were held about the typically Dutch character of De Stijl and later Dutch industrial design. Internationally, Dutch design gained acclaim with graphic design in the 1970 s and in the 1990 s, with the Dutch organization Droog Design. Since then, unexpected things started being labelled Dutch design. In today's age of globalization, migration and multiculturalism, Dutch design operates transnationally, comprising foreign objects, subjects and practices in the Netherlands and abroad. By drawing on recent discussions on national canons and critiques of methodological nationalism, this special issue proposes alternatives for a more dynamic understanding of Dutch design and national <b>design</b> <b>canons.</b> As such, it builds on scholarship problematizing Dutch design and contributes to wider debates on the transnationalism of national design histories...|$|E

40|$|Design historians {{frequently}} {{struggle to}} place design artefacts that are {{outside of the}} realm of consumption and do not readily fit into the accepted historical <b>design</b> <b>canon.</b> This is in part due to the limitations of commonly used methodologies. This paper discusses the formulation of an alternative discursive methodology and its application to a historical study of government emblems. Discursive methodology facilitates the consideration of government emblems as simultaneously design artefacts and political symbols. It does this by contextualising the emblems within the massive changes faced by the local design industry and local government in mid- 1990 s Victoria. The research thus avoids a common criticism of design histories: the object/canon bias. Close study of the work of Foucault and Foucauldian scholars reveals the importance of his views on and approach to historical investigation for design historians. This paper discusses these theories, formulates them into a workable methodology for historical inquiry and then discusses the application of the methodology to the development of an interdisciplinary history of government emblems...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} EOS-1 {{was launched}} in 1989. It was the company's first professional-level EOS camera and was aimed at the same photographers who had used Canon's highly respected, manual focus professional FD mount SLRs, such as the Canon New F-1 and the Canon T90. On a physical level the EOS-1 resembled the T90, which had been <b>designed</b> for <b>Canon</b> by Luigi Colani. The EOS-1 had a single centrally-mounted autofocus point, plus basic weather sealing.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of SLRs now sold are digital models, even though their size, form factor, and other design elements remain derived from their 35 mm film predecessors. Whether a dedicated digital design such as the Olympus Four-Thirds system, which permits equivalent performance with smaller and lighter cameras, will ultimately supersede the film-derived <b>designs</b> from <b>Canon,</b> Nikon, Pentax, and Sony is as yet unclear. Additionally SLRs are facing a threat from the rapidly expanding mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera segment among all types of camera user.|$|R
25|$|A special form of Attic vases of {{this period}} was the Tyrrhenian amphora (550-530 BC). These were egg-shaped neck amphora with decorations {{atypical}} of the usual Attic <b>design</b> <b>canon</b> of the period. Almost all of the c. 200 surviving vases were found in Etruria. The body of the amphora is usually subdivided into several parallel friezes. The upper or shoulder frieze usually shows a popular scene from mythology. There are sometimes less common subjects, such as a unique scene of the sacrificing of Polyxena. The first known erotic images on Attic vases are also found at this vase location. The painters frequently put annotations on Tyrrhenian amphora which identify the persons shown. The other two or three friezes were decorated with animals; sometimes {{one of them was}} replaced with a plant frieze. The neck is customarily painted with a lotus palmette cross or festoons. The amphoras are quite colorful and recall Corinthian products. In this case a Corinthian form was obviously deliberately copied to produce a particular vase type for the Etruscan market, where the style was popular. It is possible that this form was not manufactured in Athens but somewhere else in Attica, or even outside Attica. Important painters were the Castellani Painter and the Goltyr Painter.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} EOS-1 {{had been}} launched in 1989, {{two years after}} the company had introduced their new EOS autofocus system. It was the company's first professional-level EOS camera and was aimed at the same photographers who had used Canon's highly regarded, manual focus professional FD mount SLRs, such as the Canon New F-1 and the Canon T90. On a physical level the EOS-1 resembled the T90, which had been <b>designed</b> for <b>Canon</b> by Luigi Colani. The EOS-1N was a revision of the EOS-1, with five autofocus points spread across the frame rather than a single centrally-mounted autofocus point, plus more effective weather sealing, a wider exposure range, and numerous other improvements. In common with the EOS-1, the 1N used Canon's A-TTL automatic flash system, and does not support the more modern E-TTL.|$|R
5000|$|Through-the-lens light {{metering}} is {{also known}} as [...] "behind-the-lens metering". In the SLR design scheme, there were various placements made for the metering cells, all of which used CdS (Cadmium sulfide) photocells. The cells were either located in the pentaprism housing, where they metered light transmitted through the focusing screen; underneath the reflex mirror glass itself, which was Topcon's design; or in front of the shutter mechanism, which was the <b>design</b> used by <b>Canon</b> with their Canon Pellix.|$|R
5000|$|EF-S 24mm 2.8 STM, {{announced}} September 2014. Unlike {{the other}} 24mm lenses, it will mount only on bodies {{that support the}} EF-S mount. It will mount on all current Canon bodies with APS-C sensors, as well as older APS-C bodies dating to the 2003 introduction of the EF-S mount (in other words, the EOS 10D and older bodies are not compatible). It will not mount on any body with a full-frame or APS-H sensor. As it is <b>designed</b> for <b>Canon</b> APS-C bodies, its field of view is equivalent to a 38mm lens on a full-frame sensor, and operates similar to the Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM pancake lens. Compared to the EF 24 2.8 IS USM, the EF-S lens loses IS, but lists for about a fourth of the price. The STM offers advantages for video shooting over USM, specifically quieter autofocus.|$|R

50|$|The {{church is}} one of the finest {{examples}} of traditional Sinhalese architecture. The church has very unusual architecture: the clergyman behind the new <b>design</b> was Reverend <b>Canon</b> Ivan Corea who was Vicar of St Luke's Church, Borella, for 25 years (1929-1954). Canon Corea started a massive building programme in the 1930s. Bishop Horsley, who was Bishop of Colombo, consecrated the church on the day of its diamond jubilee on June 30, 1941. St Luke's Church was in the forefront of missionary activity including ministering to medical professionals in Colombo. A regular service was held at 5:30 am to cater to the needs of medical professionals before they went on duty in the local hospitals.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{starting}} with the first FD lenses produced in late 1970, all FD lenses had the capability of supporting full-aperture metering and multiple Automatic Exposure (AE) modes using both shutter-preferred and aperture-preferred modes. Even Programmed AE was possible with no modifications to the lens mount, though {{at the time of}} its introduction Canon did not have an AE camera body in the FD line. This was a <b>design</b> triumph for <b>Canon</b> that no other camera or lens maker was able to equal in 1970. Every other camera manufacturer had to make one or more alterations to its lens mount to enable full aperture metering, and later AE and or Programmed AE operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion that}} there might be a template, some kind of script {{detailing}} a plan for action, which can be transferred from one research project to another, does have some appeal. Research processes, however, are not that prescriptive. Design research, furthermore, straddles very different approaches to research and will ask different kinds of questions when studying: designers in practice, aspects in design history, critical design, research as design and other fields in the <b>design</b> research <b>canon.</b> Each project will have its own research design, detailing a researcher’s reasoning in the selection and application of theory and methods in a particular way to address a specific research question. The notion then of applying a model or ‘boilerplate’ that can be universally mapped onto any research project is misleading, without oversimplifying the work that is involved in the production and presentation of knowledge (preparation of knowledge work). Design, like any other field of inquiry, is in the midst of debate in the philosophy of science. Given changes in philosophic fashion this debate is necessarily incomplete (White, 2011 p. xv). Design research it has also been argued has its own nature (Archer, 1995, Dilnot, 1998) ...|$|R
