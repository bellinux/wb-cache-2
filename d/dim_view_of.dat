One such proposal was made during the reign of Sejong the Great, but when an advisor of the court suggested that the abolition of the class would lead to government officials committing grave crimes, the king chose to preserve the kisaeng.|$|E

Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took a <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E

This is necessary in order to avoid criticism from the International Narcotics Board, which historically has taken a <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> any moves to relax official drug policy. In their annual report, the Board has criticised many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis, Australia for providing injecting rooms and the United Kingdom for proposing to downgrade the classification of cannabis, which it has since done (although this change was reversed by the Home Secretary on 7 May 2008 against the advice of its own commissioned report).|$|E

25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 20th century (post World War I) that slavery {{gradually}} became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France. Gordon describes the lack of homegrown Islamic abolition movements as owing much {{to the fact that it}} was deeply anchored in Islamic law. By legitimizing slavery and – by extension – traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery. The political and social system in Muslim society would have taken a <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> such a challenge.

5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take a <b>dimmer</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|R

There were whole plantations of uprooted trees. Close to the road, on their left, was a roofless house, and a family of children crying underneath a tarpaulin shelter. As they crept on, the wind came to them with a brackish flavour, salt with the sea. The chauffeur was gazing ahead doubtfully.|$|R
25|$|This was in {{part due}} to the German belief that the Soviets had {{insufficient}} fuel supplies, particularly oil, which would undermine Soviet armaments production. The energy resources (30 percent in the Ural-Volga region, 27 percent in Soviet Asia, and 43 percent in the Caucasus) were used to complete an enormous mechanisation program. The populations' use of fuels for lighting and general civilian needs, caused OKL to assume that the Red Army and VVS could only meet peacetime fuel allocations through restrictions. It was believed that this difficulty would continue for some time. German intelligence also had a <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Soviet logistical capabilities. It viewed the Soviet road and rail networks as incomplete, thus the supply of aviation fuel to the VVS on the frontline would be poor and would curtail Soviet air operations. It was also thought that the bulk of Soviet industry lay west of the Urals, and was thus vulnerable to capture anyway. Although aware that the Soviet Union intended to move 40 to 50 percent of its industry east of the Urals to continue production, the Germans viewed this plan as impossible to carry out. The Luftwaffe also vastly underestimated the Soviet ability to improvise.|$|E

500|$|Thirteen {{years after}} his death, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica said of Bayard that [...] "his tall dignified person, unfailing courtesy, and polished, if {{somewhat}} deliberate, eloquence made him a man of mark in all the best circles. He was considered indeed by many Americans to have become too partial to English ways; and, {{for the expression of}} some criticisms regarded as unfavorable to his own countrymen, the House of Representatives {{went so far as to}} pass... a vote of censure on him. [...] The value of Bayard's diplomacy was, however, fully recognized in the United Kingdom where he worthily upheld the traditions of a famous line of American ministers." [...] In 1929, the Dictionary of American Biography described Bayard, as a Senator, as being [...] "remembered rather for his opposition to Republican policies... than for constructive legislation of the successful solution of great problems", and said that he had [...] "the convictions of an earlier day... and was never inclined, either politically or socially, to seek popularity with the country at large." [...] Charles C. Tansill, a conservative historian, found much to praise in Bayard; he published a volume on Bayard's diplomatic career in 1940 and another about his congressional career in 1946, the only full-length biographies to appear since Bayard's death. [...] Later historians took a <b>dimmer</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Bayard's diplomatic career; in a 1989 book, Henry E.

40|$|Some adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) are not detected before marketing {{approval is}} given because clinical trials are not suited for their detection, {{for various reasons}} [5, 23]. Drug regulatory bodies therefore weigh {{the potential benefits of}} a drug against the harms and allow drugs to be marketed if felt that the potential benefits far outweigh the harms [26, 48]. Associated adverse events are subsequently monitored through various means including reports submitted by health professionals and the general public in what is commonly referred to as spontaneous reporting system (SRS) [19, 23, 69]. The resulting database contains thousands of adverse event reports which must be assessed by expert panels to see if they are bona fide adverse drug reactions, but which are not easy to manage by virtue of the volume [6]. This thesis documents work aimed at developing a statistical model for assisting in the identification of bona fide drug side-effects using data from the United States of America’s Food and Drugs Administration’s (FDA) Spontaneous Reporting System (otherwise known as the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS)) [28]. Four hierarchical models based on the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distribution [43, 78] were explored {{and one of them was}} identified as the most suitable for modeling the data. It compares favourably with the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) of DuMouchel [19] but takes a <b>dimmer</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> drug and adverse event pairs with very small observed and expected count than the GPS. Two results are presented in this thesis; the first one, from a preliminary analysis, presented in Chapter 2, shows that problems such as missing values for age and sex that militate against the optimal use of SRS data, enumerated in the literature, remain. The second results, presented in Chapter 5, concern the main focus of the research mentioned in the previous paragraph...|$|R
5000|$|These {{bilateral}} tensions were partly {{moderated by}} {{the web of}} personal relationships that the war spawned between officials in the two governments. As a result, recalled one Canadian diplomat, [...] "there developed a collaboration in international organizations so habitual that it was taken for granted by the 1950s." [...] These officials quickly discovered a mutual interest in making certain that {{the concerns of the}} small and middle powers in the postwar international system were not ignored by the great powers. Canada and Australia, however, differed on how to achieve this. For the Australian prime minister, John Curtin, the solution lay in transforming the Commonwealth into an institution that would rival the major powers in stature and influence. Canadian officials were suspicious of suggestions for closer Commonwealth consultation, which they feared might limit Canada's flexibility in dealing with the United States. Mackenzie King took an even <b>dimmer</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Curtin's ideas. Such notions, he fumed, were part of a [...] "deliberate design... to revive an imperialism which left the Dominions something less than national sovereignty" [...] and represented [...] "an attack on his personal position." [...] The difference in approach was even greater at the United Nations where Evatt enjoyed a free hand in shaping Australian policy. The outspoken and combative foreign minister preferred to attack head-on the privileges enjoyed by the great powers. At the U.N.'s founding conference in San Francisco in 1945, he stubbornly opposed every clause in the U.N.'s charter that seemed to weaken the new organization or that gave the major powers undue influence. While some Canadian officials quietly admired Evatt's determination to strengthen the U.N., most were dismayed by his confrontational tactics. As Cold War tensions reduced the likelihood that the great powers would achieve a sufficient level of cooperation to ensure the survival of the U.N., discretion seemed the greater part of valour.|$|R
