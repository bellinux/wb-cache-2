5|$|After {{the release}} of Results May Vary, Limp Bizkit joined the band Korn on a tour called the Back 2 Basics Tour. The Back 2 Basics Tour, which was {{sponsored}} by Xbox, was scheduled for November 2003. However, during a concert at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, Durst was hit by an object thrown from the crowd. Durst finished the remaining two songs of Limp Bizkit's set and after the concert, Durst had seven stitches administered by a private physician. During the end of 2003, Limp Bizkit cancelled their tour dates in Southeast Asia after there was a United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> warning of increased security threats abroad. Limp Bizkit planned to play shows in Bali, Bangkok and Manila. However, after a terrorist bombing in Istanbul, Turkey occurred, the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> issued a travel advisory, and Limp Bizkit cancelled the shows in Southeast Asia. Although they did not perform in Southeast Asia, Limp Bizkit did perform in South Korea and Japan. In January 2004, there were rumors that Limp Bizkit were going to tour with the rock band Kiss, although the band was unable to, citing scheduling conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government has made it increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Michigan <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Highways {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) {{to approve a}} Bus.

M-28 was rerouted on June 4, 1999, when the City of Ishpeming petitioned MDOT to reroute the highway along Lakeshore Drive to US41/M-28. Previously, it ran along Greenwood Street and North Lake Road and met US41/M-28 in the West Ishpeming neighborhood of Ishpeming Township.|$|E
5|$|Mexican Marines arrested Treviño Morales on 15 July 2013 in {{the state}} of Nuevo León without a single bullet being fired. At the time of his capture, the Mexican {{government}} was offering up to a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) reward for information leading to his arrest. The United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> was offering up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and conviction.

5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls {{documents}} modern human trafficking, specifically sexual slavery.

Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E

5|$|No Major League Baseball (MLB) {{team had}} played in Cuba since March 21, 1959. Castro made {{attempts}} to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba to no avail. In the 1970s, George McGovern, a United States Senator, pushed {{the idea of an}} exchange of MLB and college basketball teams as a way to bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the ping-pong diplomacy that aided US-China relations; however, this was blocked by the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E
5|$|The MSHD's successor, the Michigan <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> Highways, realigned {{the route}} of M-20 through Western Michigan in 1969. In the {{aftermath}} of the reroute, the M-20 designation was moved from Muskegon to New Era. The former routing of M-20 south of Hesperia to Muskegon was renumbered M-120, including a segment that ran concurrently with M-82. That concurrency was removed in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> maintains that Vietnam lacks an independent judiciary, {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E
