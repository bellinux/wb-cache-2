30|$|Summary (4 lines): The {{aim is to}} {{show that}} the <b>inhalation</b> <b>analgesia</b> with a 50 % nitrous oxide/oxygen premix (Kalinox®) has great {{benefits}} in Essure device insertion (less pain and better tolerance).|$|E
40|$|An air–enflurane mixture {{was used}} for <b>inhalation</b> <b>analgesia</b> in {{conscious}} patients undergoing painful procedures such as burns dressings. A preliminary study indicated that enflurane possessed definite analgesic properties, but that the concentration of the air–enflurane mixture was critical if restlessness was to be avoided and cooperation retained. Further studies established that 1 % enflurane in air provided good analgesia {{in the absence of}} anaesthesia. The analgesic effects were similar to those produced by 0. 35 % methoxyflurane in air, but were produced in a much shorter time (about 3 minutes compared with 9 to 10 minutes). Preoperative starvation was unnecessary and nausea and vomiting were absent. Details are given of the use of enflurane analgesia in 32 conscious burned patients who underwent 101 burns dressing procedures...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{ascertain}} patients' attitudes towards planned induction and labour. Twenty per cent of patients had not heard of induction before their pregnancy, and those who had had most probably heard about it from relations and friends rather than the media. Most patients had no firm opinions on induction of labour but were usually glad to have their pregnancy ended. Many considered that they had not been given enough information by the medical staff on their induction. The amount of pain experienced by patients at amniotomy was related to the "favourability" of the cervix. Possibly women with a low cervical score should be given more premedication or <b>inhalation</b> <b>analgesia</b> at amniotomy. Most patients found injections of narcotic agents adequate analgesia in labour. Those patients who did not receive adequate analgesia were principally those who had either very short or quite long labours. Patients with long labours may benefit from more liberal use of analgesia, but no satisfactory form of analgesia seems to be available for patients who are likely to deliver within two or three hours of induction...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{anaesthesia}} (Local plus General) {{has been}} used at the 1 st Clinic of Orthopaedics since 1986. A trial is described involving 21 children and comparing them with a control group of 14 cases having only inhalation anaesthesia. Caudal blockade with Bupivacaine is the local anaesthesia used to decrease stress during pelvic osteotomies. The use of combined anaesthesia provides smoothness and stability with absence of side effects and the doses of anaesthetic and post- operative analgesic agents used were less than in the <b>inhalation</b> group. Postoperative <b>analgesia</b> lasts approximately 2 - 4 hours longer than general anaesthesia. N/...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundFlail {{chest is}} managed with {{mechanical}} ventilation or <b>inhalation</b> therapy, and <b>analgesia.</b> Mechanical ventilations carry risks by themselves, and disengage with the external fixators, {{so they must}} be operated to improve lung ventilatory mechanics and cleaning. Little has been published {{on the use of}} bio-absorbable material and its evolution in the setting of flail chest. Material and methodsA study was made on a material that {{did not have to be}} removed, that had the malleability of steel, its inflammatory reaction was minimal, and could be handled in both adults and children. A descriptive study is presented of patients with flail chest under rib fixation with plates and bio-absorbable screws. ResultsA series of 18 cases are presented, with ages from 33 - 74 years, three with bilateral flail chest. Fixation was performed between days 1 - 21 of the accident. In cases that showed no fractures of pelvic limbs, walking was restarted the day after fixing. In all cases mechanical ventilation improved and pain decreased. So far there has been no reaction to the material. ConclusionsFlail chest has a high (16. 3 %) mortality when the pathophysiology of the condition (pain, poor mechanical ventilation, alveolar oedema-pulmonary contusion) is not treated. The use of bio-absorbable material has no side effects attributable to material, making it another option for rib fixation...|$|R
40|$|O medo Ã uma caracterÃstica {{fundamental}} do ser humano. Ã o medo que ativa respostas fisiolÃgicas que farÃo frente a ameaÃas reais ou imaginÃrias, possibilitando ao organismo as opÃÃes de luta ou fuga. Quando este medo, ou a ansiedade gerada por ele, interpÃe-se entre o paciente e cuidados de saÃde, torna-se urgente a adoÃÃo de medidas que visem aboli-lo ou minimizÃ-lo. Ainda hoje, muitos pacientes nÃo procuram o atendimento odontolÃgico em decorrÃncia do medo e da ansiedade. O Ãxido nitroso, como meio de sedaÃÃo, vem sendo usado no mundo todo com ampla margem de sucesso. O objetivo deste trabalho foi uma avaliaÃÃo comparativa entre os parÃmetros cardiovasculares e saturaÃÃo de oxigÃnio de dois grupos de 20 pacientes, classificados como ASA I e II, selecionados para cirurgia de extraÃÃo de terceiros molares inclusos. No grupo de estudo (n= 20), os pacientes foram submetidos Ã cirurgia sob anestesia local, associada Ã sedaÃÃo com Ãxido nitroso (70 %) e oxigÃnio (30 %); no grupo controle (n= 20), os pacientes foram submetidos ao mesmo tipo de procedimento cirÃrgico, com a utilizaÃÃo Ãnica da anestesia local. Os resultados mostraram que a sedaÃÃo com o Ãxido nitroso, mesmo na concentraÃÃo mÃxima permitida â 70 % â Ã um procedimento seguro e efetivo. Os parÃmetros cardiovasculares, do grupo sob sedaÃÃo, mostraram uma estabilidade hemodinÃmica maior que a observada no grupo que recebeu somente a anestesia local, nÃo tendo sido observado em nenhum dos grupos, qualquer episÃdio de dessaturaÃÃo ou alteraÃÃes eletrocardiogrÃficas de significado clÃnico, todos os procedimentos foram finalizados com sucesso e nenhum evento adverso foi observadoFear is {{a fundamental}} human emotion. It is fear that triggers physiological responses that prepare the body for action against real or imaginary threats, allowing the individual {{to decide whether to}} fight or flee. When fear, or resulting anxiety, interferes with the provision of healthcare causing patients to delay or avoid care, it is necessary to take measures to eliminate or minimize this feeling. Even today, patients avoid dental care due to fear or anxiety. To those, classified as âphobicâ, are added patients with special needs and non-cooperative children. In these cases, hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs have been used, as well as general anesthesia. As an alternative to the use of such drugs, the mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, also called conscious sedation or <b>inhalation</b> <b>analgesia,</b> have been used throughout the world {{with a high degree of}} success. The objective of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of cardiovascular parameters and pulse oximetry values in two groups of 20 patients, classified as ASA I and II according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, who were referred for surgical removal of impacted third molars. Patients in the experimental group (n= 20) underwent surgery under local anesthesia with sedation consisting of 70 % nitrous oxide and 30 % oxygen, while patients in the control group (n= 20) underwent the same surgical procedure but only under local anesthesia. The results demonstrated that sedation with 70 % nitrous oxide is a safe and effective procedure. The cardiovascular parameters in the group given sedation showed more hemodynamic stability than those observed in the group that only received local anesthesia. In none of the groups, desaturation episodes or electrocardiographic changes of clinical significance were observe...|$|E
