500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years is too often. The name of Arsenal has been sullied and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken this action." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E
500|$|After the season, {{head coach}} Lloyd Carr was {{replaced}} by Rich Rodriguez. [...] Rodriguez' no huddle spread option offense, which used zone blocking, was a major adjustment for Boren. By the tenth day of spring practice Boren had left the team. Boren made {{a statement to the}} press regarding his decision, which included the following excerpt: [...] "Michigan football was a family, built on mutual respect and support for each other from (former) Coach (Lloyd) Carr on down. We knew it took the entire family, a team effort, and we all worked together[...] I have great trouble accepting that those family values have eroded in just a few months[...] [...]That I am unable to perform under these circumstances at the level I expect of myself, and my teammates and Michigan fans deserve, <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made the decision to leave." [...] A month later, Ohio State coach Jim Tressel announced Boren would redshirt for the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season and become the first player to transfer from Michigan to play for archrival Ohio State since at least World War II. [...] According to Section 14.5.2.B of the Rules of Eligibility in the Big Ten handbook, Boren is ineligible to be a scholarship athlete after transferring. [...] A little more than a week after Justin announced his transfer, his younger brother Zach committed to Ohio State. [...] Later that summer, Detroit Free Press writer Michael Rosenberg, backed up Boren's statement about family values: [...] "Rodriguez's staff uses some of the foulest, most degrading language imaginable. I know coaches curse, and I'm no prude, but this goes way beyond a few dirty words. He belittles his players. This {{is a big part of}} why offensive lineman Justin Boren [...] left the team. He felt his dignity was at stake." ...|$|E

I was a night-born. <b>I,</b> who <b>had</b> lived all my life with the day-born, was a night-born. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>been</b> {{satisfied}} with cooking and dishwashing; that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hankered to run naked in the moonlight. And I knew that this dirty little Juneau hash-joint was no place for me. And right there and then I said, [...] "I quit." [...] I packed up my few rags of clothes, and started. Jake saw me and tried to stop me.|$|R

2500|$|In June 2008, Ljungberg {{retired from}} the Swedish National team stating, [...] "The simple fact is the {{physical}} strain of playing on the national team and in club football {{for such a long}} time has finally taken its toll. And that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> decided to concentrate on playing for West Ham United and that is where my focus will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tolkien {{included}} neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work. Rather the themes, moral philosophy, and cosmology of The Lord of the Rings {{reflect his}} Catholic worldview. In {{one of his}} letters Tolkien states, [...] "The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world. For the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not here. I'm at Bungay," [...] he replied. [...] "I'm {{giving a}} music lesson to Harold and Julia. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to leave the}} table with the ladies--I'm {{spending}} the night there, and I shan't be back till late on Christmas Eve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she admitted. [...] "I am rather {{looking forward}} to my drive. To-night, as we came here, the whole country seemed like a great garden of {{perfumes}} and beautiful places. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them telephone for a carriage.

6000|$|... "In Ireland," [...] he confided. [...] "Sorry {{to desert}} you as I did, {{but you do}} not begin to count for us just yet. There was just a faint doubt as to what they were doing to do about internment. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get the Irish trip off my mind." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a speech}} on June 25, 2003, criticizing giving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, Paul said, [...] "These medals {{generally}} have been proposed to recognize a life of service and leadership, and not for political reasons—as evidenced by the overwhelming bipartisan support for awarding President Reagan, a Republican, a gold medal. These awards normally go to deserving individuals, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> many times offered to contribute $100 of my own money, to be matched by other members, to finance these medals." [...] Texas Monthly awarded him the [...] "Bum Steer" [...] award for voting against a congressional honor for cartoonist Charles Schulz, but also noted, [...] "When he was criticized for voting against the [...] medal, he chided his colleagues by challenging them to personally contribute $100 to mint the medal. No one did. At the time, Paul observed, 'It's easier to be generous with other people's money. [...] In February 2009, he joined with Democratic congressman Harry Mitchell of Arizona to call {{for an end to}} automatic Congressional pay increases, through a proposed amendment to the economic stimulus package.|$|E
2500|$|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{defends the}} idea of innate {{concepts}} by suggesting the mind {{plays a role in}} determining the nature of concepts, to explain this, he likens the mind to a block of marble in the New Essays on Human Understanding, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken as an illustration a block of veined marble, rather than a wholly uniform block or blank tablets, that is to say what is called tabula rasa {{in the language of the}} philosophers. For if the soul were like those blank tablets, truths would be in us in the same way as the figure of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the marble is completely indifferent whether it receives this or some other figure. But if there were veins in the stone which marked out the figure of Hercules rather than other figures, this stone would be more determined thereto, and Hercules would be as it were in some manner innate in it, although labour would be needed to uncover the veins, and to clear them by polishing, and by cutting away what prevents them from appearing. It is in this way that ideas and truths are innate in us, like natural inclinations and dispositions, natural habits or potentialities, and not like activities, although these potentialities are always accompanied by some activities which correspond to them, though they are often imperceptible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had hoped}} otherwise," [...] he said. [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been slow to}} move. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> waited, why I have even {{committed}} the treachery of permitting Pier Luigi to suppose me ready at need to engage in his service." ...|$|E
60|$|That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{come up from}} my warm bunk {{at midnight}} to sit alone on the taffrail, {{listening}} in the keen air to the howling that made me shiver, spite of myself, and watching in the vague moonlight to understand if possible what the brutes felt amid the primal silence and desolation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No.' Murdoch laughed. 'He {{is strong}} enough and would be useful, but he gets so confoundedly sulky if he takes a drop too much. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to get rid of}} him. He got into three or four rows, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> him on my hands each time for over a fortnight, so <b>I</b> thought he <b>had</b> better go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{to grieve}} me, my boy, no. At least, {{if there is}} nothing in it that will grieve you too much. But I hardly {{expected}} that this--just this--would ever happen. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never prepared you for it. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never told you anything about your parentage. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> striven in every way not to make that an injury to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Too pretty," [...] said Attwater. [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> her married. A man {{never knows}} when {{he may be}} {{inclined}} to be a fool about women; so when we were left alone <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the pair {{of them to the}} chapel and performed the ceremony. She made a lot of fuss. I do not take at all the romantic view of marriage," [...] he explained.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Acton laughed. [...] "You needn't worry {{yourself}} on that point. We have all our little hobbies. My husband's is {{the acquisition of}} dollars {{and the opening of}} mines and mills. Mine is the amusing of my friends, or, rather, the permitting them to amuse themselves, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> Bonavista built. <b>I</b> make only one stipulation--it is that when you stay with us, you are amused." ...|$|R
40|$|On Nov. 18, 1989, {{shortly after}} the fall of the Berlin Wall I {{returned}} for the first time since my birth to Ukraine, and as the taxi passed by the square clock tower in Kyiv’s Central Square, I was seized by the emotion of its electronic letters spelling out in Cyrillic the day of the week, and month – in Ukrainian.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} the man slowly, [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> got stuck {{up in the}} range. Couldn't make anything of the gorge in the loose snow. Tried to crawl up over the ice track and dropped through. Burst the pack-straps getting out, and don't know {{where most of the}} grub and one blanket went to. It was the bigger packet. That <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to come back. I don't quite know how I made the valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't," [...] {{rejoined the}} other.

You must all forgive me ere you start upon your journey. You are not out of the wood yet, remember. Though Paris is a long way behind, France itself is no longer a healthy place for any of you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a light fixed there for the benefit or the fishermen," [...] he said, [...] "a light which I work from my own dynamo. Between where we are sitting now and there--only a little way out to sea--is a jagged cluster of cruel rocks. You can see them if you care to swim out in calm weather. Fishermen who tried to come in by night were often trapped there and, in a rough sea, drowned. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> that pillar of light built.

5000|$|This, {{combined}} {{with the possibility of}} being awarded a Fields medal, led him to quit professional mathematics.

Now, when I become a very conspicuous person, I cannot stay a pet and say nothing. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to quit."
