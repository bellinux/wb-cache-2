5|$|Authorities {{were amazed}} by the {{similarities}} between Cox's actual crimes and his unpublished manuscript, The Associates, which they found several years before Cox was arrested. The novel's protagonist is 5ft 7in (170cm), has brown <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes. Cox is 5ft 6in (168cm), has brown <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> green eyes. Both the protagonist and Cox drove a silver Audi TT, illegally acquired Tampa real estate worth $2.7 million, were alumni of the University of South Florida, had an intense fear of Interpol, and formerly worked as insurance seller.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, blond <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes—changed radically {{over the}} course of time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E

40|$|The capitula of Cynara cardunculus contain <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi {{representing}} 7 % of {{the total}} plant biomass. These low density biomass components could be mechanically separated without apparent losses using a whole-plant processing prototype. <b>Hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi are filamentous structures made up of longitudinally aligned fibre cells, without intercellular voids or pitting, with the following dimensions regarding length, width and wall thickness: 1. 35 mm, 19. 8, and 4. 8 m for <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> 1. 78 mm, 10. 4, and 2. 9 m for pappi. Chemically <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi have low content of ash (1. 9 % and 1. 1 %, respectively), extractives (5. 4 % and 6. 0 %) and lignin (10. 6 % and 17. 8 %), and high content of holocellulose (77. 5 % and 72. 8 %) and -cellulose (55. 2 % and 46. 8 %). Pulps could be produced using a conventional kraft process with high yields and low residual lignin, e. g. 63 % at Kappa 7 for <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> 48 % at Kappa 11 for pappi, low coarseness values (0. 04 and 0. 03 mgm− 1) and adequate pulp properties for paper (40 and 42 Nmg− 1 tensile index; 3. 6 and 3. 4 kPam 2 g− 1 burst index in unrefined pulps of <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi, respectively). The results also indicated that there is scope for improving pulp quality by optimising pulping conditions {{to this type of}} new raw materials. The differences between <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi may also be further exploited namely the lower lignin content of <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> the higher slenderness and wall thickness of pappi fibres. The utilization of <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> pappi may strengthen the differentiated use of biomass fractions of the Cynara plant and its potential as a bioenergy crop...|$|R

40|$|Shallow basal root growth angle (BRGA) {{increases}} phosphorus acquisition efficiency {{by enhancing}} topsoil foraging because in most soils, phosphorus {{is concentrated in}} the topsoil. Root <b>hair</b> length <b>and</b> density (RHL/D) increase phosphorus acquisition by expanding the soil volume subject to phosphorus depletion through diffusion. We hypothesized that shallow BRGA and large RHL/D are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition, meaning that their combined effect {{is greater than the}} sum of their individual effects. To evaluate this hypothesis, phosphorus acquisition in the field in Mozambique was compared among recombinant inbred lines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) having four distinct root phenotypes: long root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> shallow basal roots, long root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> deep basal roots, short root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> shallow basal roots, <b>and</b> short root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> deep basal roots. The results revealed substantial synergism between BRGA and RHL/D. Compared with short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes, long root hairs increased shoot biomass under phosphorus stress by 89 %, while shallow roots increased shoot biomass by 58 %. Genotypes with both long root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> shallow roots had 298 % greater biomass accumulation than short-haired, deep-rooted phenotypes. Therefore, the utility of shallow basal roots <b>and</b> long root <b>hairs</b> for phosphorus acquisition in combination is twice as large as their additive effects. We conclude that the anatomical phene of long, dense root <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> the architectural phene of shallower basal root growth are synergetic for phosphorus acquisition. Phene synergism may be common in plant biology and can have substantial importance for plant fitness, as shown here...|$|R
