5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a circular machine. Knitting speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in flat knitting which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial flat knitting machines are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is {{a widely}} used fabric {{manufacturing}} technology. Compared with warp knitting and circular <b>knitting,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is characterized by its higher process flexibility and greater fabric structure variety. In this work, <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> technology was exploited to fabricate auxetic fabrics which laterally expand when stretched. Three kinds of geometrical structures, i. e. foldable structure, rotating rectangle and reentrant hexagon, were employed as basic reference structures {{for the development of}} these kinds of auxetic fabrics. The weft knitting processes based on these structures were specially developed and auxetic fabrics were fabricated using the computerized <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines.</b> The Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the developed fabrics were plotted and compared with those calculated using existing models to demonstrate the variation trends of Poisson's ratio with the axial strain. The results reveal that except the folded fabric formed with the face loops and reverse loops in a rectangular arrangement, of which the auxetic effect firstly increases and then decreases with the axial strain, the auxetic effects of all other fabrics decrease with an increase of the axial strain. The work also shows that auxetic fabrics can be realized based on knitted structures and that <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> technology can provide a simple, but highly effective way of fabricating auxetic fabrics from conventional yarns.

40|$|One of {{the areas}} of medical textile is the spacer knitted {{orthopaedic}} products. The concept of compression therapy of orthopaedic supports lies on a simple and efficient mechanical principle â€“ it consists of applying elastic garment around the limb. Spacer orthopaedic supports are <b>knitted</b> on <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> equipped with especial elastomeric thread feeder. Compression made by the support depends on the support area, shape and characteristics of knitting. Because of orthopaedic supports are intended for durable wearing and need to vouchsafe compression of fixed value, {{it is very important}} to known how processes acting during exploitation influence alteration of compression values. The aim of this study was to establish the alteration of compression of knitted support during exploitation, i. e. after multifold extension, washing and drying. The samples were <b>knitted</b> on a <b>flat</b> double needle bed <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> in combined jacquard-laid-in pattern with elastomeric weft threads.

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} first attempt of {{developing}} auxetic structures using high performance fibres through knitting technology. Polyamide (PA) and para-aramid (p-AR) fibres and their combination were knitted in to purl structures using <b>flatbed</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine,</b> varying different structural (such as loop length, cover factor and yarn density) and machine parameters (such as take-down load). The influence of different parameters on negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) was thoroughly investigated. It was observed that NPR improved strongly {{with the increase in}} loop length of knitted structures. NPR also increased withthe decrease in cover factor and increase in course density of knitted fabrics. An increase in take-down load also improved NPR for tightly knitted samples, but led to initial decrease and subsequent increase in NPR for medium and higher loop lengths; except for p-AR fabrics, which showed a decrease in NPR with take-down load for higher loop lengths. Tensile properties of the developed auxetic structures were also found to depend strongly on fibre type and loop length, and the highest tensile performance was achieved with lower loop lengths and p-AR yarns. The p-AR fabrics produced using lower loop length and lower take-down load resulted in the highest NPR ofâˆ’ 0. 713. Therefore, the developed knitted structures produced using high performance yarns and showing strong auxetic effects can have huge potential for industrial applications, especially in personal protection materials, such as cut resistance fabrics, bullet proof vest, helmets, and so on.

Employing manual measuring and 3 D body scanning {{in conjunction with a}} digitally enabled knitting system, 3 D shaped knitwear has been developed to fit the individual body shape of a cohort of women over UK size 16. Wearer analysis proves that women value the prototype garmentâ€™s comfortable fit, which eliminates stitch distortion whilst reducing the drooping and folding commonly found in â€˜outsizeâ€™ clothing (Myers McDevitt, 2004 : 246). This research employs a widely available Shima Seiki <b>flat</b> bed <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> in combination with an SDS 1 programmer, creating accessible and transferable outcomes for all systems. One of the unique aspects of this research is integrating design with technical knitting skills so that reproduce-able garments are developed with full cognisance of the manufacturing process.
