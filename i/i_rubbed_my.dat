2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand into my pocket, and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> forehead, for {{the doctor}} had {{incidentally}} thrown out an embarrassing idea.|$|E
60|$|Out I {{started to}} thrust my head, but a sharp blow on the {{forehead}} caused me to recoil. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry at Paul, who was laughing in gleeful, boyish fashion.|$|E
5000|$|... :My pistol may snap, my mojo is frail:But <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> root, my luck {{will never}} fail:When <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> root, my John the Conquer root:Aww, {{you know there}} ain't nothin' she can do, Lord,:I <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> John the Conquer root ...|$|R
5000|$|... "And here <b>I</b> am <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> fabulous new car in her face," [...] Bree says, [...] "I feel awful. Thank God I didn't {{show her}} how it parks itself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{a mystery}} is it?" [...] <b>I</b> cried, <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> hands. [...] "This is very piquant. I am much obliged {{to you for}} {{bringing}} us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, doubting {{whether we}} had not slept and dreamt these things by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and {{suddenly}} discovered the blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my shoulder and arm.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> knee, and enthroned Jicks as ordered. At {{the same}} time Mr. Finch solemnly stalked up to his daughter; laid {{his hands on her}} head; raised his eyes to the ceiling; and said in bass notes that rumbled with {{paternal}} emotion, [...] "Bless you, my child!" ...|$|E
60|$|I looked {{where he}} pointed; and, sure enough, {{there was an}} island where I had never seen one before. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and looked again. Yes: there it was,--a little island, with trees and people on it; for I saw smoke {{coming out of the}} chimney of a queerly-shaped house on the shore.|$|E
60|$|And at that up <b>I</b> jumped, and, <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> eyes, ran to a {{loophole}} in the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then, sir," [...] said <b>I,</b> and <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> neck {{a little}} with my thumb, [...] "then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{heard those}} words <b>I</b> had to <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{to make sure}} that I was awake.|$|R
60|$|So closely I took St Rosa's {{story to}} heart that, one day, after bidding my beauty a wistful {{farewell}} in the glass, <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> cheek too, {{but with the}} blue flowers of the--brooklime. It stained them a little, but soon washed off. In my case a needless precaution; my pr√©tendants have been few.|$|E
60|$|The {{sunlight}} was streaming {{through the}} window when at last my pen ceased to move. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and looked out in momentary amazement. Morning had already broken across the sea. My green-shaded lamp was burning with a sickly light. The moon had turned pale and colourless whilst I sat at my desk.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, {{thinking}} that I {{was the victim}} of some hallucination, or that the refraction from the intense light produced an optical delusion; and, as I did so, the flaming pillar slowly twisted and thundered off whithersoever it passes to {{in the bowels of the}} great earth, leaving Ayesha standing where it had been.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> was <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> freckle lotion on it, but I {{must have}} used that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs," [...] was the despairing response. [...] "What shall I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, just oblige me: {{let me try}} {{what there}} is in luck. Go on playing while <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> up <b>my</b> Arabic, and try to read this ineffable name on the case. Is it the word of Power of Solomon?" ...|$|R
60|$|ACRES But, David, has Mr. De-la-grace been here? <b>I</b> must <b>rub</b> up <b>my</b> balancing, and chasing, and boring.|$|R
6000|$|I stared. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. It {{could not}} be--yes, it was--Umbezi, [...] "Eater-up-of-Elephants," [...] {{the father of}} Mameena. In a few seconds, without waiting for leave to approach, he had bounded through the line of dead princes, {{stopping}} to kick one {{of them on the}} head and address his poor clay in some words of shameful insult, and was prancing about before Cetewayo, shouting his praises.|$|E
6000|$|I want very affectionately and earnestly {{to congratulate}} {{you on your}} eldest daughter's {{approaching}} marriage. Up to the moment when Mary told me of it, I had foolishly thought of her always as the pretty little girl with the frank loving face whom I saw last on the sands at Broadstairs. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and woke at the words [...] "going to be married," [...] and found I had been walking in my sleep some years.|$|E
60|$|Slumbering there rested me greatly, I think, {{and the sun}} {{was setting}} and the {{violence}} of the heat abating, through all the time I slumbered. When at last I was roused from my slumbers by a remote clamour, I felt active and capable again. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and stretched my arms. I rose to my feet--I was a little stiff--and at once prepared to resume my search. I shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder, and went on out of the ravine of the gold-veined rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] said the monk, meekly from under loads of white beard, [...] "but I fear I do not understand; {{was it in}} order that <b>I</b> might <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Serrano said he {{was drawn}} to the texture Torres {{developed}} in his work, telling Complex Magazine: [...] "It looked like, even when I was looking at it on my phone or computer, <b>I</b> could <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> fingers across the screen and be able to feel the paper that he drew it on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'First {{accumulate}} {{a mass of}} Facts: {{and then}} construct a Theory.' That, I believe, is the true Scientific Method. <b>I</b> sat up, <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eves, and began to accumulate Facts.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{it proved}} a bitter night, even for me. I was the warmest clad in the boat. What the others must have {{suffered}} I {{did not care}} to dwell upon over much. For fear that we might meet up with more ice in the darkness, we bailed and held the boat bow-on to the seas. And continually, now with one mitten, now with the other, <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> nose {{that it might not}} freeze. Also, with memories lively in me of the home circle in Elkton, I prayed to God.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sight of}} this monster rather {{relieved}} than heightened my terrors--for I now {{made sure that}} I dreamed, and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and briskly forward. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my limbs. A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. This seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{perhaps it}} was the word [...] "priests" [...] that I carried away with me through the {{darkness}} of another flight in time. Perhaps it was the cue. More probably it was a mere coincidence. At any rate I awoke, lying upon a rough rocky floor, and found myself on my back, my arms crossed in such fashion that each elbow rested in the palm of the opposite hand. As I lay there, eyes closed, half awake, <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> elbows with my palms and found that I was rubbing prodigious calluses. There was no surprise in this. I accepted the calluses as of long time and a matter of course.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, father, I {{really think}} I could {{do some good}} with it. For instance, <b>I</b> could just <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> lamp, and then have all your trees pruned for you, at once, without any further trouble." ...|$|R
5000|$|Music papers {{started to}} slag us off ... because Sgt. Pepper took five months to record, and I {{remember}} the great glee seeing {{in one of}} the papers how the Beatles have dried up ... and <b>I</b> was sitting <b>rubbing</b> <b>my</b> hands, saying [...] "You just wait." [...] - Paul McCartney ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{an appalling}} {{scrimmage}} for a moment; then, before <b>I</b> could fairly <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes, the hare had vanished utterly, and a savage ring of lynxes were licking their chops hungrily, glaring and growling {{at each other}} to see which it was that had gotten the biggest mouthful.|$|R
60|$|IN {{the early}} morning (it was the second morning after my recovery, and I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue of tumultuous dreams,--dreams of guns and howling mobs,--and became {{sensible}} of a hoarse shouting above me. <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and lay listening to the noise, doubtful {{for a little while}} of my whereabouts. Then came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects being thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round, and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round window and left it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went on deck.|$|E
60|$|As I {{took hold}} of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly {{truncated}} at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was not}} a {{refreshing}} slumber. I tossed and tumbled amid a series of vile dreams, in which everything seemed to go wrong with me. At last, I remember, I was charging an unshaken square of Hungarian Grenadiers, with a single squadron upon spent horses, just as I did at Elchingen. I stood in my stirrups to shout 'Vive l'Empereur!' and as I did so, there came the answering roar from my hussars, 'Vive l'Empereur!' I sprang from my rough bed, with the words still ringing in my ears, and then, as <b>I</b> <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, and wondered if I were mad, the same cry came again, five thousand voices in one long-drawn yell. I looked out from my screen of brambles, and saw in the clear light of morning the very last thing that I should either have expected or chosen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father! Father!" [...] Bruno repeated: and, {{while the}} happy {{children}} were being hugged and kissed, <b>I</b> could but <b>rub</b> <b>my</b> eyes and say [...] "Where, then, are the rags gone to?"; {{for the old}} man was now dressed in royal robes that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and wore a circlet of gold around his head.|$|R
6000|$|... ‚ÄúMy {{medicine}} is always good. However, {{if it is}} not good, then do by me as you have done to the others. Cut me up a bit at a time, even as you have cut him up.‚Äù He pointed to the Cossack. ‚ÄúThe {{medicine is}} now cool. Thus, <b>I</b> <b>rub</b> it on <b>my</b> neck, saying this further medicine.‚Äù ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he stood}} there he lifted his hand and rubbed it across his {{forehead}} {{as if in a}} sort of daze from the heat. I recognized the gesture as one very characteristic of myself; <b>I</b> had often <b>rubbed</b> <b>my</b> hand across my forehead on a close, hot day like that. Then the man suddenly vanished as if he had sunk through the floor.|$|R
