40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} plays a {{key role}} in studies of graphene and related carbon systems. Graphene is perhaps the most promising material of recent times for many novel applications, including electronics. In this paper, the traditional and well established Kramers-Heisenberg-Dirac (KHD) Raman scattering theory (1925 - 1927) is extended to crystalline graphene for the first time. It demands different phonon production mechanisms and phonon energies than does the popular "double resonance" Raman scattering model. The latter has never been compared to KHD. Within KHD, phonons are produced instantly along with electrons and holes, in what we term an electron-hole-phonon triplet, which does not suffer Pauli blocking. A new mechanism for double phonon production we name "transition sliding" explains the brightness of the 2 D mode and other overtones, as a result of linear (Dirac cone) electron dispersion. Direct evidence for sliding resides in hole doping experiments performed in 2011 chenCrommie. Whole ranges of electronic transitions are permitted and may even constructively interfere for the same laser energy and phonon q, explaining the dispersion, bandwidth, and strength of many two phonon Raman bands. Graphene's entire Raman spectrum, including dispersive and <b>fixed</b> <b>bands,</b> missing bands not forbidden by symmetries, weak bands, overtone bands, Stokes anti-Stokes anomalies, individual bandwidths, trends with doping, and D- 2 D band spacing anomalies emerge naturally and directly in KHD theory.

5000|$|Having been {{primarily}} a recording artist {{up until this}} point, Pink's early solo tours and performances were generally met with much negativity, because [...] "it was music that was never intended to be performed live for commercial audiences." [...] However, after initially spending years playing shows with pre-recorded music, karaoke style, Pink slowly attracted what would become his full-time band, composed of renowned musicians who have since helped bring his recordings to life. The band, known as Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, consisted of keyboardist/guitarist/backing vocalist Kenny Gilmore, drummer/vocalist/guitarist Jimi Hey, and guitarist Cole M.G.N.

40|$|Abstract. Feature {{reduction}} {{is common in}} biosignal analysis, especially in case of quantitative EEG analysis. Mostly, summation in the spectral domain is applied {{to reduce the number}} of estimated power spectral density values, which gains between four and twelve band power values. Depending on the problem, on signals under analysis and on methods used for further processing it is an open question if such a strong decrease in the number of features is optimal. Modern Soft Computing methods offer the feasibility of processing a large amount of different features without considerable performance deteriorations. In this paper we apply such methods and compare empirically the case of no feature reduction to four variants of feature reduction. Our data set consist of more than 3, 700 examples of microsleep events experienced by young adults in an overnight driving simulation study. More than 4, 600 features were extracted from seven EEG and two EOG channels utilizing the modified periodogram method. Results showed that summation in many <b>fixed</b> <b>bands,</b> or in fewer, but freely optimized bands is more optimal than no reduction, or strong reduction to four bands commonly selected in EEG analysis. 1...|$|R

50|$|There is no <b>fixed</b> <b>band</b> set-up {{for playing}} CWM, but most have a lead singer and lead guitarist or {{keyboard}} player. Their {{role is to}} indicate the tone, structure, pace and volume of the worship songs, and perhaps even construct the order or content {{during the time of}} worship. Some larger churches are able to employ paid worship leaders, and some have attained fame by worship leading, blurring contemporary worship music with Christian rock, though the role of the band in a worship service, leading and enabling the congregation in praise normally contrasts that of performing a Christian concert. In CWM today there will often be three or four singers with microphones, a drum kit, a bass guitar, one or two guitars, keyboard and possibly other, more orchestral instruments, such as a flute or violin. There has been a shift within the genre towards using amplified instruments and voices, again paralleling popular music, though some churches play the same songs with simpler or acoustic instrumentation.|$|E

40|$|Large {{aperture}} scintillometers (LAS) {{are often}} used to characterise atmospheric turbulence by measuring the structure parameter of the refractive index Cn². However, absorption phenomena can lead to an overestimation of Cn². By applying an accurate numerical filtering technique called the Gabor Transform to the signal output of a LAS, we improved {{our knowledge of the}} accuracy of the measured Cn² by determining and attenuating the contribution of absorption. Two studies will be led on a 12 -day dataset using either <b>fixed</b> <b>band</b> pass or adaptive filtering. The first one consists in evaluating the best-fitted filter for which the resulting Cn² is independent of meteorological conditions, especially wind speed, and the second one consists in accurately attenuating absorption phenomena. A reference Cn² (hereafter 'reconstructed Cn²') will be created by accurately removing absorption from the scintillation spectrum, and will be used to evaluate each filter. By comparing the 'reconstructed Cn²' with a raw Cn² measured by a scintillometer we found that the average relative contribution of absorption to the measurement of Cn² is approximately 1. 6 %. However, the absorption phenomenon is highly variable; occasionally, in the worst cases, we estimated that the absorption phenomenon could represent 81 % of the value of Cn². Some explanations for this high variability are proposed with respect to theoretical considerations. Amongst the <b>fixed</b> <b>band</b> pass filtering used in this paper, we concluded on the preferential use of a band pass filter [0. 2 - 400 Hz] for Cn² at 60 %. Using an adaptive filter on the 12 -day dataset really improves the filtering accuracy on both points discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial is {{to test the hypothesis}} that a prosthesis of this design can be dilated with an intraluminal balloon dilator and is as safe and effective to use as the conventional <b>fixed</b> fabric <b>band.</b> The design of this trial is that of a unicenter non-randomized prospective human clinical trial. The controls are historical. The indications for banding and the surgical techniques for implantation are those previously described and accepted for conventional <b>fixed</b> fabric <b>bands.</b> Dilatation employed techniques described and accepted for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. During the 57 months of this trial, 40 patients received the dilatable banding prosthesis. Banding was successful and uncomplicated. No migration of the prosthesis occurred. In only 1 patient was the band adjusted too tightly at implantation. The device was never adjusted too loosely. There were 11 deaths. None were related to the prosthesis. Dilatation was performed on 7 patients. This was successful in 6 and uncomplicated in all except 1 who developed a transient heart block. The dilatable band prosthesis was explanted readily and completely in all 27 patients during their definitive surgery. In 7 patients stenosis of a pulmonary artery branch developed as a result of distal implantation of the device. Balloon dilatation improved the stenosis in 2 of the patients. Surgical pulmonary artery angioplasty was performed mn all 15 patients having total correction (TC) and in 4 of the 12 patients who had a bidirectional Glenn procedure (BDGP) and Damus-Kaye-Stanzel connection (DKSC). The duration of banding of the patients who had (TC) was 31 to 1139 (mean 339) days. The duration of banding of the patients who had BDGP and DKSC was 88 to 594 (mean 215) days. The longest period of banding was 1640 days. Macroscopic and radiographic examination of all 28 explanted devices revealed no evidence of wear or damage. Scanning electron microscopic examination was conducted on 5 of the explanted devices which had been implanted 159 to 1139 (mean 422) days. One of the 5 had been successfully dilated. No component failure was identified. The materials remained inert. ConclusionThe dilatable band prosthesis is as safe and effective to use as the conventional <b>fixed</b> fabric <b>band.</b> It is more readily explanted completely and provides a safe non-surgical option for dilatation...|$|R
