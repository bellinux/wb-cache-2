60|$|But if {{the wisdom}} of Comte was insufficient, the folly of Comte was wisdom. In an age of dusty modernity, when beauty was thought of as {{something}} barbaric and ugliness as something sensible, he alone saw that men must always have the sacredness of mummery. He saw that while the brutes have all the useful things, {{the things that are}} truly human are the useless ones. He saw the falsehood of that almost universal notion of to-day, the notion that rites and forms are something artificial, additional, and corrupt. Ritual is really much older than thought; it is much simpler and much wilder than thought. A feeling touching the nature of things does not only make men feel that there are certain proper things to say; <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> that there are certain proper things to do. The more agreeable of these consist of dancing, building temples, and shouting very loud; the less agreeable, of wearing green carnations and burning other philosophers alive. But everywhere the religious dance came before the religious hymn, and man was a ritualist before he could speak. If Comtism had spread the world would have been converted, not by the Comtist philosophy, but by the Comtist calendar. By discouraging what they conceive to be the weakness of their master, the English Positivists have broken the strength of their religion. A man who has faith must be prepared not only to be a martyr, but to be a fool. It is absurd to say that a man is ready to toil and die for his convictions when he is not even ready to wear a wreath round his head for them. I myself, to take a corpus vile, am very certain that I would not read the works of Comte through for any consideration whatever. But I can easily imagine myself with the greatest enthusiasm lighting a bonfire on Darwin Day.|$|E

By the early 1950s, emotional delivery had reached its apex in the miniature psycho-drama songs of writer-singer Johnnie Ray. Known as 'The Cry Guy' and 'The Prince of Wails,' Ray's on-stage emotion wrought 'breakdowns' provided a release for the pent-up angst of his predominantly teenaged fans.

40|$|There is a {{delicate}} and controversial area not yet very clear between Statistics, as a subject of study and Education as a social phenomenon.

On the other hand, there are few experts in education with enough knowledge of Statistics and its methods, who can study globally and satisfactorily all the problems of statistical education. On analyzing the goals of statistical education as a reflection of the needs of society, we have to face the problem of detecting and identifying the influence which social needs have on statistical education.

60|$|In each of Marlowe's tragedies we {{have the}} picture of a man {{dominated}} by a single passion, the lust of power for its own sake. In each we see that a powerful man without self-control is like a dangerous instrument {{in the hands of a}} child; and the tragedy ends in the destruction of the man by the ungoverned power which he possesses. The life of Swift is just such a living tragedy. He had the power of gaining wealth, like the hero of the Jew of Malta; yet he used it scornfully, and in sad irony left what remained to him of a large property to found a hospital for lunatics. By hard work he won enormous literary power, and used it to satirize our common humanity. He wrested political power from the hands of the Tories, and used it to insult the very men who had helped him, and who held his fate in their hands. By his dominant personality he exercised a curious power over women, and used <b>it</b> brutally to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> their inferiority. Being loved supremely by two good women, he brought sorrow and death to both, and endless misery to himself. So his power brought always tragedy in its wake. It is only when we remember his life of struggle and disappointment and bitterness that we can appreciate the personal quality in his satire, and perhaps find some sympathy for this greatest genius of all the Augustan writers.|$|R

50|$|Public choice {{theory is}} often used to explain how {{political}} decision-making results in outcomes that conflict with the preferences of the general public. For example, many advocacy group and pork barrel projects are not the desire of the overall democracy. However, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> sense for politicians to support these projects. <b>It</b> may <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> powerful and important. It can also benefit them financially by opening the door to future wealth as lobbyists. The project may be of interest to the politician's local constituency, increasing district votes or campaign contributions. The politician pays little or no cost to gain these benefits, as he is spending public money. Special-interest lobbyists are also behaving rationally. They can gain government favors worth millions or billions for relatively small investments. They face a risk of losing out to their competitors if they don't seek these favors. The taxpayer is also behaving rationally. The cost of defeating any one government give-away is very high, while the benefits to the individual taxpayer are very small. Each citizen pays only a few pennies or a few dollars for any given government favor, while the costs of ending that favor would be many times higher. Everyone involved has rational incentives to do exactly what they are doing, even though the desire of the general constituency is opposite. Costs are diffused, while benefits are concentrated. The voices of vocal minorities with much to gain are heard over those of indifferent majorities with little to individually lose. However the notion that groups with concentrated interests will dominate politics is incomplete because it is only one half of political equilibrium. Something must incite those preyed upon to resist even the best organized concentrated interests. In his article on interest groups Gary Becker identified this countervailing force as being the deadweight loss from predation. His views capped {{what has come to be}} known as the Chicago school of political economy and it has come in sharp conflict with the so-called Virginia faction of public choice due to its assertion that politics will tend towards efficiency due to nonlinear deadweight losses and due to its claim that political efficiency renders policy advice irrelevant.|$|R
40|$|Systemic and {{structural}} discrimination in American cities, {{which is responsible}} for enclaves of crime, poverty and subpar education, have not only produced a generation of despondent individuals with limited feelings of agency, but also a generation that can only conceive of this lifestyle and mentality as normal. Much like the institutions of discrimination, in place that maintain this reality, the psychological damage done to youth of color living in inner‐city communities, particularly black youth, is cyclical. Therefore, teaching urban black youth in inner‐cities to practice civic engagement by passively observing older generations of black folks, and “giving back to the community” as adults (Charles 2005), will no longer suffice as effective ways of combating many real and dangerous issues taking place in their communities. Additionally allowing urban black youth to accept being systemically pathologized in politics will not improve levels of political participation (Cohen 2012). On the contrary, <b>it</b> will only <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> further politically alienated and <b>make</b> <b>them</b> desire, even more, to stay out of urban politics. Many of the problems black youth encounter in inner‐city communities are political, so they need to be taught how to create sustainable and meaningful social change locally. This thesis contributes to a much larger and needed conversation on active citizenship and youth empowerment for urban youth in general but specifically urban black youth in inner‐cities. In this thesis, I examine the capacity for different civic education curricular models to raise levels of civic engagement and political participation for urban black youth. By assessing different theoretical approaches to civic education, the aim is to find ways to combat attitudes of apathy and community disengagement among urban black youth, and hopefully empower them to tackle the structural inequalities they face, living in inner‐city communities...|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} talk was very largely Charterson. He had no {{intention}} of coming to business with Blenker until Lady Harman had given place to the port and the man's nerves were steadier. He spoke of this and that in the large discursive way men use in clubs, and it was past the fish before the conversation settled down upon the topic of business organization and Sir Isaac, a little warmed by champagne, came out of the uneasily apprehensive taciturnity into which he had fallen in the presence of his wife. Horatio Blenker was keenly interested in the idealization of commercial syndication, he had been greatly stirred by a book of Mr. Gerald Stanley Lee's called Inspired Millionaires which set out to show just what magnificent airs rich men might give themselves, and he had done his best to catch its tone and to find Inspired Millionaires in Sir Isaac and Charterson and to bring it to their notice and to the notice of the readers of the Old Country Gazette. He felt that if only Sir Isaac and Charterson would see getting rich as a Great Creative Act it would raise their tone and his tone and the tone of the Old Country Gazette tremendously. It wouldn't of course materially alter the methods or policy of the paper but <b>it</b> would <b>make</b> <b>them</b> all <b>feel</b> nobler, and Blenker was of that finer clay that does honestly want to feel nobler. He hated pessimism and all that criticism and self-examination that makes weak men pessimistic, he wanted to help weak men and be helped himself, he was all for that school of optimism that would have each dunghill was a well-upholstered throne, and his nervous, starry contributions to the talk were like patches of water ranunculuses trying to flower in the overflow of a sewer.|$|R
