25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> {{was the best way}} to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|The Saints' first release after Kuepper's {{departure}} was {{the live}} EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It {{was followed by}} a studio album, The Monkey Puzzle, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 as <b>I</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>This</b> Was Love, But This Ain't Casablanca on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as Out in the Jungle... Where Things Ain't So Pleasant on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in The Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-The Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned's Brian James guested on lead guitar.|$|E

Affleck {{wanted to}} participate in the film as he was interested in playing a comedy role, saying [...] "it sounded like a fun film to do. I wanted to do a comedy, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was an opportunity to try and be funny." [...] Grazer felt that Affleck would be perfect for the role because of his deadpan timing.|$|E

500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I {{just thought it was}} incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 2003 release, Soul Journey, Welch and Rawlings {{explored}} new territory. Welch said: [...] "I {{wanted to}} make it a happier record. Out of our four records, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> might be the one where you're driving down the road listening to it on a sunny summer day." [...] Rawlings again produced the record. The album also reflected a change in the typically sparse instrumentation: Welch and Rawlings introduced a dobro, violin, electric bass and drums, and Welch later said, [...] "Everything's not supposed to sound the same, you want it to reflect change and growth." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> would be a brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I {{just want to know}} if you like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E

500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just thought it was just incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E
500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>this</b> {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E
500|$|The Oliviers filmed That Hamilton Woman (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having {{entered the}} war, {{it was one}} of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British {{sentiment}} among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part." [...] The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request {{for the rest of his}} life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, [...] "By Jove, she's a clinker." ...|$|E

500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told me {{that this}} story about a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. I had the same feeling about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E
500|$|AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw wrote, [...] "The whole storyline {{with the}} creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though I sort of knew the doc must be {{involved}} from the beginning. I also wonder how it {{fits in with}} the alternate universe." [...] The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen graded the episode with a B-. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly believed that [...] "in some ways, {{this was one of}} the less-distinctive, more X-Files-ish episodes of Fringe on Thursday night... But as usual, there was another narrative layer at work here" [...] involving a grieving Olivia. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to... But besides that great little scene at the end, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was an average episode. Granted, Fringes 'average' episodes are still better than a lot of the other stuff on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Lewis's sister Leslie Lewis {{provides}} backing vocals on two tracks, {{while her}} father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica. [...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that I want to keep writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2017, the WBO {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} sanction a regional unification fight between Singh and WBO Oriental super middleweight champion Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China. New India Express announced the fight, billed as [...] "Battleground Asia" [...] would take place on 5 August 2017 at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Indoor Stadium in Mumbai. On 26 July, IOS Boxing Promotions and Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions announced that they had reached a deal to work together once again. Singh retained his Asia Pacific title and won the Oriential title after the fight went to the scorecards after 10 rounds. The judges scored the fight 96-93, 95-94, 95-94 in favour of Singh. Although the fight was scored close, Singh {{seemed to have the}} fight under control using his height and reach. In round six, Maimaitiali was docked a point for repeated low blows after being warned in previous rounds. Had he not been docked a point, the fight would have ended as a majority draw. After the bout, Singh praised his opponent, [...] "I didn't expect him to fight so well and last the distance. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> would last for a maximum of 5-6 rounds. Hence I didn't fight according to my strategies. I just want to tell China, please don't come to our border. This is for peace." [...] He said about the bout, [...] "The blows disturbed me. He has been fantastic. His aggression was terrific." [...] He also offered the title back to Maimaitiali, as a message for peace. This was in relation to the recent border tension between India and China.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and whisper in his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E
500|$|Professor Milton Greene {{was played}} by guest actor Alan Alda, {{best known for}} his role as Hawkeye Pierce from the {{television}} series M*A*S*H. This was Alda's second appearance, having appeared in the previous episode [...] "Mamma Mia". In a scene of [...] "Kidney Now!", Tracy breaks down crying and says [...] "There is no baby. I was chicken! I was chicken!" [...] then Milton, who sees this, asks [...] "A guy crying about a chicken and a baby? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> was a comedy show." [...] This was a reference to Alda's M*A*S*H character in the series finale episode in which Hawkeye breaks down after realizing he had seen a woman smother her baby to death, not a chicken as Hawkeye had originally recalled in his repressed mind. Comedian actor Chris Parnell, who played Dr. Leo Spaceman in the season finale, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. Comedian actress Sherri Shepherd reprised her role as Angie Jordan, the wife of Tracy, for the fifth time. Paula Pell made her second guest spot as the character Paula Hornberger, the wife of Pete Hornberger, played by Scott Adsit. In [...] "Kidney Now!", Angie and Paula ask Liz for relationship advice. In addition, 30 Rock writers Jack Burditt, Kay Cannon, and Donald Glover appear in the episode; Burditt and Cannon appear in The Vontella Show segment as members from the audience who ask Liz questions. When Tracy accepts an honorary diploma from his former high school, in his speech, Tracy outs Glover's character. The success of the benefit concert for Milton is not explicitly referenced until Alda's character alludes to it in the season five episode [...] "Christmas Attack Zone", though in the season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse", Milton is shown to have finished his book entitled From Peanut to President, a biography of U.S. President Jimmy Carter.|$|E

He states he [...] "very briefly" [...] joined the Bosnian Army Foreign Volunteer Force: [...] "In Bosnia, I did fight for a while.
