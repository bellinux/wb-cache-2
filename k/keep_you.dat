Pea protein has an amino acid profile {{similar to that of}} soy, but pea protein does not elicit {{concerns}} about unknown effects of phytoestrogens. Pea protein is also less allergenic than soy. Pea protein has high fiber content and has no allergic ingredients and therefore is easy for digestion as compared to whey protein. Pea protein is a slow digesting protein and is able to <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> full longer.|$|E

Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one {{so that no one}} may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived.

500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made.

Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely {{knew she was going}} to another level and I was excited for [...] I love to see the creative side.

500|$|Townsend {{assisted}} Gaye with {{producing the}} rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad [...] "If I Should Die Tonight", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. [...] "Just to <b>Keep</b> <b>You</b> Satisfied" [...] was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song's co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of [...] "Just to <b>Keep</b> <b>You</b> Satisfied", which were done by The Originals.

[...] He then addressed the group, [...] "We have made many laws and endeavored in several ways to <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> from among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death will <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> from among us. [...] We desire not your death." [...] Having met his obligation to present {{the position of the}} colony's authorities, he then pronounced, [...] "Hearken now to your sentence of death." [...] William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison. [...] Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.|$|E

500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> on if you don't {{take as much}} money as in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
