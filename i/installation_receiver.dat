40|$|Vibrating {{sources in}} buildings, such as service equipment, {{elevators}} and electric devices, often {{cause a lot}} of noise because of the mechanical excitation of building elements (structure-borne sound). De draft standard prEN 12354 - 5 describes how the normalized sound pressure in a room can be calculated based on the injected structure-borne sound power of an installation in another room. Estimating this power is not simple, because both source properties (<b>installation)</b> as <b>receiver</b> properties (building element) play a role. The draft standard prEN 15657 - 1 delivers a method to do this for sources of which the mobility is much larger than the mobility of the receiving building element, therefore making a measurement of the source mobility unnecessary. In this method, the source is put into operation on a plate that is resiliently connected to the surroundings. The injected power in this so-called “reception plate” is then determined out of the structure-borne sound power in the diffuse velocity field of the plate. In this investigation, the injected structure-borne sound power by an operating fitness vibration plate into three different floors between two acoustical transmission rooms is determined via the reception plate method. The power is also calculated according to the more exact “mobility method”, that takes the source mobility into account. Finally, the results of both methods are compared to each other. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In {{a single}} <b>receiver</b> {{residential}} <b>installation</b> {{there is a}} single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the LNB on the dish. The DC electric power for the LNB is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver. In addition, control signals are also transmitted from the receiver to the LNB through the cable. The receiver uses different power supply voltages (13 / 18 V) to select antenna polarization, and pilot tones (22 kHz) to instruct the LNB to select one of the two frequency bands. In larger installations each band and polarization is given its own cable, so there are 4 cables from the LNB to a switching matrix, which allows the connection of multiple receivers in a star topology using the same signalling method as in a single <b>receiver</b> <b>installation.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeveral error sources can {{contribute}} to the global tracking error of heliostats. These sources can be, for instance, angular offset in the reference position of the tracking mechanisms, imperfect leveling of the heliostat pedestal, lack of perpendicularity between the tracking axes, lack of precise clock synchronization. All these possible errors are characterized by angles that have very specific numerical values for each heliostat in a central <b>receiver</b> <b>installation.</b> However, they are intrinsically random in nature, and the errors in different heliostats are independent from each other. In principle, the overall drift behavior of the heliostats can be characterized by a statistical distribution of tracking errors. This global distribution characterizes the angular deviation of the heliostat normal and is used in ray tracing simulations of heliostat fields. It is usually assumed to be Gaussian, although some authors argue in favor of other types of distributions. In the present work, the dependence of the global tracking error distribution on the above mentioned primary error sources is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Random values are assumed for the different error parameters, and the resulting global tracking error distributions are evaluated for different times of the year for a heliostat field...|$|R

The <b>installation</b> of GPS <b>receivers</b> on board of LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) satellites such as CHAMP and SAC-C offers new opportunities of ionospheric remote sensing. Beside the GPS radio occultation measurements both satellites CHAMP and SAC-C are using a dedicated zenith looking antenna to track permanently several GPS satellites for precise orbit determination.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the use of}} a multi-beaming radar system is {{analyzed}} and a possible setup of a closed loop system (i. e. from measurement and data acquisition to orbit determination) is described. The Orbit Determination (OD) algorithms are specialized for a bistatic radar configuration where the Medicina Northern Cross radio-telescope (owned by the University of Bologna-Italy) is considered as a receiver. The Northern Cross is composed of two perpendicular arms: the E/W arm is 564 m long and consists in a single cylindrical antenna with a width of 29. 4 m, whereas the N/S arm is made of 64 parallel antennas with a length of 22. 6 m and a width of 7. 5 m. The collecting area reaches 27, 400 sqm and, by considering a complete upgrade of the radar with the <b>installation</b> of new <b>receivers</b> on the focal lines, up to 22, 880 possible theoretical independent beams could cover the field-of-view of 55. 47 (E/W) deg x 1. 8 (N/S) deg. By looking at the sequence of beams that are illuminated, it is thus possible to estimate, with an higher level of detail with respect to the single-beam system, the ground track of the transiting object. Given this peculiar system, tailored orbit determination algorithms have to be developed. The orbit determination algorithm receives as input the data processed by the acquisition system, that digitally assembles measured radar echoes, using Fast Fourier Transform, to provide the signal for each beam. These inputs are the measured Doppler shift, time delay, the illumination time and measured power intensity associated to each beam. By combining these information with the knowledge of beam distribution and pointing it is possible to refine the orbital parameters of known objects or to perform a preliminary OD. A few LEO objects are considered to generate simulated data that are then used to feed the developed OD algorithms. In this way the performances of the algorithms can be tested and the effectiveness of this innovative configuration for space debris measurements, that couples a bistatic radar and a multi-beaming receiver, can be assessed...|$|R
40|$|The Ionosphere denotes {{that part}} of the upper {{atmosphere}} which affects significantly radio wave propagation due to its ionization. This property causes as well the scientific interest in the ionosphere. Radio waves used for signal transmission by numerous technical systems are affected by the ionosphere. Above altitudes of about 1000 km the ionosphere fades to the so called plasmasphere. For the correction and simulation of ionospheric/plasmaspheric impacts on radio wave propagation, models of the ionosphere and plasmasphere are needed. A basic requirement for the understanding and modeling of the ionosphere/plasmasphere system are observation data. Due to the difficult observation conditions, the exploration of the upper ionosphere and especially of the plasmasphere is indeed sparse up to now. Existing models are based on comparatively small data sets and are therefore still deficient in some cases. In front of this background, the collection of new ionospheric/plasmaspheric observation data is worthwhile and necessary. The global navigation satellite system GPS uses two different L-band carrier frequencies for signal transmission. The ionosphere represents a dispersive propagation medium for this frequency range. Therefore, simultaneous reception of both GPS signals enables remote sensing of the ionosphere, assuming identical ray paths. Ground based GPS measurements are used successfully since several years to monitor the vertical Total Electron Content (TEC) in an operational manner. The <b>installation</b> of GPS <b>receivers</b> on board of LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) satellites such as CHAMP offers new opportunities of ionospheric/plasmaspheric remote sensing. For precise orbit determination the German small satellite CHAMP performs permanently dual frequency measurements of up to 8 GPS satellites with a sampling rate of 0. 1 Hz, using a dedicated zenith looking antenna. These navigation measurements provide {{for the first time the}} opportunity of a GPS based monitoring of the upper ionosphere and plasmasphere on global scale. This PhD thesis describes the reconstruction of global three dimensional electron density distributions of the upper ionosphere and plasmasphere based on GPS measurements from CHAMP. The methods and algorithms that have been developed in this frame are pointed out in detail. After preprocessing and calibration, link related TEC measurements are derived from the GPS navigation observations on board CHAMP. The three dimensional electron density distribution is reconstructed by assimilating the integrated TEC measurements of a full CHAMP revolution into the ionospheric/plasmaspheric model PIM. For this purpose the discretization of PIM on a global voxel structure is necessary. The assimilation method which has been developed is based on an iterative algorithm. During this procedure the initial model assumption is modified in an multiplicative manner. Finally, the resulting electron density distribution represents the TEC measurements, which had been to assimilate. The reconstruction results are presented for selected assimilation examples by means of two dimensional slices along the respective CHAMP orbit plane. First validation results using electron density measurements from the Langmuir Probe on board CHAMP, from incoherent scatter radars and from ionosondes are promising and show the fundamental suitability of the presented technique for the reconstruction of adequate electron density information from integrated TEC measurements. Considering especially the reconstruction opportunities using GPS measurements of planned LEO missions in the future, such assimilation results may provide a considerable data base for ionospheric/plasmaspheric modeling and research...|$|R
