50|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} a single interior space, with no subdivisions, and no mouthpiece. This is most appropriate to free flow systems.In this arrangement the diver can talk clearly, including talking with other divers underwater. This allows communications equipment (usually an <b>intercom</b> <b>wire</b> or by modulated ultrasound) to be installed in the mask and is very useful for working divers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Intercom</b> - Two <b>wire</b> or Four <b>wire</b> <b>intercom</b> allows {{everyone}} on the production able to communicate quickly and effectively.|$|R
50|$|A {{wireless}} intercom is {{a telecommunications}} device that enables voice communication {{without the need}} to run copper <b>wires</b> between <b>intercom</b> stations. A <b>wired</b> <b>intercom</b> system may incorporate wireless elements.|$|R
25|$|An {{obsolete}} use for seven-pin XLR connectors was analogue {{lighting control}} signals, {{as well as}} for <b>wired</b> <b>intercom</b> in broadcast studios, specifically with Ward-Beck intercoms.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{intercom}} systems communicated over {{a set of}} low-voltage signal wires {{installed in}} {{the walls of a}} building. The installation was typically done during the building’s construction, but buildings could be retrofitted with communication wires, at a cost. Non-radio [...] "wireless" [...] intercom designs were developed that used a building's existing electrical wiring to carry communication signals. Such systems work similarly to normal <b>wired</b> <b>intercom</b> designs, with <b>intercom</b> stations using <b>wires</b> to connect to electrical outlets in rooms. This method of intercom connection is most useful in offices and homes served by a single electrical service. Products are available from a variety of manufacturers including Westinghouse and GE.|$|R
5000|$|Power line {{communication}} {{units that}} send signal over house wiring have {{been referred to}} as [...] "wireless" [...] intercoms. Though they are technically <b>wired</b> <b>intercoms,</b> they are based on existing wiring and thus require no additional wires.|$|R
50|$|One {{reason to}} use a {{wireless}} intercom system is {{that the cost of}} retrofitting a building for a <b>wired</b> <b>intercom</b> system is high. Another reason is the increased portability of a wireless system. With battery-powered radio frequency wireless intercom units, a person can carry a station as they walk around.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>intercom</b> is {{inherently}} private, {{so long as}} the wiring system isn't tapped by outside parties. Wireless intercom is not inherently private; conversations on a wireless intercom are broadcast using publicly available wireless frequencies which means other users with similar devices could listen in if they are within range. Most units on the market will allow intercom conversations to be heard through other devices such as scanners, baby monitors, cordless telephones, or the same brand of wireless intercom.|$|R
50|$|A hard <b>wire</b> <b>intercom</b> {{appears to}} have been {{provided}} between Sieber and the engineers in the launch bunker using a system similar to that used in the manned glider flights. Around 1100 am, the M23 was ready for take-off. Low stratus clouds lay over the Ocksenkopf. The Walter liquid-fueled rocket motor built up to full thrust and Sieber pushed the button to ignite the four solid boosters. With a roar, the M23 rose out of a cloud of steam and rocket smoke straight up, displaying its camouflage paintwork. At an altitude of about 100 to 150 m, the Natter suddenly pitched backwards into an inverted curve. Initially it climbed at about 30° to the vertical. At about 500 m the cockpit canopy was seen to fly off. The Natter continued to climb at high speed at an angle of 15° from the horizontal and disappeared into the clouds. The Walter motor stalled about 15 seconds after take-off. It is estimated the Natter reached 1500 m, at which point it nose-dived and hit the ground with great force about 32 seconds later, some kilometres from the launch site. Unknown at the time, one of the Schmidding boosters failed to jettison and its remains were dug up at the crash site in 1998.|$|R
50|$|For {{installations}} {{where it}} is not desirable or possible to run wires to support an intercom system, wireless intercom systems are available. There are two major benefits of a wireless intercom system over the traditional <b>wired</b> <b>intercom.</b> The first is that installation is much easier since no wires have to be run between intercom units. The second {{is that you can}} easily move the units at any time. With that convenience and ease of installation comes a risk of interference from other wireless and electrical devices. Nearby wireless devices such as cordless telephones, wireless data networks, and remote audio speakers, as well as structural features in your building, can all interfere. Electrical devices such as motors, lighting fixtures and transformers can cause noise. There may be concerns about privacy since conversations may be picked up on a scanner, baby monitor, cordless phone, or a similar device on the same frequency. Encrypted wireless intercoms can reduce or eliminate privacy risks, while placement, installation, construction, grounding and shielding methods can reduce or eliminate the detrimental effects of external interference. The United States and Canada have several frequency ranges for wireless intercom systems and other wireless products. They are 49 MHz, FM band (200KH - 270 kHz), 494-608 MHz, 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5.8 GHz, and MURS (150 MHz). IP Intercoms are now appearing that connect a Master to an IP Substation elsewhere on the Internet, via an Ethernet port. Wireless intercoms can also run over a mesh network that allows near-instant communication throughout a house.|$|R
