25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to <b>do</b> <b>there,</b> although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E
25|$|Tank bottom weights {{provide a}} much shorter lever arm, so {{need to be}} a much larger {{proportion}} of the total ballast, but do not interfere with propulsive efficiency the way ankle weights <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> are not really any other convenient places below the weight belt to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so {{there is no need for}} longitudinal trimming.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres varies between species. For example, human chromosomes {{do not have}} mega-telomeres while mice and many species of birds <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> is also variation in their structure and location within the same species. In mice and birds, mega-telomeres regions are observed to be hypervariable, meaning {{that there is a}} high degree of polymorphism in the size and position of mega-telomeres between individuals, including those of highly inbred lines. Analysis of siblings from highly inbred chicken-lines have suggested that these ultra-long telomeric sequences are extremely heterogenous. Similar observations of heterogeneity have also been made in mice.|$|E

25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is good to be occupied and to have something to <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently.

500|$|Greg Mueller from GameSpot {{recommends}} {{the game for}} its value but sees it as [...] "not an absolutely essential expansion" [...] and rates some of the later quests as repetitive and uninspired. Similar comments followed from GamePro reviewer Newton, who found that it is [...] "an impressive expansion" [...] which [...] "delivers more of what made Oblivion great: creative quests, a huge land to explore, and tons of things to <b>do</b> <b>there,</b> [...] making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was {{a fan of the}} core game". Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is [...] "the same game as it ever was, only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop, and less interesting questing". Charles Onyett from IGN rates it as [...] "an entirely worthy addition to Bethesda's stellar fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series" [...] and as [...] "a great excuse to jump back in [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the damage}} they <b>do,</b> <b>there</b> have been {{attempts}} to control the numbers of both native and introduced populations of common starlings. Within the natural breeding range, this may be affected by legislation. For example, in Spain, this is a species hunted commercially as a food item, and has a close season, whereas in France, it is classed as a pest, and the season in which it may be killed covers {{the greater part of}} the year. In Great Britain Starlings are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it [...] "illegal to intentionally kill, injure or take a starling, or to take, damage or destroy an active nest or its contents". The Wildlife Order in Northern Ireland allows, with a general licence, [...] "an authorised person to control starlings to prevent serious damage to agriculture or preserve public health and safety". This species is migratory, so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly affected. In Europe, the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long-term results. Non-lethal techniques such as scaring with visual or auditory devices have only a temporary effect in any case.|$|E

The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can." [...] They also stated that their thoughts were [...] "with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation." [...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use." [...] On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from [...] "not guilty" [...] to [...] "guilty" [...] and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.|$|E

500|$|After Halo 3, {{development}} studio Bungie {{created an}} internal team {{to work on}} Peter Jackson's planned Halo game, Halo Chronicles. Chronicles was eventually canceled and the team began working on a standalone expansion project—Halo 3: ODST—while another team, led by creative director Marcus Lehto and design lead Christian Allen, worked on Reach. The team considered many different concepts and approaches to the game; among the rejected ideas was a sequel to Halo 3. The team eventually settled on a prequel to the first Halo game in brainstorming sessions. It would {{take place on the}} planet Reach, during a pivotal time in the war. [...] "Reach, as a fictional planet, was just a great candidate [...] play around with. It's such a rich world, with such a great fiction surrounding it," [...] said Lehto. [...] "We were like: 'Okay, that's it. We've just got a lot of things we can <b>do</b> <b>there</b> so we can build an immense story with it.'" [...] No longer burdened with continuing the story threads of the Halo trilogy, Bungie used Reach to introduce new characters and settings. As Reach ends with the destruction of the titular planet, Bungie wanted to be sure players still felt a sense of accomplishment and success. [...] "It is a challenge overall to ensure the player feels they're doing the right thing {{all the way to the}} end," [...] said Lehto.|$|E
500|$|Major {{parts of}} the song [...] "Sadda Haq" [...] were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the {{backdrop}} were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, [...] "I am not concerned at all. I {{have been out of}} India for long and don’t know whats going on, but I don’t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie is not to make any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue." [...] However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: [...] "The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily, and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn’t <b>do.</b> <b>There</b> were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames." [...] The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a [...] "Free Tibet" [...] banner featured in the song.|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to <b>do?</b> <b>There</b> wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
