5|$|Vesta is {{currently}} {{one of only}} six identified Solar System bodies of which we have physical samples, coming {{from a number of}} meteorites suspected to be Vestan fragments. It is estimated that 1 out of 16 meteorites originated from Vesta. The other identified Solar System samples are from Earth itself, meteorites from Mars, meteorites <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> and samples returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> the comet Wild 2, and the asteroid 25143 Itokawa.|$|E
5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of the Great Wall myth. Examples of this myth's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China is visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> or Mars.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the E ring comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
50|$|OSIRIS-REx II was a 2012 {{proposal}} {{to replicate the}} original spacecraft for a double mission, with the second vehicle collecting samples <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two <b>moons</b> of Mars, Phobos and Deimos.

5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost all {{the rocks}} show {{evidence}} of impact process effects. Many samples {{appear to be}} pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> are highly brecciated {{as a result of}} being subjected to multiple impact events.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon.</b> Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors {{denotes the}} rank of each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and do not follow the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon.</b> The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to the Engineer ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with the Engineer, who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as the Engineer launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes the Engineer and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to the Engineer home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations. Together, they depart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> aboard an Engineer ship.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of the Earth. The Earth continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|Sentinel {{uses the}} Pillars to {{transport}} hundreds of concealed Decepticons <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> to Earth. Carly is later captured by Gould, who is {{revealed to be}} in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Megatron's second-in-command, Starscream, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Gould reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld of Cybertron to the Solar System, then to enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> {{are extremely}} old compared to rocks found on Earth, {{as measured by}} radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
5|$|While Rinoa {{is being}} treated on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia uses her to free Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to {{activate}} the Lunatic Pandora facility, inciting a rain of creatures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> that sends Adel's containment device to the planet. Having selected Adel as her next host, Ultimecia abandons Rinoa in outer space. Squall rescues her, and they return to the planet on a derelict starship. Upon their landing, delegates from Esthar isolate Rinoa for fear of her sorceress abilities, forcing Squall to rescue her. They are met by the President of Esthar who reveals himself to be Laguna and apologizes for the incident and announces Dr. Odine's plan to let Ultimecia possess Rinoa, have Ellone send Rinoa (and thus Ultimecia as well) {{to the past and}} then retrieve only Rinoa back to the present, enabling Ultimecia to achieve Time Compression, as it would allow Squall's group to confront Ultimecia in her time. To do this, Squall's team infiltrates Lunatic Pandora, defeats Seifer and Adel, and has Rinoa inherit Adel's sorceress powers. Time Compression is thus initiated; Squall and his allies travel to Ultimecia's era and defeat her.|$|E
