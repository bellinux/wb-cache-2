5|$|Upon gaining {{independence}} in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of <b>its</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{and played a}} leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in South Africa. One notable exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with Israel throughout the 1960s.

The final effects of the war also contributed to the development of a more diverse and cosmopolitan Australian society.|$|E

Biya has clashed with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich Bakassi peninsula (however, this was resolved with the Greentree Agreement) and with Gabon's president, El Hadj Omar Bongo, over personal rivalries.|$|E

5|$|The {{developments}} in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital {{interests in the}} Río de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. <b>Its</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mauá) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow.|$|E
5|$|To counter {{powerful}} neighbors {{such as the}} Kingdom of Dali (934–1253), the Song made {{alliances with}} tribal groups in southwest China which served as a protective buffer between their borders and Dali's. As long as these ethnic tribal groups paid tribute to the Song court and agreed to follow the course of <b>its</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> the Song agreed to grant military protection and allow the tribal leaders hereditary, autonomous local rule. During the 1050s, the Song put down local tribal insurrections along their borders with the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt, while their relations with Tai peoples and alliances with local clan leaders in the southern frontier led to a border war with Lý from 1075 to 1077.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia {{deteriorated}} in {{the aftermath}} of the May Overthrow in 1903. Almost immediately, the new Karađorđević government aligned itself with the Russian Empire and oriented <b>its</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> away from its long time patron, the Habsburgs, and Austria-Hungary. In 1906, Austria-Hungary closed its border to Serbian agricultural exports in an episode known as the Pig War. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina—a territory with a large Serb population that it had been granted by the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The annexation prompted the Serbian public to call for war with Austria-Hungary. With no promise of Russian support in the event of war, the Serbian government decided against pursuing the matter militarily. Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf boasted that it would take Austro-Hungary only three months to defeat Serbia should war erupt between the two nations.|$|E
