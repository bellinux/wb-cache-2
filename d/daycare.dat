5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the <b>daycare</b> center, babies are perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers.

40|$|Residential {{restrictions}} for {{sex offenders}} {{have become increasingly}} popular, {{despite the lack of}} empirical data suggesting that offenders' proximity to schools or <b>daycares</b> contributes to recidivism. Using a matched sample of recidivists and nonrecidivists from Florida (n = 330) for the period from 2004 through 2006, the authors investigated whether sex offenders who lived closer to schools or <b>daycares</b> were more likely to reoffend sexually against children than those who lived farther away. No {{significant differences were found between}} the distances that recidivists and nonrecidivists lived from schools and <b>daycares.</b> There was no significant relationship between reoffending and proximity to schools or <b>daycares.</b> The results indicate that proximity to schools and <b>daycares,</b> with other risk factors being comparable, does not appear to contribute to sexual recidivism. These data do not support the widespread enactment of residential restrictions for sexual offenders. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} day surgery for inguinal hernia. Design: A randomised prospective study of patients presenting for elective inguinal hernia repair.
