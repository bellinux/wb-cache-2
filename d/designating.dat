In 2005, Lipmaa, Wang, and Bao identified a new essential security property, non delegatability, of <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes. Briefly, in a non delegatability <b>designated</b> verifier signature scheme, neither a signer nor a <b>designated</b> verifier can delegate the signing rights to any third party without revealing their secret keys. However, this paper shows that four recently proposed strong <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes are delegatable. These schemes do not satisfy non delegatability secure requirement of strong <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes...|$|R
