30|$|The {{observed}} {{variation of}} the polar component is a direct evidence of deep modification of elementary physical interactions with the studied surfaces. Polar interactions include a few basic purely electrostatic interactions that involve the charge of ions and the permanent <b>dipole</b> <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> molecules. Charge–charge, charge–dipole and dipole–dipole interactions (Debye interactions) belong to this category as well as orientation interactions (Keesom interactions). UV treatment of diamond particles, strengthening the polar component, decreases slightly the dispersive component. UV light causes decomposition of organic contaminations on solid surfaces and leads to surface cleaning [38, 39]. It stimulates adsorption of atmospheric water on the diamond surface [40]. Such a modification leads to increasing its hydrophilic state.|$|E

The polarization data show a reversal in the sign of the circular polarization when lambda is greater than about 5000 A, which lasts for about 0. 1 in phase and which is not present during a high state. The reversal can be interpreted {{as the result of the}} dominance of photospheric radiation at these phases. The photometric observations show, for the first time, nearly sinusoidal UBV light curves with minima shifted by 0. 5 in phase from previous high-state observations. This behavior is explained by assuming that the radiation in the blue bands is dominated by blackbody emission from the heated photosphere near the accretion region. The spectroscopic observations show broad, resolvable cyclotron harmonics and strong photospheric Zeeman features. Theoretical models suggest the presence of a <b>dipole</b> <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> field strength of about 31 MG offset by about - 0. 1 Rwd from the center of the white dwarf along the dipole axis.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} simple {{case of an}} {{external}} field acting on noninteracting particles, a formulation of the self-consistent field theory for treating proteins and unfolded protein chains with multiple interacting titratable groups is given. Electrostatic interactions between the titratable groups are approximated by a Debye-Huckel expression. Amino acid residues are treated as polarizable bodies with a single dielectric constant. Dielectric properties of protein molecules are {{described in terms of}} local dielectric constants determined by the space distribution of residue volume density around each ionized residue. Calculations are based on average charges of titratable groups, distance of separation between them, on their pKa's, residue volumes and on the local dielectric constant. A set of different residue volumes is used to analyze the influence of the permanent <b>dipole</b> <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> parts of the residue on calculated titration curves, electrostatic contribution to the free energy of protein stability, and pK shifts. Calculations with zero volumes [...] which means that charged portions of protein molecules are viewed as part of the high dielectric medium [...] give good agreement with experimental data. The theory was tested against most accurate approaches currently available for the calculation of the pKa's of ionizable groups based upon finite difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (FDPB). For 70 theoretically calculated pKa's in a total of six proteins the accuracy of the approach presented here is assessed by comparison of computed pKa's with that measured. The overall root-mean-square error is 0. 79, compared to the value 0. 89 obtained by FDPB approach given in the paper of Antosiewicz et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 238 : 415 - 436, 1994). The test of Debye-Huckel approximation for the electrostatic pair interactions shows that it is in excellent agreement with experimental data as well as the calculations of the FDPB and Tanford-Kirkwood methods on the pK shifts of His 64 in the active site of subtilisin over the whole range of ionic strengths.

A mixture of boron (B) and boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) powder was used as a new precursor to grow such nano-rough films.

The presence of guest molecules, such as template molecules, adsorbates, or water, modifies the position and sharpness of the phase transition.

Molecules possess several features that greatly increase the possibilities for new interactions, collective quantum states and effects, collisional processes, fundamental symmetry tests and chemical processes.

Several approaches towards trapping of molecules, the key first step toward studying ultracold molecules at high density, have already succeeded: direct cooling of molecules via a buffer gas, mechanical slowing of a pulsed molecular beam with electric fields and photoassociation of alkali atoms.

This is {{in stark contrast to}} the dilute gases of ultracold atoms, which have isotropic and extremely short-range, or "contact", interactions. The large electric <b>dipole</b> moment <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> molecules can be tuned with an external electric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold chemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of novel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed at observing the influence <b>of</b> <b>dipoles</b> on ultracold molecules, only recently have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a dramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be understood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for scattering <b>of</b> fermionic <b>polar</b> molecules. We directly observe the spatial anisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction rates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble <b>of</b> ultracold <b>polar</b> molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to suppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions...|$|R

The interactions of the guest molecule 2 -(N, N dimethylamino) - 5 -nitroacetanilide (DAN) with a polycarbonate and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) host are compared. A detailed characterisation of the two systems is described employing infra red spectroscopy and analysis of the chromophore alignment during electric field poling. The study reveals that hydrogen bond formation between the guest and the polar polycarbonate backbone accounts for the unusually good alignment stability previously reported in the polycarbonate system. The molecular hyperpolarisibility of DAN in PMMA is also measured and the apparent enhancement compared with solution measurements is accounted for by the more <b>polar</b> nature <b>of</b> the polymer environment.

The coarse-grained formulation {{is based on}} the wavevector-dependent correlation functions <b>of</b> molecular <b>dipoles</b> <b>of</b> the host <b>polar</b> liquid and a density-density structure factor of the positions of the solutes. A nonlinear dependence of the absorption coefficient on the solute concentration is predicted and originates from the mutual polarization of the liquid surrounding the solutes by the collective field <b>of</b> the solute <b>dipoles</b> aligned along the radiation field. The theory is applied to terahertz absorption of hydrated saccharides and proteins. While the theory gives an excellent account of the observations for saccharides without additional assumptions and fitting parameters, experimental absorption coefficient of protein solutions significantly exceeds theoretical calculations within standard dielectric models and shows a peak against the protein concentration. A substantial polarization of protein's hydration shell is required to explain the differences between standard theories and experiment. When the correlation function <b>of</b> the total <b>dipole</b> moment <b>of</b> the protein with its hydration shell from numerical simulations is used in the present analytical model an absorption peak similar to that seen is experiment is obtained.

40|$|Measurements of the {{impedance}} of erythrocyte suspensions made by Fricke (1) and McClendon (2) {{have been}} interpreted as possibly leading {{to the conclusion that}} the impedance is due to a thin layer of nonconducting material of molecular dimensions surrounding the erythrocytes. Assuming a dielectric constant of 3, Fricke's calculations give a thickness of 33 /~, which led him to suggest that the non-conducting layer was unimolecular. The low conductivity would point to a layer of lipoid molecules, for it is difficult to see how hydrated protein molecules could form a layer of such low conductivity. Since any calculation of thickness from impedance measurements depends on assumptions as to dielectric constant, a discussion of the probable value of this constant for thin films becomes important. If the lipoid layer is solid, 3 is a probable value, being the average value for organic substances in the solid state. If the lipoid layer is liquid, as is probably the case in the erythrocyte, more factors have to be taken into consideration, for organic liquids generally have considerably larger dielectric constants. The main contribution to the dielectric constant of naturally occurring lipoids comes from the polar groups (carboxyl, amino, etc.) of the molecules. The contribution of the hydrocarbon part of the molecules is minute. When an electric field is applied to a lipoid in the solid state tl{e electrical <b>dipoles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>polar</b> groups are unable to rotate the molecules as much as if the substance were liquid, and consequently lipoids have much lower dielectric constants in the solid than in the liquid state.

Analysis of the density of interface states shows that La-Si bonds at the c-LaAlO 3 (001) /Si(001) interface do not create interface states in the silicon band gap, in contrast to Hf-Si bonds in m-HfO 2 (001) /Si(001) interfaces studied previously...|$|R
40|$|Bismuth {{vanadate}} (BiVO 4) is {{a promising}} material for photoelectrochemical water splitting and photocatalytic degradation of organic moieties. We evaluate the ionization potentials of the (010) surface termination of BiVO 4 using first-principles simulations. The electron removal {{energy of the}} pristine termination (7. 2 eV) validates recent experimental reports. The effect of water absorption on the ionization potentials is considered using static models as well as structures obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Owing to the large molecular <b>dipole</b> <b>of</b> H 2 O, adsorption stabilizes the valence band edge (downward band bending), thereby increasing the ionization potentials. These results provide new understanding to the role <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> layers on complex oxide semiconductors, with importance for the design of efficient photoelectrodes for water splitting...|$|R

[...] [URL] {{developments}} {{in the context of}} quantum information theory, together with the superb experimental control on quantum systems attained {{in the last couple of}} decades, are giving rise to the appearance of a new field of research and development¿quantum technologies¿the use of quantum protocols and system to enhance available technology or even develop totally new devices [1]. Within this field, quantum metrology or quantum sensing focuses in establishing the measurement uncertainties achievable according to quantum mechanics, to devise physical systems able to test them, and to design new measurement devices that translate these findings into practical applications [2]. Building on the exquisite control and precise detection methods available for trapped atomics ions [3], we have developed two proposals to use them as quantum probes of weak and/or short-pulsed electric fields. In our first proposal, we measure and stabilize the carrier-envelope-offset phase of a femtosecond frequency comb by multipulse quantum interferometry¿a new interferometry protocol that uses a trapped ion as a nonlinear detector of the pulse-to-pulse phase variations of a fast train of laser pulses [4]. Our second work relies again on trapped ions, together with quantum logic and state-dependent forces, to determine the electric <b>dipole</b> moment <b>of</b> a <b>polar</b> molecule by measuring the extremely weak electric field that this produces on the nearby probe ion [5, 6].

40|$|Abstract: Ripple phase {{modelling}} was achievable {{by taking}} into consideration the <b>dipole</b> structure <b>of</b> the <b>polar</b> heads <b>of</b> model membrane molecules. Computer simulations enabled the selective analysis of a model membrane. Considering only the hydrophobic part of the lipid membrane, the gel-fluid transition stage can be obtained in such a simulation. Assuming an additional degree of freedom, the entire molecule can move along the normal to the membrane surface projected from two C-C bonds. The amounts of shifted lipids were 17 % and 33 % at temperatures of 300 K (gel) and 330 K (fluid), respectively. Taking into account only polar head interactions in media of different ionic strength I, dielectric constant ε, and an effective charge and temperature, we could observe the same behaviour of the examined system independently {{of the values of}} I and ε when the charge was reduced to q/ 2. The amount of shifted heads at 300 K decreases sharply with the reduced charge value, with an accompanying increase in the number <b>of</b> “standing ” <b>polar</b> heads. Summing up, it can be stated that hydrocarbon lipid chains exhibit a greater tendency to displacement in the fluid state than in the gel state. However, the polar heads behave in the opposite way: there are more displaced heads at 300 K than at 330 K. Thus, the overall analysis of the interactions between the molecules of the model membrane should enable us to find model parameters suitable for studying the lipid membrane at a wide range of temperatures. Finally, an electrostatic profile close to the membrane surface could be estimated in different membrane states. This should be useful in membrane-biologically active compound interaction analysis...|$|R

But we can not calculate the EDM of an atom using Boltzmann constant. The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> atoms by which orientation polarization arises completely differs from polar molecules. The orientation polarization <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> molecule, such as HCl or H 2 O etc, is a molecule as a whole turned toward the direction of an external field. Unlike polar molecules, the orientation polarization <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> atom, such as K, Rb or Cs atom, is only the valence electron in the outermost shell, along a highly elliptical orbit, turned toward {{the direction of the}} field, {{but the rest of the}} atom does not move! The article derived the new form of Boltzmann constant. When it was applied to orientation polarization <b>of</b> <b>polar</b> atoms, its value k is far less than 1. 38 * 10 - 23 J/K(for example, k= 7. 14 * 10 - 29 J/K for Cs atom).
