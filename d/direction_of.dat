40|$|We {{can observe}} that people {{familiar}} with an environment give route <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> varying granularity to other locals. Such route directions are typically shorter than the turn based <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> current navigation services, and contain only references of high relevance to the wayfinder. Studying these route <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> varying granularity reveals that {{they are intended to}} be memorized, a property that requires a low cognitive workload of the wayfinder during their usage. The short-term memory span of humans imposes a limit on the amount and the structure of information communicated.
