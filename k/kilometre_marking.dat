50|$|Final: 5.30 p.m After a very {{energetic}} race {{up to the}} 500 metres mark, {{where the}} two boats still lay side by side, the Germans began {{to take the lead}} and, at the <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark,</b> Ludwigshafen were about one length ahead. Thames R. C. fought pluckily, however, and stroke Bruce Logan deserves every credit for the courageous way in which he challenged the leader. But at the Englishmen's last spurt between the bath-nouse and the bridge, {{it was clear that the}} crew was done for, while the Germans, on the other hand, rowed with still greater energy than before. Ludwigshafen won brilliantly by a good two lengths, and passed the post in excellent condition.|$|R
5000|$|This {{stage is}} {{relatively}} flat, {{with only two}} category 4 climbs, and was the last opportunity for the sprinters to shine before the race went into the mountains. On the 40th anniversary {{of the death of}} Tom Simpson, [...] rider Bradley Wiggins led from the two <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark</b> and at one stage was 18 minutes clear, but riding alone took its toll and with seven kilometres left he was reeled in. That left Tom Boonen to beat Óscar Freire and Erik Zabel in a sprint finish for his first Tour stage win in two years. After the stage Wiggins revealed his lone breakaway was a gift to his wife on her birthday, with Wiggins only finding out about the date's significance after the race.|$|R

Initially, he was thought to have broken his femur and arm, but later it was learned that this was not the case. He suffered a broken arm but never lost consciousness and was taken to a nearby hospital in Cuneo. During this Tour, Pereiro was working for [...] team captain Alejandro Valverde but when it became clear in the Pyrenees that Valverde had lost too much time, he and Valverde managed to maintain placings in the top 20 riders.|$|R
50|$|In Neustadt an der Weinstrasse the Rehbach splits off to {{the left}} at the Winzinger Wassergescheid, {{carrying}} one third of the water. The Speyerbach then flows through a narrow valley in the hill country of the German Wine Route; both sides of the valley are lined with vineyards. It then continues through the Upper Rhine Valley, in a South-Easterly direction. In Speyerdorf the Ranschgraben splits {{off to the}} left. Here, the Speyerbach flows through the municipalities of Hanhofen and Dudenhofen. At the Hanhofer Wassergescheid, the Mühlbachgraben joins from the right, and the Woogbach split off on the left, taking half the water. Two more tributaries join in the next 3 kilometres: the Modenbach and the Hainbach. In Speyer, the Woogbach rejoins, and then the Speyerbach flows into the Rhine in the port of Speyer, at Rhine <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark</b> 400.3.|$|R
50|$|The line {{continues}} north, but sees limited traffic beyond Werris Creek. The line {{reaches the}} major New England towns of Tamworth and Armidale, {{the latter being}} the northernmost extent of service on the line. Until the mid-2000s freight traffic continued to the disused station at Dumaresq which {{is home to a}} now-also-disused agricultural fertilizer depot. There is now wire across the corridor at several points between Armidale and Dumaresq, after which the line is closed. A block is placed across the tracks a short distance from Dumaresq, at the 590 <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark.</b> North of Glen Innes the line, and particularly its bridges, have fallen into disrepair. In December 1991 the line was severed when the Roads & Traffic Authority built a deviation of the New England Highway over the line at Bluff Rock south of Tenterfield. At Wallangarra, the line met Queensland Railways' Southern railway line.|$|R
50|$|Catarina Ribeiro (Portugal) made {{an early}} break to a lead of almost 30 {{seconds in the}} first five {{kilometres}} of the race, but shortly after the 10 <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark</b> she was caught by the peloton. Alyson Dixon (Great Britain) had by that stage made a counter-attack, and held a lead of more than 30 seconds by half way. A group of 14 caught and passed her. That pack, including Dixon stayed together for 10K then, largely under pressure from Amy Cragg (United States), this group was reduced to nine, before Rose Chelimo (Bahrain) went off the front, chased and eventually passed by Edna Kiplagat (Kenya), but Chelimo stayed in her shadow. Behind them Flomena Cheyech Daniel had a small lead on Cragg for bronze. As the finish on Tower Bridge came into view, Chelimo passed Kiplagat and went on to win by seven seconds. Meanwhile Cragg had pulled even with Daniel. Kiplagat looked content with for silver as Cragg was sprinting away from Daniel. Suddenly catching Kiplagat looked possible. Kiplagat narrowly retained second as Cragg was given the same finishing time.|$|R
50|$|An {{initiative}} of the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG) brought {{a new approach to}} the line. Following its success on the neighbouring Alb Valley Railway from Karlsruhe to Bad Herrenalb, it suggested in March 1995 that the line be adapted for light rail (stadtbahn) operations. The attractiveness of the line in Bad Wildbad would be increased if it was extended to the spa park (Kurpark).With the political support of the state of Baden-Württemberg and the adjacent municipalities and districts, the line was taken over by AVG on 1 January 2000 under a 25 years lease from Deutsche Bahn and the line began to be converted for light rail operations. This included the modernisation of the tracks, the electrification of the line and the renovation of Brötzingen station; the unused station building still stands at the 0 <b>kilometre</b> <b>mark.</b> New stations were established at Maihälden Pforzheim, Brötzingen Sandweg, Brötzingen Wohnlichstraße, Neuenbürg Freibad, Rotenbach, Eyachbrücke, Höfen Nord, Calmbach Süd and Bad Wildbad Nord; one more stations at Pforzheim Durlacher Straße is planned. Calmbach station became a crossing station and new signals were installed.|$|R
50|$|The {{trail is}} very well <b>marked</b> with <b>kilometre</b> posts <b>marking</b> both the {{distance}} to the next campsite or section as well as the total length of the walk to go.

These notice boards also show elevation graphs of the walk and alert walkers to potential dangers.|$|R
