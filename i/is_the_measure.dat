5|$|Students were {{enrolled}} {{from throughout the}} city. Often the school was used to reassign students {{who could not be}} enrolled into other high schools. As of the 2006-2007 school year, Arlington enrolled 1,825 students. The plurality were Asian, at 48%, with Black, 35% and Hispanic, 11% being the other major ethnic groups. 5% of students identified as White. The school has the highest rate of poverty in high schools from the Saint Paul Public School system with 89% of students qualifying for Free and Reduced Price Lunch. Free and Reduced Price Lunch <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of poverty for the district. The school has a large percentage of students who have limited English proficiency (58%). 14% of students qualify for special education. The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 83% while roughly three out of five students who initially enroll graduate within 4 years. 35% of students had grade level reading proficiency and 13% of students had proficiency in mathematics. Enrollment dropped considerably in the last years with only 875 students enrolled in 2010 and projections of only 650 for 2011.|$|E

The next step, to correct for fractionation, {{can be done}} using either the / ratio or the / ratio, and also depends on {{which of the two}} {{possible}} standards was measured: HOxI or HoxII. R'std is then R'HOxI or R'HOxII, depending on which standard <b>was</b> used. <b>The</b> four possible equations are as follows. First, if <b>the</b> / ratio <b>is</b> used to perform the fractionation correction, the following two equations apply, one for each standard.|$|R

25|$|In electromagnetism, {{permittivity}} or absolute permittivity, usually {{denoted by}} the Greek letter ε (epsilon), <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field {{in a particular}} medium. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of electric flux in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity. Thus, permittivity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of a material's ability to resist an electric field, not its ability to ‘permit’ it (as the name ‘permittivity’ might seem to suggest).|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol is {{measured}} in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) {{of blood in the}} United States and some other countries. In the United Kingdom, most European countries and Canada, millimoles per liter of blood (mmol/Ll) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} measure an angle θ, a {{circular}} arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. {{with a pair}} of compasses. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of the angle in radians.|$|E
25|$|Radiographic density <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> {{of overall}} darkening of the image. Density is a {{logarithmic}} unit {{that describes the}} ratio between light hitting the film and light being transmitted through the film. A higher radiographic density represents more opaque areas of the film, and lower density more transparent areas of the film.|$|E
25|$|A reaction's cross section, denoted σ, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of the {{probability}} that a fusion reaction will happen. This depends on the relative velocity of the two nuclei. Higher relative velocities generally increase {{the probability}}, but the probability begins to decrease again at very high energies. Cross sections for many fusion reactions were measured (mainly in the 1970s) using particle beams.|$|E

25|$|If heat {{capacity}} is measured for a well defined amount of substance, the specific heat <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> {{of the heat}} required to increase the temperature of such a unit quantity by one unit of temperature. For example, to raise the temperature of water by one kelvin (equal to one degree Celsius) requires 4186 joules per kilogram (J/kg).|$|E
25|$|Body {{image is}} often {{measured}} {{by asking the}} subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The {{difference between these two}} values <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of body dissatisfaction. There are many negative effects that body dissatisfaction can have these include: that some research suggests a link between body dissatisfaction in girls and smoking. Also having this body dissatisfaction can affect a girl’s comfort with her sexuality when she’s older and may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|According to kin {{selection}} theory, relatedness {{is extremely}} important in reproductive behavior. This is because by favoring offspring that are close relatives, this individual can {{increase the likelihood of}} its genes being passed into the next generation. Like most Vespula wasps, V. acadica has high effective paternity(>2). This derived trait <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of queen mating frequency, and it also takes into account the use of sperm. Evidence indicates that the opportunity for multiple matings is present for V. acadica, even though the queens do not participate in these matings.|$|E

25|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of {{how much}} light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID burners give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID burner produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption means less fuel consumption, with resultant less CO2 emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of engine running time is with the lights on).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} analyser characteristics. The mass resolving power <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> {{of the ability}} to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006–2007 school year, Washburn {{enrolled}} 1,217 students. The same year, {{the school}} reported a racial makeup of 50.7% Black, 26.0% White, 12.2% Hispanic, 7.7% Asian and 3.4% American Indian. The {{majority of students}} qualify for Free and Reduced Price Lunch with 60%. Free and Reduced Price Lunch <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> of poverty for the district. 18% of students have limited English proficiency and 13% of students qualify for special education. The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 89.94% while district-wide 43.7% of students graduated during the 2003–2004 school year. 29% of students met or exceeded the standards in the 10th grade Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment Series II test, while 14% met or exceeded the standards for the 11th grade MCAS test in 2007.|$|E
