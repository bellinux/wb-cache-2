40|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>leakages</b> of high {{pressure}} and temperature steam valves {{have been identified}} as a potential contributor to a loss in power generating plant efficiency. These losses are often neglected due to it being difficult to detect problematic valves and quantify the <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through them. A non-intrusive NOT technique that detects and quantifies <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through valves will be a very favourable tool to any power generating plant as it will allow for the early detection of <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> and could possibly provide considerable financial savings. This research evaluates different monitoring techniques suitable for detecting and quantifying <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through valves and selects a technique that is most suitable for application in a power generating plant environment. The proposed technique utilises infra-red thermography to calculate pipe surface temperatures on a length of un-insulated pipe located downstream of a valve that is leaking internally. As the leakage steam flows through the length of un-insulated pipe, it will lose a portion of its heat energy through the pipe wall to the surrounding environment. This will result in a drop in temperature of the steam from the upstream to downstream points of the un-insulated length of pipe. By calculating the heat loss and the drop in temperature of the leakage steam, a mass flow rate of the leakage steam can be determined. A mathematical model was derived which with inputs of upstream and downstream pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe, pipe properties and ambient air conditions, calculates the heat loss, the temperature drop and the resulting mass flow rate of the leakage flow through the valve. A detailed experimental study was conducted to validate the proposed technique in determining <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> thought steam valves. Steam generated from a mini steam generating plant was allowed to flow through an experimental test rig, which contained a length of un-insulated pipe, at different flow rates. Pipe surface temperature measurements of the un-insulated pipe were made using an infrared thermal camera and a mass flow rate of the steam was calculated using the derived mathematical model. In all experiments, the mass flow rate calculated using the mathematical model was compared to a mass flow rate acquired from a flow measuring device installed in-line with the experimental test rig. The results indicate that an increase in mass flow rate causes an increase in pipe surface temperatures of the un-insulated pipe which translates to an increase in heat loss of the leakage steam through the length of un-insulated pipe. The mass flow rate calculated using the proposed technique closely approximates the mass flow rate acquired from the flow measuring device. This indicates that the proposed technique, using infrared thermography, is capable of detecting and quantifying possible <b>internal</b> valve <b>leakages</b> encountered in online operation. Onsite tests were performed using the proposed technique on two different boiler drain valves at Majuba Power Station. It was found that one of the valves was internally leaking steam to the atmosphere at a rate of 0. 039 kg/s whilst the other valve was sealing correctly. A comprehensive financial impact study was conducted, and it was found that this leakage steam will result in a total loss of R 730 108 per annum if the leak is left unattended. This is the loss for a single valve that has a relatively small leak. The financial loss for a combination of all valves that are internally leaking in a power plant could be substantial and can clearly justify plant personnel in utilising the proposed technique to identify problematic valves. With its portability, non-intrusiveness and ease of use the proposed technique provides a cost-effective means to determine <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> through power plant valves...|$|R

The nearly zero-energy building demand makes uncontrolled leakage paths even more undesired and creates {{the need for further}} investigation of their behavior under unsteady wind conditions. The present numerical study examines the role of wind gustiness on instantaneous infiltration rates of a low-rise building. For this purpose, two levels of gust frequency Ω have been simulated, expressed as a sinusoidal factor in the wind profile formula. In parallel, a ratio α is employed to represent seven different cases of external leakages distribution, while five scenarios of compartmentalization and <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> shows the impact of the latter on the dynamics of building air exchange rates. The results indicate that higher wind gustiness results in higher ACH, marking out gusts as a potential critical factor under unsteady climate conditions.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{computational}} model of industrial-purpose hydraulic drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines (pump and motor). Adjustable pump {{equipped with the}} pressure control unit can be run together with several adjustable hydraulic motors {{on the principle of}} three-phase hydraulic socket-outlet with high-pressure lines, drain, and drainage system. The paper considers the pressure-controlled hydrostatic transmission with hydraulic motor as an output link. It shows a possibility to create a saving hydraulic drive using a functional tie between the adjusting parameters of the pump and hydraulic motor through the pressure difference, torque, and angular rate of the hydraulic motor shaft rotation. The programmable logic controller can implement such tie. The Coulomb and viscous frictions are taken into consideration when developing a computational model of the hydraulic volume displacement drive. Discharge balance considers external and <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> in equivalent clearances of hydraulic machines, as well as compression loss volume caused by hydraulic fluid compressibility and deformation of pipe walls. To correct dynamic properties of hydraulic drive, the paper offers that in discharge balance are included the additional regulated external leakages in the open circuit of hydraulic drive and regulated <b>internal</b> <b>leakages</b> in the closed-loop circuit.

40|$|This Master`s Thesis {{deal with}} {{integrity}} and barrier philosophy. A special {{focus has been}} on <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> through barrier elements. There is an increasing discussion about what a primary and secondary barrier is, how many barriers there should be, their permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria and their integrity. Subsea Christmas tree (XMT) is considered as a pressure barrier element in subsea production systems. Rules and regulations require frequent leakage testing of subsea XMT valves. Applicable standards include NORSOK D- 010, ISO 10423 and 13628 - 4 and API RP 14 B. Due to the remoteness, of the subsea well head, testing is more complicated compared to testing of platform trees (dry trees). Applicable standards specify a maximum permitted leakage rate. However, when considering testing of valves using small fluid test volume the model has limitations. A challenge is to determine if the leakage test criteria are fulfilled or not. Leak testing of subsea XMT valves is an engineering challenge. Engineers must meet leak rate standards as well as they have to understand all aspects of the leak testing procedure. Operators address a {{question of whether or not}} their correlation tool of pressure to leak rate is accurate enough. Another question regards the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B; how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes – typical XMT volumes. By this Master`s Thesis, an issue that does not have an ideal solution today is highlighted. The issue that operating companies faces is: In questionable situations whether a valve has fulfilled the criteria or not – how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes, how to decide whether a XMT have to be pulled, how to increase planning security, how to save money, time and estimate the lifetime of different valves on the XMT. The problems that the Operating Company meet regarding leakage testing of XMT valves may be that the differential pressure across the valve is lost in a couple of minutes. This questions the leak test procedure; is the permitted leak rate acceptance criteria or the test interval too large? To be on the safe side when evaluating leakage tests, the Operating Company has included new permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria into their work procedures. Service personnel fear that such a strict acceptance criteria can result in an unmanageable situation with a numerous of exceptions. Another problem that may be faced is that there is no procedure of when to initiate the leakage test. This results in difficulties in comparing historical and recent leakage tests. Also, this can result in a leakage test that shows a smaller leakage than it actually do. Data from previous leakage tests of production Master – and –Wing valve on the XMT are collected. The data are used to evaluate today`s procedure of leakage testing and for correlating pressure to leak rate. Both, the new <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria that the Operating Company uses and the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B are evaluated. Today, a basic tool for correlating pressure to acceptable leak rate exists. From the technical advisors point of view it is desirable with a more accurate software tool that can correlate pressure to leak rate. To evaluate today`s practice of correlating pressure to leak rate the MultiProScale simulation tool is used. It is assumed that the simulation tool correlates the most correct leak rate due to the complexity of the simulation tool. However, this Master`s Thesis shows that such a powerful tool is not needed for correlating pressure to leak rate. Based on this Master`s Thesis, the contribution to the leakage testing procedure is an improved calculation tool of correlating pressure, temperature and compressibility changes to actual leak rate. A presentation of this Master`s Thesis is presented for the Technical advisor of Well Technology, Hilde Brandanger Haga at Statoil. She agreed with the challenges and solutions that were presented. The improved calculation tool was also introduced. A proposal was presented that not only could the calculation tool be used onshore, but it could be used to show the actual leak rate during leakage testing of the PMV and PWV offshore. The advantage with this tool is that it can ensure the competence, it helps the decision-making process, it increases planning, it decreases cost and safeguard barriers. Other contributions are recommended changes both to the leak testing procedure and the data documentation. In relation to both of the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria, the main conclusions are: To apply the <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria governed by API 14 B to the subsea XMT, the leakage time interval have to be reduced from 10 – to 2 minutes. This will not result in an increased number of valves that does not fulfill the acceptance criteria. Or to apply the acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B, the test volume has to be > 50 liters. And, the additional <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria that are implemented by the Operating Company are stricter than the one governed by API RP 14 B. A decrease in time interval from 10 – to 2 minutes gives an increased number of valves that do not fulfill the permitted <b>internal</b> <b>leakage</b> acceptance criteria. </p...|$|E
