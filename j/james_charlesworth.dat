50|$|Verse 9 {{refers to}} a dispute between Michael the Archangel and the devil about the body of Moses. Some interpreters {{understand}} this reference to be an allusion to the events described in Zechariah 3:1-2. The classical theologian Origen attributes this reference to the non-canonical Assumption of Moses. According to <b>James</b> <b>Charlesworth,</b> {{there is no evidence}} the surviving book of this name ever contained any such content. Others believe it to be in the lost ending of the book.|$|E

5000|$|Gabbatha (Lithostrōtos): This {{location}} is referenced {{only once in}} the New Testament in John 19:13. This is an Aramaic term that refers {{to the location of}} the trial of Jesus by Pontius Pilate and the Greek name of Lithostrōtos (λιθόστρωτος) meaning stone pavement also refers to it. It was likely a raised stone platform where Jesus faced Pilate. <b>James</b> <b>Charlesworth</b> considers this location of high archaeological significance and states that modern scholars believe this location was in the public square just outside the Praetorium in Jerusalem and was paved with large stones.|$|E

50|$|A new {{characteristic}} of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archeology and <b>James</b> <b>Charlesworth</b> states that few modern scholars now want to overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea {{during the time of}} Jesus. A further {{characteristic of}} the third quest has been its interdisciplinary and global nature of the scholarship. While the first two quests were mostly by European Protestant theologians, the third quest has seen an worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines, e.g. Jewish scholars involved in historical Jesus research have contributed their detailed knowledge of Second Temple Judaism as the backdrop for the third quest.|$|E
5000|$|Artapanus’ {{motivation}} for writing his history is equally debated. One branch of analysis emphasizes the underlying {{tension between the}} diaspora Jews and their Hellenistic neighbors. For example, some scholars, such as Carl Holladay, see Artapanus’ writings as “competitive historiography.” [...] These scholars argue that Artapanus aimed to defend the Jews from the attacks of gentile historians such as Manetho, and this explains his superior depiction of the Jewish patriarchs. <b>James</b> <b>Charlesworth</b> of Princeton University, for example, argues Artapanus composed a “pro-Jewish apology” in response to anti-Moses and other anti-Jewish Egyptian stereotypes. Others refute the former argument, claiming {{it is highly unlikely}} that any gentiles would read an embellished history of the Jews that disparaged their own cultures’ accomplishments. Instead, these scholars insist that Artapanus’ target audience was primarily the Jews themselves, and he wrote this romantic history to bolster their national pride. Some scholars accept both of these arguments, claiming that Artapanus’ narrative at once represents an apologetic historiography and a romantic piece of national propaganda.|$|E
