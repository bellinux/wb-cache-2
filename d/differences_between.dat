He argued that all the <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection.

5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{recognized the}} resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and {{recommended that the}} former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor.

In addition, they reviewed the <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E
