[...] "He usually picks out a high gravelly bank close to the water and digs a hole straight <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way from the top. He makes it just big enough for himself and Mrs. Rattles to go in and out of comfortably, and he digs it straight in for several feet.

I should have to share your worries and make your coffee--and {{disappoint}} you, disappoint you and fail you in a hundred ways. Think! Should I be any good as a squaw? How can one love when one knows the coffee isn't what it should be, and one is giving one's lover indigestion? And I don't want to be your squaw. I don't want that at all. It isn't how I feel for you. I don't want to be your servant and your possession." ...|$|E

I am Ignatius Morat, of the Society of Jesus, and as to {{the people}} who have used me a little roughly, why, if you are sent upon the Iroquois mission, of course you know what to expect. I have nothing at all to {{complain}} of. Why, they have used me very much better than they did Father Jogues, Father Breboeuf, and a good many others whom I could mention. There were times, it is true, when I was quite hopeful of martyrdom, especially when they thought my tonsure was too small, which was their merry way of putting it.

50|$|Classicus, {{along with}} Sabinus and Tutor, were {{leaders of the}} Treviri and Lingones, both Gallic tribes, and had {{separate}} ideals from Civilis and his Batavian revolt. The Batavians were seeking little more than tribal independence, while Sabinus and his allies were looking {{to start a new}} Roman Empire in Gaul, an Imperium Galliarum. After killing a deserter named Vocula, who had tried to escape after seeing the treachery of Classicus and the rest, Julius Classicus read an oath of allegiance (dressed as a Roman general) to the 1st and 16th legions of Germany, commanding them to swear allegiance to their new emperor, Julius Sabinus (who would have been the 5th Emperor <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over a year).|$|E

50|$|Maltepe is not {{unpleasant}} to live <b>in,</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{far from}} the city. There is a busy shopping district and some big supermarkets with Burger Kings, branches of ToysRUs {{and all the other}} modern amenities. Maltepe has cinemas, fast-food places, and some good kebab houses. And there is the sea shore, where there are nice cafes and some bars and cafes with live music similar (but on a much smaller scale) to those found in Kadıköy or in Taksim (on the European side of the city). The public transport is mainly for commuters and doesn't run into the night for party-goers though mini buses or 'dolmuses do run late into the night, often until at least 3am depending on your destination. Recently a large new mosque has been constructed in the centre of Maltepe(built on 1992), the main distinctive landmark.|$|E

[...] And Carrie tucked Wanda under the sofa pillow, as if a trifle ashamed of her society, with Eva's {{innocent}} eyes upon her own, and Alice sadly regarding her over the rampart of wise books, which kept growing higher as the eager girl found more and more treasures in this richly stored library.|$|R

5000|$|The rōnin {{spent more}} than 14 months waiting for the [...] "right time" [...] for their revenge. It was Yamamoto Tsunetomo, author of the Hagakure, who asked the well known question: [...] "What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?" [...] His answer was that the forty-seven rōnin would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their {{dissipated}} behavior was just an act, that <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time {{they would have been}} ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the rōnin to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The rōnin would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.|$|E

5000|$|The two bouts {{launched}} one man {{and ruined}} the other. For Ali, this {{was the beginning of}} the Ali mystique: the people's hero confronting seeming impossible odds and insurmountable foes (both inside and outside the ring) only to triumph through his wit, integrity, courage and talent. For Liston, the fights left his reputation in tatters. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over one year, he went from being considered one of the most fearsome heavyweights of all-time to an overrated champion. [...] "the two Ali fights Liston would never again intimidate a world-class fighter," [...] wrote Bob Mee, [...] "and therefore would never again be the fighter he used to be." [...] Worse, the mysterious circumstances surrounding the end of the second fight probably linked Liston forever to all that was corrupt and suspect in boxing. Recent attempts to introduce more balance and fairness in understanding Liston's career and life have faced a stiff challenge posed by the final 30 seconds of the second fight in Lewiston, Maine, in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Architect and topographer Francesco Bianchini {{named it}} the [...] "ustrinum of the Antonines" [...] on the {{hypothesis}} {{that it was the}} site of the funeral pyre for members of that dynasty.

[...] Lanciani suggests [...] that this may have been the [...] "ustrinum Antonini Pii et Faustinae", while another similar structure, of which the ruins were found <b>in</b> 1907 <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to the north-east of the first, was the [...] "ustrinum M.

5000|$|Our film {{is called}} Grand Exit — {{it was done}} in {{nineteen}} thirty-five and teams Ann with Edmund Lowe. Now Edmund Lowe, in this movie, plays a ladies man who makes a living as an arson investigator.

It's all very lively and fast-paced — a movie that clocks <b>in</b> at <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over <b>an</b> hour long.
