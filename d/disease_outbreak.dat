The guidance in this document has been organized to correspond to the sections in NORS. Sections in NORS for waterborne disease reporting include the General Section, Water section, Etiology & Lab section, the Attachments section, and one section for the type of water exposure (e. g., Drinking, Rec.

500|$|Governor Colón {{considered}} {{turning the}} Mameyes neighborhood into a common grave {{to prevent the}} spread of <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak.</b> As a result, the National Guard evacuated the town, although the governor changed his mind after public outcry. Initially, a death toll of 500people was reported, although that was [...] "the product of the original, collective hysteria," [...] according to the mayor of Ponce's press officer. Additionally, the number of destroyed houses was overestimated, only to be revised downward owing to before-and-after satellite images and interviews with survivors. After the Mameyes landslide, about 150people, including National Guardsmen, worked to locate bodies with the assistance of six rescue dogs. Rescue workers also recovered 23bodies from the collapsed bridge near Coamo. On October13, officials halted the search for any survivors of the landslide, although workers continued to look for storm victims. On October22, Governor Colón ordered the teams to stop searching for bodies after officials determined that there was a threat of further landslides. Workers initially had difficulty assisting the affected families due to the occurrence in early morning and the continued intensity of the rain, and as a result, only 50bodies were recovered. Many houses around the Mameyes landslide were later demolished as they were at risk for further landslides.|$|E

[...] At the dead animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that they keep the land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting the tone of his overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally binding State Livestock Transfer Order directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth <b>disease</b> <b>outbreak.</b> This freezes the movement of all livestock to or from the Bannon ranch, while they await the test results.|$|E
