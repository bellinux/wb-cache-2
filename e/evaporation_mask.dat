No pre-anodization was used prior to observing hydrogen adsorption by cyclic voltammetry so that clean surfaces having the ordered structures indicated by LEED were studied. The problem of contributions from non-ordered {{parts of the}} electrode like support wires and edges was solved by using a gold <b>evaporation</b> <b>masking</b> technique. The specific contribution of atomic imperfections to the voltammetry curve was deduced from the ordered and countable imperfections occurring on high Miller index single crystal surfaces that have a stepped structure.

The bond strength was found to vary systematically: n(111) x(100) > (100) > n(111) x(111) > (110) > (111). Distinct states for hydrogen at steps versus hydrogen on terraces could be distinguished.

30|$|The entire OPV device stack can be {{directly}} printed into any kind of two-dimensional shape using mass-manufacturing printing technologies, namely gravure, flexography and screen printing [2, 13]. These printing methods and the materials used for printing however set some technical boundary conditions for the layout design, which are especially important for the electrical performance of the modules. In this work, the technical boundaries for the custom-shaped OPVs were determined by the processing method, the used equipment and materials. First, the overall feature size was defined to be 120 by 130  mm. This was limited by the engraved area of the gravure printing plate {{and the size of}} the <b>evaporation</b> <b>mask.</b> Secondly, the dimensions of the individual OPV cells were influenced by the electrode materials. The length of the cell was limited to 50  mm due to the thermal evaporating process of LiF/Al where the fine features of the shadow mask are prone for bending, and the width of the cells were fixed into 5  mm due to the sheet resistance of ITO [5]. Additionally, the precision of the printed image is influenced by the dimensional accuracy of the printed layer i.e. the shrinking/spreading of the ink thus the dimensions of the test prints were compared with the layout. In R 2 R rotary screen printing of ITO, the dimensions in machine (MD) and cross-machine direction (CD) perpendicular to the direction of printing deviated + 0.2 % (MD) and + 0.1 % (CD). In S 2 S, gravure printing of PEDOT:PSS dimensions deviated + 4 % (MD) and + 0.4 % (CD) compared to the layout and respectively, P 3 HT:PCBM − 0.9 % and + 0.1 %.|$|E
40|$|Authors: William R. Erwin (wrerwin 1 @gmail. com) ### **Abstract** The {{fabrication}} and {{characterization of}} organic solar cells using the model system P 3 HT (Poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl)) as the electron donating polymer and PCBM ([6, 6]-Phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester) as the electron accepting molecule is described. ### **Materials** 1. Indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass (Thin Film Devices Inc.) 2. Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) Polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in water (Heraeus) 3. 0. 45 micron filters (Sigma-Aldrich) 4. Regio-regular poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) (P 3 HT), MW ~ 30, 000 (Sigma-Aldrich) 5. [6, 6]-Phenyl C 61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Nano-C inc.) 6. 1, 2 -Dichlorobenzene, anhydrous (Sigma-Aldrich) 7. Vacuum grade lithium fluoride 8. Vacuum grade aluminum ### **Equipment** 1. Spin coater in normal atmospheric conditions 2. Spin coater in inert atmosphere 3. Hot plate 4. Resistive evaporation deposition system with sample mask 5. AM 1. 5 solar simulator and power source 6. Potentiostat or sourcemeter 7. Sample mask and electrical contacts for testing ### **Procedure** #### Glass Cleaning Begin by using as purchased 1 inch square ITO glass. Because {{the glass is}} clean upon arrival, the cleaning steps are limited to ten minutes in a plasma cleaner at medium power. This plasma treatment removes adventitious carbon from the ITO surface making the surface more hydrophilic for PEDOT:PSS deposition and improving the work function of the ITO. When purchasing ITO, {{pay special attention to}} the surface roughness; if the surface roughness is too high, it may cause shorting in the device. #### PEDOT:PSS Deposition Using as purchased PEDOT:PSS, pass the solution through a 0. 45 micron PVDF filter using a syringe. Before deposition, blow the substrate off with nitrogen to remove any particulate. For a 40 - 50 nm layer, drop 250 microliters of solution onto glass and spin coat at 500 rpm for 15 seconds to allow the liquid to spread, followed by a 30 second spin at 3000 rpm. Following deposition, anneal the film on a hot plate at 150 C for 10 minutes to remove any water from the film. Immediately place substrate into tightly fitting petri dish, and move to an nitrogen atmosphere for further processing. The anneal and subsequent transfer to an inert atmosphere serve to ensure that all water is forced from the PEDOT:PSS film. #### Active Layer Deposition The active layer consists of P 3 HT and PCBM (1 : 1 by mass) in 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene at a total concentration of 40 mg/mL. The blend should be stirred at 40 C in the glove box overnight. Prior to spin coating, pass the mixture through a 0. 45 micron PVDF filter. Drop 200 microliters of the solution onto the substrate and allow it to spread across the substrate. Spin coat using a two step process: 2000 rpm for 2 s followed by 800 rpm for 15 s. The first step removes bulk solvent, increasing overall uniformity of the film, while the second step allows for partial solvent evaporation. Immediately after spin coating, transfer the sample into a well sealed petri dish and allow it to solvent anneal. During the solvent anneal, the film turns from purple to orange, indicating that solvent is evaporating from the film. The solvent anneal is of crucial importance, as it allows for the formation of an ordered bulk heterojunction between the donor (P 3 HT) and acceptor (PCBM) phases. If spin coating is too long, and no solvent is left for a solvent anneal, the morphology will be “finely mixed,” inhibiting charge transport. If too much solvent is left after spin coating, pinholes may form in the active layer, increasing shorting in the device. After solvent anneal, thermally anneal the sample at 140 C for 10 minutes in an inert atmosphere. Store in a dark, inert atmosphere until cathode deposition. #### Cathode Deposition Place sample face down into <b>evaporation</b> <b>mask.</b> Using a resistive evaporator evaporate 1 nm LiF at a rate of 0. 1 Å/s, followed by a 100 nm layer of Al at a rate of 1. 5 Å/s. #### Device Testing Test devices over a desired potential range (- 1 V: 1 V) under AM 1. 5 conditions. Typical devices should exhibit short circuit current densities of 5 - 15 mA/cm 2, open circuit voltages in the range of 0. 6 - 0. 7 V and a fill factor between 0. 5 and 0. 7, resulting in efficiencies up to ~ 6 %. ### **Reference** 1.

The method consists of CVD synthesis of an individual SWNT from evaporated metal catalyst pad and shadow <b>mask</b> <b>evaporation</b> of metallic electrical contacts on the SWNT. The thickness and dimensions of the catalyst pad are optimized to yield on average one long and horizontally aligned single SWNT after CVD synthesis. In contrast to standard electron-beam lithography technique, this method {{has the advantage of}} not exposing the SWNTs to any electron beam irradiation or chemicals that are reported to damage or/and contaminate the SWNTs [16, 17]. Furthermore, in order to minimize any damage or contamination of the SWNT before electrical properties measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy mapping, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are performed only after all the electrical transport measurements are achieved. The electrical properties of individual SWNTs are measured using four-terminal method to minimize the effects of the contact resistance from the electrodes [18, 19].

Various techniques, such as photolithograph [11 and electron beam <b>evaporation</b> through shadow <b>mask</b> [2], have been used to create catalyst patterns for CVD (chemical vapor deposition) growth of patterned and aligned CNTs. However, these techniques require sophisticate and expensive facilities and are hard to scale-up. Sol-gel method has been successfully adopted to prepare film-like irodsilica substrates for large-scale growth of highly aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube arrays [3 - 51.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} carbon-nanotube based nanoscale electronics during last decade has stimulated great interests in molecular electronics beyond nanotubes. This extension has been hindered by fabrication of molecular circuits with conventional e-beam lithography. We {{have developed a}} shadow <b>mask</b> <b>evaporation</b> (SME) method to fabricate sub-micrometer metallic electrodes and other structures without using lithographic resists (e. g. photoresist or electron beam resist). We have fabricated electrode pairs with gaps as small as 200 nm, and I will discuss a method that we believe will allow reproducible fabrication of gaps smaller than 10 nm. We have used these shadow masks in a resist-free process to contact DNA strands on mica, carbon nanotubes on Si, {{as well as to}} create an etch mask for fabricating 200 nm polymer nanowires. High bias transport measurement shows that the saturation current of metallic carbon nanotubes is always enlarged in a two-probe measurement and can be used to estimate contact resistance. Carbon nanotubes can endure high voltages as high as 40 V Nanotubes break down when the tube temperature reaches the burning temperature. For a micrometer-long nanotube, most of the heat generated by the current is dissipated through the substrate at high bias. The longer the nanotube, the higher voltage it can sustain. We also report fabrication of sub- 30 nm conducting polymer nanofiber with tunable resistance. Characterization by scanning conductance microscopy shows the dependence of conductivity on nanofiber diameter. This is confirmed by transport measurements on nanofibers contacted by SME.

We demonstrate that {{the change in the}} threshold voltage of the bottom gate depends on the top gate bias with two linear relationships for two different regimes. The interpretations of the results, assuming that the mobilities of the top and bottom channels have similar magnitudes, and that the capacitance of the semiconductor layer is not negligible, indicated two distinct regimes for a dual-gate p-type OFET. 1. When one gate is positive, hence the respective channel is in depletion and no gate screening will occur, while the other gate is in accumulation regime, the field of the positive gate will penetrate to such a large extend that the channel in accumulation will be affected by both gates. 2. When both channels are in accumulation, the charges present in the channels will screen the respective gate potentials, hence both channels will operate individually and no mutual influences are observed. For a dual-gate OFET with its top channel in accumulation, we demonstrate a drop in the transconductance when the bottom gate potential becomes negative. This transition regime between both linear regimes is marked by a drop in the transconductance, where the bottom channel depends on the bottom gate only and the top channel will depend on both gates. The transition regime results {{from the fact that the}} charges accumulated in the bottom channel will start to screen the influence of the bottom gate potential on the top channel and the change in overall drain current will depend only on the change of the Current of the bottom channel.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis investigates transitions between quantum states in superconducting double dots (SDDs), a nanoscale device consisting of two aluminium superconducting islands coupled together by a Josephson junction, with each dot connected to a normal state lead. The energy landscape consists of a two level manifold of even charge parity Cooper pair states, and continuous bands corresponding to charge states with single quasiparticles in one or both islands. These devices are fabricated using shadow <b>mask</b> <b>evaporation,</b> and are measured at sub Kelvin temperatures using a dilution refrigerator. We use radio frequency reflectometry to measure quantum capacitance, which {{is dependent on the}} quantum state of the device. We measure the quantum capacitance as a function of gate voltage, and observe capacitance maxima corresponding to the Josephson coupling between even parity states. We also perform charge sensing and detect odd parity states. These measurements support the theoretical model of the energy landscape of the SDD. By measuring the quantum capacitance in the time domain, we observe random switching of capacitance between two levels. We determine this to be the stochastic breaking and recombination of single Cooper pairs. By carrying out spectroscopy of the bath responsible for the pair breaking we attribute it to black-body radiation in the cryogenic environment. We also drive the breaking process with a continuous microwave signal, and find that the rate is linearly proportional to incident power. This suggests that a single photon process is responsible, and demonstrates the potential of the SDD as a single photon microwave detector. We investigate this mechanism further, and design an experiment in which the breaking rate is enhanced when the SDD is in the antisymmetric state rather than the symmetric state. We also measure the quantum capacitance of a charge isolated double dot. We observe 2 e periodicity, indicating the tunnelling of Cooper pairs and the lack of occupation of quasiparticle states. This work is relevant to the range of experiments investigating the effect of non-equilibrium quasiparticles on the operation of superconducting qubits and other superconducting devices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to test and characterize a new method for gold nanoparticle production. The main idea {{was based on the}} preliminary observations made in earlier work, which had suggested that small amounts of gold deposited onto a silicon substrate will spontaneously reshape into gold nanoparticles when treated to controlled high-temperature heating for a sufficient period of time. This idea for a fabrication process was extended to incorporate Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) gold patterning. The full fabrication method consisted of the following steps: (1) Preparation of clean silicon substrates, (2) Addition of a Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) Coat via spin coating, (3) Design of gold patterns for the EBL, (4) Gold patterning via EBL, (5) Gold deposition via electron beam <b>evaporation,</b> (6) PMMA <b>mask</b> removal via acetone wash, and (7) High-Temperature furnace heating, as well as plans for a final step (8) Isolation of the gold nanocages via HF etching. The project research required the use of the photolithographic facilities of the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (VINSE), as well as the use of the high-temperature furnace and other basic needs supplied by the research group of Professor Dickerson. Some of the VINSE equipment required relatively extensive operational training. The research project has demonstrated that the described thermal fabrication method can uniformly and repeatedly produce Au nanoparticles of about 400 nm in diameter from Au deposits of 1 um 2 area and 20 nm thickness. Larger areas displayed structural fragmentation into multiple nanoparticles, and this fragmentation effect increased proportionally with increasing area size. Due to time constraints, the many available parameters prevented a complete characterization of this fabrication method; however, useful insights were obtained for several of the parameters of the fabrication process. In particular, it can be expected that smaller nanoparticles may be fabricated in a straightforward manner by reducing the patterned area sizes of the gold deposits. Results suggested an intrinsic limitation to the method: for the requirement of product uniformity, each Au-area deposit had to produce only a single nanoparticle.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and electrical characterization of organic electronic devices with critical dimensions down to the sub 100 -nm scale. The applications include organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) as well as molecular devices where the interelectrode separation {{is defined by the}} thickness of a self-assembled molecular layer. Electrodes are prepared using several techniques such as shadow <b>mask</b> <b>evaporation,</b> photolithography, electron-beam lithography (EBL), nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and breakdown of nanowires by controlled electromigration, depending on the application and the range of interelectrode separation. In the case of OFETs, the channel length of the devices is in the range from 70 µm down to 50 nm. Dihexylquaterthiophene (DH 4 T) is used as active material and is deposited from solution by drop casting, spin coating and self-assembly. In the case of OFETs, a different behavior was found when comparing results on devices produced by drop casting and spin coating. In particular with respect to the presence, or not, of a saturation region at high drain-source voltage. The output characteristics of almost all of the spin-coated devices presented saturation at high drain-source voltages while for all of the drop-cast devices the drain-source current did not saturate. Non-saturating output characteristics at short channel lengths were initially interpreted as resulting from the overlap of the depletion regions next to the metal contacts. Nevertheless, the observation of this effect at long channel lengths for devices containing relatively thick organic semiconductor layers suggested that this {{is the result of the}} current flowing through the bulk of the organic semiconductor in addition to the current through the accumulation layer at the semiconductor-insulator interface. In order to account for this effect, the model for the output characteristics of FETs in the gradual channel approximation was modified to take into account the contribution of the mobility of the bulk of the organic semiconductor to the total channel mobility. The proposed model also incorporates the metal-semiconductor contact resistance because at short channel lengths it becomes comparable to the channel resistance. This model satisfactorily fits the results for all the fabricated devices. An increase in the field-effect mobility was expected for devices with channel lengths in the nanometer scale caused by the increase of material homogeneity and reduction of grain boundaries in the channel at this lengthscale. Nevertheless, the field-effect mobility was found to decrease with decreasing channel length. This decrease is not due to a contact resistance limitation, as suggested in the literature, but it is most probably the result of incomplete filling of the channels for short channel length devices. Additionally, gate voltage modulation in molecular electronic devices, where the channel length is defined by the thickness of a self-assembled DH 4 T layer sandwiched between gold electrodes, is demonstrated...|$|R
