The subject matter in this study is approached by using community social work perspective. The research data consists of descriptions of early intervention and family support working models. Descriptions have been gathered from the workers of play parks, social and family work, families with children home service, family houses and groups and projects in two phases: first by a questionnaire and thereafter worker joint development process. This study is a part of the development process of early intervention and family support in Family Centres. The data was analysed by applying theory engaged examination and content analysis. Evaluation method is description and the purpose is to create an overview the work of early intervention and family support and its development needs. The approach to research is development evaluation. The workers described in the questionnaire 393 different working models. Based on analysis working methods of direct client work were defined as follows: family work, group work, community work, multicultural work and information about the services. Working methods of <b>indirect</b> <b>client</b> work were defined as multiprofessional network and strengthening of the working methods of early intervention and family support. Based on the questionnaire workers saw supporting parenthood and strengthening of social networks needs for the work. Experienced results of the working methods were positive and their achievements were experienced in family and group work. Based on workers experience working methods close to basic work were considered to be effective. Workers evaluate that the working methods brought a change to client's life situation (medium 8, 31 on scale 1 - 10). The descriptions prepared in the development process examine early intervention and family support in three levels: community, department and worker/working place. Local co-operation and group work were described by all functions. This study investigates also the descriptions of the workers from play parks from the community and community social work perspective. Parks are described as spaces of community, where participation and empowerment is made possible. The work of early intervention and family support is not a uniform collection of working methods which would be similar to all functions. All functions do it by taking into account the basic work and its specific features. Based on the analysis of descriptions I suggest looking at the early intervention and family support from developmental, social and operational point of view. Operational viewpoint is intervention and support on individual and community level. Through these elements both universal and selective needs of children and their families is visible in early intervention and family support. The changes in working environment have an impact on the development of the work. In this study four development strategies have been created from community social work basis. In these strategies the aim, elements and methods of work have been combined. Strategies are proactive and preventive work, services close to community, work centred on the social network and shared responsibility of practitioners and citizens. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|A general {{approach}} to achieve anonymity on P 2 P net-works is {{to construct an}} <b>indirect</b> path between <b>client</b> and server for each data transfer. The indirection, together with randomness {{in the selection of}} intermediate nodes, pro-vides a guarantee of anonymity to some extent. It, how-ever, comes at the cost of a large communication overhead. In this paper, we present Shubac, a searchable, anonymous peer to peer (P 2 P) overlay network. It implements a flex-ible dynamic path approach that shrinks paths in size to reduce overhead and delays and meanwhile reconfigures paths dynamically throughout a communication to main-tain a high level of privacy. This dynamic path approach enables Shubac to make a good tradeoff between anonymity and efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} humanoid robots in residential stroke care to facilitate both direct and <b>indirect</b> interaction between <b>clients</b> and therapists. Direct interaction is realized through a humanoid-mediated teletherapy where a therapist assesses the motor function of a patient and provides therapy customized to the individual. During the teletherapy sessions, the therapist uses a simple speech interface to program therapeutic behavior and activity. Indirect interaction is implemented by the therapist-programmed artifact where a humanoid robot delivers therapeutic activities to the stroke patient {{in the absence of}} the therapist. We propose that such an approach can amplify the outcome per hour of therapist time. Outcome data from the current study indicate that the therapist can successfully provide customized therapy to individuals in residential settings and warrant further study. I...|$|R

This paper argues {{that there is}} a need to make mobility explicit at every level of the OSI model [...] - even above the network level through user or application level. Further, it is proposed that the mobile host and the first hop (wireless link) of communication be handled differently than the rest of the network. Hence, in networks with mobile hosts, we propose a radical approach of <b>indirect</b> interaction between <b>clients</b> and servers. 1 Introduction The client-server paradigm has served well for structuring applications in distributed systems. The paradigm is implicitly based on two assumptions: 1) the end points of the communication link are fixed and 2) the underlying network infrastructure is to a large extent homogeneous (high bandwidth, reliable, and low latency). However, mobile hosts have different characteristics from fixed hosts. Mobility implies that hosts will connect from different access points and ma [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis The {{quality of}} {{supporting}} relationship and aim directivity {{as a successful}} factor in social work was written by Šicnerová Věra, Faculty of Theology of the University of South Bohemia. The supervisor of the thesis is Lhotová Marie, PhDr. Ing. Ph. D. Key words: aim, emotions, <b>client,</b> <b>indirect</b> approach, Rogers, empathy, interaction, communication, conflict, social work, social worker, relationship. The diploma thesis describes {{the development of a}} social therapeutic relationship between a client and a social worker which is based on non - evaluating approach of the social worker and in the connection with a suitable follow-up aim. The information about the conditions of a quality relationship which is needed for communication between the client and the social worker in a social therapeutic relationship is included in the thesis. Dangers and inappropriate approaches which can ruin suitable selection and the realization of aim are mentioned too. The thesis defines vocational qualities of social workers which can make the relationship development easier. It also presents attributes of social workers and clients, which can on the contrary disrupt or thwart this development. The diploma thesis illustrates that the relationship between social workers and clients is a determinative factor for a successful definition and realization of the social therapeutic process aim...|$|R
50|$|The above {{types of}} {{disciplinary}} knowledge may appear in explicit formats, {{which can be}} learnt from formal programmes at teaching institutions such as higher education and professional institutions alongside other skills and abilities relating to presentation, communication, and team working. As ascertained in the findings, there was other non-disciplinary knowledge, which was not explicit but tacit in nature. Interviewees mentioned tacit experiences from their past work and life experiences, which they used to draw upon in performing their creative knowledge work. This form of knowledge was harnessed collectively as a team (of an advertising campaign or a software programme). This collaborative approach to working, especially with roles such as creative directing and software programme managing, requires tacit knowledge of {{the strengths and weaknesses}} and the needs and wants of the related team members (knowledge of psychology). This form of working may occur within the organisation, as a stand-alone group for a specific project in the organisation, or as a sub-contracted team outside the organisation. Within this role, creative knowledge workers may perform their activities individually and/or collectively as part of their contribution to the project. The findings also brought out some characteristics of collaborative working such as the varieties of stakeholders such as sub-contracted groups, and the <b>indirect</b> relationships between <b>clients,</b> workers (of an ad agency), and consumers (Loo, 2017).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a literature review and research report. Section 1 : Literature Review Constructs of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious traumatization (VT) have been proposed to describe {{the negative impact of}} working with traumatized clients. In previous reviews of the literature, evidence to support these constructs has been limited and inconsistent; consequently their validity has been questioned. This review seeks to reassess the evidence from recent empirical findings. The review concluded that evidence to support the constructs remains limited, but tentatively there is greater evidence to support STS in contrast to VT. Section 2 : Research Report This study investigates the extent of exposure to trauma work among trainee clinical psychologists and its impact on well-being. The study seeks to assess which theoretical model (STS, VT, or even a non-specific model of general psychological distress) best accounts for any negative effects associated with <b>indirect</b> exposure to <b>client</b> trauma. 564 trainees participated in an online survey, which included self-report measures of general psychological distress, trauma symptoms and disrupted beliefs. Most trainees had caseloads of 1 - 2 trauma cases, with the most common trauma being sexual abuse. Exposure to trauma work was not related to general psychological distress or disrupted beliefs, but {{was a significant predictor of}} trauma symptoms. Level of stress of clinical work and quality of trauma training contributed to the variance in trauma symptoms. It is concluded that the study provides support for STS and lacks evidence to support VT or a non-specific model of general psychological distress.

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{contributions}} that twelve classifications of presenting problems and the counseling relationship make in determining client satisfaction with counseling in a college counseling center context. Participants were 155 undergraduate and graduate students who engaged in counseling during the Fall, 1997, semester at a large southwestern university counseling center. Data utilized in this study was archival. A recursive, just-identified path model was developed. Multiple regression analyses were used and the maximum likelihood estimation method was applied to the structural equation model. Analysis of Moment Structures (Amos; Arbuckle, 1995) was utilized in the analysis of the structural model. Findings from the study supported one classification of presenting problem (issues related to romantic relationship difficulties) as being an <b>indirect</b> predictor of <b>client</b> satisfaction via its effects on the counseling relationship. When the presenting problem of anxiety was studied in isolation, it was shown to be a significant predictor of client satisfaction. Personally-related problems were identified as four times as influential on client satisfaction than were academic and vocational problems. Findings also attested to the important role of the counseling relationship as a significant predictor of client satisfaction and as a mediator variable between clients 2 ̆ 7 presenting problems and their satisfaction with counseling. Based on these findings, implications for practice include the importance of counselors being highly skilled in building therapeutic relationships with clients and the possibility of modifying the counseling process used with clients addressing vocational and academic issues to more similarly reflect the process in place with clients addressing personally-related issues. Such modification may serve to increase client satisfaction. ...|$|R
