5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows {{a cast of}} {{characters}} living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|The New York Metropolitan Opera {{commissioned}} John Harbison {{to compose}} an operatic {{treatment of the}} novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> premiered on December 20, 1999.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby.</b> It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald's {{visits to}} Long Island's south shore and his {{experience}} attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsbys setting. Today, {{there are a}} number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party. Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby.</b> Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success. Like Nick in The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich. In many ways, The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> (1926), by Herbert Brenon– {{a silent}} movie of a stage adaptation, {{starring}} Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson, and William Powell.

5|$|Sam Waterston is an American {{actor who}} made his film debut in the 1965 drama The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean. Waterston has {{appeared}} in numerous films, television shows {{as well as on}} stage during his career. One of his early film roles was as a shoe salesman in the television drama film The Glass Menagerie (1973), for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Waterston went on to appear as bond salesman Nick Carraway in the 1974 feature film version of The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> which earned him two Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actor, and New Star of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Robert Keable (6 March 1887 – 22 December 1927) was a British novelist, {{formerly}} a missionary and priest in the Church of England. He resigned his ministry following {{his experiences in}} the First World War and caused a scandal with his 1921 novel Simon Called Peter, {{the tale of a}} priest's wartime affair with a young nurse. The book sold 600,000 copies in the 1920s alone, was referenced in The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> and was cited in a double murder investigation. Fêted in the United States, but critically less than well-received, Keable moved to Tahiti where he continued to write, producing both novels and theological works, until his death at age 40 of a kidney complaint.|$|E
5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|Since 2000, DiCaprio has {{received}} critical acclaim {{for his work}} {{in a wide range of}} film genres. DiCaprio's subsequent films include The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), the biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can (2002), and the epic historical drama Gangs of New York (2002), which marked his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. He was acclaimed for his performances in the political war thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the neo-noir crime drama The Departed (2006), the espionage thriller Body of Lies (2008), the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the biographical film J. Edgar (2011), the western Django Unchained (2012), and the period drama The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> (2013).|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald's {{goal was}} to produce a {{literary}} work which would truly prove himself as a writer, and Gatsby {{did not have the}} commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character. According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although 1926 brought Owen Davis's stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye. For several years afterward, the general public believed The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby</b> to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio {{produced}} the environmental documentary The 11th Hour and the comedy-drama Gardener of Eden in 2007.

In 2011, he portrayed J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, in the biopic J. Edgar. The following year, he played a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-directed western Django Unchained. DiCaprio starred in two film adaptations of novels in 2013; he first appeared as Jay Gatsby in the Luhrmann-directed adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The <b>Great</b> <b>Gatsby,</b> and later as Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street, an adaptation of Belfort's memoir of the same name. The latter earned him a third Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 2015, DiCaprio played fur trapper Hugh Glass in the survival drama The Revenant, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
