50|$|A <b>hypostatic</b> <b>gene</b> is {{one whose}} {{phenotype}} is altered by {{the expression of}} an allele at a separate locus, in an epistasis event.|$|E
5000|$|Example: In labrador retrievers, the {{chocolate}} coat colour {{is a result}} of homozygosity for a gene that is epistatic to the [...] "black vs. yellow" [...] gene. The alleles determining whether the dog is yellow or black, are that of the <b>hypostatic</b> <b>gene</b> in this event.|$|E
40|$|Within the {{domestication}} {{of the dog}} was bred a {{large number}} of breeds, which vary in size, physique and fur color. Coloring of dogs {{plays a key role in}} choosing of puppy. Most of breeds have in their standard specified permitted coloring, a coloring which is preferred and forbidden coloring. Some types of coloring carry the risk of various forms of congenital defects. Genes that are involved in the fur color of dogs can be divided into distribution genes influencing the distribution and dilution of the pigment on the body of the dog and to genes encoding the synthesis of a certain kind of pigment. These genes interact and effect of alleles of epistatic gene can suppress the phenotype expression of the <b>hypostatic</b> <b>gene</b> alleles. They are known two main pigments dark eumelanin and light pheomelanin, which are influenced by alleles of these two genes, and it leads to origin of all color variance and drawings coat in dogs...|$|E
