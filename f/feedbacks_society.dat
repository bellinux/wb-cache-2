40|$|Through a structural-functional analysis, the {{relationship}} between the profession of social work and the institution of social welfare is examined. Social welfare Is defined as an institution concerned with those legitimated needs of people which relate to the quality of life which cannot be met in the marketplace. The central mission of the institution of social welfare is seen in three dimensions: social control, humanitarianism and <b>feedback</b> to <b>society</b> of patterns of social hurt which prevent the achievement of humanitarian aspirations and threaten the stability of the social order. Institution provides one set of coordinates to the grid of social structure which is depicted. The other set of coordinates is provided by social class and class conflicts which define both form and content of the institution of social welfare and the contradictions of {{the relationship}} between the profession of social work and its anchoring institution.

In our example, social feedback of z=G is likely to be interpreted by the steering institutions as ŵ_̂t̂ that is closer to w_t than a feedback of z=B. In the next section, we investigate further how an institution might respond to social feedback in its signal to the actuators.|$|R

People regard clothing as a self-validation tool individually or collectively, therefore, clothing has become contiguous to the body in a physical sense and psychological senses. Work uniform is adopted for pu rposes of identification, visibility and expression of organizational roles allowing the public to identify individuals as members of a certain corporate, their job nature and also enables insiders to interpret their rank, duties and privileges. Uniform wearers who become psychologically acute to the <b>feedbacks</b> from <b>society</b> have significant impact on the wearers' performances and thus an investigation of the psychological activities of uniform wearers could be instructive for uniform design improvement. This paper describes an in-depth survey on uniform wearers' clothing psychology in terms of uniform liking problem, understanding of company's uniform policy, image assessment and feelings of wearing uniform at different stages, ways of uniform wearing pattern, dissatisfaction with their uniforms together with a prioritizing problem of factors influencing uniform design.

Therein lies the potential of space for a substantially enhanced positive impact on culture through education. This essay suggests that through engaging more of the space research and development community in enabling unique and 'meaningful educational experiences' for educators and students at the pre-collegiate levels, space science and exploration can amplify its positive <b>feedback</b> on <b>society</b> and act as an important medium for cultural transformation to greater science literacy. I discuss the impact of space achievements on people and define what is meant by a 'meaningful educational experience,' all of which points to the need for educators and students to be closer to the practice of real science. I offer descriptions of two nascent science education programs associated with NASA which have the needed characteristics for providing meaningful experiences that can cultivate greater science literacy. Expansion of these efforts and others like it will be needed to have the desired impact on culture, but I suggest that the potential for the needed resources is there in the scientific research communities.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{presents}} the results of applying IMAGE 2 to assess changes in biodiversity. The organisers of two separate workshops solicited for these applications. Pre-prints of the resulting papers are presented in this report. The first workshop 'Managing for biodiversity: Incentives for the protection of nature' focussed on incentives for optimising biodiversity. Here, integrated assessment modelling and scenario analyses were presented as a tool to evaluate different incentives. The scenarios highlighted that rapidly increasing consumption patterns, rapid expansion of rangelands to support changing diets and too slow-moving technological innovations are major attributes of land-use change and biodiversity decline. It was concluded that scenario studies transparently highlight the complex systemic interactions and <b>feedback</b> between <b>society</b> and the other components of the earth's system. In addition, scenario studies contribute to improving the understanding of changes in biodiversity at global and regional levels of assessment. The second workshop focussed on the use of environmental scenarios to determine the current and future threats to biodiversity. A group of experts on all biomes used the scenarios and estimated changes in biodiversity. This report presents a summary of results by the expert team. The results suggests that land-use change will be the driver with the largest impact on biodiversity followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated CO 2 concentrations. However, large regional differences emerged. Although local pressures often cause threats to biodiversity, both papers show that scenario analyses with integrated assessment models can help to define future trends. The strength of this approach is that the interactions between different stressors can be determined. Further, the effectiveness of different policy measures can effectively and comprehensively be evaluated with scenario analyses...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{which is}} the natural {{continuation}} of part I [S. Federico, B. Goldys, and F. Gozzi, SIAM J. Control Optim., 48 (2010), pp. 4910 - 4937], studies a class of optimal control problems with state constraints where the state equation is a differential equation with delays. In part I the problem is embedded in a suitable Hilbert space H and the regularity of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is studied. The goal of the present paper is to exploit the regularity result of part I to prove a verification theorem and find optimal feedback controls for the problem. While {{it is easy to}} define a feedback control formally following the classical case, the proof of its existence and optimality is hard due to lack of full regularity of V and to the infinite dimensionality of the problem. The theory developed is applied to study economic problems of optimal growth for nonlinear time-to-build models. In particular, we show the existence and uniqueness of optimal controls and their characterization as <b>feedbacks.</b> © 2011 <b>Society</b> for Industrial and Applied Mathematics...|$|R

Today, unfortunately, insufficient attentions is paid to the issues of constructing a complex of technologies capable of ensuring dynamic economic development of an integrated system of municipal management.

30|$|While we {{elaborate}} on this further in Sect.  3.5 below, {{at this stage}} consider a simple example that captures the elements involved: an environment protection agency as a smart institution. The agency might raise the price of carbon credits to control pollution. In any economy, especially {{in the presence of}} internal and external shocks, the impact of this policy on unemployment may be less than certain. In particular, if unemployment does rise appreciably, the consequences of an economic downturn may move into the social sphere through, say, higher crime rates. If the downturn persists, the government may be held responsible, and the impact is felt politically as well. As opposed to a generic institution, where such <b>feedback</b> from <b>society</b> is ordinarily a second-order consideration, for a smart institution the relevant steering bodies would directly consider their feedback sources, be they academics, the media and the average voter. A number of issues arise here, and while they may not be novel, {{the manner in which the}} feedback informs the operation of the institutions is crucial to a theory of smart institutions. First, the feedback process may generate useful new information, or it may generate information that is already expected by the steering institutions. In Sect.  3.5, we discuss the concept of entropy that enables us to measure the value of feedback for the steering institutions, but a key point of difference between generic and smart institutions is worth noting here. While a generic institution may also solicit and consider feedback, its relevance to the functions of the institution is not critical. For smart institutions, on the other hand, the value of the information to the process of their operation is paramount.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the experience of}} the Institute of Socio-Economic Development of Territories of RAS in conducting sociological research on the territory of the Vologda Oblast and the Northwestern Federal District. It describes the historical aspects of formation of the system for public opinion monitoring and examines its theoretical and methodological foundations. The author of the article analyzes the structure of monitoring indicators and provides a brief interpretation of research findings that reflect social wellbeing and social perception trends. In addition, the paper analyzes people’s attitude toward the activities of federal and regional authorities, trends in social well-being, consumer sentiment and also the complex indicator – the index of public sentiment in the region – developed by ISEDT RAS researchers. The results of sociological studies carried out at ISEDT RAS correlate with the dynamics of the all-Russian public opinion polls conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM), Levada-Center, etc. They indicate that Russian society gradually adapts to new conditions of life {{after the collapse of the}} USSR. Besides, opinion polls show the most important features of the post-Soviet Russian history at its present stage; they are associated with the intensification of international political relations, the consequences of the “Crimean spring” and the new challenges Russia’s economy is facing now. The article concludes that as global community, of which Russian society is part, is evolving, sociological knowledge begins to play an increasingly important role in administration and national security; this is associated with the greater importance attached to intangible development factors. Therefore, a necessary prerequisite for administration effectiveness in all its stages is to implement the results of sociological research on social transformation trends and factors in the system of managerial decision-making. Twenty-five years of ISEDT RAS experience clearly show that this principle is relevant, it enjoys great demand and brings actual practical results. It indicates that the system of <b>feedback</b> between <b>society</b> and government, a feedback based on sociological research, provides extensive information on social well-being, economic situation, and political attitudes, helps evaluate the effectiveness of government economic and social policy more adequately, address the rights and interests of various population groups in the development and implementation of socially important managerial decision...|$|R
40|$|Periods of {{conflict}} erode trust between {{national and local}} authorities and the people they govern, a trust {{that needs to be}} re-established. As peace operations are undertaken by inter-governmental bodies that tend to be inherently state-centric, however, peace operations need to go beyond merely supporting the extension of state-authority and strengthen inclusive state-society relations by supporting and facilitating inclusive processes that can address social cohesion, inequalities and marginalization. In order to support the emergence of resilient societies, these operations must help states and their societies to develop inclusive processes that enable participatory and responsive state institutions that are closely connected to the social institutions in the communities they serve. Furthermore, peace operations are often perceived as being partial to the party in government, while the government of the day often discourages peace operations from engaging with civil society. In {{the first part of this}} paper we explain why strengthening inclusive state-society relations is an important issue to address when peace operations are mandated to foster peace processes that can resist relapse. The second half of the paper shifts the attention to 'how' peace operations can enhance and support state-society relations. In addition to monitoring the effect peace operations have on state institutions, operations should monitor how people experience the role and impact of peace operations. This can be assessed in a number of ways, including by involving representative advisory groups from civil society and local communities in assessments, analysis, planning, implementation and evaluation, so as to ensure continuous direct input and <b>feedback</b> from the <b>society</b> on the work of the peace operation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Optimizing a {{therapeutic}} product's benefit-risk profile is an on-going process throughout the product's life cycle. Different, yet related, benefit-risk assessment strategies and frameworks {{are being developed}} by various regulatory agencies, industry groups, and stakeholders. This paper summarizes current best practices and discusses {{the role of the}} pharmacoepidemiologist in these activities, taking a life-cycle approach to integrated Benefit-Risk Assessment, Communication, and Evaluation (BRACE). Methods A review of the medical and regulatory literature was performed for the following steps involved in therapeutic benefit-risk optimization: benefit-risk evidence generation; data integration and analysis; decision making; regulatory and policy decision making; benefit-risk communication and risk minimization; and evaluation. <b>Feedback</b> from International <b>Society</b> for Pharmacoepidemiology members was solicited {{on the role of the}} pharmacoepidemiologist. The case example of natalizumab is provided to illustrate the cyclic nature of the benefit-risk optimization process. Results No single, globally adopted benefit-risk assessment process exists. The BRACE heuristic offers a way to clarify research needs and to promote best practices in a cyclic and integrated manner and highlight the critical importance of cross-disciplinary input. Its approach focuses on the integration of BRACE activities for risk minimization and optimization of the benefit-risk profile. Conclusion The activities defined in the BRACE heuristic contribute to the optimization of the benefit-risk profile of therapeutic products in the clinical world at both the patient and population health level. With interdisciplinary collaboration, pharmacoepidemiologists are well suited for bringing in methodology expertise, relevant research, and public health perspectives into the BRACE process.

40|$|The {{societies}} and ecosystems of the Nigerien Sahel appeared increasingly vulnerable to climatic and economic {{uncertainty in the}} late twentieth century. Severe episodes of drought and famine drove massive livestock losses and human migration and mortality. Soil erosion and tree loss reduced a woodland to a scrub steppe and fed a myth of the Sahara desert relentlessly advancing southward. Over the past two decades this myth has been shattered by the dramatic reforestation of more than 5 million hectares in the Maradi and Zinder Regions of Niger. No single actor, policy, or practice appears behind this successful regreening of the Sahel. Multiple actors, institutions and processes operated at different levels, times, and scales to initiate and sustain this reforestation trend. We used systems analysis to examine the patterns of interaction as biophysical, livelihood, and governance indicators changed relative to one another during forest decline and rebound. It appears that forest decline was reversed when critical interventions helped to shift the direction of reinforcing feedbacks, e. g., vicious cycles changed to virtuous ones. Reversals toward de-forestation or reforestation were preceded by institutional changes in governance, then livelihoods and eventually in the biophysical environment. Biophysical change sustained change in the other two domains until interventions introduced new ideas and institutions that slowed and then reversed the pattern of <b>feedbacks.</b> However, while <b>society</b> seems better at coping with economic or climatic shock or stress, the resilience of society and nature in the Maradi/Zinder region to global sources of uncertainty remains a pressing question in a society with one of the highest population growth rates on Earth...|$|R
40|$|Violence between Hindus and Muslims is a {{structural}} given of Indian society. One finds its traces {{very early in}} the country’s history, a fact that can drive the analyst to explain the phenomenon by referring to the incompatibility of Hindu and Muslim cultures. However, those historians interested in the phenomenon have always emphasized the economic dimension of the rivalry between Hindus and Muslims, which springs from territorial conflicts or commercial competition. Among sociologists and political scientists, this approach has found favour with many authors more or less inclined to Marxist categories. The interpretation of violence between Hindus and Muslims that I have suggested during the last wave of riots between 1989 and 1992 is very different. This interpretation values the role of politics in two complementary aspects, the ethno-religious ideology and the exploitation of communal issues by political parties. Indeed, research on communal riots in India after 1947 suggests that these riots largely originate from a distorted idea – ideology – of the Other; the Hindu though representing an overwhelming majority, often perceive of the Muslims as a ‘fifth column’ threatening them from within Indian society. And the Hindu nationalist parties, which have codified this ideological pattern, employ it for electoral means in the course of campaigns laying the ground for the outbreak of violence. These parties have, in fact, learned to mobilise Hindus against Muslims on the basis of real or presumed ‘sacred’ issues since the emergence of electoral politics in colonial times. Their goal is to provoke such kinds of riots in order to polarise the electorate along the religious cleavage more effectively. This explanatory model of Hindu-Muslim riots has to be verified again {{in the light of the}} Gujarat riots of 2002. Moreover, these riots also commit us to reconfirm the role of the Hindu nationalist party. The latter has to be weighted even more heavily due to the events in Gujarat, for the party held political power in that State. This state of things explains the rather exceptional intensity of the Gujarat riots. Because, this time, communal violence was not so much a reflection of the common logic of communal riots in India, but rather the result of an organised pogrom with the approval of the State acting not only with the electoral agenda in mind, but also in view of a veritable ethnic cleansing. Beyond that, the intensity of the riots has also demonstrated that this kind of violence has triggered a <b>feedback</b> in <b>society</b> even among groups so far less inclined to ethnic nationalism like, for example, the tribals. But there is an effect of yet another political strategy at work, which reminds us of the ideological core of our explanatory model: the more and more thorough diffusion of Hindutva in reaction to a fear of Jihad...|$|R

40|$|It {{was only}} {{twenty years after}} the 1979 Revolution that local Islamic councils were legalized and {{launched}} everywhere in Iran as part of reforms to strengthen decentralization and enhance people’s participation in policy planning. However, although these councils comprise elected members, {{they have not been}} fully institutionalized within the local government system and within Iran’s hierarchy of power. Local councils, therefore, have not led to the greater empowerment of people. This study assesses the decentralization process within the power structure after the Iranian Revolution. The research aims to provide insights into these key questions: how was the structure of the post-revolution decentralization system {{different from that of the}} previous regime? Why has the policy of decentralization not led to the sort of devolution that would enable people to participate in decision-making? What are the political obstacles to the empowerment of the people, a professed goal of the postrevolution government? A qualitative research method involving a multiple case study approach is used here. Urban and rural communities were selected for assessment through purposive sampling. Easton’s theory of political system was applied as it provides an effective conceptual framework to examine and explain the data. The results indicate that the post-revolution system is one that can be classified as a filtered democracy. In this type of political system, inputs from society have to pass through filters created by power elites. The <b>feedback</b> loop within <b>society</b> does not connect the inputs to the outputs. Demands from society, therefore, are not the basis for decision-taking at the top level of the political system. Only certain urban-based councils, particularly those in Tehran, showed degrees of power devolution. In Tehran, the councils have moved from beyond their defined legal functions. The whole decentralization process faces a series of political obstacles that cannot be removed until the system reforms its centralized hierarchy of power. There is a tightly controlled hierarchy of government bodies, from the center down to the provinces, townships, districts and villages, in all parts of this filtered democracy. The councils are not institutionalized in the political system. The decentralized councils are only connected to municipalities that are responsible for certain municipal services. These councils are not decision-making organisms, rendering invalid the post-revolution objective of people empowerment...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of digital mammography is to display mammograms on softcopy (electronic displays). Softcopy display of mammography is challenging because of the spatial and contrast resolution demands present in mammograms. We have designed and developed a softcopy mammography display application, Mammoview, which is capable of allowing radiologists to read mammograms as quickly and as accurately as they can on film alternators. We review the studies using Mammoview to elucidate the requirements of a successful softcopy display station. The design and development of the Mammoview softcopy display station are described in this article, and results of several studies using Mammoview are reported, including subjective <b>feedback</b> from Radiological <b>Society</b> of North America (RSNA) conference demonstrations, and clinical studies measuring performance in terms of speed and accuracy. Additional analysis of user interactions and user feedback is used to study the successes and shortcomings of mammography display stations like Mammoview. Overall, radiologist readings using Mammoview {{have been shown to be}} as fast and as accurate as readings using mammography film alternators. However, certain parts of the softcopy interface were more successful than their film counterparts, whereas others were less successful. Data analysis of the recorded human–computer interactions for the softcopy component of the clinical trial indicate statistically significant correlations between the difference in review time of softcopy versus alternator readings and three factors: the number of interactions, the reader, and the size of the image being reviewed. The first factor (number of interactions) suggests that simpler interfaces require less time to use; the second factor, the reader, supports previous findings that radiologists vary in how fast they read screening mammography studies; the third, size of image, suggests that the speed of softcopy review is increased relative to film readings when images are significantly larger than the display size. Feedback from radiologists using the system in clinical trials and at demonstration exhibits at RSNA indicated good acceptance of the interface and easy adaptation. Radiologists indicated that they felt comfortable using the interface, and that they would use such a softcopy interface in clinical practice. Finally, preliminary work suggests that the addition of a simple interaction to incorporate computer-aided detection (CAD) results would improve reading accuracy without significantly increasing reader times...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the current ruling party, the AKP (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi - Justice and Development Party) in Turkey. Its {{aim is to}} examine the emergence and consolidation of the AKP, as well as {{to determine whether or not}} this has shaped the evolution of the party system in Turkey. This research draws on a qualitative research approach, through interviews with 36 key informants from political parties, NGOs, grassroots organizations and through gathering data in the literature produced by parties and other statutory and voluntary agencies, as well as through the collection of descriptive statististics related to socio-economic structures, migration, occupational categories, macroeconomic indicators and collections of election surveys. The finding reveal that the AKP did not emerge as an Islamist party, but because of its promises of economic stability and growth, and of further integration into the EU and USA-led global order. The thesis shows that more so than its religious discourse, the AKP’s electoral success was based on the party’s adapting a hybrid, progressive and pro-EU position during its first tenure in government. Second, this research demonstrates how the political conjuncture up to 2002 and long-term economic factors provided favourable circumstances for the AKP’s emergence. The study’s findings also reveal that the consolidation of the AKP is mainly attributable to its economic and social agenda, and the utilization of the public purse and other state resources (e. g. social and health care benefits) as a means of catering for its target constituencies. In addition, they demonstrate that once AKP’s consolidation was completed (2010) the party’s discourse gradually became more conservative and nationalist, giving way to more authoritarian policies. Nonetheless, as long as economic performance and conditions remain unchanged, the AKP continues to appeal to its social base. Consequently, this thesis demonstrates that the gradual drift in Turkish society towards moderate Islamic and traditional values was not the main factor in the AKP’s rise to power. Rather, this shift can be viewed as the feedback effect of the consolidation of the AKP process into societal structures and norms. Hence, this work highlights the AKP’s impact on the structure of the party-system and the role of its policies in transforming Turkish society. Lastly, this study contributes to the foundation upon which further research on Turkish politics and the party system can continue, by exploring the dual effect of the AKP’s ruling tenure: factors leading to the AKP’s emergence and its <b>feedback</b> into Turkish <b>society</b> and politics...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 th Sasol, a local Non-Governmental-Organization (NGO), builds sand storage dams, to {{mitigate}} the consequences of droughts in the semi-arid county of Kitui, Kenya. Sand storage dams are dams constructed in ephemeral rivers which increase the storage capacity of the riverbeds. The water stored by sand storage dams enables local people to generate income through irrigated agriculture and brick making. By exploiting the stored water people also influence the groundwater flows and tables through water extraction and evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration through the cultivation of land. This two way <b>feedback</b> between <b>society</b> and water system is further influenced by local circumstances like water quality, slopes and local initiatives. In this study the long term effects of sand storage dams on hydrology and water use were assessed in the Kiindu catchment near Kitui town. It combines observed human agency and simulated effects of sand storage dams on groundwater levels to depicture what is called in socio-hydrology the coevolution of society and water system after the construction of sans storage dams. During a fieldtrip the study area, the local circumstances and the exploitation of water sources were assessed by means of trans-sectional walks and semi-structured interviews. The results show the interaction of local circumstances, society and water system led to different local developments even in a small catchment like the Kiindu catchment. How water is extracted and used depends on catchment properties. If the riverbanks are broad and lots {{of water from the}} riverbed can be extracted like in the downstream of the study area, people do irrigated agriculture on the riverbanks. But in such areas it is hard to find locations where sand dams can be founded on rock. Therefore sand dams are endangered by erosion of the riverbanks. In areas with steeper slopes and narrow and thin riverbeds, irrigated agriculture cannot be applied in the vicinity. Here people need to invest in equipment to utilize the water stored by the sand dams. But in these areas there are more locations where sand dams can be founded on rocks. Therefore the sand dams are more robust. Other factors that influence the utilization of water from the catchment are water quality and the availability of alternative water sources. To investigate how the effects of the sand storage dams on the groundwater tables may influence the availability of water and therefore the water use, a groundwater model was developed. With the ‘pmwin’ groundwater model, which is based on the finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW, the influence of local catchment properties on the performance of the sand dams were assessed and changes in flow directions around sand dams analysed. The simulations show that the slopes of the stream and the thickness of the riverbed {{have a major impact on}} the amount of water stored by the sand dams. Because the sand dams which store the largest amount of water lie in the area where most of the irrigated fields are located, the modelling results give a possible explanation for the observed development. The study shows that the sand dams in general lead to larger amounts of water available in the catchment. Therefore they improve living conditions of the local communities. However the effects of the sand dams differ between the areas. In some areas they only help the communities to satisfy their domestic water demand, while in other areas people have sufficient water to generate income through irrigated agriculture. But sand storage dams may also fail and their effect abate afterwards. Thus the study shows that there is not ‘The Effect’ of the sand storage dams on the development of a catchment. To understand why sand storage dams have a certain effect it is important to take the local circumstances into account by assessing their effects. One should also be cautious and choose a flexible implementation and operation approach that takes the local circumstances into account if the experience with sand storage dams is transferred from one area to another. Finally, if there is not ‘The Effect’ of sand storage dams, how do developments of catchments look like after the construction of sand storage dams? Based on the information obtained in the field, hypothetical socio-hydrological narratives for small sub areas in catchment, which need to be proved in further research, are formulated to show how these sub-catchments may have developed.

40|$|Several {{pressing}} issues face municipal planners including increased {{land use and}} climate change. Managing these issues requires a balance between different actions to accommodate citizen’s demands of ecosystem services (ES) and development projects. The implementation of ES as a new tool for assessments needs to be contrasted by research considering existing tools such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). ES has been introduced as a policy tool at the governmental level but implementation at the local and regional scale is still needed; municipalities could benefit from collaboration with the research community for {{state of the art}} methods. One obstacle for implementation of ES {{is that it is not}} always easy for laymen to understand and additionally, the ES concept may be weakly supported by science. The municipalities realize that a society on its way towards sustainability takes advantage of new knowledge and that interactions with research will put them in the forefront of new scientific questions. The municipalities ask for research that takes a citizen perspective and research that prioritizes questions other than pure environmental considerations. Priorities in municipality planning are based on local conditions and rely on EIA. Many ecological indicators are already covered in EIA and this is reflected in Swedish Comprehensive Plans (SCP) documents, yet need further analysis is needed to be a part of ES. The SCPs present concepts at a policy level and rarely provide a more detailed plan of action compatible with the ES approach. We found that the use of ES concepts in Swedish Comprehensive Plans and in EIA is still not common and in need of further support from research and in practice. The EIA is decisive for comprehensive planning documents in the Swedish municipalities and follows standard format over time and between municipalities. ES is focused on human needs while the EIA describes place based assessments on environmental impact rather than <b>feedback</b> to the <b>society</b> by the intervention. Municipalities of south Sweden ask for research support in many different areas, for instance how to set up proper organization for implementation of ES and environmental issues, but priorities are based on their local conditions. The results shows that collaboration between stakeholders and researchers is needed which can create incentives, so that the decisions made by individuals, communities, corporations, and governments may be able to promote widely shared values compatible with ES. Researchers and municipalities who work on an operational level face many challenges in promoting greater use of the ES approach, with some of them yet to be defined. We conclude that implementation of ES could draw from lessons learned in the use of EIA. Further, it is presented that ES has the potential for greater public and stakeholder feedback into decisions as compared to EIA...|$|R
40|$|Communication is {{the basic}} human needs. Communication is the {{receiving}} and giving action such information or message as we need. Basically, there are several elements of communication: source, message, channel, and receiver and completed with feedback and environmental. This thesis describe about The Communication Principles in the Quran: A Study to An-Nida Verses. There are forty seven verses about an-Nida based on term nada. Quran as media of communication, God and His creature. Quran use different word to show the communication activities such as: yuridu, ya’muru, yasya, kutiba, yaqdzi and fi’il amri. In an effort to understand the Qur'an and pass it to anyone is a communication activity. The {{things that can be}} used as evidence to understand the Quran as communication activities are reading (al-‘Alaq: 1 - 2), remember (Abasa: 11 - 12), study (Ali Imran: 79), finding explanation (al-Furqan: 33), take action (al-Furqon: 52). In communication, there are eight ethic codes that accordance with Islamic teach: responsibility, freedom, independency, sincerity, truthfulness, accuracy, impartiality, fair play, and decency. Here the writer search in Maryam: 3, story about Prophet Zakariya who ask son to God for his preaching continuity because he was grow old and his wife was barren. In this communication Prophet Zakaria and God as a communicator while he can be communicant at same time. The message is Zakariya prayer. Gabriel as channel to delivery message from God. Praying as media to express his wish. The son is his happiness concept. The setting is his condition and psychological side. The feedback God granted and safe him by his son. While in Hud: 45, this case bout Prophet Noah who ask his son being safe when flood came, but God did not granted his prayer because his son was bad boys. In this communication Prophet Noah and God as a communicator while he can be communicant at same time. The message is Noah prayer. Praying as media to express his wish. The son being safe is his happiness concept. The setting is flood. The feedback God disagree his wish and God did not granted his prayer, and then Noah happiness concept did not happen. From the research the writer can conclude that the communication is more important and do as on ethic, because wrong communication it will be wrong in meaning, understanding and interpretation. Also the process of revelation is the process of delivering the message which God words (kalam Allah) is a message (ar-risalah). In other words, God as source, Prophet Muhammad as receiver, communication codes is Arabic language, and Gabriel as channel. The noise was from Quraisy or Arabian societies who disturb Muhammad’s preaching. The <b>feedback</b> was Arabian <b>society</b> who embraces Islam and rejects Muhammad’s preaching. Besides, the language style of the Quran to communicate, metaphor {{is one of the most}} frequently used in al-Quran, such as: Tasybih, Majaz, Kinayah and Isti’arah. ...|$|R
