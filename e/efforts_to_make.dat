5|$|In 1900, after Galveston {{was struck}} by a devastating hurricane, <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated. The {{following}} year, the discovery of oil at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont prompted the development of the Texas petroleum industry. In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt approved a $1-million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the city's population had reached 78,800, almost doubling from a decade before. African Americans formed {{a large part of the}} city's population, numbering 23,929 people, which was nearly one-third of the residents.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Bartley was {{recruited}} as the film's director of photography; G. Kalyana Sundaram and D. G. Jayaram edited the film. Ghantasala composed the soundtrack and score. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors. Suryakantam {{was chosen to}} play Gundamma and Chakrapani suggested Kameswara Rao not to make any special <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her character look ruthless because Suryakantam had an aggressive body language.|$|E
5|$|The Naruto manga series, {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Masashi Kishimoto, is split in two parts to divide the storyline; the second part is simply known as Part II. The plot follows the return of the ninja Naruto Uzumaki to Konohagakure, after {{two and a half years}} of training after leaving his teammates Sakura Haruno and Kakashi Hatake, and his subsequent <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his best friend, Sasuke Uchiha, return with him and his friends. However, the criminal organization Akatsuki begins to hunt Naruto to get the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox that is sealed within him.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, the Park Service {{installed}} two webcams at the Sheep Rock Unit. Both transmit continuous real-time images; one {{shows the}} paleontology {{lab at the}} Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features. In June 2011, work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon-neutral. Solar panels generate enough electricity to power the house {{as well as the}} ranger's electric vehicle, on loan from its manufacturer for a year. The project is part of ongoing <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the whole park carbon-neutral.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently left out of the team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.|$|E
5|$|Local {{officials}} in Allegan have proposed {{creation of a}} truck route around the town. Concerned about the traffic and noise, residents have formed the Citizens for a Safer Community. They cite reports that show that the accident rates in town are higher than the statewide average. The group and local officials are proposing using 24th Street, 118th Avenue and Babylon Road for truck traffic. MDOT would require permits to erect the signs needed for the truck route. The department has indicated that the bypass {{would not be a}} state highway. MDOT will not take ownership of the roads needed for the truck route, but overall the department is supportive of the city's <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the downtown area more pedestrian friendly.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is {{the first}} such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia {{ratified}} the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight {{the contrast between the}} achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes. The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the host city Sochi more accessible.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation was {{the result}} of early <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the River Don in South Yorkshire, England, navigable between Fishlake and Sheffield. The Dutch {{engineer}} Cornelius Vermuyden had re-routed the mouth of the river in 1626, to improve drainage, and the new works included provision for navigation, but the scheme did not solve the problem of flooding, and the Dutch River was cut in 1635 to link the new channel to Goole. The first Act of Parliament to improve navigation on the river was obtained in 1726, by a group of Cutlers based in Sheffield; the Corporation of Doncaster obtained an Act in the following year for improvements to the lower river. Locks and lock cuts were built, and, by 1751, the river was navigable to Tinsley.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E
5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} {{school life}} goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships {{with his friends}} and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute {{the premise of the}} game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Yuuki jealous only serve to further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from Summer Days. Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Whites {{represented}} 94.7% of Boston's population. From the 1950s {{to the end}} of the 20th century, {{the proportion}} of non-Hispanic whites in the city declined; in 2000, non-Hispanic whites made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city majority-minority for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant gentrification, in which affluent whites have moved into formerly non-white areas. In 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated that non-Hispanic whites again formed a slight majority. But , in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more affordable housing more available, the non-white population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding US Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic white population of 47 percent (some reports give slightly lower figures).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E

It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 flagship model, the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing <b>efforts.</b> <b>To</b> <b>make</b> the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E
