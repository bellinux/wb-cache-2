5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and <b>Diesel</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Unit</b> services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar {{is on the left}} and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car <b>Diesel</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Unit</b> (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in the}} distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E

5|$|Under British Rail, many {{passenger}} services on the Amlwch branch operated through to Bangor, removing {{the need to}} change trains at Gaerwen. An early three-coach British United Traction (A.E.C.) <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> train was trialled {{on the line in}} May 1953. The train was economical in fuel use, and did not require a fireman, but train passengers and crew complained at the very rough ride - rattling windows a particular complaint. As part of British Rail's Modernisation Plan, Derby Lightweight DMUs were introduced three years later. A 1956 brochure advertised day return tickets from Bangor to Amlwch for 4s.4d, or Llangefni for 11d. Steam engines continued to be used for freight trains, and for extra workings such as Saturday trains. Steam returned for all passenger trains in the summers of 1963 and 1964 due to a shortage of DMUs.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, an NSB Class Cmb1 <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> {{was taken}} into use, {{and the number of}} daily trips {{increased}} to four. On days with heavy traffic, it hauled a trailer, which was normally stationed at Sandnes Station. On 10 November 1935, the new Ganddal Station opened, simplifying the stopping at the station. During World War II, the multiple units were disused, and instead the trains were hauled with steam locomotives. From 1 May 1944, the line was converted to standard gauge, and NSB Class 14 multiple units were taken into use, running on wood gas {{until the end of the}} war. In 1945, there were four daily round trips, but at the start of 1946, the number of daily round trips increased to six, and from mid-1946, to ten. From 1947 to 1953, there were eight or nine daily round trips, and from 1953 ten. Class 14 was eventually replaced with NSB Class 86 and NSB Class 87 in 1953. By then, the driving time from Ålgård to Sandnes had been reduced from 38 to 25minutes.|$|E
5|$|Sabah uses a dual {{carriageway}} with the left-hand traffic rule. All major towns in Sabah also provide public transportation {{services such as}} buses, taxis and vans. The BRT Kota Kinabalu is currently under construction to provide bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Sabah's capital. A rail transport through the Western Line operated by the Sabah State Railway provides daily services for commuters, travellers, {{as well as for}} cargo transportation. A separate company owned by Sutera Harbour known as the North Borneo Railway operates leisure tour for tourists. The train station and terminal is located in Tanjung Aru, not far from the city airport. Other main stations including in Papar, Beaufort and Tenom. The current Aeropod projects on the main station in Tanjung Aru will modernise the station and provide a provision for future light rail transit (LRT). In early 2016, the state government has purchased a new <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> (DMU) for about RM8 million to replace the old train used between Beaufort and Tenom while the rail line from Halogilat and Tenom will be upgrading by the federal government at the cost of RM99.5 million along with the arrival of another three DMUs that will be received in early 2018. Kota Kinabalu International Airport is the main gateway to Sabah. In 2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as a runway expansion. As a result of this expansion, the airport is now able to accommodate the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. It has also become the second largest airport in Malaysia. Other smaller airports in Sabah including Kudat Airport, Lahad Datu Airport, Sandakan Airport and Tawau Airport. Layang-Layang Airport in Swallow Reef served as a military and civilian airport. Three airlines serving flight routes in Sabah: Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, and Malindo Air. Sabah Air is a helicopter chartered flight company owned by the Sabah state government, serving flights for aerial sightseeing to interested customers as well for the transportation of state government servants.|$|E
50|$|From {{the late}} 1980s some class 628/928 <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were {{used on the}} lower section as far as Baiersbronn.

50|$|Silloth {{remained}} {{popular as}} a holiday destination, but the traffic was seasonal. Two-car <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> were introduced on the line, replacing steam traction of passenger trains, on 29 November 1954. This {{was the second}} introduction of <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>units</b> in the Great Britain, the first having been in the West Riding.|$|R
5|$|The last {{scheduled}} London Transport steam {{passenger train}} on the branch left Chesham at 12.11am on 12 September 1960. 1,917 passengers used {{the line that}} day, in comparison with a typical Sunday usage of around 100. Earlier on 11 September descendants of the Chesham residents who had attended Watkin's original meeting to promote the railway, along with 86-year-old Albert Wilcox who had been present {{at the opening of}} the line, rode the steam shuttle to Chalfont& Latimer and back, and attended a ceremony in Chesham's Council Chamber. (Although the 12.11am service from Chesham on 12 September 1960 was the last scheduled London Transport steam service to use the line, a steam train left Marylebone for Chesham each morning at 3.55am to deliver newspapers, returning as the first passenger train from Chesham at 5.58am. This journey to Marylebone was open to the public but was unadvertised and did not appear in published timetables. This arrangement continued to be operated by steam locomotive until 18 June 1962.) The Ashbury passenger cars, which by now had each covered around , were retired from service. The last steam-powered passenger services on the remaining non-electrified section between Amersham and Aylesbury ran on 9 September 1961. The line between Amersham and Aylesbury was handed over to British Rail, leaving Chesham as the westernmost point of the London Underground network. The goods yard at Chesham was closed in 1966, and a train hauled by a former GWR 5700 Class locomotive removed the track from the goods yard, the last steam service to use the line. On 17 October 1967 the newspaper train service and its return journey to Marylebone, by this time worked by a British Rail <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit,</b> was abandoned, leaving the branch exclusively operated by London Transport trains.|$|E

They have the same basic design, bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> (DMU), which is in turn the most common post-privatisation <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> family, and both evolved from the Class 168 Clubman design by Adtranz.

25|$|The Budd Rail Diesel Car, RDC or Buddliner is a {{self-propelled}} <b>diesel</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>unit</b> (DMU) railcar. Between 1949 and 1962, 398 RDCs {{were built}} by the Budd Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional diesel locomotive-drawn train with coaches. The cars could be used singly or several could be coupled together in train sets and controlled from the cab of the front unit. The RDC {{was one of the}} few DMU trains to achieve commercial success in North America.
