500|$|In a mixed review, Vibe magazine's Jason King {{said that}} the album {{occasionally}} [...] "sounds desperate to reach every demographic". Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyoncé had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective [...] "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it [...] "a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads [...] "self-pitying/self-mythologising", while Q stated, [...] "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it [...] "demonstrates vocal finesse [...] But, especially on the ballads, [...] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardians Adam Sweeting wrote that [...] "the desperate urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad {{means that there is}} barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Baby Boy" [...] as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, [...] "Dangerously in Love ... with <b>her</b> <b>daddy,</b> the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." [...] He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating [...] "a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that [...] "the first half is good enough to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny".|$|E
500|$|After Underwood's Play On Tour {{wrapped in}} December 2010, {{she started to}} work on her fourth studio album, which was then untitled. Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs." [...] Songwriters Chris Tompkins and Josh Kear, who {{previously}} wrote [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] for Underwood's debut album, Some Hearts (2005), worked on [...] "Blown Away" [...] initially without a specific artist in mind. At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / <b>Her</b> <b>daddy</b> was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song. As they wrote the pre-chorus line [...] "not enough rain in Oklahoma", both knew that it was a Carrie Underwood song, as the singer is from that state. [...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented. After the theme of the song had been established, the songwriters wanted to [...] "dig up as much drama as [...] could." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{tells the story of a}} daughter locking herself in a storm cellar while her alcoholic father is passed out on the couch in the path of a tornado. Underwood revealed that [...] "Blown Away" [...] was the song that defined the direction of the album, and recalled the first time she heard the demo: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{subject of}} the song [...] "She" [...] is not {{mentioned}} in the lyrics, but Misfits associate Eerie Von noted in The Misfits box set in 1996 that the song was about Patty Hearst. The lyrics reference Hearst's participation in a San Francisco bank robbery in 1974: [...] "She walked out with empty arms, machine gun in her hand/She is good and she is bad, no one understands/She walked in in silence, never spoke a word/She's got a rich <b>daddy,</b> she's <b>her</b> <b>daddy's</b> girl".|$|R

The fourth song, [...] "Rat Room", is about fighting with her alter ego Jane, who wants to [...] "destroy everything she has made".
