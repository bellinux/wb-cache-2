40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} have recently shown promise in the ad-hoc retrieval task. However, such models {{have often been}} based on one field of the document, for example considering document title only or <b>document</b> <b>body</b> only. Since in practice documents typically have multiple fields, and given that non-neural ranking models such as BM 25 F {{have been developed to}} take advantage of document structure, this paper investigates how neural models can deal with multiple document fields. We introduce a model that can consume short text fields such as document title and long text fields such as <b>document</b> <b>body.</b> It can also handle multi-instance fields with variable number of instances, for example where each document has zero or more instances of incoming anchor text. Since fields vary in coverage and quality, we introduce a masking method to handle missing field instances, as well as a field-level dropout method to avoid relying too much on any one field. As in the studies of non-neural field weighting, we find it is better for the ranker to score the whole document jointly, rather than generate a per-field score and aggregate. We find that different document fields may match different aspects of the query and therefore benefit from comparing with separate representations of the query text. The combination of techniques introduced here leads to a neural ranker that can take advantage of full document structure, including multiple instance and missing instance data, of variable length. The techniques significantly enhance the performance of the ranker, and also outperform a learning to rank baseline with hand-crafted features.

As the language analysis cannot be done without considering first the multiple writing traditions present in the Toledan scene, we began examining the paleographic and graphic aspects of the documents. This study put in evidence the coexistence of very different traditions, which is in turn reflecting, without any doubt, on other analysis’ levels, from the phonetics to the lexic. We also traced the northern provenience of the Toledan writing habits, and their connections with the Castilian of Alfonso X, with surprising result...|$|E

Method: historical-social study, we used the concepts of Pierre Bourdieu as a theoretical framework, oral and documentary primary sources. Oral sources were derived from interviews with 11 nurses {{and a member of the}} health management who experienced this process. After the completion of each interview were performed transcription and thorough reading of the same, in order to organize the <b>document</b> <b>body</b> to be worked. Results: As they were acting, the nurses began to fight for the overthrow of the ruling power, established strategies in the processes of selection and hiring, updated the professional habitus, reacted as the wage gap between doctors and nurses and claimed professional autonomy.

40|$|Abstract. The current {{availability}} of information many times impair the tasks of searching, browsing and analysing information pertinent to a topic of interest. This paper presents a methodology to create a meaningful graphical representation of corpora of documents targeted at supporting exploration of correlated information. The purpose of such an approach is to produce a map from a <b>document</b> <b>body</b> on a research topic or field based on the analysis of their contents, and similarities amongst articles. The document map is generated, after text pre-processing, by projecting the data in two dimensions using Latent Semantic Indexing. The projection is followed by hierarchical clustering to support sub-area identification. The map can be interactively explored, helping to narrow down the search for relevant articles. Tests were performed using a collection of documents pre-classified in three research subject classes: Case-Based Reasoning, Information Retrieval, and Inductive Logic Programming. The map produced was capable of separating the main areas and approaching documents by their similarity, revealing possible topics, and identifying boundaries between them. The tool {{can deal with the}} exploration of inter-topics and intra-topic relationship and is useful in many contexts that need deciding on relevant articles to read, such as scientific research, education, and training...|$|E
