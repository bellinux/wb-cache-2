30|$|Another {{limitation}} {{of this paper is}} that many of the <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> in the sample lost their jobs during the Great Recession, around the period between 2007 and 2009 when the unemployment rate peaked at ten percent in the United States. As a result, these <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> are certainly likely to have had more difficulty finding jobs than other <b>workers</b> <b>displaced</b> during non-recessionary periods.

Our results support the findings in the literature that <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> experience substantial and persistent effects on employment probabilities and wages. The size of these employment and wage effects are contingent on age. <b>Displaced</b> older <b>workers</b> face worse employment prospects than <b>displaced</b> prime-age <b>workers</b> and <b>displaced</b> older <b>workers</b> who do find a job typically experience larger wage losses than <b>displaced</b> prime-age <b>workers.</b> This picture is clear from descriptive statistics and remains after comparing the outcomes of <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> to a control group of workers with the same observed characteristics, who {{were not involved in}} firm bankruptcies.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{economic}} transition on the pattern and costs of worker displacement in Ukraine, using the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) for the years 1992 to 2002. Displacement rates in the Ukrainian labor market average between 3. 4 and 4. 8 percent of employment, roughly in line with levels typically observed in several Western economies, but considerably larger than in Russia. The characteristics of <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> are similar to those displaced in the West, in so far as displacement is concentrated on the less skilled. Around one third of <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> find re-employment immediately while the majority continues into long-term non- employment.

Overall, the workers in our sample did not differ greatly from the full sample. For example, the average weekly earnings at the current job of those in the <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> sample were slightly higher than those in the full sample (i.e., $ 685.01 vs. $ 677.47), and the differences in gender, race, and age were quite small between the two samples.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to quantify preseparation earnings losses of workers displaced in mass layoffs using the <b>Displaced</b> <b>Worker</b> Survey, {{the largest and}} most representative sample of displaced workers. Using the 1986 <b>Displaced</b> <b>Worker</b> Survey and random samples of the 1984 and 1985 Current Population Survey as a comparison group, it is found that workers lose on average 9 percent of their earnings prior to separation as a result of wage cuts. This result is very similar to the preseparation losses found in other studies using different data sources. One implication of this finding is that those studies that only take into consideration the post-displacement losses of workers displaced in mass layoffs clearly underestimate the total costs suffered by these workers. ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> {{experience}} substantial wage reductions that are strongly related to their predisplacement job tenure and experience. This paper is an assessment of whether firm closures or downturns in more broadly defined labor markets drive the extreme wage losses of high tenure, high experience <b>displaced</b> <b>workers.</b> I show that the relatively high wage losses of high experience <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> are primarily due to their heightened sensitivity to downturns in their state, industry, and occupation. However, the large wage losses of high tenure <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> are not explained by their sensitivity to these local downturns. One interpretation of these facts is that firm specialization is linked primarily to firm-specific experience, but not to general labor market experience. ...|$|R

We investigate {{the role of}} post-displacement occupational matching in explaining the cost of job displacement. We combine German administrative data on the work history of <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> with information on the task content of more than 260 occupations, providing a measure of skill mismatch between a worker's pre- and post-displacement occupation. We find that displaced occupational switchers suffer average wage losses of more than 8 % over 15 years. However, <b>displaced</b> <b>workers</b> moving to occupations where they are initially underqualified quickly manage {{to return to their}} pre-displacement earnings path, and even gain from switching in the long run.

Instead, both stayers and quitters {{should be used for}} the construction of this credible counterfactual, since for a <b>displaced</b> <b>worker</b> the non-treatment state might be either staying at the firm or quitting the firm.|$|E

40|$|The {{employment}} of older workers into their mid- 60 s {{will be critical}} {{to their ability to}} ensure a secure retirement. One of the risks threatening the ability to work to older ages is being “displaced,” with displacement defined as the elimination of the worker’s job due to a shift in the demand for labor. Displacement can easily throw 50 -year-old workers off course, disrupt their retirement saving plans, and lead to premature retirement. This paper explores the relationship between job loss and age over the period 1984 - 2004 using the biennial <b>Displaced</b> <b>Worker</b> Supplement to the Current Population Survey. It finds that no major trends in the displacement of older workers have occurred over the 11 <b>Displaced</b> <b>Worker</b> Surveys conducted during the period. Re-employment rates for older workers appear to have improved. And the earnings loss associated with the displacement of older workers has not changed significantly. Two other significant findings relate to tenure and education. First, the historical protection that older workers appeared to have against displacement was due to tenure not to age per se. Controlling for tenure, the probability of displacement increases with age. Second, college education is no longer a source of significant protection in the world of displacement, and its importance has declined sharply for re-employment. older workers, displacement, retirement, saving plans, job loss, tenure, education, re-employment, earnings loss...|$|E
