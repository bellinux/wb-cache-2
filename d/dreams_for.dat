5|$|In Budapest Tales (1976), Szabó traded his earlier, complex {{narrative}} structures, {{characterized by}} flashbacks and <b>dreams,</b> <b>for</b> a more linear one. At the same time, he traded the literal representation of history for an allegorical one. The film follows a disparate {{group of people}} who come together on the outskirts of an unnamed city {{at the end of an}} unnamed war to repair a damaged tram and ride it into the city. Allegorically, the film was interpreted by critics variously as representing Hungarian history specifically or universal human responses to war and reconstruction more generally.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural <b>dreams</b> <b>for</b> the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

25|$|The Eugene Mall was a car-free zone in {{the heart}} of Eugene, Oregon, {{designed}} to encourage pedestrian access to shopping and entertainment areas. Dedicated on February 13, 1971, the mall opened amid three days of fanfare and dreams of a revitalized downtown. Conflict over the scope and use of the mall began immediately and continued for 30 years until the last remaining parts of the mall were opened to automobile traffic. At that time, a former Eugene mayor commented that the city's <b>dreams</b> <b>for</b> a bright future just hadn't worked. Many residents, however, shared the much-earlier view of a former downtown merchant, that Eugene had sustained more damage from the mall than it would have from a natural disaster.|$|E
25|$|Industrialist Collis P. Huntington (1821–1900) {{provided}} crucial {{funding to}} complete the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (C) from Richmond, Virginia to the Ohio River in the early 1870s.

In 1881, the Peninsula Extension of the C was built from Richmond down the Virginia Peninsula to reach a new coal pier on Hampton Roads in Warwick County near the small unincorporated community of Newport News Point. However, building the railroad and coal pier was only {{the first part of}} Huntington's <b>dreams</b> <b>for</b> Newport News.|$|E
