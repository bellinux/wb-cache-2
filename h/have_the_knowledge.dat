According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

25|$|An {{individual}} {{must be able}} {{to connect}} in order to achieve enhancement of social and cultural capital and achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but have nonfunctioning capabilities in that they do not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them.|$|E

25|$|Episode two: Abdul and Liz - The {{couple in}} episode two, Abdul and Liz, {{have been married}} for eight years. During their married life, their dress sense has become almost {{identical}} and both dress in practical outdoor wear. Their clothing is so similar that they have to write on initials in order to differentiate between their own items. Liz feels that she does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> about fashion to dress smartly and loathes clothes shopping. Abdul contacted the show originally, fearing that their clothing has a negative impact on their self-confidence and social life, but Liz however feels {{that they do not have}} a problem. For dinner parties, Abdul is keen to dress smarter, but feels obliged to dress down to match a more casual Liz. Liz has a demanding job, often coping with a sixty-hour week. Soon into Woodall and Constantine's arrival, they discover that Abdul and Liz sleep in separate beds, so as not to disturb each other. When the couple are revealed behind the silhouette screen, Woodall and Constantine see an admirable figure on Liz that has been hidden by her unflattering clothing. In the makeover, Trinny dresses Liz in a fitted trouser suit and waistcoat to accentuate her figure. To give Abdul more youth, Susannah fitts him with a tailored suit and purple shirt.|$|E

2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry?

Also, the idea that law is just a product of deliberate design, denied by natural law and linked to legal positivism, can easily generate totalitarianism: [...] "If law is wholly the product of deliberate design, whatever the designer decrees to be law is just by definition and unjust law becomes a contradiction in terms. The will of the duly authorized legislator is then wholly unfettered and guided solely by his concrete interests".

It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.|$|E
