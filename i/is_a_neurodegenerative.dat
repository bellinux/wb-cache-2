5|$|Huntington's disease <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> genetic {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the Huntingtin protein cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
25|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating a variety of diseases. For example, schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> disease that may result from an abnormal ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors.

25|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{also known}} simply as Alzheimer's, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> disease {{characterized}} by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining {{activities of daily living}} and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.|$|E

25|$|Parkinson's disease <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> disease {{described}} by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or in-vitro, some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E

50|$|Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>neurodegenerative</b> {{condition}} {{characterized by}} two hallmarks: senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangle.
