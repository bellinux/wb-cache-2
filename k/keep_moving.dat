5|$|Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I, a short novel set {{immediately}} after XIII, shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself {{caught in a}} dark void, but she decides to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward.|$|E
5|$|Ugg and Wrongway – Two purple {{creatures that}} hop {{along the sides}} of the cubes in an Escheresque manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively, and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end.|$|E
5|$|After {{building}} boats, Lochry {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Wheeling, hoping {{to catch up with}} the main body of the expedition. Meanwhile, Clark left Major Charles Cracraft with provisions and a small group of men on Camp Three Island to await Lochry's arrival. Further down the Ohio, Clark stopped at the mouth of the Kanawha River, but again he decided to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> in order to prevent desertion. Clark left a letter fastened to a pole which instructed Lochry to keep following.|$|E

5|$|After more lineup changes, Stockdale {{stopped using}} the Wolfmother name in 2013 and {{released}} {{a collection of}} recent recordings under his own name as <b>Keep</b> <b>Moving.</b> The band returned shortly after the album's release, however, and later released their third album New Crown in March 2014, which reached number 160 on the Billboard 200. The band released their fourth studio album Victorious in February 2016, which reached number 17 on the Australian Albums Chart.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{is badly}} mauled by {{a grizzly bear}} and left close to death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and <b>keep</b> <b>moving.</b> Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E
5|$|The group became {{lost and}} confused. After {{two more days}} without food, Patrick Dolan {{proposed}} {{that one of them}} should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice. Eddy suggested that they <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt. Antonio the animal handler was the first to die; Franklin Graves was the next casualty.|$|E
5000|$|Willy Ley {{gave the}} novel a mixed review, praising it as [...] "a story which <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> from page {{one to the}} end," [...] but {{complaining}} that it included [...] "too much plot and counterplot, sub-plot and sub-sub-plot." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{extremely}} common within its small range. However, there are threats to its habitat from forest fires, timber extraction, and small-scale farming, which <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> uphill. The IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group underscores that habitat protection is urgently required for this species.|$|R

5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would <b>keep</b> <b>moving.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Knight Bus segment when Harry {{is being}} taken to The Leaky Cauldron uses the {{technique}} known as bullet time, popularised in The Matrix series of films. This segment takes humorous advantage of the magic quality of the Harry Potter world by having the Muggle world go into bullet time while inside the Knight Bus, Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang (and the talking shrunken head) <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> in real time.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{transmission}} line, a wave travels {{from the source}} along the line. Suppose the wave hits a boundary (an abrupt change in impedance). Some of the wave is reflected back, while some <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> onwards. (Assume {{there is only one}} boundary, at the load.) ...|$|R

5000|$|In this case, by {{the time}} the front of the ladder collides with the back door, the back of the ladder does not know it yet, so it <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> {{forwards}} (and the ladder [...] "compresses"). In both the frame of the garage and the inertial frame of the ladder, the back end <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> {{at the time of the}} collision, until at least the point where the back of the ladder comes into the light cone of the collision (i.e., a point where force moving backwards at the speed of light from the point of the collision will reach it). At this point the ladder is actually shorter than the original contracted length, so the back end is well inside the garage. Calculations in both frames of reference will show this to be the case.|$|R
25|$|Each soldier had {{two to four}} horses—so when a horse tired {{they could}} change {{to one of the}} others. This made them one of the fastest armies in the world, but also made the Mongol army {{vulnerable}} to shortages of fodder. Campaigning in arid regions such as Central Asia or forested regions of Southern China were thus difficult and even in ideal steppe terrain, a Mongol force had to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> to ensure sufficient grazing for its massive horse herd.|$|E
25|$|Two forts on the Outer Banks (Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras) {{had been}} built by the Confederates, to protect their commerce-raiding activity. But these were lightly-defended, and their {{artillery}} could not engage the bombarding fleet under Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham, commandant of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which had been ordered to <b>keep</b> <b>moving,</b> to avoid presenting a static target. Although held up by bad weather, the fleet was able to land troops under General Ben Butler, who took the surrender of Flag Officer Samuel Barron.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E

50|$|The road then passes Beckermet and Calder Bridge, {{junctions}} here give {{access to}} the Sellafield site. It <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> south into a sparsely populated area of Cumbria. It passes just inside the Lake District National Park boundary and {{near the village of}} Ravenglass. Moving back out of the national park, it passes through Waberthwaite and Bootle and round the foot of Black Combe.|$|R
25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a side-to-side dash or vertical leap into the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
25|$|The fleet {{moved to}} the attack on November 7, after more delays caused by the weather during which {{additional}} troops were brought into Fort Walker. Flag Officer Du Pont ordered his ships to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> in an elliptical path, bombarding Fort Walker on one leg and Fort Beauregard on the other; the tactic had recently been used effectively at the Battle of Hatteras Inlet. His plan soon broke down, however, and most ships took enfilading positions that exploited a weakness in Fort Walker. The Confederate gunboats put in a token appearance, but fled up a nearby creek when challenged. Early in the afternoon, most of the guns in the fort were out of action, and the soldiers manning them fled to the rear. A landing party from the flagship took possession of the fort.|$|E
25|$|Network Projection is used {{to detect}} and use network-connected projectors. It {{can be used to}} display a {{presentation}}, or share a presentation with the machine which hosts the projector. Users can do this over a network so multiple sources can be connected at different times without having to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> the sources or projectors around. The network projector can be connected to the network via wireless or cable (LAN) technology to make it even more flexible. Users can not only connect to the network projector remotely but can also remotely configure it. Network projectors are designed to transmit and display still images, such as photographs and slides —not high-bandwidth transmissions, such as video streams. The projector can transmit video, but the playback quality is often poor. Binary %windir%\system32\NetProj.exe implement Network Projection feature.|$|E
30|$|The Set Direction {{procedure}} {{sets the}} ranging of a calculated intended angle keeping it within allowable limits of 0 ° to 359 °. The Apply Fixed Translation inverts the heading, moves the agent x time speed, thus placing it at probably a vacant location, updating the History, and, inverting the direction again, {{so that it}} <b>keeps</b> <b>moving</b> in the same direction, after being sufficiently dispersed.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the source}} node <b>keeps</b> <b>moving,</b> its {{location}} calculated {{based on the}} old INTEREST packet might not be accurate any more. If no measure is taken to correct the source location, the actual forwarding path might get {{far away from the}} expected one; that is, the destination of the data forwarding path most probably misses the sink. We propose the following sink-assisted approach to solve this problem.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. {{government}} has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy {{what they think}} is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead. As long as the train <b>keeps</b> <b>moving,</b> his location cannot be determined. However, Casey faxes a message to the owner of the Mile High Cafe, who contacts Admiral Bates. Bates reluctantly approves a stealth bomber strike to destroy the train.|$|R
25|$|Richthofen's forces quickly {{established}} {{air superiority}} in the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, destroying 82 enemy fighters {{within the first}} day. Richthofen arrived at his command post as the bombs first fell. He {{was impressed with the}} 2,100 sorties flown on 7 May. Inter service communication was facilitated by Fliegerverbindungsoffizier (air liaison officers or Flivos), specially trained air force officers attached to ground units. They advised the air Corps on the situation and intentions of the ground forces and also advised the army of the best use of air power. This operational style was effective against fixed targets in slow-moving operations, but was more difficult in fast-moving operations such as Bustard Hunt. The advance meant Richthofen had to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> forward. He complained bitterly about the inability of his signals teams to set up new telephone and radio communications quickly enough.|$|E
25|$|Kōsuke Fujishima's manga series Ah! My Goddess {{featured}} {{a play on}} Schrödinger's Cat. During one storyline, a storage room was expanded to infinite proportions and the main characters encountered a Schrödinger's Whale, an extremely rare species {{with the ability to}} travel through space-time in a five-dimensional quantum state. The male lead in the series, Keiichi Morisato, befriends the whale and teaches it songs by real-life musical group The Carpenters (in the original English translation, it was Matthew Sweet) - but their time spent together is short, for the whale must move on or risk its safety as its wave function collapses. Because of this need to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> through quantum states, Schrödinger's Whales hardly ever meet, the reason they are so thin on the ground— but miraculously, Keiichi secured the future of the species by teaching it the songs. After discovering the whale had gone, he found out that it had learned Only Yesterday by itself (Missing Time in the translation) - this gave the whales a call that they could locate each other by.|$|E
25|$|Zaken, in {{the second}} tank, tried to reach his company commanders on the radio, but got no reply. He called the crewmen and told and learned {{that many of the}} commanders were either dead or wounded. He told them to <b>keep</b> <b>moving</b> {{to get out of the}} ambush and fire all weapons. The {{battalion}} made it to the square at the end of the streets and lined up facing the sources of fire. One tank commander Captain Menashe Goldblatt, who had been hit in the shoulder and lost his consciousness, recovered and was asked by Zaken to go from tank to tank and talk to the crews. He found that many of the commanders were either dead or wounded, and that many of the men were in shock. He appointed gunners and loaders as tank commanders, assigned them fire sectors and told them to switch their radio frequency from the company frequency to the battalion frequency so that they could speak directly to Zaken. One tank commander was not wounded but refused to take his head out of the turret and Goldblatt warned him that he would personally fire a shell at him if he didn't start functioning.|$|E
