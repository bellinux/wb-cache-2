40|$|Two {{different}} grain drills {{were evaluated}} for planting wheat in sandy loam soil in two consecutive {{years on the}} basis of seed depth, emergence rate, grain yield, fuel consumption, and field capacity. A factorial combination of two drills (John Deere drill equipped with <b>double</b> <b>disks</b> <b>openers</b> and press wheels, Nordsten drill equipped with hoe openers and spring spikes covering device) and four planting speeds were used. Results showed that drill type had significant effect (P<O. OI) on emergence rate and wheat yield. Planting speed had significant effect (P<O. OI) on emergence rate. Interaction between drill type and planting speed had significant effect (P< 0. 05) on emergence rate. The highest plant emergence and yield were obtained with the John Deere drill. Nordsten drill gave lower average seed depth (std. = 0. 40 em.), less fuel consumption rate, and higher field capacity. Interaction between drill type and planting speed should be considered when using grain drills for wheat planting...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the furrow opener mechanisms action and the level of load applied to soil firming mechanism in no-till, on the Oxisol resistance to penetration during soybean sowing, under three soil moistures. The experiment was arranged in split-split plot design, in which the plots were composed by three soil moistures (23. 8; 25. 5 and 27. 5 % b. s.), two furrow <b>opener</b> mechanisms sub-plots (<b>double</b> <b>disks</b> and furrow plough) and the split-split plot of three levels of load applied to soil firming mechanism (12. 2; 18. 5 and 24. 1 kPa), according to randomized blocks design, with three replications.

40|$|Seed furrow {{sidewall}} smearing by planter <b>double</b> <b>disk</b> <b>openers</b> in {{clay loam}} and loam soils {{was investigated in}} field and growth chamber experiments. Treatment variables were row preparation, soil moisture, and planting period. Evaluation parameters were soil bulk density, air permeability, cone index, emergence rate index and total emergence, and plant dry matter weight. The experiments were conducted in somewhat poorly drained soils near Ames, Iowa. The fields were not cultivated before planting and the residue {{from the previous year}} 2 ̆ 7 s corn was removed. Experiments were conducted in two cropping seasons. Each experiment consisted of a factorial design of three coulter treatments, three moisture ranges and three planting periods. Crop growing seasons were divided into three planting periods. Treatments were replicated three times using a split-split design. After planting in the field, undisturbed soil blocks were removed and transferred to growth chambers. Soil blocks were not watered and left for 28 days at 21 ° to see the plant shoot and root responses. Triple coulter produced lowest bulk density, lowest penetration resistance, and highest permeability in both the field and growth chamber experiments. In clay loam soil field experiments, the triple coulter seed placement was deeper and this treatment resulted in slower emergence and lower plant dry weight 42 days after planting than the other two row preparation treatments. In the growth chamber experiment, triple coulter had lower dry shoot weight and lower dry weight of roots in the furrow than the other two row treatments. In loam soil, triple coulter generally had faster emergence in cold and wet soil conditions and produced the highest plant dry matter weights 28 and 42 days after planting in the field experiment. In the growth chamber experiment, no significant differences among plant shoot and in-furrow root dry weights were observed for the three row treatments in loam soil. More roots were observed growing in no-coulter and single coulter seed furrows than in the triple coulter row treatment. Seed furrow sidewall smearing was greater, especially at higher soil moisture, in the no-coulter and single coulter treatment. This did not significantly affect the dry weights of plant components as long as plant moisture and nutrient needs were fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|Direct seeding {{in fields}} with high amounts of residue {{has always been}} a problem for producers. Excess residue causes hair-pining of the straw which results in {{decreased}} penetration of <b>disk</b> <b>openers.</b> Hair-pinning also results in poor seed placement which decreases the crop establishment. In the past, residue managers have commonly been used in the United States to clear residue for precision planters in high value crops. The precision planter residue managers are costly and therefore are not commonly used to seed other types of crops. Manufacturers have recently designed universal cheaper types of residue managers. The new residue managers are designed for cereal, pulse and oilseed type crops to clear the residue away from the path of the opener to allow for good soil penetration, residue clearance and seed placement. The AgTech Centre was approached by the Alberta Reduced Tillage Linkages (ARTL) to test the performance of several different residue managers. The ARTL wanted to increase the exposure of residue managers in Alberta with hopes of more producers direct seeding in heavy residue conditions. The AgTech Centre performed an experiment to test various types of residue managers while seeding with <b>disk</b> <b>openers</b> under different conditions. Measurements were made and analyzed.

40|$|A tillage {{reference}} implement (TRI) {{concept to}} predict and compare draft requirements for tillage implements was developed. The reference implement concept {{was based on}} implement draft and soil and implement scale factors. The scale factors consist of a soil scale factor, implement scale factor and soil and implement scale factor. The TRI draft {{with the use of}} scale factors can predict the implement draft irrespective of soil types and field conditions. The TRI concept was tested using a tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator. The predicted implement draft values were in close agreement with the measured values. The TRI was used to determine the force differences in a tillage operation and to predict the tillage induced changes in soil properties. The TRI draft, after the implement operation, was found to be lower than that beside the operation. The relationship of implement draft to soil and implement geometric parameters need to be precisely developed to predict the tillage effect of soil properties. ^ The TRI, tandem disk, chisel plow and field cultivator drafts, vertical forces and torques were significantly affected by the tillage depths and travel speeds. The draft, vertical force and torque models for the implements and TRI were related as a quadratic of tillage depth. ^ A microprocessor based non-contact ultrasonic sensor was used to measure tillage depths. The sensor was tested on concrete, grass, wheat stubble, lightly disked wheat stubble and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces. It performed well on concrete and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces and the measured values gave coefficient of variation lower than 10 % on concrete and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces. The precise measurements of tillage depths in the <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces were used in developing the draft model. ^ To adjust the soil scale factors for variations in soil parameters within a given soil type, a soil cone index was used as a covariate in the draft models. The effects of soil moisture content and bulk density on the cone index values were normalized using covariate analysis technique. The technique allowed treatments comparison at same and across depths. Cone index models for wheat stubble and <b>double</b> <b>disked</b> surfaces were developed based on soil depth, moisture content and bulk density. The model gave a fair estimate and the predicted values of the cone index were found within 8 % of the measured values. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{on-going}} work is {{to study}} the performance of RAID 6 protected storage systems under a Storage Performance Council- 1 (SPC- 1) benchmark based workload [3]. With the scale of modern storage systems becoming increasingly large, the probability of having <b>double</b> <b>disk</b> failure in a protection group {{is much higher than}} before. As a result, there is an increasing demand for products protected against <b>double</b> <b>disk</b> failure. Although a number of <b>double</b> <b>disk</b> failure protection algorithms have been proposed, RAID 6 has not been used extensively in practice due to its poor small write performance. In addition, there have been few publications about its performance under real world workloads. Given the trend of using RAID 6 protection, {{it is important to understand}} the performance of RAID 6 under realworld workloads. This work will study the performance of P+Q-like RAID 6 algorithm as an exemplar (other RAID 6 algorithms deploying two redundant disks in a protection group include Row-Diagonal Parity (RDP) [2] and EVENODD [1]) under an SPC- 1 benchmark based workload using simulation. A discrete-event driven simulation model called SIMRAID has been developed to model the storage subsystem. SIMRAID contains a benchmark workload generator, a detailed RAID controller coupled with cache model, a transport-level Fibre-Channel model and disk model. The accuracy of SIMRAID has been verified through simulation of a system for which there are published SPC- 1 benchmark results. Thi...|$|R
