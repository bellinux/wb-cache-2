5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Management</b> Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E

In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to redirect $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E
5|$|The blacktip shark {{is popular}} with {{recreational}} anglers in Florida, the Caribbean, and South Africa. It {{is listed as}} a game fish by the International Game Fish Association. Once hooked, this species is a strong, steady fighter that sometimes {{jumps out of the}} water. Since 1995, the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened, as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing. The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks. In both cases, regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species, such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Management</b> Plan. No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented.|$|E
25|$|According to {{fisheries}} scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in <b>fisheries</b> <b>management</b> decisions {{is the absence}} of quality data. <b>Fisheries</b> <b>management</b> decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be effective.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Plan for the Salmon Fisheries in the EEZ off the Coast of Alaska (FMP) {{manages the}} salmon {{fisheries}} in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 3 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles offshore) off Alaska. The North Pacific <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Council developed this FMP under the Magnuson-Stevens <b>Fishery</b> Conservation and <b>Management</b> Act (MSA). The FMP is being comprehensively revised {{to comply with}} the recent MSA requirements, such as annual catch limits and accountability measures, and to more clearly reflect the Council’s policy with regard to State of Alaska management authority for commercial and sport salmon fisheries in the EEZ. This document provides decision-makers and the public with an evaluation of the environmental, social, and economic effects of alternative <b>fishery</b> <b>management</b> plans for the salmon fisheries in the EEZ and addresses the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Executive Order 12866. (blank page) Executive Summary The North Pacific <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Council (Council) is considering comprehensively revising and updating the <b>Fishery</b> <b>Management</b> Plan for the Salmon Fisheries in the EEZ off the Coast of Alaska (FMP).
