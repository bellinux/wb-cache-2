5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Josef Müller {{took over}} as CEO in 1950. A {{decision}} was taken to undertake more international projects, following a period of essentially domestic work after World War II. This included a series of power infrastructure works in Turkey and bridge and smelting works construction in Egypt during the early 1950s. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that many projects from this period were undertaken outside of the First World;many were funded from development aid budgets.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79–9 overall record {{during his}} three varsity seasons, {{including}} two Final Four appearances. However, a championship eluded Robertson, {{something that would}} become a repeated occurrence in his professional career. When Robertson left college he was the all-time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Robertson took Cincinnati to national prominence during his time there, but the university's greatest success in basketball took place immediately after his departure, when the team won national titles in 1961, 1962, and just missed a third title in 1963.|$|E

5|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 5,045,356 houses in Ohio, of which 4,499,506, or about 89.2% are estimated to be occupied; this is 0.8% above the national average rate of occupation. Houses with a mortgage are estimated to cost owners about $1,216 per month, which is $186 below the national average. The United States Census Bureau also estimates that 3,150,239 houses are owner-occupied, or about 70%, which is 2.7% above the national average, and that an estimated 1,349,267 houses are renter-occupied. The median house value is $135,200, which is a significant $50,000 below the national average. Also, {{there are an}} estimated 545,850 unoccupied houses. It is also <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the plurality of houses in Ohio were built from 1940 to 1959 (1,175,325 houses), and that 3,058,721 houses are in some way dependent on utility gas.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cathedral}} was {{designed}} by French architects, it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France. Above all, it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone. Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland. As bricks and mortar are {{not as strong as}} stone, the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone (although those in the nave are of brick). The north transept portal is also built of limestone, no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window, also structured in limestone itself. While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design, the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics. Constructed in about 1330, the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French. Nicolaus from Västerås, the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s, appears to have slightly modified the original plans, adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that cross-vaults were nevertheless installed, rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time. Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey. The towers, however, still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture, indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time. Overall, despite minor differences, Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France.|$|E

5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless it is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>note</b> {{that it was}} the Williams FW08D, {{rather than}} any 4-wheeled car, which {{prompted}} FISA to ban 4WD from Formula 1 in 1982.|$|E

25|$|It is an <b>interesting</b> point <b>to</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} {{selective}} breeding of cattle {{was almost impossible}} before the enclosure of land by dykes and ditches in the 18th-century, because prior to this the cattle were free to mix without much control from the farmer and establishing or maintaining a 'pure breed' was therefore practically impossible.|$|R

30|$|An <b>interesting</b> point <b>to</b> <b>note</b> is {{that higher}} {{variability}} in productivity in LDCs {{could be the}} consequence of higher regulations to begin with: firms in sectors with a comparative advantage could have higher worker productivities, while firms in protected sectors lower productivities (even considering government regulations to protect them). In a sense, then, Peronism, by introducing distortions, generates anger towards capitalists and perpetuates the beliefs that Peronism fostered.|$|R

30|$|It is <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> also <b>note</b> {{that the}} polarimetric {{information}} becomes {{visible in the}} form of the different widths of each dimension, which can vary distinctly as in the first set, showing very little cross-polarisation scattering, or be much more evenly scaled as in the other two locations.

30|$|However, it was {{observed}} that PBR of the SNPs produced via these plant extracts remain as expected (Fig.  1) without any significant shifting [7]. It is <b>interesting,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that most of the reaction initiated by these plant extracts underwent relatively fast reaction and nucleation process characterized by high rate constant (Table  2). The scenario displayed further suggest that these reaction conditions favour a growth rate more akin to the OR process, being predominantly controlled by diffusion without prejudice to the expected passivating influence of the organic inherent in the plant extracts [6].|$|R
30|$|NADES 4 and NADES 5 affinities {{are almost}} similar to {{phospholipids}} (phosphatidylcholine). These mild affinities of NADES 4 and NADES 5 -for HBDs and HBAs of phospholipids-suggest that perhaps their cytotoxic mechanism {{is not entirely}} focused on cellular aggregation, but rather depends on the resulting reactions engendered by the cellular adsorption. That is, Krebs cycle stalling and acidosis by NADES 5, and cellular poisoning by NADES 4 at a threshold concentration. It is <b>interesting</b> though <b>to</b> <b>note</b> that the solvents with the overall lesser affinities are both the most toxic and least toxic understudied eutectics.|$|R
50|$|An {{experiment}} by Pettorelli et al. {{was carried}} out in northern Tanzania using camera traps to find out total species distribution.
