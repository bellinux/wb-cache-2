5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E
5|$|The {{composer}} Sergei Rachmaninoff {{produced a}} number of solo piano pieces that were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. He composed sixteen such pieces, and all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these casual works, he draws upon the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> composers, including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well-thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as a child or adult, these pieces cover {{a wide spectrum of}} forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} {{the power of}} the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (十三衙門), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon's regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor's attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor's favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor's death.|$|E

Although Buddhism was the state religion and the principal doctrine followed {{by the majority of}} the population, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> local beliefs, particularly Hinduism, were considerable, and are expressed in the architecture of the period.

25|$|Uyghur {{belongs to}} the Karluk branch of the Turkic {{language}} family, which also includes languages such as Uzbek. Like many other Turkic languages, Uyghur displays vowel harmony and agglutination, lacks noun classes or grammatical gender, and is a left-branching language with subject–object–verb word order. More distinctly Uyghur processes include, especially in northern dialects, vowel reduction and umlauting. In addition to <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Turkic languages, Uyghur has historically been influenced strongly by Persian and Arabic, and more recently by Mandarin Chinese and Russian.|$|E
25|$|When Buddhism came to China, it {{was adapted}} to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories about the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> schools in the {{evolution}} of Chan vary widely and heavily reliant upon speculative correlation rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between Mahāyāna Buddhism and Taoism, while others insist that Chan has roots in yogic practices, specifically , the consideration of objects, and , total fixation of the mind. A number of other conflicting theories exist.|$|E
25|$|All Kepler circumbinary planets {{that were}} known as of August 2013 orbit their stars {{very close to the}} plane of the binary (in a {{prograde}} direction) which suggests a single-disk formation. However, not all circumbinary planets are co-planar with the binary: Kepler-413b is tilted 2.5 degrees which {{may be due to the}} gravitational <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> planets or a third star. Taking into account the selection biases, the average mutual inclination between the planetary orbits and the stellar binaries is within ~3 degrees, consistent with the mutual inclinations of planets in multi-planetary systems.|$|E

25|$|Some of Mazzoni’s {{influences}} are obvious, such as Plato and Aristotle. Mazzoni regularly makes direct {{reference to}} their works and draws {{some of his}} ideas directly from theories that they established (the distinction between icastic and phantastic imitation, for example, is drawn from Plato). The <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> thinkers has also been identified in Mazzoni’s work, including neo-platonists such as Proclus and Greek sophists such as Dionysius of Helicarnassus and Aulus Gellius (the latter two particularly in Mazzoni's discussion {{on the impact of}} the character of the poet {{on the nature of the}} poem;).|$|E
25|$|German {{cultural}} patterns influenced strongly the German and Protestant burghers, {{especially in}} Royal Prussia and Poznań area, {{some of whom}} were educated at Protestant universities in Germany. The German culture became significant in the 18th century Commonwealth {{in the context of the}} personal union with Saxony. Less prevalent, but also present was the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> Protestant West European cultures, among which at the earlier stages the Dutch was more significant than English. Jewish burgher circles in the Commonwealth were important in trade and cultural contacts. Some Jews were educated abroad at the few European universities that accepted Jewish candidates.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, as the Protestant Church {{attempted}} {{to come to}} terms with the Third Reich, Barth was largely responsible for the writing of the Barmen declaration (Ger. Barmer Erklärung). This declaration rejected the influence of Nazism on German Christianity by arguing that the Church's allegiance to the God of Jesus Christ should give it the impetus and resources to resist the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> lords, such as the German Führer, Adolf Hitler. Barth mailed this declaration to Hitler personally. This was one of the founding documents of the Confessing Church and Barth was elected a member of its leadership council, the Bruderrat.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Newton's law of universal gravitation in the 17th century, {{the stability of the}} Solar System has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with Laplace. The stable orbits that arise in a two-body approximation ignore the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bodies. The effect of these added interactions on the stability of the Solar System is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to significantly change the orbital parameters and lead to a completely different configuration, or whether some other stabilising effects might maintain the configuration of the orbits of the planets.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} twentieth-century {{art is a}} {{narrative}} of endless possibilities {{and the search for}} new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence.|$|E
