One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of Newsweek, showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined [...] "EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century. <b>How</b> <b>Did</b> <b>it</b> <b>Start?</b> Can it Be Stopped?"

They found Heckler to be receptive to suggestions and, when Campbell pushed the issue of delays in people with AIDS's claims for Social Security, she promised to raise it with her counterpart at the Social Security Administration.|$|E

40|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of reasons}} {{reported}} for why organisations start a sourcing decision. This chapter discusses this theme based on two questions: Does the need and/or wish to increase e-Government services influence the start of a sourcing decision process aiming at reorganising hosting of software applications and if <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> influence the <b>start</b> of such a decision-making process? The point of departure, besides a literature review, is a sourcing decision-making process in a Swedish municipality. When analysing the sourcing decision, five suggested propositions developed from the factors, control, core competence, capability, cost, and strategy, are used. It is concluded that municipalities in Sweden has to prepare for being more of an e-Government organisation, which means that more of the services the municipalities' employees has done before citizens will do by themselves. This demands that to be able to offer future e-Government services municipalities need to have control over software applications. From this study it is suggested that centralisation of hosting can be seen as decentralisation of work tasks from an e-Government perspectiv...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{theory and}} {{applications}} of wavelets have undoubtedly dominated the journals in all mathematical, engineering and related fields throughout the last decade. Few other theoretical developments in mathematical sciences have enjoyed this much attention and popularity, {{have been applied}} to such a diverse field of disciplines, and perhaps, have been so blindly misused. What was the missing piece in the great puzzle of signal processing, and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> the wavelets fill-in this missing piece? <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all <b>start,</b> what development stages <b>did</b> <b>it</b> go through {{and what is the}} state of the art today? Have we reached the saturation, or do we have a long way to go? In this paper, we present three overviews in an attempt to answer these questions. In a historical overview, we look at the genesis of the wavelet theory as we take a short chronological journey through the wavelet times. In a technical overview, we look at the driving forces that played a key role in the development of the theory of wavelets, and try to find out what was so special that brought them to the center stage of scientific journals. In an application overview, we look at some of the most creative conventional and non-conventional applications of wavelets. On the conventional front, we discuss such applications as image compression, speech processing, and solution of partial differential equations. On the unconventional front, we look at various fields of applications including chemistry, neurophysiology, nondestructive evaluation, fractals, and economics. In particular, we discuss analyzing brain signals for the detection of Alzheimer's disease, analyzing ultrasonic weld inspection signals for the detection of cracks i...|$|R

40|$|This book {{is about}} {{narrative}} methods and narrative research. The word narrativity derives from the Latin word narrare, which means ‘to tell’. Narratives are present everywhere. They {{come in the form}} of fairy tales, drama, drawings, art, history, biography, myths and legends. Narratives can be found at all ages and in all societies. Stories have always played an important role in human life (Ten Holter, 2010). Simply put, a story is a sequence of coherent events. The following questions can usually be asked: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>start?</b> Then what happened? How did it end? (Bijl, Baars & Schueren, 2002). In the field of narratology, stories are the object of study and the focus is on the way in which these stories are told. Narratives are about biographical events as told by those who experienced them (Van Biene et al., 2008). They often have a time sequence; i. e. the narrator establishes a link between the past, the present and the future. People tell stories from a particular perspective. The narrator takes his or her own position in a story, but positions can also be assigned by others (e. g. the listener) (ibid). In addition to the narrator, narratives also include other parties; for example, a person may speak about their family or neighbours...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedIt is {{the purpose}} of this study to present an {{analysis}} of the Negro Press in Los Angeles. It attempts to show from a sociological view the component elements and the chief purpose of the press. The press is analysed by showing its chief purpose and functions, the factors that compose the press, and the contents of the various newspapers. Objectivity is sought throughout. Rating one paper superior to another similar paper will not be attempted. It is true that some may have reached a more developed stage journalistically because of their experience while others are new in the field. By limiting the study to the press of Los Angeles, a more thorough picture may be presented. Only papers published in Los Angeles by Negros that can be purchased by the public are presented. They are the ones that would circulate sufficiently to be of sociological importance. The study is limited to publications that have appeared within the last four years, 1942 to 1945 inclusively. Within the last few years same books have been written with chapters on the Negro press, and several magazine articles have appeared. To my knowledge only three books dealing with the Negro Press exclusively have been published, of which only one is in print, namely, Detweilder's The Negro Press, 1922. Original research is therefore imperative in many ways and complete information is not always possible.; The aim of this thesis is to answer the following questions: 1. Is there a need for the Negro press in Los Angeles? 2. To what extent does it have a real purpose? 3. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>start,</b> and why? 4. What types of editorials are presented in the Los Angeles Negro's press? 5. What type of advertisements are now carried in the Negro Press? 6. How much space is actually devoted to crime items? 7. What are the types of materials presented in feature sections? 8. Where does the news of the non-local type of the papers come from? These are the chief questions that arise concerning the Negro's press...|$|E
40|$|Public Employment Services (PES) are {{increasingly}} affected {{by changes in}} the economy and labour markets. Rather than focusing on the imperative for change (what to do), this paper focuses on the action (<b>how</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it).</b> Our <b>starting</b> point is that to deal with the current changes in governing and implementing tasks in advanced economies, PES needs new ways of making governance work. The aim is to consider how the move from ‘actor’ to ‘regisseur’ (Conductor) as a model for labour market governance affects the role of PES. This new role of conductor is a key element of the PES EU 2020 Strategy Output Paper, adopted {{at the end of the}} Danish Presidency in June 2012. The purpose of the PES EU 2020 Strategy Output Paper is to establish a Vision for PES delivery by 2020. It describes the necessary elements to create a modernised service to deliver the EU 2020 Employment Strategy. It calls for a shift from a traditional employment service to a labour market ‘conductor’. Implementing this Vision demands that PES offer a wider set of services to enable various transitions over the life-cycle and to support new customers (workers, inactive groups) with no traditional links to PES. PES therefore need to become enabler, coach and also a ‘conductor’ and facilitator in the labour market by building partnerships with other labour market actors. Based on the individual case study of the Belgian PES (Flanders), we conclude that the label of ‘conducting’ means more than just coordination through partnerships and networks. In practice, there is an evolution from a single mode of governance towards a multiple mode combining characteristics from all three modes of governance, i. e. hierarchy, markets and networks. A key element of the conducting role is the interaction with other actors, regardless of the mode of governance. Moreover, the mix of governance is changing over time. A key factor for PES in our case study, and probably also in other advanced PES systems, is keeping vital labour market information and matching processes under public control in an increasingly digitalised labour market. In this way, thinking of PES as a conductor is not the end of PES as we know but rather the beginning of a process of reinventing PES as a prime public service. nrpages: 28 status: publishe...|$|R
