40|$|Radiation is energy {{moving in}} the form of {{particles}} or waves. Familiar radiations are heat, light, radio waves, and microwaves. Another form of radiation is called ionizing radiation. It is a very high-energy form of electromagnetic radiation that has the ability to ionize anything it comes into contact with, making it a potential health concern. 1 Where does radiation come from? Some of the elements on the periodic table emit radiation due to the instability of their nucleus. Radioactive elements relevant to the current situation in Japan include Iodine- 131, Cesium- 137, Strontium- 90 and Plutonium. 2 Note that many naturally-occurring elements with which we are familiar, such as Potassium in bananas, contribute to the background radiation to which we <b>are</b> commonly exposed. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is any radiation capable of displacing electrons from atoms, thereby producing ions. High doses of ionizing radiation may produce severe skin or tissue damage. There are several types of ionizing radiation: alpha particle, beta particle, gamma ray, neutron, x-ray. 1 The three relevant to the incident in Japan are alpha, beta and gamma radiation...|$|R

The objective of this research is to identify whether <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> <b>is</b> better than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English. This experimental research was carried out to University students of English Department. The population was the second semester students. Two classes taken in this research were the experimental class and the control class. The independent variables are the use of teaching media and the attributive factor is students’ self-confidence while the dependent variable is pronunciation skill. Results: (1) <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> <b>is</b> more effective than Rosetta Stone to assist teaching pronunciation of English; (2) students having high self-confidence have better pronunciation skill than students having low self-confidence; and (3) there is an interaction between the media used and students’ self-confidence in teaching pronunciation. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> <b>is</b> more effective than Rosetta Stone in teaching pronunciation for students having high and low self-confidence.

They spend {{a significant amount of}} time sifting through documents and finding new information such as facts, opinions or stakeholders (i. e. people, places and organizations that have a stake in the news). Spotting them is a tedious and cognitively intense process. One task, essential to this process, is to find and keep track of stakeholders. This task is taxing cognitively and in terms of memory. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> offers an automatic aid to this task. <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> <b>is</b> a system that, given a seed story, mines the web for similar stories reported by different sources and selects only those stories which offer new information with respect to that original seed story.
