50|$|Deleterious alleles segregating in {{populations of}} diploid organisms have a {{remarkable}} trend to be, at least, partially recessive. This means that, when they occur in homozygosis (double copies), they reduce fitness {{by more than}} twice than when they occur in <b>heterozygosis</b> (single copy). In other words, part of their potential deleterious effect is hidden in <b>heterozygosis</b> but expressed in homozygosis, so that selection is more efficient against them when they occur in homozygosis. Since inbreeding increases the probability of being homozygous, it increases the fraction of the potential deleterious effect that is expressed and, therefore, exposed to selection. This causes some increase in the selective pressure against (partially) recessive deleterious alleles, which is known as purging. Of course, it also causes some reduction in fitness, which is known as inbreeding depression.|$|E

For example, an inherited mutation of a highly conserved residue in the CNBD of the HCN4 protein (S672R) is associated with inherited sinus bradycardia. In vitro studies indicate that the S672R mutation causes a hyperpolarizing shift of the HCN4 channel open probability curve of about 5 mV in <b>heterozygosis,</b> an effect similar to the hyperpolarizing shift caused by parasympathetic stimulation and able to explain a reduction of inward current during diastole and the resulting slower spontaneous rate.|$|E

5000|$|As {{an example}} of genetic purging, {{consider}} a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles.

Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say N=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them.

40|$|Mutations in the ash- 1 and ash- 2 {{genes of}} Drosophila melanogaster cause {{a wide variety}} of {{homeotic}} transformations that are similar to the transformations caused by mutations in the trithorax gene. Based on this similar variety of transformations, it was hypothesized that these genes are members of a functionally related set. Three genetic tests were employed here to evaluate that hypothesis. The first test was to examine interactions of ash- 1, ash- 2 and trithorax mutations with each other. Double and triple heterozygotes of recessive lethal alleles express characteristic homeotic transformations. For example, double heterozygotes of a null allele of ash- 1 and a deletion of trithorax have partial transformations of their first and third legs to second legs and of their halteres to wings. The penetrance of these transformations is reduced by a duplication of the bithorax complex. The second test was to examine interactions with a mutation in the female sterile (1) homeotic gene. The penetrance of the homeotic phenotype in progeny from mutant mothers is increased by <b>heterozygosis</b> for alleles of ash- 1 or ash- 2 as well as for trithorax alleles. The third test was to examine the interaction with a mutation of the Polycomb gene. The extra sex combs phenotype caused by <b>heterozygosis</b> for a deletion of Polycomb is suppressed by <b>heterozygosis</b> for ash- 1, ash- 2 or trithorax alleles.

40|$|AbstractThis review {{discusses}} hemoglobin D-Punjab, {{also known}} as hemoglobin D-Los Angeles, {{one of the most}} common hemoglobin variants worldwide. It is derived from a point mutation in the beta-globin gene (HBB: c. 364 G>C; rs 33946267) prevalent in the Punjab region, Northwestern Indian. Hemoglobin D-Punjab can be inherited in <b>heterozygosis</b> with hemoglobin A causing no clinical or hematological alterations, or in homozygosis, the rarest form of inheritance, a condition that is commonly not related to clinical symptomatology. Moreover, this variant can exist in association with other hemoglobinopathies, such as thalassemias; the most noticeable clinical alterations occur when hemoglobin D-Punjab is associated to hemoglobin S. The clinical manifestations of this association can be similar to homozygosis for hemoglobin S. Although hemoglobin D-Punjab is a common variant globally with clinical importance especially in cases of double <b>heterozygosis,</b> hemoglobin S/D-Punjab is still understudied. In Brazil, for example, hemoglobin D-Punjab is the third most common hemoglobin variant. Thus, this paper summarizes information about the origin, geographic distribution, characterization and occurrence of hemoglobin D-Punjab haplotypes to try to improve our knowledge of this variant. Moreover, a list of the main techniques used in its identification is provided emphasizing the importance of complementary molecular analysis for accurate diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Drosophila paulistorum populations colonizing {{the urban}} area of Porto Alegre, {{southern}} Brazil, were studied {{with the objective}} of characterizing their chromosomal polymorphism in this new environment. Despite being geographically and ecologically marginal {{and the fact that the}} colonization of the urban area seems to be a recent event, the populations showed a large number of inversions on all chromosome arms. Differences regarding inversion frequencies and percentage of <b>heterozygosis</b> were found when we compared the samples with respect to geographical, microenvironmental and temporal aspects. Such differences, however, could be attributed to both selective and stochastic factor...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the SLC 4 A 1 gene in three Mexican patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS). The promoter and all 20 exons were investigated through heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing. No DNA changes were detected {{in one of}} the three patients. Two well-known polymorphisms, Memphis I and the Diego-a blood group, were detected in another one. In the third, the HS phenotype could be explained by the novel 1885 _ 1888 dupCCGG mutation found in <b>heterozygosis.</b> This frameshift mutation is predicted to result in a truncated and unstable protein lacking normal functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{polymorphism}} of 11 microsatellites from Zebu cattle (Bos indicus) {{were studied}} using a commercial multiplex system, to estimate genetic variability. Allele frequencies, polymorphism information content and <b>heterozygosis</b> were calculated. Allele frequencies revealed {{that in the}} sample analyzed the markers were not equally polymorphic.   The average allele was 14. 2 with the highest values for the TGLA 122 microsatellites. The mean heterozygocity was 0. 7056 and the polymorphism information content was 0. 668. This multiplex analysis {{could be used for}} pedigree information and for adequate genetic improvements in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the LRRK 2 gene are {{the most}} common known cause of {{familial}} and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Few studies performed to date to assess frequency of these mutations are actually only representative of specific areas. Here we study the frequency and clinical phenotype of LRRK 2 G 2019 S, I 2020 T and R 1441 C/G/H mutations in 356 Sardinian patients with idiopathic PD and 208 controls. Seventeen additional subjects, relatives of PD mutated probands, were enrolled. Eight patients were mutated in <b>heterozygosis</b> for LRRK 2 gene (2. 3...|$|E
40|$|More than 20 DNA {{mutations}} {{with different}} inheritance pattern {{have been described}} in patients with Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS), leading to abnormal or absent synthesis and/or expression of GPIbalpha. Clinical phenotype shows considerable variation between individuals, such as bleeding, platelet count {{and the percentage of}} large platelets. We describe in a BSS patient the first case of homozygous four bases deletion (TGAG) in the gpIbalpha gene coding sequence, leading to a premature stop codon. In the propositus, blood smears revealed giant platelets (30 x 10 (9) platelets/L), and platelet agglutination to ristocetin was absent. Propositus' parents are consanguineous. His father and paternal grandmother showed a mild thrombocytopenia (108 x 10 (9) /L and 120 x 10 (9) /L platelets respectively) while mothers and sister's referred normal platelet counts. The surface expression of GPIbalpha was practically undetectable by flow-cytometry and western blot in the patient and was reduced in the father. Proband's DNA analysis revealed a homozygous four-base-pair deletion (TGAG), starting from the last base of the codon for Ser 39, leading to a coding frame shift with a new termination codon after 11 novel amino acids. The same mutation was seen in <b>heterozygosis</b> in both parents. This is the first report of GPIbalpha TGAG deletion in homozygous state even if the defect has already been described in a case of compound <b>heterozygosis.</b> Surprisingly, the propositus does not report any spontaneous bleeding tendency...|$|E
