40|$|Metallic strip {{gratings}} (MSG) {{have different}} applications, ranging from printed circuits to filters in microwave domains. When {{they are under}} the influence of an electromagnetic field, evanescent and/or abnormal modes appear in the region between the traces, their utilization leading to the development of new electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation methods. This paper studies the behavior of MSGs in the sub-subwavelength regime when they are excited with TEz or TMz polarized plane waves and the slits are filled with different dielectrics. The appearance of propagating, evanescent and abnormal modes is emphasized using an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensor</b> with metamaterials lens realized with two conical Swiss rolls, which allows the extraction of the information carried by the guided evanescent waves. The evanescent waves, manipulated by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensor</b> with metamaterial lenses, improve the electromagnetic images so that a better spatial resolution is obtained, exceeding the limit imposed by diffraction.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an inverse method {{for determining the}} conductivity distribution of a flat, layered conductor using a multi-frequency <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sensor</b> based on phase signature alone. Eddy current sensors are used {{in a wide range}} of non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. Single frequency sensors are very common, however, the potential of an eddy current sensor with spectroscopic techniques offer the ability to extract depth profiles and examine more fully the internal structure of the test piece. In this paper, we found a simplified model that can estimate the phase signature of a cylindrical coil above a conductor with an arbitrary conductivity profile. This simplified model improves the computational efficiency by many fold compared to the complete analytic solution. For inverse solution, a simplex search method was used to fit a set of multi-frequency phase values in a least-squared sense. Experimental eddy-current tests are performed by taking the difference in inductance of the coil when placed in free space and next to a layered conductor over the range 100 Hz- 1 MHz. Good estimates for the conductivity profile from experimental and simulated data were obtained.
