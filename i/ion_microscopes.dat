In 1951 its progeny; the Field <b>Ion</b> <b>Microscope,</b> was introduced and in 1956 it became the first microscope to image isolated atoms on a metal surface. In 1967 the Atom-Probe Field <b>Ion</b> <b>Microscope</b> was introduced and extended the capability of the microscope by determining the chemical identity of the imaged atoms. In 1973 the paradigm shifted away from the Field <b>Ion</b> <b>Microscope</b> with the introduction of the 10 cm Atom Probe.

Today, the Atom-Probe is a commercial tool in the arsenal of instruments used to develop new materials for technology and industry.|$|R

40|$|Both {{scanning}} electron microscopes (SEM) and helium <b>ion</b> <b>microscopes</b> (HeIM) {{are based}} on the same principle of a charged particle beam scanning across the surface and generating secondary electrons (SEs) to form images. However, there is a pronounced difference in the energy spectra of the emitted secondary electrons emitted as result of electron or helium ion impact. We have previously presented evidence that this also translates to differences in the information depth through the analysis of dopant contrast in doped silicon structures in both SEM and HeIM. Here, it is now shown how secondary electron emission spectra (SES) and their relation to depth of origin of SE can be experimentally exploited through the use of energy filtering (EF) in low voltage SEM (LV-SEM) to access bulk information from surfaces covered by damage or contamination layers. From the current understanding of the SES in HeIM it is not expected that EF will be as effective in HeIM but an alternative {{that can be used for}} some materials to access bulk information is presented...|$|E
40|$|Helium <b>ion</b> <b>microscopes</b> (HIM) {{have turned}} into a {{frequently}} used imaging device in several laboratories around the world.

While the image generation in a HIM is based on evaluating the amount of secondary electrons the information carried by the back-scattered He/Ne projectiles (BSP) is not taken into consideration at the moment. Thus the HIM offers excellent topographic imaging capabilities but chemical information (in terms of elemental composition) of the surface is not accessible. Nevertheless back-scattered particles carry that information and may be used to provide additional contrast mechanism(s). First attempts to measure BSP energy spectra were done by Sijbrandij et al. and gave evidence for the general feasibility but also revealed that a quantitative chemical analysis of thin layers would require development of more sophisticated detection concepts than those used in their experiments (silicon surface barrier detector) ...|$|E

This cooling not only limited the ion’s movement, but also sharpened its spectral features by re-ducing Doppler broadening, enhancing the scattering of laser light tuned to one of its transitions.

It was shown that the length of what was removed during discharge part of specimens in most of the cases was several orders greater than that of an initial radius of the specimen apex. Experimental results obtained in this work indicate that electrical breakdown in field <b>ion</b> <b>microscopes</b> is initiated by the impact of nanoparticles detached from a point anode in a high eleetric field. A new approach for explanation of an observed specimen failure in a high eleetric field was proposed, where the formation and expansion of the cathode plasma play the key roje in the mechanical rupture and melting of field ion tips. The expanding plasma behaves as a dynamic capacitor plate characterized bya high velocity and increasing field strength at the specimen tip. The field rise rate at a constant voltage in a dynamic plasma to tip capacitor is of the order of gt; 1020 V m s.
