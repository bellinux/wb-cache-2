5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> able to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's right wing. The material recovered from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area. <b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> unable to recover material from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing.|$|E
5|$|Police {{appealed for}} {{information}} about her disappearance, and issued a photofit of the lorry driver, {{but he was not}} identified. By 25 December, <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> working on the theory that he had abducted her. The following day, <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> working on the assumption she had been murdered. Figard's father travelled to the UK to help detectives in their search for her and to appeal to the public for information as to her whereabouts.|$|E

5|$|Nick Hardwick, {{chair of}} the IPCC, said on 9 April {{that there were no}} CCTV cameras in the area. On 14 April the Evening Standard wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault.

5|$|All NIU Huskie {{sporting}} events, {{home and}} away, through Sunday were canceled. Most students left campus for the weekend. A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire. <b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of {{what was left of the}} concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> {{able to locate}} individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|These <b>investigators</b> <b>were</b> {{overseen by}} two {{commanding}} officers {{more concerned with}} politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) and Major William Rawls (John Doman). Assistant state's attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had {{a sexual relationship with}} McNulty. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.|$|E
5|$|<b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> {{unable to}} enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as “fat lighter,” because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' {{landlord}} {{who lived}} in the same building, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. <b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect. He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.|$|E

The imam was the American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, then considered a moderate. Awlaki has since been accused of aiding the 9/11 plot and since 2006–2007 has been identified as radicalized. <b>Investigators</b> <b>were</b> trying to determine if al-Awlaki's teachings influenced Hasan.
