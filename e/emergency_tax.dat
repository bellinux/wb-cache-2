Its {{continued}} existence was assured, however, {{by the terms of}} the cession of the kingdom to Savoy by Spain. In August 1720, Saint-Rémy, the viceroy of the new king, Victor Amadeus II, called a meeting of the Stamenti to swear fealty to Victor Amadeus and approve taxes. Early in 1721 it was called upon again to approve <b>emergency</b> <b>taxes</b> to deal with an epidemic of bubonic plague. This was the last time the Stamenti met. Thereafter only its commission of deputies was asked to re-authorise the previously approved taxes, which it duly did every three years.

5000|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{described}} {{in the writings of}} Somadeva and were applied under extraordinary circumstances when even Brahmins and temples were not excluded. These were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, facing natural calamities, or preparing for war or overcoming its ravages. Fines were charged on socially or politically alienated villages, the term used being Sadandadas aparadhah or Pratishisiddhaya. Since these taxes were uncommon, income to state from these sources was small overall. Income on government property included taxes on stray plots of cultivable land, forests, forest produce, waste lands, lands awaiting cultivation and specific trees such as sandal, Hirda, mango and Madhuka, even when these were found growing on private property. The kingdom did not lay claim to the entire land inside its territory. A record of the feudatory Vaidumba king from southern Deccan says the king had to purchase three veils of land from a local assembly in order to assign it to a temple in a village. [...] Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory, although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The term used for these taxes was Sahadhyantara Siddhi. Treasures, even when discovered on private land, were included as taxable earnings as were the incomes and properties of persons who died without heirs. If there were no survivors in the family, the state claimed all the properties.|$|R

5000|$|The half-tax policy {{began as}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>tax</b> {{designated}} for military rations (hyororyosho) collected during wartime: half the income from particular temple, shrine and estate lands in the provinces of Mino, Ōmi and Owari would be taken to support armies of the Muromachi regime. Increasingly, this was reinterpreted and changed by Takauji as the permanent acquisition of half the land {{for the purpose of}} enfeoffing vassals. [...] This was a radical departure from previous practice. As was indicated above, during the Kamakura period, most of the lands, particularly in the central and western provinces of Honshū, were owned by the nobles, but managed as stewardships (jito shiki) by Kamakura house vassals, uniting both the interests of the nobles and the interests of the warriors together in the estate institution. With the advent of the half tax measure, Takauji was removing one half of the estate lands from noble control and giving it in fief to his warriors.|$|E
40|$|Despite a {{great variety}} of {{transport}} policies the 'public services' concept is the dominant organizational solution for the transport sector in the European countries. Public activity includes among others the provision of: infrastructure (roads, bridges, airports, tunnels, harbours [...] .), traffic information, public transport (person and goods traffic), traffic police and <b>emergency,</b> <b>taxes,</b> fees and road pricing systems. As such the tasks partly belong to the 'productive' (not jurisdictional or administrational) functions of the public authorities. For them a trend to organizational changes can be observed throughout Europe resulting in deregulation, shift of competencies from state to regional or local authorities and privatization of former public services. These tendencies can be observed on different levels, for all transport modes and in countries with different organizational backgrounds (e. g. Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, France, Germany). Driving forces are increasing financial pressures to public authorities in the provision of transport services, a growing demand of co-operation between local, regional, national authorities and a political change to deregulation and market solutions. Examples are the deregulation of state owned railway operators with concepts for regionalization, privatization and transnational harmonization, as well as the approaches within the field of air traffic control and management or the privatization of transport infrastructure (e. g. the Channel-Tunnel between France and Great Britain, Transrapid in Germany). Thus the transport sector experiences a complete re-definition of the responsibilities, i. e. the borderlines between: public authorities on different territorial levels and public and private tasks.

A second job or a job with a pension is taxed at a basic rate of 20%, or the tax allowance can be split across both sources of income.Non-standard codes are used when usual tax free allowances do not apply. Where no allowances exist, code BR is used to tax at basic rate (20%), and code D0 is used to tax at higher rate (40%). If no tax is to be collected, code NT is used. If tax has to be collected on an income above PAYE earnings, a K code is used. This works as equivalent to a negative tax allowance.|$|E

By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther's predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (Ermächtigungsgesetz) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The restrictive monetary policy by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three <b>emergency</b> <b>tax</b> hikes, brought forward due dates for taxes, increased prepayments of assesed taxes, raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial burden sharing between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs - by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{every person}} paid under the PAYE scheme is {{allocated}} a tax code by HM Revenue and Customs. This is {{usually in the}} form of a number followed by a letter suffix, though other 'non-standard' codes are also used. This code describes to employers how much tax to deduct from an employee. The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.Tax codes are passed between periods of employment by a P45, which is generated when a person leaves a job. If a P45 is mislaid or not supplied at the end of a period of employment, a P46 can be filled out in order to determine which tax code is applicable to a person. Between submitting a P46 and receiving the correct tax code from HM Revenue and Customs, an employer can apply the <b>emergency</b> <b>tax</b> code on a week 1 basis. In this case, tax will be calculated as if the employee is working in the first week of the tax year, and all previous earnings are ignored.At the end of each tax year employers are required to send out a P60 which documents the total earnings and tax a person has paid within that tax year.|$|E
