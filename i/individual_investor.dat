[...] Since everyone holds the risky assets in identical proportions to each other—namely in the proportions given by the tangency portfolio—in market equilibrium the risky assets' prices, and therefore their expected returns, will adjust so that the ratios in the tangency portfolio {{are the same as}} the ratios in which the risky assets are supplied to the market.

Furthermore, the associations are moderated by the investment experience of <b>individual</b> <b>investors,</b> suggesting that more-experienced <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> are better able to incorporate governance strength into their judgment than less-experienced <b>individual</b> <b>investors.</b> Additionally, investment experience is positively related to the emphasis that <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> give to corporate governance information in making investment decisions...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines investors’ {{performance and}} trading {{behavior on the}} Norwegian stock market, using a unique and extensive data set of monthly holdings of all the investors. The first paper studies how Norwegian <b>individual</b> <b>investors,</b> financial institutional investors and foreign investors affect stock return volatility and finds surprising and interesting results: domestic <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> and financial institutional investors dampen stock return volatility, and foreign investors exacerbate stock return volatility. While the result that <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> reduce stock return volatility {{is similar to the}} implication of the findings in Sias (1996) and Malkiel and Xu (2003), it is inconsistent with the traditional assumption that <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> are noise traders who make stocks more volatile. It is also striking that domestic financial institutional investors and foreign investors have opposite impact on stock return volatility, although we usually assume that institutional investors, regardless of geographical locations, have similar impact on the stock market. The explanations are that foreign investors are momentum traders, trade the most and have the shortest investment horizon; <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> are contrarian traders, trade the least and have the longest investment horizon; and financial investors fall somewhere in-between. The second paper examines whether some <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> can successfully time the stock market, {{in the sense that they}} invest more in the stock market conditional on the forecast that the stock market will perform well in the subsequent period and reduce their equity portfolio holding when the stock market underperforms the bond market. The results show that some <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> can successfully time the market at 1 to 6 month horizons with the strongest results at the quarterly horizon. We show that <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> with positive and significant timing ability have higher performance than that of investors with no or negative timing ability, which indicates that our results that some <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> can time the stock market are not spurious. The third paper examines whether some <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> can outperform the market and can do so persistently, using unique data on month-end stock market portfolios of all <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> over an eleven-year period. By using different measures of portfolio performance and various analysis methodologies, this paper finds that a sizable of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> exhibit economically and statistically significant performance persistence.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{financial}} performance of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> {{in the stock}} market. We consider three different perspectives of financial performance of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> to offer significant evidence associated to the issue. We build a model to study {{whether or not the}} trading of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> before an event is predicting the short-term abnormal returns of the stock after the event. This study is providing further evidence to the growing academic literature about individual investors’ performance. The analyses are performed on data set provided by Finnish Central Securities Depository (FCSD) for four years from 2006 to the end of 2009. Performing statistical analysis, the individual net trading and cumulative individual net trading are calculated. Two different data sets are created to analyze the abnormal returns of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> around scheduled new and to analyze the same connection around non-scheduled news. The results suggest that cumulative net individual trading prior to an event does predict the cumulative abnormal returns after the event but the link is quite weak and varies when different time-horizons are used or only active <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> are considered. The results show a positive correlation between <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> buying stocks prior to earnings announcement and the positive abnormal returns of the stock {{on the day of the}} event and on the following day. This correlation turns to be negative when we consider longer time periods for abnormal returns. With non-scheduled news, we did not find such correlation when considering all <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> but correlation was found when we considered only the most active <b>individual</b> <b>investors.</b> When we did not control for any kind of events, we found that <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> seem to be investing in an informed way...|$|R

Emotions and {{preferences}} of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> affect {{not only their}} trading strategies, but also the aggregate stock prices. This research tries to find the preferences of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> in choosing investing targets, and examines if Taiwan Stock Index Futures which <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> prefer to trade could be the indicator which forecasts the trend of Taiwan Stock Index. Finally, this research examines how successive trading behavior of foreign investors affects trading strategies of <b>individual</b> <b>investors.</b> Empirical results show that: First, <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> usually prefer small stocks and low-price stocks. When the prices of high-price stocks are high enough {{to attract the attention}} of <b>individual</b> <b>investors,</b> <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> turn to prefer high-price stocks. Second, there is a weak relationship between the price of Taiwan Stock Index Futures used to be regarded as a leading indicator and real rate of return of Taiwan Stock Index in the future. It is possible that the change of price of Taiwan Stock Index Futures just reflects the rate of return of Taiwan Stock Index and the emotions of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> on that day. Third, the termination of successive trading behavior of foreign investors is regarded as a signal of trend-reversing by <b>individual</b> <b>investors.</b> This will affect the rate of return of stock index.

Within a non-advisory context, <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> elect to build and manage their investment portfolios to avoid the cost of hiring professional advisors. To cope with markets’ uncertainty, <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> should acquire, understand, and use only relevant information, but that task can be affected by many factors, such as domain knowledge, cognitive and emotional biases, information overload, sources’ credibility, communication channels’ accuracy, and economic costs. Despite an increased interest in examining the financial performance of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> in Saudi Arabia, there has been no empirical research of the information behavior of <b>individual</b> <b>investors,</b> or the behavioral biases affecting the investment decision making process in the Saudi stock market (SSM). The purpose of this study was to examine this information behavior within a non-advisory contextualization of their investment decision-making process through the use of an online questionnaire instrument using close-ended questions. The significant intervening variables identified in this study influence the individual investors’ information behavior across many stages of the decision making process. While controlling for gender, education, and income, the optimal information behavior of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> in the SSM showed that the Experience factor had the greatest negative effect on the Information Seeking Behavior of <b>individual</b> <b>investors.</b> This was followed by Risk Tolerance, Financial Self-Efficacy, Emotional Biases, Education Level, Formal Information Access, Regret Aversion Bias, and Subjective Financial Knowledge. The Information Acquisition and Information Searching Behavior was influenced by the Acquisition Skepticism, Regret Aversion Bias, Formal Information Access, Overconfidence, and Information Seeking Behavior. Furthermore, the findings indicate that Formal Information Sources have a statistically significant positive effect on the Information Seeking Behavior, and on the Information Acquisition and Information Searching of <b>individual</b> <b>investors</b> in Saudi Arabia.
