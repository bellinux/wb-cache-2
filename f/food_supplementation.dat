50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>supplementation</b> {{and access}} to food {{does not affect the}} number or the sizes of worker offspring. This could suggest that there is not the {{adaptive}} advantage to make larger workers. Stabilizing selection is present to make a fixed number of workers regardless of nest size or food availability. The selection shifts toward the production of more sexual females than larger males. The colonies that are supplemented with food also produced more reproductive females than larger reproductive females which suggests that female sexual production in resource limited conditions is very expensive. Males however, are slightly larger on average which could mean that the number of males produced is not as critical as male size. It has been proposed that larger males helps the colony by attacking foreign males, and defending nest territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{metalloid}} Se is {{ubiquitous in}} soils, but exists mainly in insoluble forms in high-Fe, low-pH and certain leached soils, and hence is often of limited availability to plants. Consequently, {{it is often}} supplied by plants to animals and human consumers at levels too low for optimum health. Se deficiency and suboptimality are manifested in populations as increased rates of thyroid dysfunction, cancer, severe viral diseases, cardiovascular disease and various inflammatory conditions. Se deficiency probably affects at least a billion individuals. Optimal cancer protection appears to require a supra-nutritional Se intake, and involves several mechanisms, which include promotion of apoptosis and inhibition of neo-angiogenesis. Evidence suggests that in some regions Se is declining in the food chain, and new strategies to increase its intake are required. These could include education to increase consumption of higher-Se <b>foods,</b> individual <b>supplementation,</b> <b>food</b> fortification, <b>supplementation</b> of livestock, Se fertilisation of crops and plant breeding for enhanced Se accumulation. Se levels in Australian residents and wheat appear to be above the global estimated mean. Wheat is estimated to supply nearly half the Se utilised by most Australians. Increasing the Se content of wheat represents a food systems approach that would increase population intake, with consequent probable improvement in public health and large health cost savings. The strategies that show most promise to achieve this are biofortification by Se fertilisation and breeding wheat varieties that are more efficient at increasing grain Se density. Research is needed in Australia to determine the most cost-effective fertilisation methods, and {{to determine the extent}} of genetic variability for grain Se accumulation. Before recommending large-scale fortification of the food supply with Se, it will be necessary to await the results of current intervention studies with Se on cancer, HIV and AIDS, and asthma.

The aims of this thesis are to explore women’s perceptions of maternal undernutrition, to analyse the association between prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and birth weight (BW), to analyse whether food- and multiple micronutrient interventions generate pro-disadvantaged equity in child survival, and to examine whether an early prenatal invitation to <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) represents value for money in infant survival compared to invitation to <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> at usual time combined with 60 mg iron and 400 µg folic acid (standard practice). The study on women’s perceptions (n= 236) was nested into the MINIMat randomized trial where women (n= 4436) were allocated to early (E), or usual (U) time of invitation to prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and 30 mg iron with 400 µg folic acid, or 60 mg iron with 400 µg folic acid, or MMS. Live births (n= 3625) were followed-up. The analyses of equity and cost-effectiveness were based on this trial. A cohort design (n= 619) was employed for the analysis of food supplements and BW. Women perceived maternal undernutrition as a serious health problem and attached very low scores to CED in pregnancy. An average of four months of prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> increased BW by 118 g. An early invitation to prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and MMS lowered mortality in children before the age of five years and reduced social disparity in child survival chances.

Subjects/Methods: We performed a 13 week open, randomized, double blind clinical trial on 149 free living persons with mild hyperhomocyteinemia, with daily 200 μg from a natural folate-rich diet, 200 μg [6 S] 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate (5 -MTHF), 200 μg folic acid or placebo. Participants were stratified according to their MTHFR genotype. Results: Homocysteine (Hcy) levels were reduced after folate enriched diet, 5 -MTHF or folic acid supplementation respectively by 20. 1 % (p < 0. 002), 19. 4 % (p < 0. 001) and 21. 9 % (p < 0. 001), as compared to baseline levels and significantly as compared to placebo (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 002 and p < 0. 001, respectively for enriched diet, 5 -MTHF and folic acid). After this enriched diet and the folic acid supplementation, Hcy in both genotype groups decreased approximately to the same level, with higher percentage decreases observed for the TT group because of their higher pre-treatment value.

Young animals thus have to balance their investment in growth versus ROS defence, and this balance is likely mediated by resource availability. Consequently resources transferred prenatally by the mother and nutritional conditions experienced shortly after birth may crucially determine the oxidative status of young animals. Here, we experimentally investigated the relative importance of pre- and early postnatal nutritional conditions on the oxidative status of great tit nestlings (Parus major). We show that resources transferred by the mother through the egg and nutritional conditions encountered after hatching affect the oxidative status of nestling in a sex-specific way. Daughters of non-supplemented mothers and daughters which did not receive extra food during the early postnatal period had higher oxidative damage than sons, while no differences between sons and daughters were found when extra food was provided pre- or postnatally. No effect of the <b>food</b> <b>supplementations</b> on growth, fledging mass or tarsus length was observed, indicating that female nestlings maintained their investment in growth at the expense of ROS defence mechanisms when resources were limited.

Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent diarrhea or infections; alcoholics), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the elderly, the infirm, those with eating disorders or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) anemia patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from osteoporosis.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} can be omnivores, carnivores, or herbivores. Omnivorous reptiles can be fed species-dependent mixes {{of plant}} or meat-based <b>foods,</b> with additional <b>supplementation,</b> most commonly calcium. Carnivorous reptiles may need living or dried insects or whole rodents. Frozen rodents {{can be bought}} from pet shops and are then thawed before feeding, and live rodents can be kept and sustained before feeding. Some species of reptiles will also feed on smaller reptiles.|$|R
40|$|Climate-change has the {{potential}} to affect migratory birds by altering prey availability across their annual cycle. Observational and experimental approaches were used to understand the causes and consequences of these changes on the breeding productivity, mass regulation and survival of a wetland bird; the Eurasian reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. Climatic influences on wetland invertebrate populations were assessed by monitoring natural and experimentally-induced variations in temperature. Further increases in early spring temperatures are likely to result in earlier availability of prey resources. The responses of breeding birds to changes in their prey were tested with <b>food</b> <b>supplementations,</b> which advanced egg-laying dates, reduced the laying interval and incubation duration, and increased nestling growth rate. These effects enable earlier first fledglings and increase the opportunity for second breeding attempts within the peak invertebrate prey window. The consequences of prey availability on wintering body condition were tested by comparing resources and energy reserves in contrasting habitats in West Africa during the non-breeding period. Birds occupying prey-rich habitats maintained lower body reserves than conspecifics occupying prey-poor dry-scrub habitats, consistent with strategic buffering of reserves against starvation in food-poor habitat. These results suggest how reed warblers are able to survive in lower quality habitats and potentially avoid density-dependent mortality associated with drought as observed in other wetland migrants. Analysis of long term (> 30 year) weather effects on survival revealed measurable but minor impacts, suggesting reed warblers are very adaptive to environmental change. Overall, this study provides strong support for climate-driven advance in spring invertebrate availability and identifies the reed warbler breeding and survival parameters most affected by increases to prey availability. This study provides an integrated and original understanding of the mechanisms which may underlie current levels of population growth in what appears {{to be one of the}} few long-distance migratory European songbird species currently benefiting from climate-change...|$|R
40|$|Background: National {{nutrition}} {{programs in}} Bangladesh have in-cluded prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> to reduce maternal and child malnutrition. The knowledge base is weak regarding {{the effect of}} prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> on the birth weight (BW) of infants in populations in whom low BW is prevalent and regarding any vari-ation in effect based on maternal nutritional status. Objective: We examined whether observational data support an effect of daily prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> on BW by considering the duration of supplementation and whether the effect is modified by maternal postpartum weight (a proxy of prepregnancy weight) groups. Design: A cohort of undernourished pregnant women (n 777) who received prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> (608 kcal/d) was followed. The association between the uptake of food supplements and BW was analyzed after adjustment for potential confounders (n 619 with complete information). Differential effects in lower and higher maternal postpartum weight groups were examined. Results: The average BW was 2521 g. On average, the women received daily supplements for 4 mo, which resulted {{in an increase in}} BW of 118 g (1. 0 g/d). The strongest effect was found for births occurring in January and February. There was a linear dose-response relation between duration of supplementation and BW for women with higher postpartum weights (42 kg, above the median). In women with lower weights (42 kg, below median), a shorter du-ration of supplementation (4 mo) had no such dose-response re-lation with BW, but there was a linear dose-response relation for longer durations of supplementation. Conclusions: The association between duration of prenatal <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and BW varies with maternal postpartum weight. A large effect was observed after the season with food insecurity (mid...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to evaluated the effect formula <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> as complementary feeding (MP-ASI) on growth and development of infants 6 to 9 month of ages.   This study setting was in Tanah Datar District West Sumatera Province Indonesia and the participants amount were 355 infants aged 6 to 9 months at beginning of the study. This community trial using Cluster Randomized Control Trial (CRCT) was conducted to 40 clusters  from 5 selected villages were assessed for baseline data. The children were divided into 4 groups: <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> group (FS-group), psychosocial stimulation (PS-group), Food and psychosocial stimulation group (FP+PS-group) and control group (C-group). The intervention group received formula <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> (MP-ASI)   with local product about 250 to 300 kcal and  6 to 8 gram protein daily for 6 month. The results shows that 271 children completed the study. After 6 month of intervention, for F-Group mean of length is improved 6. 61 cm + 2. 11 SD and for FP-Group improved 6. 27 cm + 2. 24 SD. The FP-Group benefitted  in difference Z-score weight for height of nutritional status at baseline and after 6 month of intervention are FP-groups (0. 57 + 1. 15 SD) compare the F-groups  (- 0. 16 + 1. 12   SD). There was significant effect of <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> and  psychosocial stimulation  on children’s cognitive development,  improving  21. 37 + 12. 43 SD point and on motoric development improving  20. 65 + 18. 38 SD point (P< 0. 001). It can be concluded that the formula <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> (MP-ASI) combination with psychosocial stimulation had strong effect to the improvement of  infants’s growth and development...|$|E
40|$|Anaemia {{in school}} aged girls is an {{important}} but neglected issue. Since iron supplementation programmes have had little reported success in reducing anaemia, interest is turning to food based approaches that have higher potential for achieving far reaching benefits. The {{purpose of the study}} was to observe sustainability of the effect of iron and <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> on haemoglobin (Hb), intelligence quotient (IQ) and growth of the subjects. At baseline, estimation of haemoglobin (Hb), red cell indices, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, serum transferrin saturation and serum ferritin was done. IQ, weight and height were measured using standard procedures. Anaemic subjectswere divided into three groups, viz., (i) twice weekly supplementation of iron folic acid syrup (53 mg iron/week); (ii) daily supplementation of 4 niger seed and defatted soyaflour biscuits plus 2 lemons (45 mg iron/week) and (iii) control. Non anaemic group(NAC) was not intervened. Endline data was collected after 120 days. Follow up for Hb, IQ, weight and height was done 4 months after cessation of supplementation. The prevalence of anaemia was 77 % in the study population; 46 % subjects had mild anaemia and 32 % had moderate anaemia. Iron status was lower in anaemic subjects (p< 0. 001). Iron supplementation was more effective in raising Hb and building iron stores than iron rich <b>food</b> <b>supplementation.</b> Iron supplementation improved IQ but did not bring about catch up of anaemics to non anaemics. Iron rich <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> was better than medicinal iron in promoting growth in anaemic girls. The impact of iron rich <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> on Hb, IQ and growth sustained for 4 months while that of medicinal iron did not. Effects of <b>food</b> <b>supplementation</b> are sustainable for 4 months, therefore, this strategy holds more potential to control anaemia, in school aged girls. </p...|$|E
40|$|Arctic {{populations are}} at an {{increased}} risk of vitamin D inadequacy due to geographic latitude and a nutrition transition. This study aimed to assess the adequacy of dietary vitamin D and calcium among women of child-bearing age in Arctic Canada. This study collected data from 203 randomly selected women of child-bearing age (19 - 44 years) in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories of Arctic Canada. Cross-sectional surveys using a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire were analysed to determine the dietary adequacy of vitamin D and calcium and summarize the top foods contributing to vitamin D and calcium intake among traditional food eaters (TFE) and non-traditional food eaters (NTFE). The response rate was between 69 - 93 % depending on the community sampled. Mean BMIs for both TFE and NTFE were above the normal range. Traditional food eaters had a significantly higher median vitamin D intake compared with non-traditional eaters (TFE= 5. 13 ± 5. 34 µg/day; NTFE= 3. 5 ± 3. 22 µg/day, p= 0 · 004). The majority of women (87 %) were below the Estimated Average Requirements (EAR) for vitamin D. Despite adequate median daily calcium intake in both TFE (1, 299 ± 798 mg/day) and NTFE (992 ± 704 mg/day; p= 0. 0005), 27 % of the study population fell below the EAR for calcium. Dairy products contributed the most to intake of vitamin D (TFE= 30. 7 %; NTFE= 39. 1 %) and calcium (TFE= 25. 5 %; NTFE= 34. 5 %). Inadequate dietary vitamin D intake is evident among Inuit and Inuvialuit women of child-bearing age in Arctic Canada. Promotion of nutrient-rich sources of traditional <b>foods,</b> <b>supplementation</b> protocols and/or expanded food fortification should be considered to address this nutrition concern...|$|R
