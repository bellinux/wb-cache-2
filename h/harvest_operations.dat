This research was conducted to measure the time and productivity of forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> and also to analyze the cost and revenue of mangrove forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> at Matang mangrove forest. This project had been carried out in cooperation with Seri Sepetang Enterprise, one of the harvesting licenses in Kuala Sepetang, Perak. Data collections were taken in every station starting from standing tree until to the Kiln-Drying jetty. The data then calculated by using the formulas of productivity and cost analysis. As the result, the productivity for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are 1. 84 tan/hour, 3. 82 tan/hour and 4. 64 tan/hour respectively. The cost for each operation of 9 tan log volume for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are RM 56. 88, RM 10. 80 and RM 36. 72 respectively. As the revenue, the company paid RM 260 per 9 tan of log for the in-forest operation (felling, manual skidding and loading to the ship) and pay RM 80 per 9 tan for the water transportation, and they gained the net profit of RM 192. 32 and RM 43. 28 respectively. The average of forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> is twice operation in a day (equal with 2 x 9 -ton volume of log production a day), so they will gain a double profit. In conclusion, the forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> is sustainably managed for supplying the raw material of charcoal industries in Matang mangrove forest. Since, they work manually and spend much energy in this forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation,</b> so for further study it recommends to conduct the ergonomics evaluation during forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> at Matang Mangrove Forest...|$|R
40|$|<b>Harvesting</b> <b>operations</b> in timber {{concessions}} {{have traditionally}} followed strategies related to enterprises' capacity {{in terms of}} available equipment and financing, industrial integration, commercialization of more species, physical accessibility to the concession, and quality of human resources, among others. Some more traditional forest enterprises interested in maximizing their production have began activities to monitor {{the performance of their}} personnel in each <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation,</b> and identify the environmental impact these cause in the residual forest. This is not a practice that can be generalized to the concessions operating in the Ucayali Region where most small to medium enterprises do not have enough knowledge about the utility of monitoring their operations. In this article we present information gathered in six timber concessions of theUcayali Region to assess the damage caused by their <b>harvesting</b> <b>operations</b> in the vegetation, soil and watercourses, as well as the harvesting residues. The impact in the vegetation resulted to be more intense with manual operations than with mechanized harvesting. The impact in the soil caused by mechanized operations was low in areas affected by gaps but highly variable in conditions such as roads and skid trails. Watercourses in general reflect poor planning of road infrastructure in the concessions. Harvesting residues were found without justification in logging gaps and along roads. It is concluded, among other points, that damage caused by <b>harvesting</b> <b>operations</b> can be minimized with adequate planning of <b>harvesting</b> <b>operations,</b> increased training of personnel for teamwork, and in general by adopting reduced impact harvesting techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine, {{through the use of}} the bearing capacity model, the traffic effects of the forest <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> on the preconsolidation pressure (p), during one cycle of the eucalyptus plantation. The work was conducted using undisturbed soil samples, collected at the surface of the A horizon and {{in the top of the}} B horizon of an Udult (PA), Aquox (FX) and Udox (LA) soils.

The percentage of soil samples, in the region with additional soil compaction, indicated that the Udult was the soil class more susceptible to soil compaction, followed by the Aquox and Udox. Despite Udult is the more susceptible to soil compaction, the regeneration of the soil structure in this soil class was more efficient than in Aquox.

40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of New Zealand <b>Harvest</b> <b>operations</b> where extracted trees are processed into logs and loaded out onto trucks. Forest owners need to balance the cost and environmental considerations when designing and constructing landings, with the productivity and safety of the harvesting crew that will use the landing. The objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of landing size and how they affect forest <b>harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> This study investigates the relationship between landing size and processing delays. A time study was carried out for ten <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> predominantly in the lower North Island. The time study recorded all delays on the processing task of measuring and cutting stems into logs. The delays were then categorised so that only processing delays that are influenced by the size of the landing remained. These processing delays were then expressed per m 3 and used as the response variable in regression analysis to test their correlation against landing size and a range of other predictor variables. A very strong, linear relationship between processing delays per m 3 and actual landing size was found. This indicates that <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> on smaller landings exhibited higher delays per m 3 than those on larger landings. Loading of the deck was the most significant processing delay; this is a direct result of not having enough room for surge piles as delimbing was not able to be carried out during loader downtime. The significance of the relationships developed in this study can help forest owners realise the implications of building landings that are too small for the intended purpose. Not only will small landings affect productivity, but have the potential to financially affect the forest owner also...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{is used to}} restock trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) cutblocks and factors controlling regeneration {{are areas}} of interest and concern to the forest industry. <b>Harvest</b> <b>operations</b> in Manitoba require that coarse woody debris, or slash, be left and distributed in cutblocks. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of slash loading on soil temperatures and aspen regeneration, and implications for <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> in the Duck Mountain area. Early sucker growth, initiation, and soil temperatures were surveyed in six winter and six summer cutblocks under different levels of slash loadings. A growth chamber study, using field temperature data as a guideline, examined the effects of diurnal temperature variation on sucker initiation and production. In winter and summer cutblocks, mean depths to sucker initiation from the parent root were 4. 6 + 2. 4 cm and 3. 4 + 2. 1 cm, respectively, and initiation of suckers occurred mainly from parental roots located in the LFH layer. Daily mean soil temperatures during the growing season were significantly lower under higher levels of slash (difference of 3. 6 oC during May). Higher amounts of slash also significantly shortened the length of the growing season (89 fewer days above 0 oC in one season) and decreased the number of suckers produced (150 000 ha– 1 decreased to 14 000 ha- 1), sucker volume (decreased by 256 cm 3 m- 2) and leaf area index (decreased by 0. 9). There was no difference in sucker production between any diurnal temperature treatments in the growth chamber study. Shallow depth to sucker initiation has important implications for <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> using heavy machinery especially those occurring during the summer season. Moderate levels of slash in summer cutblocks, and heavy levels of slash in winter cutblocks limit sucker growth. Although slash decreases diurnal temperature amplitudes, this may not be the reason for the decrease in sucker production associated with increased levels of slash. Both soil temperature and early sucker growth are strongly affected by slash loading; by monitoring <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> and the distribution of slash within cutblocks, the negative effect of heavy machine traffic and heavy piles of slash can be reduced and ensure successful forest regeneration...|$|E
