40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a graphical method for visually comparing results of different test equating methods. Test equating {{is a process}} to adjust for score differences due to the random selection of similar test items in test forms. In practice, testing organizations compare different test equating methods before deciding on a method for operational purposes. Many psychometricians such as Kolen and Brennan (1995) use graphical displays for to examine standard errors in equating and differences among a variety of equating methods. The graphical displays can show which equating method(s) yield {{the least amount of}} equating errors or which method(s) exhibit the least amount of differences. In the event that a large discrepancy appears among the methods, researchers will need to further explore the potential root causes, which often require a closer examination of individuals test scores. While it is sufficient for traditional graphical tools to identify score points associated with large discrepancies; it is hard to depict individual test takers on traditional graphical displays, because the displays are designed to show aggregated data. To this end, the current paper applies a method ⎯ SEER (Chiu & Fecso 2002 a) ⎯ to (a) visualize the effects of different equating methods on the scores of individual test takers and (b) <b>display</b> <b>test</b> score distributions on the same plot as is used to show individual level data.

40|$|Abstract Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to define the {{analytical}} and diagnostic performance of the Labor Diagnostica Nord (LDN) 2 -Met plasma ELISA assay for fractionated plasma metanephrines in the biochemical diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. Methods: The stated manufacturer's performance characteristics were assessed. Clinical utility was evaluated against liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using bias, sensitivity and specificity outcomes. Samples (n= 73) were collected from patients in whom phaeochromocytoma had been excluded (n= 60) based on low probability of disease, repeat negative testing for urinary fractionated catecholamines and metanephrines, lack of radiological and histological evidence of a tumour and from a group (n= 13) in whom the tumour had been histologically confirmed. Blood collected into k(2) EDTA tubes was processed within 30 min. Separated plasma was aliquoted (x 2) and frozen at - 40 degrees C prior to analyses. One aliquot was analysed for plasma metanephrines using the LDN 2 -Met ELISA and the other by LC-MS/MS. Results: The mean bias of - 32 % for normetanephrine (ELISA) when compared to the reference method (LC-MS/MS) makes under-diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma likely. The sensitivity of the assay (100 %) was equal to the reference method, but specificity (88. 3 %) lower than the reference method (95 %), making it less than optimum for the biochemical diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. Conclusions: Plasma-free metanephrines as measured by Labor Diagnostica Nord (LDN) 2 -Met ELISA do not <b>display</b> <b>test</b> characteristics that would support their introduction or continuation as part of a screening protocol for the biochemical detection of phaeochromocytoma unless the calibration problem identified is corrected and other more accurate and analytically specific methods remain unavailable...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{radiography}} opens {{new ways}} in diagnostic radiography, thus {{for example the}} digital subtraction of two radiographs. For the integration of such technologies into daily medical routine, not only fast computers are needed, but also suitable graphical user interfaces. The aim of the thesis {{is to create a}} solution for digital image radiography-subtraction to reach a large number of medical personnel with variable knowledge and skill and therefore improve diagnostics on a daily basis without installing specialized and complex computer hardware. Created was a web-based interface for digital subtraction radiography (DSR-Web) with corresponding database for image storage and retrieval. The subtraction of two digital radiographs can be processed using a variety of different subtraction algorithms. By choosing the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) it is guaranteed that the DSR-Web is displayed identical on different computer systems and operating systems, thus being independent of hard- and software. HTML is used on many internet pages and provides a standardized platform to <b>display</b> <b>test</b> and graphics. Typical HTML-elements are lists, tables, diagrams, symbols and free text. In addition to presenting pure data and facts great importance was drawn to the presentation of the structural components like graphics and colors, because these contribute crucially to the acceptance and operability of the graphical user interface. For the basic color, the color "green" was chosen, for its general meaning of being reassuring and anti-depressive. For contrast and attention, the color "red" was chosen. The color red is usually described as a signaling color. It communicates the necessity to do something or {{to pay attention to the}} actual step. Finally the graphical user interface was tested according to its usability to show that it was learnable and usable.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a general methodology for classifying and describing many combinatoric problems, systematising and finding theoretical expressions for quantities of interest, and investigating their feasible numerical evaluation. Unifying notation and definitions are provided. Our knowledge of random allocations is also extended. This {{is achieved by}} investigating new processes, generalising known processes, and by providing a formal structure and innovative techniques for analysing them. The random allocation models described in this thesis can be classified as occupancy urn models, {{in which we have}} a sequence of urns and throw balls into them, and investigate static, waiting-time and dynamic processes. Various structures are placed on the relationship(s) between cells, balls, and the selection of items being distributed, including varieties, batch arrivals, taboo sets and blocking sets. Static, waiting-time and dynamic processes are investigated. Both without-replacement and with-replacement sampling types are considered. Emphasis is placed on the distributions of waiting-times for one or more events to occur measured from the time a particular event occurs; this begins as an abstraction and generalisation of a model of departures of cars parked in lanes. One of several additional determinations is the platoon size distribution. Models are analysed using combinatorial analysis and Markov Chains. Global attributes are measured, including maximum waits, maximum room required, moments and the clustering of completions. Various conversion formulae have been devised to reduce calculation times by several orders of magnitude. New and extended applications include Queueing in Lanes, Cake Displays, Coupon Collector's Problem, Sock-Sorting, Matching Dependent Sets (including Genetic Code Attribute Matching and the game SET), the Zig-Zag Problem, Testing for Randomness (including the Cake <b>Display</b> <b>Test,</b> which is a without-replacement test similar to the standard Empty Cell test), Waiting for Luggage at an Airport, Breakdowns in a Network, Learning Theory and Estimating the Number of Skeletons at an Archaeological Dig.

40|$|Objective: An {{electronic}} {{emergency department}} information system (EDIS) can monitor {{the progress of}} a patient visit, facilitate computerized physician order entry, <b>display</b> <b>test</b> results and generate an electronic medical record. Ideally, use of an EDIS will increase overall emergency department (ED) efficiency. However, in academic settings where new interns rotate through the ED monthly, the “learning curve” experienced by the new EDIS user may slow down patient care. In this study, we measured {{the impact of the}} “intern learning curve” on patient length of stay (LOS). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed one year of patient care data, generated by a comprehensive EDIS in a single, urban, university-affiliated ED. Intern rotations began on the 23 rd of each month and ended on the 22 nd of the next month. Interns received a 1. 5 -hour orientation to the EDIS prior to starting their rotation; none had prior experience using the electronic system. Mean LOS (± standard error of the mean) for all patients treated by an intern were calculated for each day of the month. Values for similar numerical days from each month were combined and averaged over the year resulting in 31 discrete mean LOS values. The mean LOS {{on the first day of}} the intern rotation was compared with the mean LOS on the last day, using Student’s t-test. Results: During the study period 9, 780 patients were cared for by interns; of these, 7, 616 (78 %) were discharged from the ED and 2, 164 (22 %) were admitted to the hospital. The mean LOS for all patients on all days was 267 ± 1. 8 minutes. There was no difference between the LOS on the first day of the rotation (263 ± 9 minutes) and the last day of the rotation (276 ± 11 minutes, p > 0. 9). In a multiple linear regression model, the day of the intern rotation was not associated with patient LOS, even after adjusting for the number of patients treated by interns and total ED census (β = - 0. 34, p = 0. 11). Conclusion: In this academic ED, where there is complete intern “turnover” every month, there was no discernible impact of the EDIS “learning curve” on patient LOS.

40|$|Impedance {{spectroscopy}} (IS) is {{a powerful}} and sophisticated tool to characterize intrinsic electrical properties of any materials and its interface, measuring the electric and transport properties of the materials, investigating the mechanism of electrochemical reaction etc. The fundamental principle of IS is the measurement of the impedance (equivalent to resistance in DC analysis) of the system under investigation over a wide frequency range. The IS study provides quantitative information about the conductance, the dielectric coefficient, the static properties of the interfaces like contact resistance, and its dynamic change due to adsorption or charge transfer phenomenon. Commercial Impedance analyzers that are available today are bulky and cannot be carried or deployed at remote locations for monitoring so easily, also such systems are expensive. Though IS concept is not new, standard Impedance analyzers are interfaced to the computer and require {{detailed analysis of the}} data by experts. Advancement in data conversion and signal processing is opening up opportunities for handheld smart devices. Hence it is felt {{that there is a need}} to develop a versatile low cost, portable (handheld) impedance analyzer instrument which can be used to characterize non linear materials like semiconductors, biological objects, and electrochemical samples. The instrument should be capable accepting test parameters using a touch screen based keypad and <b>display</b> <b>test</b> results on a Graphical LCD for quick analysis. Hence a standalone handheld instrument is designed to work independently without any PC control. The designed instrument consists of Digital Direct Synthesis (DDS) signal generator, a constant current source, Analog to digital convertor, Microcontroller to control frequency sweep parameters and acquire data, TFT Graphics LCD for displaying various plots, touch screen user interface to input sweep parameters and data storage section for offline analysis of obtained data. The instrument is designed to work on a battery or a regulated power supply. The instrument has options to display Nyquist plot, capacitance versus frequency plot, real and imaginary value of impedance versus frequency plot etc. Experimental investigations are conducted using this instrument on few passive components like resistor, inductor, capacitor and combinations. The instrument is also used to monitor the performance of polyimide based capacitive humidity sensor and its characteristics like sensitivity, linearity, repeatability and hysteresis. The measurement accuracy of the impedance varies from 0. 7 % to 4. 67 % depending on the impedance range. Bio impedance measurements are carried out on biological samples like Banana and the measured values are compared with the standard LCR meter. The bio impedance measurements are repeatable and comparable with the standard LCR meter readings and it is found to be within ± 1 % accuracy at the calibrated frequency. The instrument is also validated using industry standard Gauge R & R procedure to understand the repeatability and reproducibility of the instrument.
