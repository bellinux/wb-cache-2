50|$|Advanced {{electronic}} signature - an {{electronic signature}} is considered advanced if it meets certain requirements. It provides unique identifying information that links {{it to its}} signatory. The signatory has sole control of the data used to create the electronic signature. It must be capable of identifying if the data accompanying the message has been tampered with after being signed. If the signed data has changed, the signature is marked invalid. Certificate for electronic signature - electronic proof that confirms the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signatory</b> and links the electronic signature validation data to that person. Advanced electronic signatures can be technically implemented, following the XAdES, PAdES, CAdES or ASiC Baseline Profile (Associated Signature Containers) standard for digital signatures, specified by the ETSI.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in cryptography is the distribution of keys. Suppose you live in the United States and want to pass information secretly to your friend in Europe. If you truly want to keep the information secret, you need to agree on some sort of key that you and he can use to encode/decode messages. But you don’t want to keep using the same key, or you will make it easier and easier for others to crack your cipher. But it’s also a pain to get keys to your friend. If you mail them, they might be stolen. If you send them cryptographically, and someone has broken your code, that person will also have the next key. If {{you have to go to}} Europe regularly to hand-deliver the next key, that is also expensive. If you hire some courier to deliver the new key, you have to trust the courier, et cetera. One solution is provided by digital signature as digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>signatory.</b> Both security algorithms have their flaws and benefits and they both prove to handy in long term with some compromise. In our research we are proposing a combination of both DSA and RSA as a hybrid link for both protocols. We have enhanced the hardness in security by combining the RSA and DSA encryption algorithms by adding some more security codes...|$|E
