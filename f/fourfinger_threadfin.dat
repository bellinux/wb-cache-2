50|$|Philometroides eleutheronemae is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} nematode of fishes, infecting the gonads of marine perciform fishes off the eastern Indian coast. It was first found in the <b>fourfinger</b> <b>threadfin,</b> Eleutheronema tetradactylum. It is distinguished from its cogenerates by the gubernaculum structure in males, {{as well as the}} shape and structure of the females' cephalic and caudal ends, and their oesophagus.|$|E
50|$|Eleutheronema tetradactylum, {{also known}} as <b>fourfinger</b> <b>{{threadfin}},</b> Indian salmon, blue threadfin, or Rawas, is a threadfin fish of the Polynemidae family. This is a commercially valuable species, known for uses in aquaculture. It occurs mainly over shallow muddy bottoms in coastal waters, often forming loose schools. Adults of this species enter rivers during winter. Adults feed on prawns, fish, and occasionally polychaetes, while juveniles feed on prawns, shrimps, and mysids. This species is vulnerable to overfishing.|$|E
40|$|The <b>fourfinger</b> <b>threadfin</b> Eleutheronema tetradactylum is {{reported}} as a protandrous hermaphrodite from Australian waters, while being a gonochorist in reports from Singapore and India, {{with a single}} report of protandrous hermaphroditism from the latter. Histological analysis of gonads of fish from Indian waters confirms protandrous hermaphroditism in E. tetradactylum. The study was based on 480 fish examined from eight locations along the Indian coast. Mean total length (LT) of male fish was 240 mm with the transition to female starting from 280 mm LT. Specimens confirmed as mature females were > 380 mm LT...|$|E
50|$|Ranging {{in length}} from 20 cm in the black-finned {{threadfin}} (Polydactylus nigripinnis) to 200 cm in <b>fourfinger</b> <b>threadfins</b> (Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries {{as a food}} fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch.|$|R
