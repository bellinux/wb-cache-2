40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of combined treatments of the extrusion process and the addition of a natural source of tannins (tea and or gambier wastes) of the total gas and methane production in soybean flour. The materials used in this study were soybean meal, tea waste, gambier, cow rumen fluid, alcohol, CO 2, McDougall solution, 15 % H 2 SO 4, 0, 5 N NaOH, 0, 5 N HCl, 1 % PP indicator and distilled water. The instruments used were analytical scales, test tubes, oven, extruder machine, waterbath, centrifuge, vacuum flaks, CO 2 gas cylinder, 100 ml syringes glass equipped with silicone hoses and clips to be closed and opened, vaccuntainer, erlenmeyergas chromatography, special <b>flute</b> <b>tube</b> and distillation flask, glass beaker, Erlenmeyer, incubator, pipettes, measuring instruments, magnetic stirrer, peristaltic pump to drain the rumen fluid and heater. This study used completely randomized design in 2 x 3 factorials and 3 replicates by a-factor (a 0 = no extruided and a 1 = extruded) and b-factor(b 0 = no tannins, b 1 = tea waste tannins, b 2 = gambier tannin). The parameters observed including total gas and methane production, the data were taseted by usisng analysis of varience and followed by the Duncan test. The results indicate that there is no interaction between the extrusion and the addition of tannins to total gas production, while the production of methane gas does not indicate any influence (p < 0. 05). It is concluded that the extrusion and protection with natural tannins of soybean flour have impacted on decreased in the production of total gas and methane productio...|$|E
50|$|Overtone <b>flute</b> <b>tubes</b> {{typically}} have relatively long resonating chamber compared it its diameter or cross sectional area, which encourages the instrument to resonate {{in the higher}} harmonics. This also makes it either difficult to play or very quiet when attempting to play the instrument in the first harmonic.|$|R

50|$|The pan <b>flute's</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{stopped at}} one end, {{at which the}} {{standing}} wave is reflected giving a note an octave lower than that produced by an open pipe of equal length. In the traditional South American style, pipes are fine-tuned to correct pitch by placing small pebbles or dry corn kernels {{into the bottom of}} the pipes. Contemporary makers of curved Romanian-style panpipes use wax (commonly beeswax) to tune new instruments. Special tools are used to place or remove the wax. Corks and rubber stoppers are also used, and are easier to quickly tune pipes.|$|R

40|$|Inclinometer measurements, done in <b>flute</b> {{outlined}} <b>tubes,</b> {{have been}} employed {{more and more}} spreadly in the last years, {{with the aim of}} monitoring potential and actual instability situations of soils. In spite of their large diffusion, this kind of inclinometer measurements have not been matter of recomendations about the installation of tubes, to be garantied of the real meaning of results. Present paper deals with the analysis of some hundreds of inclinometer measurements, carried out by a SINCO inclinometer, in <b>flute</b> outlined <b>tube,</b> in different instability situations of soil. The analysis of measurement data, we have at disposal, has concerned principally the determination of aspects which can alter results we read in normal diagram. These aspects, infact, can emphasize, minimize, or even cover the real movements of soil, and in any case they make very difficult the interpretation of measurements results. This paper would present results of these analysis carried on in many years of inclinometer measurements, in the aim of contributing to the statement of standard executive methodology for inclinometer tube installation, which could garantee the actual meaning of inclinometer measurements...|$|R
50|$|Bass flutes {{often have}} a C foot rather than the B foot common to other <b>flutes.</b> The shorter <b>tube</b> reduces {{acoustic}} resistance, which quickens the response and makes the tone brighter, livelier, and more resonant. The shorter tube also makes the instrument somewhat lighter and less fatiguing for the player to hold.|$|R
50|$|The nai has {{usually at}} least 20 pipes made of bamboo or reed. They are {{arranged}} in a curved array, allowing a greater speed of play. Generally the longer, lower pipes are on the right. The pitch of each pipe is adjusted with beeswax; usually nais are tuned in G for Romanian folk music, or in C for classical. Traditional Romanian pan <b>flutes</b> have <b>tubes</b> with varying diameters which go from wide to narrow as you go up the scale, to maintain the volume/length ratio of the tube and therefore produce the best consistent tone quality.|$|R

5000|$|The {{project began}} in 1995 {{as an attempt}} by Milbrodt to [...] "turn a car into music that can be {{expressed}} in written form and, therefore, performed and interpreted {{by more than one}} musician or group of musicians." [...] More specifically, Milbrodt wanted playable musical instruments created from his own car, and wanted them to represent the four instrument families of the traditional orchestra: winds, brass, percussion, and strings. To accomplish his goal, he hired professional auto mechanics to disassemble his car, and commissioned metal sculptor Ray Faunce III to create a series of playable musical instruments from the car's parts. Faunce worked with a team that included musicians, an engineer, a physicist, a glass cutter, and others to create a series of instruments, which were given names like Convertibles and <b>Tube</b> <b>Flutes</b> (winds), Strutbone and Exhaustaphone (brass), Percarsion (percussion, of course), and Tank Bass and Air Guitar (strings).|$|R
40|$|Until {{recently}} written {{work on the}} koauau {{has remained}} hidden within ethnographic accounts and anthropological analyses of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} century. Descriptions regarding the traditional construction methods of the wooden koauau, a traditional, short, open-­-ended, <b>tube</b> <b>flute</b> played using the oblique embouchure, are often brief and second-­-hand, usually describing the object as it is physically rather than the process by which it was made. As yet, very little has been done academically on the process of construction: the making of koauau. Interest in taonga puoro (traditional Maori musical instruments) within academic discussion has been increasing alongside the pragmatic revival of a musical practice motivated by a small group of high-­-profile, respected exponents. By collecting oral tradition and combining ethnographic evidence with structural knowledge from existing museum artefacts for purposes of reconstruction and re-­-enactment, these people have been revitalising and reviving the traditional practice of taonga puoro. Situated within an ethnomusicological framework of fieldwork-­-based research this thesis incorporates interviews, practical reconstruction, the study of museum artefacts, and a thorough survey of ethnography in a comparative analysis that considers the possibility, validity and probability of different techniques. Focussed specifically on traditional methods, one technique in particular, that of using a hot coal to burn the central bore that runs through the length of the shaft of the flute was central to the research. In total eighteen instruments are presented that were created during the research by methods that included cord drill, gouging of pith woods, ‘found sound’, tunnels made by moth grubs, and fire...|$|R
5000|$|Târgu Mureș is an {{important}} centre for general and higher education. The most important high schools are the [...] "Colegiul Național Alexandru Papiu Ilarian", [...] "Colegiul Național Unirea" [...] and the Hungarian-speaking [...] "Bolyai Farkas Elméleti Líceum". The latter is a continuator of {{the traditions of the}} Schola Particula, established in Târgu Mureș in 1557, and of the Reformed College banished from Sárospatak {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century. The establishment was one of the first schools of the Reformed Church in Transylvania, was first working in the old building of the Franciscan monastery in the fortress, and had Baranyai Decsi Czimor János, Tordai Ádám, Laskói Csókás Péter as teachers, as well as others. After being sacked in 1601 and 1602, the Schola was moved into another building, on the place of the present high school. For centuries it had accommodated the Reformed College and the present high school. The present aspect was acquired at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. The main statue, facing Bolyai square was erected following the design of architect Baumgarten Sándor in 1908-1909, in Hungarian Secession style.Târgu Mureș also has a [...] "School of Arts" [...] (in Romanian Liceul de Artă in Hungarian Művészeti Líceum) which was set up in 1949.The school offers young musicians and children interested in graphic arts the best education in the county.
