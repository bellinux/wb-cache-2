One {{of the most}} important treatments is the control of agitation due to the extreme possibility of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> themselves or caregivers, benzodiazepines should be administered at first sign of this. Physical restraints are not recommended for agitation or delirium as they may contribute to mortality by enforcing isometric muscle contractions that are associated with severe lactic acidosis and hyperthermia. If physical restraints are necessary for severe agitation they must be rapidly replaced with pharmacological sedation. The agitation can cause a large amount of muscle breakdown. This breakdown can cause severe damage to the kidneys through a condition called rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

Many theoretical expressions indicates that spalling occurs when and where the tensile strength of a strain-softening material like concrete is reached regardless of the time duration of the applied load. By using a simple uni-axial numerical model, this study shows that spalling instead might occurs when the cyclic response from a blast wave gradually increase the inelastic strains in the concrete. This means that spalling takes place after several loading cycles and not necessarily at the depth where tensile strength is firstly reached. Furthermore, the study shows that the cyclic response in the material model used for numerical simulation has a decisive influence on the position and extent of the resulting spalling crack...|$|R

5000|$|During the {{handling}} of this food, patients with NSRED distinguish themselves, as they are usually messy or harmful to themselves. Some eat their food with their bare hands while others attempt to eat it with utensils. This occasionally results in <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> {{as well as other}} injuries. After completing their studies, Schenck and Mahowald said, “Injuries resulted from the careless cutting of food or opening of cans; consumption of scalding fluids (coffee) or solids (hot oatmeal); and frenzied running into walls, kitchen counters, and furniture.” [...] A few of the more notable symptoms of this disorder include large amounts of weight gain over short periods of time, particularly in women; irritability during <b>the</b> day, due <b>to</b> lack of restful sleep; and vivid dreams at night. It is easily distinguished from regular sleepwalking by the typical behavioral sequence consisting of “rapid, ‘automatic’ arising from bed, and immediate entry into the kitchen.” In addition, throughout all of the studies done, doctors and psychiatrists discovered that these symptoms are invariant across weekdays, weekends, and vacations as well as the eating excursions being erratically spread throughout a sleep cycle. Most people that suffer from this disease retain no control over when they arise and consume food in their sleep. Although some have been able to restrain themselves from indulging in their unconscious appetites, some have not and must turn to alternative methods of stopping this disorder. [...] It is important for trained physicians to recognize these symptoms in their patients as quickly as possible, so those with NSRED may be treated before they injure themselves.|$|R

40|$|IntroductionAggressive {{behaviours}} of brain-injured persons put in difficulty care-work and are {{a source}} of uncertainty in the therapeutic relationship. These behavioural disorders are inherent <b>to</b> brain <b>injuries,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> context (Eames, 1988). The contextualisation of the therapeutic relationship (Morin & Apostolidis, 2002) allows us <b>to</b> consider <b>the</b> role of psychosocial prebuilts whose caregivers use to structure and contain critical situations by directing their actions. ObjectiveThis study seeks <b>to</b> highlight <b>the</b> role of social representations (Jodelet, 1989) of nurse aids about brain-injured <b>person</b> in <b>the</b> adjustments made by these caregivers to build and maintain a quality therapeutic relationship in a context of uncertainty. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with nurse aids (n= 23, 22 females, average age 37. 5 years, average length of service 8. 5 years) working in the host institution on the long time. The interviews were the subject of a thematic content analysis (Flick, 2014). ResultsThe content analysis shows that nurse aids perceive brain-injured persons with various disorders, multiple and changing. Caregivers have an organization of sequelae profiles incorporating a specific profile: the “frontals”. The contents of these representations can explain the aggressive behaviour according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> personality of <b>the</b> brain-injured <b>person,</b> brain injury, cognitive impairments and the characteristics identified of its sequelae profile. This common knowledge allows caregivers <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> status of “consciousness” of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> about his aggressive behaviour. The analysis shows that caregivers use specific care practices according to that state of “consciousness”. These practices are oriented on <b>the</b> <b>person,</b> <b>the</b> environment or the caregiver himself. DiscussionIn this context of care for brain-injured persons, caregivers explain aggressive behaviours by drawing on common theories and aetiologies allowing them to put meaning to care situations, adapt and ensure relational work. Training on and by the representations of caregivers can contribute to better care of brain-injured patients...|$|R
