40|$|Recent Solar Dynamic Observatory {{observations}} {{reveal that}} coronal mass ejections (CMEs) {{consist of a}} multi-temperature structure: a hot flux rope and a cool leading front (LF). The flux rope first appears as a twisted <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 94 A ̊ and 131 A ̊ passbands. The twisted <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> initially lies along the polarity inversion line and then rises and develops into the semi-circular flux rope-like structure during the impulsive acceleration phase of CMEs. In the meantime, the rising <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> compresses the surrounding magnetic field and plasma, which successively stack into the CME LF. In this paper, we study in detail two well-observed CMEs occurred on 2011 March 7 and 2011 March 8, respectively. Each of them is associated with an M-class flare. Through a kinematic analysis we find that: (1) the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> rises earlier than the first appearance of the CME LF and {{the onset of the}} associated flare; (2) the speed of the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> is always faster than that of the LF, at least in the field of view of AIA. Thus, the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> acts as a continuous driver of the CME formation and eruption in the early acceleration phase. Subsequently, the two CMEs in white-light images can be well reproduced by the graduated cylindrical shell flux rope model.

In this study an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methodology called code scaling applicability and uncertainty (CSAU) was implemented. Although this methodology follows 14 steps, only the following were carried out: scenario specification, nuclear power plant (NPP) selection, phenomena identification and ranking table (PIRT), selection of frozen code, provision of code documentation, determination of code applicability, determination of code and experiment accuracy, NPP sensitivity analysis calculations, combination of biases and uncertainties, and total uncertainty to calculate specific scenario in a specific NPP. The thermal hydraulic code Flownex® 1 was used to model only the reactor core to investigate the effects of the input parameters on the selected output parameters of the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> in the core. These output parameters were mass flow rate, temperature of the coolant, outlet pressure, centreline temperature of the fuel and surface temperature of the cladding. The PIRT process was used in conjunction with the sensitivity analysis results in order to select the relevant input parameters that significantly influenced the selected output parameters. The input parameters that have the largest effect on the selected output parameters were found to be the coolant flow channel width between the plates in the <b>hot</b> <b>channel,</b> the width of the fuel plates itself in the <b>hot</b> <b>channel,</b> the heat generation in the fuel plate of the <b>hot</b> <b>channel,</b> the global mass flow rate, the global coolant inlet temperature, the coolant flow channel width between the plates in the cold channel, and the width of the fuel plates in the cold channel.

40|$|ABSTRACT Butanol is an {{important}} industrial solvent and advanced biofuel that can be produced by biphasic fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum. It has been known that acetate and butyrate first formed during the acidogenic phase are reassimi-lated to form acetone-butanol-ethanol (cold channel). Butanol can also be formed directly from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) through butyryl-CoA (<b>hot</b> <b>channel).</b> However, {{little is known about}} the relative contributions of the two butanol-forming path-ways. Here we report that the direct butanol-forming pathway is a better channel to optimize for butanol production through metabolic flux andmass balance analyses. Butanol production through the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> was maximized by simultaneous disrup-tion of the pta and buk genes, encoding phosphotransacetylase and butyrate kinase, while the adhE 1 D 485 G gene, encoding a mu-tated aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, was overexpressed. The ratio of butanol produced through the <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> to that pro-duced through the cold channel increased from 2. 0 in the wild type to 18. 8 in the engineered BEKW(pPthlAAD**) strain. By reinforcing the direct butanol-forming flux in C. acetobutylicum, 18. 9 g/liter of butanol was produced, with a yield of 0. 71 mol butanol/mol glucose by batch fermentation, levels which are 160 % and 245 % higher than those obtained with the wild type. By fed-batch culture of this engineered strain with in situ recovery, 585. 3 g of butanol was produced from 1, 861. 9 g of glucose, with the yield of 0. 76 mol butanol/mol glucose and productivity of 1. 32 g/liter/h. Studies of two butanol-forming routes and their ef-fects on butanol production in C. acetobutylicum described here will serve as a basis for further metabolic engineering of clos...|$|E

A grid dependency test was performed to determine the optimal number of the grid system. The numerical results were validated using the experimental data, and showed good agreement. The inline and staggered arrangements show the highest temperature differences through all De.

In this paper, we investigate an X-class circular ribbon flare on 2012 October 23, using the multi-wavelength {{data from the}} Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. In Ca 2 H emission, the flare showed three ribbons with two highly elongated ones inside and outside a quasi-circular one, respectively. A <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> was displayed in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions that infers {{the existence of a}} magnetic flux rope. Two hard X-ray (HXR) sources in the 12 [...] 25 keV energy band were located at the footpoints of this <b>hot</b> <b>channel.</b> Using a nonlinear force-free magnetic field extrapolation, we identify three topological structures: (1) a 3 D null-point, (2) a flux rope below the fan of the null-point, and (3) a large-scale quasi-separatrix layers (QSL) induced by the quadrupolar-like magnetic field of the active region. We find that the null-point is embedded within the large-scale QSL. In our case, all three identified topological structures must be considered to explain all the emission features associated with the observed flare. Besides, the HXR sources are regarded as the consequence of the reconnection within or near the border of the flux rope. Comment: 30 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} actual CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) {{approaches to}} subcooled boiling and investigates their capability {{to contribute to}} fuel assembly design. In a prototype version of the CFD code CFX a wall boiling model is implemented based on a wall heat flux partition algorithm. It can be shown, that the wall boiling model is able to calculate the cross sectional averaged vapour volume fraction of vertical heated tubes tests with good agreement to published experimental data. The most sensitive parameters of the model are identified. Needs for more detailed experiments are established which are necessary to support further model development. The model is applied for investigation of the phenomena inside a <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> of a fuel assembly. Here the essential phenomenon is the critical heat flux. Although subcooled boiling represents only a preliminary state towards the critical heat flux occurrence, essential parameters like swirl, cross flow between adjacent channels and concentration regions of bubbles can be determined.

40|$|In recent years, the {{enthalpy}} raise <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> factor limit {{has decreased}} significantly {{due to the}} power upgrade of Ringhals 4 {{and the use of}} shielding fuel assemblies. The shielding fuel assemblies task are to reduce the neutron leakage to the reactor vessel and in that way extend the reactor lifetime. This is achieved by replacing a few fuel rods with steel rods. Experiences from the last fuel cycles show that the core design procedure has been hampered because of this and that it’s hard to stay under the design limit. A way to overcome this problem and to improve the fuel economy is to introduce the use of radial enrichment distribution in the fuel assembly. This master thesis shows, through a case study of three fuel cycles at Ringhals 4,  that the internal peaking factor can be improved by roughly 2 – 3 % and that the maximum enthalpy raise <b>hot</b> <b>channel</b> factor can be improved by about 2. 0 – 2. 5 % if the fuel assemblies contain three different levels of enrichments instead of currently one.
