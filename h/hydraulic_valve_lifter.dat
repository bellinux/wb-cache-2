50|$|A <b>{{hydraulic}}</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> {{also known}} as a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} in the area of mass transfer of air as a bubble in hydraulic fluid or lubricant is very limited. There are only a few studies on the interaction of oils with air, especially knowledge of air solubility of the oil and diffusivity of dissolved air in oil, namely aeration. This paper will study the effect of aeration on a direct acting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> system in an internal combustion engine. Aeration is, primarily, influenced by hydrodynamic factors such as, design features of the oil system and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. The direct acting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> (DAHVL) was introduced to the automotive industry because of some definite advantages, such as acoustic improvement and friction reduction. Although, the aforementioned, advantages of DAHVL are significant, the aeration effect due to hydraulics creates a challenge. Aeration stems from compressibility of air in oil. It is a fact that the incompressibility of the oil hydraulically maintains all components of the valve train in contact. Therefore, aeration tends to create separation between the valve train components. This separation creates certain effects on the dynamic performance. This paper has concentrated on 3 major specifics: how oil aeration affects engine operation (via a linear math model compared to experimental data), a brief discussion on what variables inherent in the design could significantly improve the system 2 ̆ 7 s robustness to aeration effects (experimental only) and on what causes aeration (theory) ...|$|E

50|$|The 12-valve (2 valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE is {{familiar}} as {{the engine of}} the Toyota Supra and Toyota Cressida of the 1980s.

It used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> a first for Toyota. The use of rocker arms and valve lash adjusters eliminated the need for valve clearance maintenance, a world first for any twin cam engine. This version of the M made its US debut in 1982's Toyota Celica Supra MK2. The 1982 version had a vacuum-advance distributor, whereas the 1983-1988 versions found in the Celica Supra and Cressida had full electronic control of the ignition system and distributor. The newer engine control system found in these later cars was named TCCS, or Toyota Computer Control System and, together with different intake runners, increased max power by 5 PS from August 1983.|$|R

5000|$|Bel Air {{interiors}} had {{an optional}} massive expanse of chrome across {{the lower part}} of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome horn ring. Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI.

5000|$|Initial {{power output}} {{was quoted as}} 110 {{horsepower}} -- a little higher than the target figure -- at 3,900 rpm, a rather high power peak for those days. The torque curve was quite flat, however, with at least 180 pounds/feet available from 3,500 rpm {{all the way down}} to 400 rpm, which made for incredible top-gear performance. Though the Zephyr V-12 no more resembled previous Lincoln engines than the ubiquitous V-8 (despite sharing the latter's stroke), it was more like a [...] "12-cylinder Ford" [...] than a classic multi-cylinder powerplant in character. And it was not without problems. The main ones were inadequate crankcase ventilation that caused rapid sludge buildup in sustained low-rpm running, aggravated by poor oil flow, plus too-small water passages that led to overheating, bore warpage, and ring wear. To a degree, some of these maladies were dealt with during the Zephyr's first year, and Ford improved the engine by adopting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> for 1938 and cast-iron heads and oiling improvements for 1942.

5000|$|In the Type 2, the Type 4 {{engine was}} {{an option for}} the 1972 model year onward. This engine was {{standard}} in models destined for the US and Canada. Only with the Type 4 engine did an automatic transmission become available {{for the first time}} in the 1973 model year.

The Type 4 engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type 1 engines, particularly in Transporter service.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. Originally developed for use in race cars {{as a way to}} prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, the system circulated twelve litres of oil between the storage tank mounted inside the right front fender and the engine as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} tank's filler cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power-steering-fluid filters.|$|R
5000|$|The 431-cubic-inch {{displacement}} 1938-40 Cadillac V16 {{was one of}} {{the last}} new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. As such, it incorporated some of the latest thinking. Nine main bearings provided a crankshaft main bearing support between each 135 degree opposing pair of cylinders. The square bore and stroke lowered piston speed and promoted crankshaft rigidity, no small matter for an engine with eight cylinders in line per cylinder bank. The side valve engine design was no handicap for the time because the era's typical top engine speed of 3400-3700 rpm provided little opportunity to exploit the high speed breathing efficiency of overhead valves. Luxury car drivers presumably valued smoothness and silence more than high speed power. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision <b>valve</b> <b>lifters.</b> Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45 degree V16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939, and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear only in 16 seconds. The definitive engineering report on the 135 degree Cadillac V16 engine is [...] "The Evolution of the Cadillac Sixteen engine," [...] by E.W. Seaholm, in charge of Cadillac engine design.
