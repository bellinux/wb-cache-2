5|$|<b>In</b> <b>answering</b> both {{questions}} in the negative, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's finding that the statute was unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal further clarified Singapore's stance on legislative plenary power and expounded upon Article 12(1) of the Constitution, explaining that the promise of equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Drawing on foreign case law, the Court of Appeal further outlined the test to determine if a differentiating law falls foul of Article 12.|$|E

5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> some of the mysteries in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E

25|$|Rabin dismisses these criticisms, {{claiming}} that consistent results are typically obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight.

For example, behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and cannot yet be verified in the field.|$|E

25|$|This decree of an Italian rabbi {{pronounced}} {{against a}} Turkish colleague was an unprecedented {{attack on the}} rights of the community, and provoked the righteous indignation of the Jewish social order in Constantinopleall the more as it proved to rest upon a groundless and vulgar calumny. Capsali, conscious of having been maligned, did not mince matters <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> Colon's letters; and a bitter discussion arose between the two men, in which the leading rabbis of Germany, Italy, and the Orient took part. It is characteristic of Colon that as soon as he became convinced that he had been the victim of an intrigue, and so had done injustice to the ḥakham bashi, he did not hesitate to make amends. On his deathbed, he commissioned his son Perez to go to Constantinople and ask, in his father's name, the forgiveness of Capsali.|$|E
25|$|Besides all this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often {{a single}} letter of Hamilton's {{occupied}} from fifty {{to a hundred}} or more closely written pages, all devoted to the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem; for {{it was one of}} the peculiar characteristics of Hamilton's mind never to be satisfied with a general understanding of a question; Hamilton pursued the problem until he knew it in all its details. Hamilton was ever courteous and kind <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> applications for assistance in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his investigations.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, for true believers and the righteous, death {{will cause a}} feeling of love, then it's arrives and their souls will be aparted tender. When a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angel of death comes, and tells the soul {{to come out to}} the {{pleasure}} and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called Munkar and Nakir.

500|$|The hard–easy {{effect is}} a {{cognitive}} bias that manifests itself as a tendency to overestimate the probability of one's success at a task perceived as hard, and to underestimate the likelihood of one's success at a task perceived as easy. The hard-easy effect takes place, for example, when individuals exhibit a degree of underconfidence <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> relatively easy questions and a degree of overconfidence <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> relatively difficult questions. [...] "Hard tasks tend to produce overconfidence but worse-than-average perceptions," [...] reported Katherine A. Burson, Richard P. Larrick, and Jack B.

500|$|Regarding {{the society}} itself, like social {{institutions}} in general, Durkheim {{saw it as}} a set of social facts. Even more than [...] "what society is", Durkheim was interested <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> [...] "how is a society created" [...] and [...] "what holds a society together". In The Division of Labour in Society, Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, {{and at the same time}} individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.|$|E

500|$|Both Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo and José Marmol's Amalia, {{published}} in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, [...] "all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo, a work written as a sociolodical treatise". Facundo is an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, Juan Facundo Quiroga, but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's Facundo has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment. In Facundo, Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874. Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga {{was the first time}} that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power, and <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> this question, Facundo established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing Facundo as [...] "within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God", thereby creating the bridge between writing and power that is characteristic of the dictator novel.|$|E
