5000|$|Derived {{from the}} Oxford Union debating society of Oxford University, [...] "Oxford-style" [...] debating is a {{competitive}} debate format featuring a sharply framed motion that is proposed by {{one side and}} opposed by another. A winner is declared in an Oxford-Style debate either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes. [...] Oxford-style debates follow a formal structure that begins with audience members casting a pre-debate vote on the motion that is either for, against or undecided. Each panelist presents a seven-minute opening statement, after which the moderator takes questions from the audience with <b>inter-panel</b> challenges. Finally, each panelist delivers a two-minute closing argument, and the audience delivers their second (and final) vote for comparison against the first.|$|E

(Geology) Analyses {{show that}} the effect of <b>inter-panel</b> lag on hanging wall {{instability}} is an important factor affecting rock-fall accidents and production losses in gold mines utilising segmented longwall mining methods. The study emphasises the effect of <b>inter-panel</b> lag on the development of mining-induced fractures which are considered a major contributor to hangingwall instability in geologically undisturbed ground. The geology and mining geometry at Western Deep Levels, Limited, particularly at the selected research site, is outlined. The data collection, which is facilitated by the use of stereo-photogrammetry and computer-aided data handling, is described. Three types of mining-induced fracture are evident. The effects of <b>inter-panel</b> lag and geological inhomogeneity on the orientation and density of the mining-induced fractures are illustrated and discussed. The effects of <b>inter-panel</b> lag length on energy release rate are demonstrated and discussed. Microseismic event location data analyses are used to elucidate the fracturing process that takes place in the rock ahead of the mine face. Practical suggestions regarding the reduction in number and length of <b>inter-panel</b> lags are made, in the light of recent developments in the field of rock-burst control...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{relation}} between sample sizes of female respondents aged 18 - 44 and the statistical significance of parameter estimates in four piecewise constant proportional hazard regression models by means of microsimulation. The underlying models for first marriage, first birth, second birth, and first divorce are estimated from Hungarian GGS data and interpreted and used as typical event-history models {{for the analysis of}} GGS data in general. The models are estimated from the full biographies as well as from three- and six-year <b>inter-panel</b> biographies of the simulated samples. The simulation results indicate that there is great sensibility of the parameters that reach statistical significance to the sample size precisely in the sample range of the GGS. This means that any reduction or increase in the sample size will notably affect the statistical analysis of the data. Marginal gains {{in terms of the number}} of significant parameters are especially high up to 3. 000 respondents when applying rather modest thresholds of significance. For higher thresholds, marginal gains remain steep for sample sizes up to 5. 000 respondents. When analyzing <b>inter-panel</b> histories, especially for a single three-year interval, the likelihood that parameter estimates are significant is very moderate. For 6 -year <b>inter-panel</b> histories, we get better results, at least for a sample size of at least 3. 000. When reducing the sample size to below 3. 000, the number of significant results for <b>inter-panel</b> histories deteriorates rapidly. event history surveys, microsimulation, samples, simulation...|$|E

While it is possible to control the displacements of VG through the use of Eqs.

40|$|Olfactometry is {{a precise}} testing method. How precise {{depends on the}} quality {{assurance}} / quality control (QA/QC) statistics associated with the laboratory’s results. The European Olfactometry testing standard, EN 13725 : 2003, provides a formalized method for monitoring the performance of panel members (assessors) and test results. This is accomplished through testing with the standard odorant 1 -butanol (n-butanol). Olfactometry precision can be understood through four different variance values: 1. specific panel variance, 2. within panel variance, 3. <b>inter-panel</b> variance, and 4. inter-laboratory variance. Inter-laboratory studies have shown standard deviation of log threshold values as high as 0. 30 and individual laboratories have shown <b>inter-panel</b> standard deviations of 0. 10 and within panel standard deviations as low as 0. 05. This paper defines the four types of variances and shows how the precision of odor panel results can be expressed as analogous {{to a group of}} assessors determining sound level within ± 1 dB in 95 % of the cases. This paper will present these different measures of precision with test data and examples of applications of how this information can be utilized by various stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} some mechanical properties and formaldehyde emission of beech plywood panels manufactured from rotary cut veneers using phenol–formaldehyde (PF) resin. Six plywood panels of 5 plies with 15 mm thickness were manufactured. Modulus of rupture (MOR), {{modulus of elasticity}} (MOE) and formaldehyde emission values were determined. The values of MOR and MOE were higher than the EN requirements. Furthermore, the formaldehyde emission values measured by the European small-scale chamber (EN 717 - 1) and gas analysis (EN 717 - 2) methods were lower than the E 1 -emmison class. The results showed significant variations (P< 0. 001) among beech plywood panels, most of them caused by sample heterogeneity, and inconsistency of the values {{was related to the}} <b>inter-panel</b> variation. Moreover, a strongly positive correlation between the formaldehyde emission values measured by EN 717 - 1 and 717 - 2 methods was found (R 2 value of 0. 87) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The cDNA-mediated Annealing, extension, Selection and Ligation (DASL) assay {{has become}} a {{suitable}} gene expression profiling system for degraded RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue. We examined assay characteristics {{and the performance of}} the DASL 502 -gene Cancer Panel v 1 (1. 5 K) and 24, 526 -gene panel (24 K) platforms at differentiating nine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 - positive (HER 2 +) and 11 HER 2 -negative (HER 2 -) paraffin-embedded breast tumors. Methods Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlations evaluated intra/inter-panel agreement of normalized expression values. Unequal-variance t -statistics tested for differences in expression levels between HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors. Regulatory network analysis was performed using Metacore (GeneGo Inc., St. Joseph, MI). Results Technical replicate correlations ranged between 0. 815 - 0. 956 and 0. 986 - 0. 997 for the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels, respectively. <b>Inter-panel</b> correlations of expression values for the common 498 genes across the two panels ranged between 0. 485 - 0. 573. <b>Inter-panel</b> correlations of expression values of 17 probes with base-pair sequence matches between the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels ranged between 0. 652 - 0. 899. In both panels, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB 2) was the most differentially expressed gene between the HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors and seven additional genes had p-values | 0. 5 | in expression between HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors: topoisomerase II alpha (TOP 2 A), cyclin a 2 (CCNA 2), v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 5 a (WNT 5 A), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB 7), cell division cycle 2 (CDC 2), and baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC 5). The top 52 discriminating probes from the 24 K panel are enriched with genes belonging to the regulatory networks centered around v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), tumor protein p 53 (TP 53), and estrogen receptor α (ESR 1). Network analysis with a two-step extension also showed that the eight discriminating genes common to the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels are functionally linked together through MYC, TP 53, and ESR 1. Conclusions The relative RNA abundance obtained from two highly differing density gene panels are correlated with eight common genes differentiating HER 2 + and HER 2 - breast tumors. Network analyses demonstrated biological consistency between the 1. 5 K and 24 K gene panels. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of large-scale freeform shapes in architecture poses big {{challenges to the}} fabrication of such structures. A key problem is the approximation of the design surface by a union of patches, socalled panels, that can be manufactured with a selected technology at reasonable cost, while meeting the design intent and achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and surface smoothness. The production of curved panels is mostly based on molds. Since the cost of mold fabrication often dominates the panel cost, there is strong incentive {{to use the same}} mold for multiple panels. We cast the major practical requirements for architectural surface paneling, including mold reuse, into a global optimization framework that interleaves discrete and continuous optimization steps to minimize production cost while meeting user-specified quality constraints. The search space for optimization is mainly generated through controlled deviation from the design surface and tolerances on positional and normal continuity between neighboring panels. A novel 6 -dimensional metric space allows us to quickly compute approximate <b>inter-panel</b> distances, which dramatically improves the performance of the optimization and enables the handling of complex arrangements with thousands of panels. The practical relevance of our system is demonstrated by paneling solutions for real, cutting-edge architectural freeform design projects. © 2010 ACM...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the variability between different anthropometric panels used to determine the inward leakage (IL) of N 95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and elastomeric half-mask respirators (EHRs). A total of 144 subjects, who were both experienced and non-experienced N 95 FFR users, were recruited. Five N 95 FFRs and five N 95 EHRs were randomly selected from among those models tested previously in our laboratory. The PortaCount Pro+ (without N 95 -Companion) was used to measure IL of the ambient particles with a detectable size range of 0. 02 to 120. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard fit test exercises were used for this study. IL test were performed for each subject using each of the 10 respirators. Each respirator/subject combination was tested in duplicate, resulting in a total 20 IL tests for each subject. Three 35 -member panels were randomly selected without replacement from the 144 study subjects stratified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health bivariate panel cell for conducting statistical analyses. The geometric mean (GM) IL values for all 10 studied respirators were not significantly different among the three randomly selected 35 -member panels.

40|$|Burden {{of disease}} (BOD) {{estimates}} used to foster local health policy require disability weights which represent local preferences for different health states. The global {{burden of disease}} (GBD) study presumes that disability weights are universal and equal across countries and cultures, but this is questionable. This indicates the need to measure local disability weights across nations and|or cultures. We developed a culturally adapted version of the visual analogue scale (VAS) for a setting in rural Burkina Faso. Using an anthropologic approach, BOD-relevant health states were translated into culturally meaningful disability scenarios. The scaling procedure was adapted using a locally relevant scale. Nine hypothetical health states were evaluated by seven panels of in total 39 lay individuals and 17 health professionals. Results show that health professionals' rankings and valuations of health states matched those of lay people to a certain extent. In comparison {{to that of the}} lay people, health professionals rated seven out of nine health states as slightly to moderately less severe. The instrument scored well on <b>inter-panel</b> and test-retest reliability and construct validity. Our research shows the feasibility of eliciting disability weights in a rural African setting using a culturally adapted VAS. Moreover, {{the results of the present}} study suggest that it might be possible to use health professionals' preferences on disability weights as a proxy for lay people's preferences.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the {{aesthetic}} evaluation of head photographs of treated individuals with clefts by laypeople and professionals and to investigate how certain cephalometric variables could be related to their rating. A set of five standardized head photos (frontal, both laterals, three-quater right and left) of 12 Caucasian patients with treated unilateral cleft lip and palate were presented to 12 adult laypeople, 12 orthodontists, and 12 maxillofacial surgeons. For each set of photos the judges had to answer four questions on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The answers were analysed for intra- and <b>inter-panel</b> level of agreement and correlations of assessments with certain cephalometric parameters were determined. There was a high level of agreement for all assessments of each panel of raters. However, laypeople were less satisfied with lip and nose aesthetics compared to professionals. The three groups were similarly satisfied with the aesthetics of the jaws and the face. The anterior position of the maxilla (SNA) influenced positively professionals' ratings of facial aesthetics. Orthodontists were negatively influenced when the vertical dimension of the face or the distance of the lower lip to E-plane were relatively increased. The latter was the only cephalometric parameter correlated with lower aesthetic scores obtained from laypeople. Professionals report greater satisfaction from the treatment outcome and evaluate cleft consequences with less severity than laypeople. According to cephalometric findings, the relative positions of the lips seem to dominate facial aesthetics' appreciation by laypeople, while specialists appear to focus on different features of the fac...|$|E

The character masked by the green rectangle is chosen for a“fourth wall break ” effect. The reading order of each layout is {{from left to right}} and then top to bottom. Manga layout is a core component in manga production, characterized by its unique styles. However, stylistic manga layouts are difficult for novices to produce as it requires hands-on experience and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate a stylistic manga layout from a set of input artworks with user-specified semantics, thus allowing lessexperienced users to create high-quality manga layouts with minimal efforts. We first introduce three parametric style models that encode the unique stylistic aspects of manga layouts, including layout structure, panel importance, and panel shape. Next, we propose a two-stage approach to generate a manga layout: 1) an initial layout is created that best fits the input artworks and layout structure model, according to a generative probabilistic framework; 2) the layout and artwork geometries are jointly refined using an efficient optimization procedure, resulting in a professional-looking manga layout. Through a user study, we demonstrate that our approach enables novice users to easily and quickly produce higherquality layouts that exhibit realistic manga styles, when compared to a commercially-available manual layout tool...|$|E
40|$|The Mobile Communication {{environment}} {{has changed dramatically}} from providing pure voice service exclusive to cellular users to providing multimedia services to users with access to an all-IP infrastructure via heterogeneous access technologies. IP in next generation networks will provide efficient and cost-effective interworking between different systems. Therefore, IP QoS provisioning will {{play a key role}} in satisfying mobile users' expectations on seamless access to multimedia services of desired quality anywhere and anytime. However, heterogeneity of the systems and diversity of the services challenge IP QoS provisioning schemes in multiple aspects. It is one of the most critical challenges to maintain QoS level to mobile users when handoff occurs. QoS control communications must interwork with various management entities to ensure the minimization of service disruption during handoff. In this thesis, we propose a generic multi-panel QoS control communications framework to provide a guideline for optimizing control communications between various functionalities and entities. The framework is an effective platform to analyze control communications from two perspectives, intra-panel and <b>inter-panel.</b> Specifically, we propose a novel MIPv 6 handoff scheme in the QoS panel to smooth the procedure of QoS updates during a MIPv 6 handoff. Vertical handoff is the most challenging event in the framework. The two key problems of QoS control communications are QoS domain switch and automatic service adjustment between different access networks. We propose a QoS control architecture in the QoS panel to address these issues. Both analytical results and simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed schemes for different events can promote the efficiency of intra-panel control communications in the QoS Panel. The direct benefits are greatly-reduced QoS configuration delay during handoff and smooth end-to-end QoS provisioning in terms of different measurement...|$|E
40|$|Virgin {{aggregate}} {{is being}} used faster than it is being made available creating a foreseeable shortage in the future. Despite this trend, the availability of demolished concrete for use as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is increasing. Using this waste concrete as RCA conserves virgin aggregate, reduces the impact on landfills, decreases energy consumption and can provide cost savings. However, {{there are still many}} unanswered questions on the beneficial use of RCA in concrete pavements. This research addresses the many technical and cost-effective concerns regarding the use of RCA in concrete pavements by identifying concrete mixture and proportioning designs suitable for jointed plain concrete pavements; constructing test sections using varying amounts of RCA; monitoring performance through testing, condition surveys and sensor data; modeling RCA pavement performance; and predicting life cycle costs. The research was carried out as a partnership between the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) at the University of Waterloo, the Cement Association of Canada, Dufferin Construction, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The literature review provides an overview of sustainability and key performance indicators, the material properties of RCA both as an aggregate and in concrete, concrete mixture and proportioning designs with RCA, performance of existing RCA pavements, and the implementation of RCA highlighting some examples where RCA has been used successfully. Twelve preliminary mixes were developed using three total cementitious contents amounts of 315 kg/m 3, 330 kg/m 3, and 345 kg/m 3 to determine four suitable mixes with varying coarse RCA contents (0 %, 15 %, 30 % and 50 %) to place at the CPATT test track. At 28 -days, all of the twelve mixes exceed the 30 MPa design strength. Four test sections containing 0 %, 15 %, 30 % and 50 % coarse RCA were constructed in June 2007. The test sections had identical cross sections consisting of 250 mm portland cement concrete (PCC), 100 mm asphalt-stabilized OGDL and a 450 mm granular base. For each coarse RCA content, one slab was instrumented with six vibrating wire concrete embedment strain gages to measure long-term longitudinal and transverse strain due to environmental changes, two vibrating wire vertical extensometers to monitor slab curling and warping, two vibrating wire <b>inter-panel</b> extensometers to monitor joint movement, and two maturity meters to measure maturity and temperature. Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) testing showed that the mixes containing RCA exhibited similar or improved performance when compared to the conventional concrete for compressive and flexural strength, freeze-thaw durability and coefficient of thermal expansion. Pavement performance of the four test sections was evaluated using visual surveys following the Ontario Ministry of Transportation’s Manual for Condition rating of Rigid Pavements. Nine pavement evaluations have been performed every two to four months since construction. All test sections are in excellent condition with pavement condition index (PCI) values greater than 85 after two years in-service and approximately three hundred thousand Equivalent Single Axle Loads. Sensor data from the strain gauges, and vertical and <b>inter-panel</b> extensometers are providing consistent results between the test sections. Long-term performance modeling using the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (ME-PDG) showed improved performance with respect to cracked slabs, joint faulting, and pavement roughness as the RCA content increased. Multivariable sensitivity analysis showed that the performance results were sensitive to CTE, unit weight, joint spacing, edge support, surface absorption, and dowel bar diameter. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) illustrated the savings that can be expected using RCA as a replacement aggregate source as the cost of virgin aggregate increase as the sources becomes depleted. Multivariable sensitivity analysis showed that the LCCA results were sensitive to construction costs, discount rate, and maintenance and rehabilitation quantities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} ways {{of including}} edge diffraction and surface scattering to improve room acoustics auralization, i. e., the binaural replication of an acoustic environment. The approach combines numerical and psychoacoustical studies to discern {{what level of}} computational accuracy is necessary to obtain perceptually adequate replication. In Paper I, a psychoacoustical investigation is performed on the ear's sensitivity to frequency-dependent changes in Lambert-modeled surface scattering. Using auralizations of a simulated concert hall, one finds that the frequency-dependent changes can be clearly audible over a wide frequency region and that its particular quality depends on the input signal. Frequency-dependent scattering, therefore, should be modeled, although not all auralization programs currently do this. Paper II delves into accurate modeling of edge diffraction. Using a validated time-domain model, computations are extended to include reflection/diffraction combinations, which significantly improve agreement with scale-model measurements of a stage house. Additionally, listening tests show that coloration changes due to edge diffraction are audible even for the conservative test geometry, but that second-order diffraction to non-shadowed receivers can often be neglected. Finally, a practical implementation for binaural simulation is proposed, completing a first major step toward computing edge diffraction for more accurate auralization. In Paper III, scattering is measured from various reflector arrays to allow study of physical diffraction phenomena and to gain new perspectives on modeling. This investigation also reveals general trends that can be of practical use in room acoustics when the wavelength is comparable {{to or greater than}} the individual panels. Results demonstrate (1) how the scattering from the array spreads over a considerably greater spatial extent than the "specular reflection zone" would predict, (2) how multi-element arrays apparently allow complex <b>inter-panel</b> diffraction at certain wavelengths, and (3) that the geometrical array-coverage only gives a useful estimate of the reflection strength over a limited frequency range. Paper IV discusses two ways of improving simulation of scattering in auralization: by measurements and by computation. In addition, a hybrid model for scattering is proposed for the low- and middle-frequency ranges in room acoustics...|$|E
