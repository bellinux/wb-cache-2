She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was <b>I</b> <b>wrong.</b> It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. Then I heard it wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} in The New Yorker, Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and {{associate}} of 36 years: “How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, but maybe I was wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It’s a terrible way to end a career. It’s hard to remember, but he was once the future.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems {{referred}} {{to the role of}} the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that [...] "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives. [...] Was <b>I</b> <b>wrong</b> to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?" ...|$|E
