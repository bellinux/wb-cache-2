5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size.

Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program.

Revenues from the <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices.

Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled.

To cope with increasing imports of flax, timber and hemp, and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> coal, salt and linen, between 1843 and 1846 a new wet dock and pier was built at the harbour. In 1847 a canvas manufacturer, Michael Nairn, took out a licence on Frederick Walton's patent {{for the production of}} floorcloth, and opened a factory in nearby Pathhead. When the patent expired in 1876, Nairn and other floorcloth manufacturers began the manufacture of linoleum. Production of both floorcloth and linoleum occupied seven factories in the town by 1883, employing 1,300. A further expansion of the harbour was completed between 1906 and 1908, for another increase in linoleum and coal.|$|E

40|$|Previously we {{reported}} that nuclear <b>export</b> <b>of</b> both unspliced and spliced {{murine leukemia virus}} (MLV) transcripts depends on the nuclear export factor (NXF 1) pathway. Although the mRNA export complex TREX, which contains Aly/REF, UAP 56, and the THO complex, {{is involved in the}} NXF 1 -mediated nuclear <b>export</b> <b>of</b> cellular mRNAs, its contribution to the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> MLV mRNA transcripts remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the involvement of TREX components in the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> MLV transcripts. Depletion of UAP 56, but not Aly/REF, reduced the level of both unspliced and spliced viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, depletion of THO components, including THOC 5 and THOC 7, affected only unspliced viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the RNA immunoprecipitation assay showed that only the unspliced viral transcript interacted with THOC 5. These results imply that MLV requires UAP 56, THOC 5 and THOC 7, in addition to NXF 1, for nuclear <b>export</b> <b>of</b> viral transcripts. Given that naturally intronless mRNAs, but not bulk mRNAs, require THOC 5 for nuclear export, it is plausible that THOC 5 {{plays a key role in}} the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> unspliced MLV transcripts...|$|R
