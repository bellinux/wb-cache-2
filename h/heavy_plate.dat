40|$|Abstract: The {{manufacturing}} process of <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> generates some internal residual stresses. During machining {{process at the}} end users, shape defects may be created by these residual stresses. An industrial characterization method of residual stress state in <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> with a thickness of several hundreds of millimetres is described here. The measurement principle by acoustical birefringence and the used experimental equipment are presented. The first tests were performed on standard plates representative of the various possible residual stress states. The analysis of ultrasonic signals allowed {{the definition of the}} most suitable measurement configuration and the attainment of satisfactory accuracy. Assessments of the acoustical birefringence coefficient across plate width permits to estimate residual stress profile of these plates and to identify <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> where the geometric stability during the machining process will be insufficient. The method is then validated on the <b>heavy</b> industrial <b>plates</b> at different manufacturing steps. Introduction: The {{manufacturing process}} of <b>heavy</b> steel <b>plates</b> generates some internal residual stresses. These stresses are modified at every manufacturing step, for example during hot rolling or during cooling. At the final manufacturing step, <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> present residual stress profiles i...|$|R

50|$|Dillinger Hütte {{produces}} {{heavy steel}} plate, cast slag pots and semi-finished products, such as pressings, and (pressure) vessel heads and shell sections. Total production when the French subsidiary, GTS Industries, is included is well over two million tonnes of <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> annually, in a thickness range extending from 6 to 440 mm, making the company Europe's largest <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> producer. This robust material {{is used for}} fabrication of drilling rigs, ships, petrochemicals plants, bridges and heavy machinery; reference projects include the Öresund Bridge and the Millau Viaduct, the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, and the luxury liner, Queen Mary 2. The striking arc of the Olympic Stadium in Athens was also welded from plate supplied by Dillinger Hütte. The main application for Dillinger Hütte's <b>heavy</b> <b>plate</b> output, however, is the making of large-caliber line pipe for major pipeline projects. The so-called thermomechanical rolling process, an extremely sophisticated rolling method which permits attainment of maximized mechanical properties combined with optimum working (bending and welding) characteristics, is used for these products. Dillinger Hütte is also a 50% owner of Europipe GmbH, Europe's largest manufacturer of large-caliber line pipe, with facilities in Germany, France and the USA.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{stability}} of centerline inhomogenity of continuously cast slabs and hot rolled products. The centerline segregation is a disadvantageous failure of slabs which can affect the quality properties of the final products. During hot rolling of slabs the centerline segregation pattern will become thin and stretch and {{it can also be}} detected in the middle part of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> and coils. It is a common experience that the centerline segregation of <b>heavy</b> <b>plates</b> can not be easily decreased by post heat treatment. The pattern of the centerline segregation was modeled physically by preparing a sandwich structure of steel plates with different levels of carbon and alloying elements. Homogenization experiments were performed and the samples were examined metallographically. Diffusional calculations proved the governing role of carbon activity which is influenced by the distribution of alloying elements...|$|R
