Lucy Davies of the BBC was not impressed by the song's theme being similar to those of other songs on Fearless or on her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. She opined that [...] "You Belong with Me"'s [...] "lyrical palette has few colours [...] and it's repetitive". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine said, [...] "'You Belong with Me' isn't her best-written song by a long shot, but it's hard to fault its construction."

[...] Poniewozik wrote that Rachel's [...] "silent reminder to Kurt to smile on stage was a perfect, sweet little moment", a sentiment shared by Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly. Poniewozik also noted that [...] "Lea Michele had some of her strongest non-singing moments of the season by showing not just how Rachel dealt with her problems with Finn but with being {{on the periphery of the}} group." [...] The storyline that featured the disintegration of the Rachel–Finn relationship, when commented on at all, was viewed unfavorably; VanDerWerff called it a [...] "stupid twist".|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching?, praised the {{decision}} to include a multiple-week mystery. He thought that spreading the case out allowed the episode {{to focus on the}} main story arc and Logan's subplot as well as allow the main mystery time to finish. He was also complimentary towards the Logan–Heather plotline, lauding Goglia's performance; he also stated that the episode gave him renewed interest in the Dean O'Dell case. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, rated the episode a 7.7 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He was highly critical of the subplot involving Logan and Heather, stating that it [...] "rode the line of insufferable". While opining that it had some good comedic moments, he thought {{that the majority of the}} subplot involved heavy use of clichés. However, he was more mixed to positive towards the case-of-the-week.

But Rachel's eye-on-the-prize, I'll-get-what-I-want attitude coupled with her inappropriate crush on the teacher just made her creepier than usual. Infiltrating his home, cooking and cleaning for him right under his crazy wife's nose. Come on, Berry, you're better than that..." [...] Raymund Flandez for The Wall Street Journal commented on the episode [...] "Preggers", [...] "Rachel has become insufferable. The disagreements with Mr. Schue about her own development as a bonafide triple-threat have branded her as an overbearing prima donna {{to the rest of}} Glee." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN agreed, [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> annoyed by Rachel".

Since, Swift {{has performed}} the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief. Swift's first televised performance of [...] "Change" [...] {{was at the}} 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, where she, donning a sparkly evening gown, sang on an elevator suspended from the crowd. She then came down, where she was joined by a teenage choir, and finished the performance by surfing the crowd. Swift performed [...] "Change" [...] on the first North American leg of the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a sparkly silver and black dress with black, leather boots. She noted, [...] "It's been a tough year", and commenced singing throughout the stage as images of victims of economic and natural disasters were projected on the video screens. As the song approximated, its last refrain, she said, [...] "Things turn back around." [...] Then, scenes of triumph appeared on the video screens. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter attended the May 22, 2009 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, [...] "It was overly simplistic and a bit naive, but still <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved."

500|$|In its DVD Reviews section, EWs Chris Nashawaty {{gave the}} film an A-minus, stating, [...] "Depp's soaring voice {{makes you wonder}} what other tricks he's been hiding...

[...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers awarded it 3½ out of 4 stars and added, [...] "Sweeney Todd is a thriller-diller from start to finish: scary, monstrously funny and melodically thrilling... is a bloody wonder, intimate and epic, horrific and heart-rending as it flies on the wings of Sondheim's most thunderously exciting score." [...] As with Time, the critic ranked it fifth on his list of the best movies of 2007. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The blood juxtaposed to the music is highly unsettling. It runs contrary to expectations. Burton pushes this gore into his audiences' faces so as to feel the madness and the destructive fury of Sweeney's obsession. Teaming with Depp, his long-time alter ego, Burton makes Sweeney a smoldering dark pit of fury and hate that consumes itself. With his sturdy acting and surprisingly good voice, Depp is a Sweeney Todd for the ages." [...] Harry Knowles gave the film a highly positive review, calling it Burton's best film since Ed Wood, his favorite Burton film, and said it was possibly superior. He praised all of the cast and the cinematography, but noted it would probably not appeal to non-musical fans due to the dominance of music in the film.|$|E

[...] She commented, [...] "It's so absurd, even Tom will laugh." [...] The Advertiser described Star Stories as [...] "a surprisingly funny sendup of movie stars and pop groups", and noted of the episode's title, [...] "This week's episode is titled Being Tom Cruise [...] - How Scientology isn't in Any Way Mental, which should give you some idea of the vein of humour mined." [...] The Sunday Times observed, [...] "Just when you thought you might go a week without seeing a mention of brand Beckham, here is a documentary on their best friends, brand Tom Cruise, as recorded by the least reverential writers and least convincing lookalikes on the planet. Scientologists might prefer something on the Sci-fi channel." [...] Victoria Segal, Sally Kinnes and Sarah Dempster of The Sunday Times highlighted the episode in their [...] "Critics' Choice" [...] column. They commented that the show's producers [...] " [...] their own account of his career, his love life and his religion: It's all about aliens. Comedy so broad it barely fits on the screen, it is <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amused". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun highlighted the program as his [...] "Top Choice". Adams commented, [...] "This ruthless but spot-on parody re-enacts Cruise's life and career through Hollywood gossip, rumour and exaggeration (his father is a midget, Katie Holmes a robot, Nicole Kidman a beer-swilling bogan), but is an antidote to every interview he's ever done." [...] Writing for The Newcastle Herald, Anita Beaumont commented, [...] "This is really silly stuff, but it is amusing enough to enliven a fairly dull night of TV." [...] The Sunday Mirror wrote that the program [...] "was as subtle as a sledge hammer". Simon Hoggart of The Spectator called the program [...] "a magnificently over-the-top anti-celebrity festival".|$|E

However, it's equally hard to criticise such a polished effort. On the one hand, it offers more of the great hack and slash gameplay that no one has emulated properly since the first Dark Alliance.

Despite high hopes, the album failed to meet commercial expectations, with only 50,000 copies sold in the U.S. It reached number 136 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album also earned mixed reviews from Erlewine, which stated that [...] "it's <b>hard</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disappointed", and Adrienne Day of Entertainment Weekly, which called the lyrics [...] "banal" [...] and the overall album as lacking [...] "punch".

[...] Nick Sylvester of Pitchfork also criticized the track, referring {{to it as a}} [...] "Queen pastiche [...] which has about as much club potential as a 13-year old with a milk moustache and his dad's ID".

He cited Peter Lorre in Mad Love (1935) as his main influence for the role.
