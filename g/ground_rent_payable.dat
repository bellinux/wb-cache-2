50|$|In England {{in recent}} years, some new homes and apartments {{have been sold}} by large housebuilders with a {{leasehold}} where the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> <b>payable</b> doubles every 10 to 25 years, with consequently a very high price to buy out the lease. This has caused some recently built homes to be extremely difficult to sell. In 2017 the British government launched a consultation on legal reforms to end such exploitative schemes.|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, a {{rentcharge}} is {{an annual}} sum {{paid by the}} owner of freehold land (terre-tenant) to {{the owner of the}} rentcharge (rentcharger), a person who need have no other legal interest in the land. They are often known as chief rents in the north west of England but the term <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is used {{in many parts of the}} country to refer to either a rentcharge or a <b>rent</b> <b>payable</b> on leasehold land. This is confusing as a true <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is a sum payable in relation to land held under a lease. As a result, it is important to know the status of the land for which, an annual sum is paid.|$|R

50|$|In Roman law, <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> (solarium) was {{an annual}} <b>rent</b> <b>payable</b> by the lessee of a superficies (a piece of land), or {{perpetual}} lease of building land.In early Norman England, tenants could lease their {{title to land}} so that the land-owning lords {{did not have any}} power over the sub-tenant to collect taxes. In 1290 King Edward I passed the Statute of Quia Emptores that prevented tenants from leasing their lands to others through subinfeudation. This created a system of substitution, where the tenant's full interest would be transferred to the purchaser or donee, who would pay a rentcharge. This system later passed into common law in England and was adopted by many nations which trace their legal heritage to Britain.|$|R

50|$|Local {{authorities}} were given powers {{to apply to}} the Rent Officer to consider whether a rent should be registered in respect of any regulated tenancy.

Amendment was made to the Housing Act 1988 to include these additional functions for Rent Officers. A Statutory instrument later established the required procedures. Local {{authorities were}} empowered to seek the advice of Rent Officers for information to facilitate the calculation of grant payable.

5000|$|As a legal term, <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> {{specifically}} {{refers to}} regular payments {{made by a}} holder of a leasehold property to the freeholder or a superior Leaseholder, as required under a lease. In this sense, a <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is created when a freehold piece of land is sold on a long lease or leases. The <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> provides an income for the landowner.

50|$|With {{regard to}} the former of these classes, it may be noticed that {{although}} apportioned <b>rent</b> becomes <b>payable</b> only when the whole rent is due, the landlord, {{in the case of}} the bankruptcy of an ordinary tenant, may prove for a proportionate part of the rent up to the date of the receiving order; and that a similar rule holds good in the winding up of a company; and further that the act of 1870 applies to the liability to pay, as well as to the right to receive, rent. Accordingly, where an assignment of a lease is made between two half-yearly rent-days, the assignee is not liable to pay the full amount of the half-year's rent falling due on the rent-day next after the date of the assignment, but only an apportioned part of that half-year's rent, computed from the last mentioned date. If you pay a <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> on a leasehold property or a rentcharge on a freehold property that is also payable on other neighbouring properties, you can apply to the Department for Communities and Local Government for an ‘order of apportionment’ that legally separates your share of the <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> or rentcharge.|$|R
5000|$|The State of Maryland {{maintains}} {{provisions for}} <b>ground</b> <b>rents,</b> {{primarily in the}} Baltimore area. The practice {{dates back to the}} seventeenth century, when lesserlords and serfs paid crops and livestock to feudal lords to rent the lord's land. With <b>ground</b> <b>rent,</b> homeowners only own the building itself, but they must pay a small amount to rent the land itself from its owner. Under Maryland law, if <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> is not paid on time, the ground owner can go to court and have a lien placed against the house, effectively seizing the home from the homeowner over a relatively small amount due, sometimes as little as $24. This occurred almost 4,000 times in Baltimore City from 2000 to 2005. In addition, properties with <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> are usually valued about $10,000 less than comparable properties without <b>ground</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|R

50|$|The final {{scheme was}} {{different}} {{in that the}} maximum difference between the <b>rent</b> <b>payable</b> and the eligible local housing allowance was restricted to £15. In addition in some pilot authorities, all tenants whose rent had been assessed according to reference rent rules were transferred to LHA, when the national scheme came in only those who made a new claim or moved went on to LHA.|$|R
50|$|Under an {{operating}} lease, the lessee records rent expense (debit) over the lease term, and {{a credit to}} either cash or <b>rent</b> <b>payable.</b> If {{an operating}} lease has scheduled changes in rent, normally the rent must be expensed on a straight-line basis over its life, with a deferred liability or asset reported on the balance sheet for the difference between expense and cash outlay.|$|R

50|$|The Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act 1958 {{prohibited}} {{the recovery of}} possession except by legal proceedings of certain dwelling houses released from control by Section 11(1) of the Rent Act 1957. It also suspended for a limited period the execution of any order made for possession for those still remaining in their homes on 1 August 1958, by postponing the effect of any earlier order for possession. lt regulated the <b>rent</b> <b>payable</b> pending recovery of possession (to twice the 1956 gross value, plus rates, and for services and furniture unless the contractual <b>rent</b> previously <b>payable</b> was higher). It made it an offence to recover possession other than by proceedings in court and to withhold services or furniture to which the tenant was entitled.|$|R
5000|$|In the Republic of Ireland <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> {{have been}} a feature of urban life. While most tenancy reform {{legislation}} has been enacted for agricultural land (see Irish Land Acts), urban occupiers / tenants {{have been a}}llowed to [...] "buy out" [...] their <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> from landlords, and so effectively change a long lease into a freehold interest, most recently under Acts of 1978 and 2005. Notably, <b>ground</b> <b>rents</b> in Castlebar, County Mayo have been withheld following the controversial disappearance of Lord Lucan in 1974.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{definition}} for <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> or absolute <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> originates from the 18th-century French school of political economy called the Physiocrats. They sought to bring logical analysis {{to bear on}} governmental questions. They arrived at the conclusion that [...] "ground rents" [...] should {{be the source of}} most or all taxes. They defined <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> as that portion of all rent which is attributable only to the size and location of the parcel. For instance, say you own a parcel of land. If everything you grew or built on that land burned [...] [...] [...] then you could still lease it out for its <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> (its locational value). The Physiocrats noted that the owner is in no way responsible for any increase in the [...] "locational" [...] value of his parcel. A particular location is only made more valuable because more people come to live around it. Since it is society as a whole which gives <b>ground</b> <b>rent</b> its value [...] [...] [...] they reasoned that society should regain part of that value in tax revenue.|$|R
