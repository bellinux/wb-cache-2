5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates {{had been}} the only National League team to <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> than the Dodgers in 1917, {{finishing}} last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner, Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in World War I for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard's baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the Gowanus Canal, and not a single submarine got into it.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a 2007 {{study showed that}} for {{identical}} resumes fewer replies were sent to men compared with women (it also showed that women <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> when they have children, while men <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> when they don't). A 2015 study showed that women were preferred {{by a factor of}} 2 for academic roles in STEM subjects.|$|E

50|$|The second season, 1979, was {{disrupted}} by a players' strike which forced McCreadie {{out of retirement}} for a time. The team <b>did</b> <b>worse</b> on the pitch, finishing last, and worse at the box office, with 7,137 a match, with three teams <b>doing</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|R

25|$|A study {{published}} in 2007, suggested that minocycline harms ALS patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. According to the researcher from Columbia University the effect {{does not seem to}} be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> than those on the low doses.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{differences}} in national ratings and standings {{have been noted}} between the HSI and indicators such as GDP per capita or the Human Development Index. Several small island countries plus Bhutan, Botswana, and some central-eastern European countries do considerably better in the HSI {{than they do in}} GDP per capita or HDI. Conversely, Greece and some Eurozone peers such as Ireland and Spain, several countries in the Gulf, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, the USA and Venezuela <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> in the HSI than in GDP per capita or HDI. Influential factors vary (as is viewed in the data and discussions on the HumanSecurityIndex.org Website), but include diversity and income equality, peacefulness, and governance.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a sudden}} you put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
500|$|Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said Cyrus' {{attempt to}} leave Hannah Montana was weak, only {{being driven by}} [...] "more gray thoughts". Ratliff continued, [...] "She eases up on songs with total-affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than Moms and Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again". Cinquemani finished, [...] "For teen-pop, your kid could <b>do</b> <b>worse.</b> You know, like Avril [...] ". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "If her lyrical prowess hasn't caught up to her voice yet, that should only hold promise of things to come. She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus, in Breakout, as the ideal of the American Dream: [...] "a combination of hard work, good Christian living and un-smutty pop".|$|E
2500|$|Like the Prisoner's Dilemma, {{this game}} {{presents}} {{a conflict between}} self-interest and mutual benefit. [...] If it could be enforced, both players would prefer that they both cooperate throughout the entire game. [...] However, a player's self-interest or players' distrust can interfere and create a situation where both <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> than if they had blindly cooperated. [...] Although the Prisoner's Dilemma has received substantial attention for this fact, the Centipede Game has received relatively less.|$|E

2500|$|Replicator {{dynamics}} is {{a simple}} model of strategy change commonly used in evolutionary game theory. [...] In this model, a strategy which does better than the average increases in frequency {{at the expense of}} strategies that <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> than the average. [...] There are two versions of the replicator dynamics. [...] In one version, there is a single population which plays against itself. [...] In another, there are two population models where each population only plays against the other population (and not against itself).|$|E
2500|$|This {{paper was}} the result of the {{above-mentioned}} work of Zhu and Cao, which Yau promoted in the Beijing conference. The New Yorker article concludes by linking the alleged actions of Yau with Perelman's withdrawal from the mathematical community, stating that Perelman claimed not to see [...] "what new contribution [...] did make"; that he had become disillusioned by the lax ethical standards of the community. As for Yau, Perelman is quoted saying, “I can’t say I’m outraged. Other people <b>do</b> <b>worse.</b> Of course, there are many mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who are not honest”.|$|E
2500|$|Benazir Bhutto was prime {{minister}} {{at a time}} of great racial tension in Pakistan. Her approval poll rose by 38% after she appeared and said in a private television interview after the elections: [...] "We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies; our voters were turned away." [...] The Conservatives attracted voters from religious society (MMA) whose support had collapsed. The Friday Times noted [...] "Both of them (Nawaz and Benazir) have done so badly in the past, {{it will be very difficult}} for them to <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> now. If Bhutto's government fails, everyone knows there will be no new elections. The army will take over". In confidential official documents Benazir Bhutto had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in 1993 elections, in context that she had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government. Her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called [...] "racism". Due to Benazir Bhutto's stubbornness and authoritative actions, her political rivals gave her the nickname [...] "Iron Lady" [...] of Pakistan. No response was issued by Bhutto, but she soon associated with the term.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Gibb, England's Schools {{minister}} says: [...] "We {{want all}} schools {{to consider the}} needs of their pupils to determine how technology can complement the foundations of good teaching and a rigorous curriculum, so that every pupil is able to achieve their potential." [...] Tom Bennett, the UK government's expert on pupil behaviour, said teachers had been [...] "dazzled" [...] by school computers. Andreas Schleicher, education director at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, urged schools to ensure that children gain a good grasp of reading, writing and mathematics, opining that school technology had raised [...] "too many false hopes (...) If you look at the best-performing education systems, such as those in East Asia, they've been very cautious about using technology in their classrooms," [...] (...) Those students who use tablets and computers very often tend to <b>do</b> <b>worse</b> than those who use them moderately.". In September 2015, a survey conducted by the OECD into the impact of heavy investments in digital technology within the classroom, showed that Pisa test results for reading, mathematics or science showed [...] "no noticeable improvement". In October 2015, a study by researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University and the Mathematica policy research group discovered that on-line pupils fell far behind counterparts who studied within the classroom. The National Study of Online Charter Schools found [...] "significantly weaker academic performance" [...] in maths and reading in 'virtual schools' when compared with the conventional school system.|$|E
