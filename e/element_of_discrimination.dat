40|$|Contemporary {{discrimination}} law is in crisis, both methodologically and conceptually. The judiciary’s favored heuristic for observing discrimination – a comparator who is {{like the}} discrimination claimant but for the protected characteristic – has nearly depleted discrimination jurisprudence and theory. The resulting deficit can be explained, in turn, by the comparator methodology’s profound mismatch with current understandings of identity discrimination and {{the realities of the}} modern workplace. Even in run-of-the-mill cases, comparators often cannot be found, particularly in today’s mobile, knowledge-based economy. This difficulty amplifies for complex claims, which rest on thicker understandings of discrimination developed in second-generation intersectionality, identity performance, and structural discrimination theories. By collapsing an observational heuristic into a defining <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> courts have largely foreclosed these theories from consideration, leaving the mismatch in place and sharpening the divide between theory and practice. At the same time, courts have further shrunk the very idea of discrimination by disregarding the lesson of harassment and stereotyping jurisprudence that discrimination can occur without a comparator present. The comparator methodology retains its appeal, despite these deficiencies, because its empirical patina enables courts to avoid making sociologically-oriented inquiries that stretch core judicial competencies. That is, the methodology permits courts to evaluate discrimination claims without appearing to engage in a subjective analysis of workplace dynamics. Given the complex nature of both identity and discrimination, however, these comparisons produce a false certainty at best. By contrast, alternate methodologies, including the contextual consideration favored in harassment and stereotyping jurisprudence as well as the hypothetical comparator embraced in European law, offer a meaningful framework for matching discrimination law and norms to workplace facts, while preserving judicial legitimacy. With comparators off of their methodological pedestal, we may yet recover space for the renewed development of discrimination jurisprudence and theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{subsection}} Asperae of genus Hydrangea L. (Hydrangeaceae) {{has been}} investigated for three reasons: several ambiguous classifications concerning Hydrangea aspera have been published, unexpected differences in genome size among seven accessions have been reported Cerbah et al. (Theor Appl Genet 103 : 45 - 51, 2001), and two atypical chromosome numbers (2 n = 30 for Hydrangea involucrata and 2 n = 34 for H. aspera) have been found when all other species of the genus present 2 n = 36. Therefore, these two species and four subspecies of Hydrangea in all 29 accessions were analyzed for their genome size, chromosome number, and karyotype features. This investigation includes flow cytometric measurements of nuclear DNA content and bases composition (GC%), fluorochrome banding for detection of GC- and AT-rich DNA regions, and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) for chromosome mapping of 5 S and 18 S- 5. 8 S- 26 S rDNA genes. In the H. aspera complex, the genome size ranged from 2. 98 (subsp. sargentiana) to 4. 67 pg/ 2 C (subsp. aspera), an exceptional intraspecific variation of 1. 57 -fold. The mean base composition was 40. 5 % GC.

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of enterprise bargaining in 1991, decentralised wage determination in Australia was generally expected to widen the gender wage gap (see Chapter 3). However, as discussed in Chapter 4, the research that underlies this expectation is typically based upon aggregated data and suffers {{from a number of}} deficiencies. In contrast, this dissertation utilises unit record data from the extensive 1995 Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (AWIRS 95) commissioned by the former Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business to test the hypothesis that enterprise bargaining has affected the gender wage gap in Australia. Whilst the passing of four years between 1991 and the time of data collection may not have allowed for the landmark industrial relations change to have worked itself through the labour market, a noteworthy and major feature of AWIRS 95 is that it identifies workers and workplaces operating under enterprise bargaining agreements, as well as containing a female/male split of the enterprise bargaining status (see Chapter 5). Along with hourly earnings data derived from AWIRS 95, a clear assessment can be made of gender wage gaps for employees under enterprise bargaining and those not employed under enterprise bargaining. The thesis uses OLS earnings regressions to identify the part of any gender wag gap that can be justified by the difference in measured characteristics between males and females, as well as identifying the part that remains unexplained (see Chapter 7). Given the potential that workplace characteristics can affect the integrity of OLS results, a random effects model is also used (see Chapter 8). Interestingly, the OLS and random effects results are virtually identical (see Chapter 9). It needs to be noted that the component of the gender wage gap that is unable to be justified by direct statistical reference to the regression model has been attributed to discrimination in the labour market. However, this is something of a misnomer as the unjustified component also captures the impact of: model misspecification, including excluded variables; mismeasurement; and errors of calculation. Every effort has been made to reduce these effects. Nevertheless, there may be an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the regression model utilised in this thesis that is not discernible through the observable and measurable variables (see Chapter 3). Results of analysis undertaken in this thesis indicate that the gender gap, as well as the unexplained component thereof, are larger for employee data associated with enterprise bargaining than is the case for workers not so employed. Even so, the result is not deemed to be statistically significant, as is further supported by extensive sensitivity testing (see Chapters 7 and 8). Further research is needed to support the posed hypothesis. Nevertheless, the thesis still provides a wide range of interesting outcomes in providing a greater understanding of an observable gender wage gap in Australia, as well as the associated and contributing characteristics of employees and employers. It is in this capacity that the research work recorded in this thesis provides a new level of knowledge and understanding, particularly given the thorough use made of recent microdata and the observed earnings effects of selected variables. As a consequence, the results of this thesis will form a solid foundation upon which further gender wage gap debate, policy formulation and labour economics research can stand...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} question “When is a bully not a bully?” through grounded theory using a purposive sample of volunteer {{participants who had}} been accused of workplace bullying. The aim {{of the study was to}} critically evaluate the lived experience and organisational implications of being accused of being a workplace bully, from the perspective of the (alleged) bully. The research did not set out to consider if an (alleged) bully had been guilty or innocent of the allegation put to them; it was considered that if this was deemed a criteria by the potential participant it may reduce engagement with the study. This study will contribute to the body of knowledge around the phenomenon of bullying and offers an insight into both research and further development of good organisational practice. Whilst the research on other parties involved in the issue and management of workplace bullying have developed, Einarsen (2014), Jenkins, Zapf, Winefield and Sarris (2012), Notelaers (2014) and Samnani and Singh (2012) express concern that research which explores and examines the perpetrator’s experience is scarce and needed as a priority in acknowledging the gap in current research and to develop a fuller understanding of the phenomena of workplace bullying. In a qualitative study with eight participants from a particularly difficult to access group, the researcher offers an early contribution to the current gap in literature, research and understanding of the perspective of the alleged workplace bully. Participants engaged in individual, confidential, unstructured interviews with the researcher and spoke candidly about their perceptions and the impact the accusation had on them. This was then analysed, evaluated and developed through a classical grounded theory approach to develop the theoretical model guilty until proven innocent. In discussing the participants’ concerns in this model, the research widened understanding and academic knowledge and narrowed the gap of information of the (alleged) bully’s perspective. In dealing with allegations, (alleged) workplace bullies identify with concerns of feeling bullied back, emotional reactions, self-coping mechanisms and managerial responsibility and action, from which the grounded theory guilty until proven innocent emerged. The main findings of the research emerged from the participant’s interviews; key highlights included being isolated by their organisations and subject to negative acts which would, in themselves be considered bullying behaviours. Participants then described how they would separate themselves from the organisation, despite feeling a sense of disconnected loyalty towards it. The structure of HR functions and the anti-bullying related policy had a significant influence on the negative treatment participant’s experienced, with a continual theme around the presumption the participant was guilty from the outset, by virtue of an allegation being raised. This perception was reinforced in the different way (alleged) bullies were supported and treated by their organisations from the claimants. The participants had been negatively affected by identifiable victim effect (Hamilton & Sherman, 1996), dispute-related claims (Einarsen, 1999; Keashly & Nowell, 2003) and the claimant being managed under a separate formal management procedure. The study also suggested that allegations of bullying could in themselves be a form of bullying and that there may be an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in this on the grounds of protected characteristics. The main recommendations consider the structure of HR functions and the need for a visible and accessible personnel element necessary to begin to balance the support available for all parties, including the alleged, the alleger, bystanders, witnesses, line managers, HR and investigation managers. Further research, which tests the grounded theory of guilty until proven innocent with larger samples will extend and develop this study and test some of the resolutions and solutions offered...|$|E

This trend represents an important <b>element</b> <b>of</b> novelty not only in demography, {{but also in the}} national socio-economic contest. In particular, the increasing presence of immigrants in the Italian labour market shows {{to be related to the}} persistence of relevant structural deficit in the local production system. The foreign component seems to be characterized by three particular aspects. The first refers to a high level of “over-skilled employment”, that results to be higher among foreigners than among natives. The second aspect deals with occupational segregation of immigrants workers, that has stressed the existing segmentation of local labour markets in the country. The third aspect is constituted by underemployment. These aspects are mainly based on gender, education and area of residence. Particularly, legal status (regular or irregular staying) and nationality are additional <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> to the access of migrants to the labour market and the type of occupation covered. Accordingly, based on the analysis of Istat data on labour forces (2010), this contribution aims to investigate the characteristics of the working insertion of immigrants in the different local segments of Italian labour market, focusing the attention on possible factors that distinguish various nationality of immigrants present across the national territory. Parallel, the research compares the situation of immigrants to that of Italians, in order to identify possible situations of underemployment, over-skilled employment and segregation. The main variables used for analysis are age, gender, area of origin, geographical area of residence, occupational condition, sector of activity, professional level, educational level, year of residence in Italy.

40|$|The {{principle}} of equality {{is the foundation of}} developing an entire system of human rights, and its implementation represents the standard of respecting each right individually. With these premises as a starting point, the subject of the author’s interests is whether the right to assisted reproduction, as a segment of reproductive rights, is regulated in conformity with the equality principal. In order to reach an answer, the author examines the concept of human assisted reproduction and analyzes the application of reproductive technologies in the light of legal, social and political reforms which affected marriages, the family and partnership in general {{at the end of the}} 20 th century. The author finds that the most significant ones among them are the emancipation of women, recognition and legal formation of same sex unions and statements prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Furthermore, by considering the right to assisted reproduction in the context of other human rights with which it is interconnected and interdependent (the right to life, right to privacy, the right to a family life, health rights, children’s rights), the author finds there are no absolute, unlimited rights in the contemporary system of human rights, but that they inevitably have certain restrictions. Since the same limitation attribute also characterizes the right to assisted reproduction, the author further researches whether there is discrimination, positive or negative, towards the existing forms of limitations to this right. The following forms of limitations have been singled out, as the key ones for this analysis: request for (non) marital status and heterosexual orientation, sexual affiliation and age and the accessibility (prohibition) of applying certain methods of assisted reproduction which are primarily in the function of eliminating female sterility. The author concludes that there are <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on family status, sexual orientation, age and sexual affiliation. The author finds that emphasizing the need to protect the best interests of children, as a crucial reason for justifying their introduction, can hardly be defended both legally and ethically. The author believes that the basis of limitation lies in the reasons of social suitability, namely buying social peace at the present level of development of social conscience. By appealing to the principal of equality, the author intercedes in favor of accessibility to the right for assisted reproduction under equal conditions and limitations for each user, and prohibiting discrimination on any basis...|$|R

I first give an overview of the research of immigrant- and minority business in sociology. I present those factors which place an emphasis on the characteristics and resources among ethnic groups. Thereafter I focus on the structural factors, which can encourage persons from a minority background to become self-employed. My own perspective places an emphasis on social relations when trying to understand the mechanisms which influences a person with an immigrant background to become self-employed. In relation to this, ethnicity defined in a relational context is particularly emphasized. I also examine if self-employment is a solution to the problems of segregation among the foreign born in Sweden. I have chosen to study persons with an Iranian, Kurdish and Chilean background who start and run their own businesses. One important result in this investigation {{is that many of the}} persons from all three groups have a common experience <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> and exclusion in the Swedish labor market and in society at large. There are some individuals who became self-employed to bring a business concept into reality, i. e. in this sense they are entrepreneurs. But even in these cases there were <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> features <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> that motivated them to become self-employed. Another finding is that especially persons with a Kurdish background often make use of their ethnic or social network when they start and run their own businesses. Many of the self-employed in this study are well educated, but often participate in business activities that do not require so many qualifications. They are in some respects economically integrated, but the question remains whether or not the ethnic segregation still exists...|$|R

40|$|Sigma (σ) {{factors are}} {{bacterial}} transcription initiation factorsthat direct transcription at cognate promoters. The promotersrecognized by primary σ {{are composed of}} − 10 and − 35 consensus elements separated by a spacer of 17 +− 1 bp for optimalactivity. However, how the optimal promoter spacing is sensed bythe primary σ remains unclear. In the present study, we examinedthis issue using a transcriptionally active Bacillus subtilis Nterminallytruncated σA (SND 100 -σA). The results of the presentstudy demonstrate that SND 100 -σA binds specifically to boththe − 10 and − 35 <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the trnS spacing variants, ofwhich the spacer lengths range from 14 to 21 bp, indicatingthat simultaneous and specific recognition of promoter − 10 and − 35 elements is insufficient for primary σ to discern theoptimal promoter spacing. Moreover, shortening in length of theflexible linker between the two promoter DNA-binding domainsof σA also does not enable SND 100 -σA to sense the optimalpromoter spacing. Efficient recognition of optimal promoterspacing by SND 100 -σA requires core RNAP (RNA polymerase) which reduces the flexibility of simultaneous and specific bindingof SND 100 -σA to both promoter − 10 and − 35 <b>elements.</b> Thusthe <b>discrimination</b> <b>of</b> optimal promoter spacing by σ is coredependent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} system for social cash {{transfers}} in Namibia, a middle-income country with a long experience in making available a universal and non-contributory old age pension, child grants using means-testing and quasi-conditionalities and other cash transfers. The paper traces {{the origins of the}} cash transfers back to the country’s past annexation into apartheid South Africa and shows how Namibia’s system is now faced with a set of distinct challenges that are particularly pertinent as the authorities are rapidly scaling-up access. Notably, in the years after the remaining <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination</b> were eliminated, and the value of the transfers were equalised across the ethnic groups, new discrepancies have developed in the values of the different grants. Moreover, using newly available household data the paper finds inefficiencies in the means-testing for the child grants – especially when compared to South Africa. In spite of these challenges the paper also shows that social cash transfers have a large effect on poverty reduction and that the effects are particularly positive for the poorest of the poor. The transfers also tend to reduce inequality but this impact is more limited. Simulations indicate the fiscal sustainability of an expanded system of social cash transfers and highlight the potential cost-savings that would accrue from a more effective means-test of the child grants. In the analysis the effects of using income and expenditure data {{as the basis for the}} welfare variable are discerned.
