5|$|As often {{happened}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era,</b> {{the colour}} master tapes of The Year of the Sex Olympics were wiped {{some time after}} broadcast and the play was believed lost until the 1980s when {{a black and white}} telerecording was discovered.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional attraction for music fans, and {{was followed by}} the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. LSD, a hallucinogenic drug, was widely used in the college music scene <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era.</b> Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.|$|E

Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1950s, new car {{introductions}} in {{the fall}} once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> before the popularization of computerization, {{the primary source of}} information on new models was the dealer. The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The 1869 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the earliest {{season in the}} Atlantic hurricane database in which {{there were at least}} ten tropical cyclones. Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era,</b> due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. All activity occurred in a three-month period between the middle of August and early October.|$|E
5|$|The 1921 Grey Cup {{victory was}} their last until 1933, {{at which point}} the Argonauts became the {{dominant}} team of an increasingly nationwide sport. They put together a number of Grey Cup dynasties in the 1930s and 1940s, winning eight of twenty Grey Cups between 1933 and 1952. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were most often {{on the receiving end of}} Argo Grey Cup victories <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era.</b> From 1933 to 1941 Lew Hayman coached the team with a still unparalleled winning ratio of 45–15–2. Their first back-to-back Grey Cups came in 1937 and 1938. This was also the era of the famed Stukus brothers—Annis, Bill, and Frank—who proved a potent all-purpose trio in the Argonauts' championship years.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations {{has been seen}} as creating the system of clans in the Highlands <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era.</b> Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, {{there was a lack of}} major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} of Redemption is French crusader Christof Romuald, a once-proud, religious church knight who {{is transformed into}} a Brujah vampire. With his religious faith destroyed, Christof is forced to reassess his understanding of good and evil as he acclimates to his new life. Christof's anchor to humanity is the nun Anezka, a human with a pure soul who loves Chrisof even after his transformation. As a member of the Brujah under Ecaterina the Wise, Christof allies with Wilhem Streicher, the Gangrel Erik, and the Cappadocian Serena during his journeys through 12th century Prague. Other characters <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era</b> include the slaver Count Orsi, the Tremere Etrius, and the Ventrue Prince Brandl.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Scleractinia is particularly challenging. Many species were described {{before the advent}} of scuba diving, with little realisation by the authors that coral species could have varying morphologies in different habitats. Collectors were mostly limited to observing corals on reef flats, and were unable to observe the changes in morphology that occurred in more turbid, deeper-water conditions. More than 2,000 nominal species were described <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>era,</b> and by the rules of nomenclature, the name given to the first described species has precedence over the rest, even when that description is poor, and the environment and even sometimes the country of the type specimen is unknown.|$|E
