Depending on how many times investors short sold a share {{in a period of}} 48 hours after a <b>dividend</b> <b>disbursement,</b> tax refunds were erroneously paid out up to four or five times for that single short-sell transaction. Eichel's ministry took no corrective action in response, and from that time forward, gradually larger and larger amounts of forfeited tax revenue resulted.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} in the literature that privatization program has positive impact to the country’s productivity and competitiveness. At micro level, empirical analyses both in Malaysian and Jordan have shown the significant contribution of privatization program on firms’ profitability, productivity and better leverage. Generally, privatization leads to better profitability which theoreti-cally should provide higher return to shareholders in terms of dividend as well as higher contribution to stakeholders in terms of zakat to the asnaf (zakat recipients including the poor and needy). Howev-er, studies on privatization impact towards zakat and dividend payment are almost absent. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the effect of privatization on zakat and <b>dividend</b> <b>disbursement.</b> This paper focuses on two developing nations namely Malaysia and Jordan. The sample size of this analy-sis includes 17 Malaysia Government Link Corporations (Top GLC 20 companies) and 23 Jordan State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The duration {{of the study is}} eleven (11) years from 2003 to 2013. The data were collected from Bloomberg, Amman Stock Exchange and Bursa Malaysia. Using statis-tical models and Wilcoxon signed rank test, the results show that privatization has contributed to higher payment in terms of dividend to shareholders in both countries. In addition, zakat paid by Ma-laysian GLCs is steadily increasing and significant. The findings also indicate that global financial crisis 2007 - 2008 has no impact on corporate zakat payable in Malaysia, while dividend growth is slow during this period. The paper then provides discussion on few pertinent issues and finally sug-gests the need for new tax and zakat Law in Jordan as well as improvement in current zakat account-ing practices in Malaysia.
