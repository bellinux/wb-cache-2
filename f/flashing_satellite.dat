40|$|In this study, we analyse the {{sensitivity}} of nadir viewing satellite observations in the visible range to freshly produced lightning NO x, i. e. for meteorological and (photo-) chemical conditions found in and around cumulonimbus clouds. For the first time, such a study is performed accounting for photo-chemistry, dynamics, and radiative transfer in a consistent way: A one week episode in the TOGA COARE/CEPEX region (Pacific) in December 1992 is simulated with a 3 -D cloud resolving chemistry model. The simulated hydrometeor mixing ratios are fed into a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model to calculate box-Air Mass Factors (box-AMFs) for NO 2. From these box-AMFs, together with model NO x profiles, slant columns of NO 2 (S NO 2), i. e. synthetic satellite measurements, are calculated and set {{in relation to the}} actual model NO x vertical column (V NO x), yielding the "sensitivity" S NO 2 /V NO x. From this study, we find a mean sensitivity of 0. 46. NO x below the cloud bottom is mostly present as NO 2, but shielded from the satellites' view, whereas NO x at the cloud top or above is shifted to NO due to high photolysis and low temperature, and hence not detectable from space. But a significant fraction of the lightning produced NO x in the middle part of the cloud is present as NO 2 and has a good visibility from space. Due to the resulting total sensitivity being quite high, nadir viewing satellites provide a valuable additional platform to quantify NO x production by lightning; strong lightning events over "clean" regions should be clearly detectable in satellite observations. Since the observed enhancement of NO 2 column densities over mesoscale convective systems are lower than expected for current estimates of NO x production per <b>flash,</b> <b>satellite</b> measurements can in particular constrain the upper bound of lightning NO x production estimates...|$|R
40|$|The photo-meson {{production}} of pions by shock-accelerated protons could generate {{a burst of}} ~ 10 ^ 14 eV neutrinos from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observable in the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) or its larger successors. Measurement of this flux can test the hypothesis that GRBs are {{the sources of the}} highest-energy cosmic rays, and GRB neutrinos could permit high-precision experiments in neutrino limiting speed, neutrino oscillations, and the weak equivalence principle. Neutrino emission can be expected primarily during the prompt gamma-ray <b>flash</b> and <b>satellite</b> coincidence provides a well-defined window in position and time that can be searched for an excess of upgoing muon events in AMANDA from bursts in the Northern Hemisphere. Using an event quality analysis to further reduce background in a sample of 78 GRBs from the 1997 AMANDA-B 10 data set, I find a fluence limit of (E_nu) ^ 2 (dN_nu) /(dE_nu) < 3. 8 * 10 ^- 4 min(1,E_nu/E_break) [TeV cm^- 2] per average burst, which is orders of magnitude more stringent than in similar previous searches.

40|$|Abstract. Space borne {{high-capacity}} {{solid state}} recorder (SSR) is an inevitable chain {{of the space}} scientific data acquirement system. It has become a common device in spacecraft gradually. This paper presents the design and accomplishment of the large capacity SSR design based on NAND <b>flash</b> of the <b>satellite</b> SJ- 10. The SSR improves its writing speed significantly by applying multi-pipeline writing technique. External SDRAM is used as the channel cache of the multi-channel data flows to increase the cache capacity and system throughput speed. In addition, the EDAC processing, data flow combining and separating can enhance {{the stability of the}} storage system as well as the data efficiently. The implementing of multi-channel has also laid the foundation for file system management of the space borne storage data. The simulation of multi-channel data flow is given in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Flash floods {{are among}} the most devastating natural weather hazards in the United States, causing an average of more than 225 deaths and $ 4 billion in {{property}} damage annually. As a result, prediction of flash floods in an accurate and timely fashion {{is one of the most}} important challenges in weather prediction. Data from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites are significant sources of information for the diagnosis and prediction of heavy precipitation and <b>flash</b> floods. Geostationary <b>satellites</b> are especially important for their unique ability simultaneously to observe the atmosphere and its cloud cover from the global scale down to the storm scale at high resolution in both time (every 15 min) and space (1 – 4 km). This capability makes geostationary satellite data ideally suited for estimating and predicting heavy precipitation, especially during flash-flood events.

40|$|The {{error in}} {{satellite}} precipitation-driven complex terrain flood simulations is characterized {{in this study}} for eight different global satellite products and 128 flood events over the Eastern Italian Alps. The flood events are grouped according to two flood types: rain floods and <b>flash</b> floods. The <b>satellite</b> precipitation products and runoff simulations are evaluated based on systematic and random error metrics applied on the matched event pairs and basin-scale event properties (i. e., rainfall and runoff cumulative depth and time series shape). Overall, error characteristics exhibit dependency on the flood type. Generally, timing of the event precipitation mass center and dispersion of the time series derived from satellite precipitation exhibits good agreement with the reference; the cumulative depth is mostly underestimated. The study shows a dampening effect in both systematic and random error components of the satellite-driven hydrograph relative to the satellite-retrieved hyetograph. The systematic error in shape of the time series shows a significant dampening effect. The random error dampening effect is less pronounced for the flash flood events and the rain flood events with a high runoff coefficient. This event-based analysis of the satellite precipitation error propagation in flood modeling sheds light on the application of satellite precipitation in mountain flood hydrology...|$|R

40|$|The {{discover}} of Ultra High Energy Neutrino of astrophysical nature may be already reached. Indeed {{upward and}} horizontal tau Air-showers {{emerging from the}} Earth crust or mountain chains offer {{the best and most}} powerful signal of Ultra High Energy UHE neutrinos nu_tau, barν_tau and barν_e at PeV and higher energy. The multiplicity in tau Air-showers secondary particles,N_opt = 10 ^ 12, (E_tau/ PeV, N_γ= 10 ^ 8 E_tau/ PeV, N_e^- e^+= 2 10 ^ 7 E_tau/PeV, N_mu = 3 10 ^ 5 (E_tau/PeV) ^ 0. 85, make easy its over-amplified discover. Indeed UHE nu_tau, following Super Kamiokande evidence of neutrino flavour mixing, should be as abundant as nu_mu. Also anti-neutrino electrons, barν_e, near the Glashow W resonance peak, E_ν̅_̅e̅ = M^ 2 _W / 2 m_e, may generate tau Air-showers. Such horizontal tau air-showers by nu_τ-N and UHE barν_e-e at PeVs emerging from mountain high chain {{is one of the most}} power-full UHE neutrino imprint. Upward UHE nu_τ- N interaction on Earth crust at horizontal edge and from below, their consequent UHE tau air-showers beaming toward high mountains should flash gamma,mu,X and Cherenkov lights toward detectors located on the top of the mountains or on balloons. Such upward tau air-shower may hit also nearby <b>satellite</b> <b>flashing</b> them by short, hard, diluted gamma-burst at the edge of most sensitive Gamma Ray Observatory BATSE threshold.
