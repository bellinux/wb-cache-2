50|$|The {{importance}} of <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> {{is how it}} affects the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). If the symbol duration is long enough compared to the <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> (typically 10 times as big would be good enough), one can expect an equivalent ISI-free channel. The correspondence with the frequency domain {{is the notion of}} coherence bandwidth (CB), which is the bandwidth over which the channel can be assumed flat. Coherence bandwidth is related to the inverse of the <b>delay</b> <b>spread.</b> The shorter the <b>delay</b> <b>spread,</b> the larger is the coherence bandwidth. <b>Delay</b> <b>spread</b> has a significant impact on Intersymbol interference.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, the <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{multipath}} richness of a communications channel.In general, it can be interpreted as the difference between the time of arrival of the earliest significant multipath component (typically the line-of-sight component) and the time of arrival of the latest multipath components.The <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> is mostly used in the characterization of wireless channels, but it also applies to any other multipath channel (e.g. multipath in optical fibers).|$|E

50|$|The idea {{works because}} less power is wasted in {{overcoming}} penetration and shadowing losses, and because a line-of-sight channel is present more frequently, leading to reduced fade depths and reduced <b>delay</b> <b>spread.</b>|$|E

50|$|If the <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> D over a {{particular}} cellular communication path {{in an urban}} environment is 1.9 µs, then using equation above, the coherence bandwidth is approximately 0.53 MHz, which results in frequency selective fading over the IS-95 bandwidth.|$|E
30|$|From the tables, we {{can observe}} that the <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> from the {{metropolitan}} street scenario are more dispersive {{than those from}} the crossroad scenario because {{a great amount of}} diffused optical rays due to the interference objects produce NLOS delay taps with more dispersive delays. In addition, the V 2 I cases in both scenarios show more dispersive <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> than the V 2 V cases. This is because there are strong LOS optical ray components caused by the LED headlamp in the V 2 V cases.|$|R

We show that data rates of 20 Mbps at Bit Error Rates (BER) 10 Γ 4 are possible with rms <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> up to 25 ns using a simple limiter-discriminator-integrator receiver and a (6, 4) Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). In environments with larger rms <b>delay</b> <b>spreads,</b> coherent detection {{is required for the}} same performance. We introduce a DFE structure which compensates for both modulator and channel ISI, and yet requires no power-intensive multiplication operations in the feedback section. An (8, 8) DFE with 2 -level switched (selection) diversity is shown to allow 20 Mbps data transfer at BER 10 Γ 4 for rms <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> under 150 ns, with cochannel interference.

50|$|When several {{separate}} paths from transmitter to receiver exist, {{a condition}} known as multipath, they almost never have {{exactly the same}} length so they almost never exhibit the same propagation delay.

50|$|<b>Delay</b> <b>spread</b> is {{inversely}} proportional to its frequency-domain counterpart, coherence bandwidth. This is the frequency range over which the channel gain is relatively constant. This is because summing two or more paths with different delays creates a comb filter even when the individual paths have a flat frequency response.|$|E

In this paper, we {{investigate the feedback}} requirements for adaptive pilot patterns applied in Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems. The main goal is to support {{a wide range of}} Doppler spreads and Root Mean Square (RMS) <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> while keeping the number of allowed pilot patterns at a minimum. Based on our simulation results, we show that only four bits of additional wide-band feedback per user are required in order to optimally support RMS <b>delay</b> <b>spreads</b> up to 800 ns and Doppler frequencies up to 1200 Hz.

50|$|A {{distributed}} antenna system can be implemented using passive splitters and feeders, or active-repeater amplifiers can be included to overcome the feeder losses. In systems where equalization is applied, it may be desirable to introduce delays between the antenna elements.

50|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between these}} profiles stands between robustness, resistance {{in regards to}} propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (<b>delay</b> <b>spread).</b>|$|E
5000|$|With {{appropriate}} parameter selection, MFSK {{can tolerate}} significant Doppler or delay spreads, especially when augmented with forward error correction. (Mitigating {{large amounts of}} Doppler and <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> is significantly more challenging, {{but it is still}} possible). A long <b>delay</b> <b>spread</b> with little Doppler spreading can be mitigated with a relatively long MFSK symbol period to allow the channel to [...] "settle down" [...] quickly at the start of each new symbol.Because a long symbol contains more energy than a short one for a given transmitter power, the detector can more easily attain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resultant throughput reduction can be partly compensated with a large tone set so that each symbol represents several data bits; a long symbol interval allows these tones to be packed more closely in frequency while maintaining orthogonality. This is limited by the exponential growth of tone set size with the number of data bits/symbol.|$|E
