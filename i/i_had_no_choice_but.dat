5|$|Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, {{and in all}} but a few minor skirmishes, the {{experienced}} Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to fight a war that even the Swabian counts considered to be more {{in the interests of the}} powerful Habsburgs than in the interest of the Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, king Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499 in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to make my own}} beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here. People are growing out of that old mentality. Rapping about gangs ain’t really what it’s about out here now. Everybody is having fun." [...] In the same interview, Legacy said, [...] "I think music like ours is coming from people being tired of ...|$|E

[...] noon sermons were broadcast throughout the nation via radio and caused violence and terror in many locations. People killed a few Bahá’ís here and there. Falsafi justified these acts by saying that they increased the Shah’s prestige. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to order him, in my own rash way, to refrain from giving further speeches until order was reestablished." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following WWF's annual SummerSlam event, Warrior {{was handed}} a letter dated August 26, 1991, from Vince McMahon, saying Warrior was {{suspended}} effective immediately. Among other things, McMahon said, [...] "You threatened {{to stay at}} home thereby not even appearing at Titan's major summer pay-per-view event SummerSlam. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to accede to your exorbitant demands. This was a serious mistake on your part". McMahon later testified that the only reason the company agreed to the contract was to [...] "acquiesce to his demands temporarily" [...] to ensure Warrior would perform at the SummerSlam event.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{saw myself}} as a strong woman who had come there because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> a concept that {{is also part of}} the crime of trafficking, because that is what you are made to believe when you enter the circuit.|$|R

60|$|On {{the present}} occasion, {{it was the}} old story over again. My sisters had done their best to stop it, and had failed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to appear on the}} scene--to begin, perhaps, by boxing her ears: to end, certainly, by filling her pockets.|$|E

60|$|As for Lucy, she hastened away, {{as soon as}} she had induced me {{to accept}} the box; and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to place all the pearls together, and put them in Grace's room, as my sister had desired me to do with her own {{property}} before proceeding on her walk.|$|E

60|$|I {{was in this}} {{frame of}} mind when the captain {{proposed}} that we should land upon the island.

60|$|If I {{had been}} free {{to act on}} my own impulse, I should {{certainly}} (out of regard for Mr. Engelman) have refrained from accompanying the visitors when they were shown over the house.

60|$|Having bound {{myself by}} this sacred engagement, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> {{to accept the}} {{sacrifice}} which it imperatively exacted from me.

60|$|I {{was still}} kneeling, when I felt myself seized from behind. I {{struggled}} to my feet, and confronted the gamekeeper.

Appearances were plainly against me; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> <b>but</b> to accompany the gamekeeper to the nearest magistrate.|$|E

60|$|However, he took {{thought for}} my predicament. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice,</b> he said, {{but to give}} way.
