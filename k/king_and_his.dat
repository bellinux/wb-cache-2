5|$|Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's older sister, {{had earlier}} been {{recalled}} from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French <b>king</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance; soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity {{of one or}} both of Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The <b>King</b> <b>and</b> <b>His</b> Court, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either child, as he did his son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E

5|$|A new {{civil war}} broke out when Duke Béla claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons {{accepted}} the rule of Solomon, Andrew I's son, in 1063.
