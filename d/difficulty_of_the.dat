5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first game {{to be part of}} the franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted artificial intelligence (AI) into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E
5|$|DotA {{offers a}} variety of game modes, {{selected}} by the game host {{at the beginning of the}} match. The game modes dictate the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenario, as well as whether players can choose their hero or are assigned one randomly. Many game modes can be combined, allowing more flexible options.|$|E
5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E

5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} assumes control of American forces and must {{eliminate}} all Japanese forces around the atoll by air or naval combat. The Battle For Midway received largely negative reviews upon release. It was criticised for its incompatibility {{with black and}} white television sets, as the game was only accessible in a limited range of colours. The easy <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gameplay was also criticised.|$|E
5|$|Most {{versions}} of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general problem in various models of computation.|$|E

5|$|The lengthy {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb {{in the middle}} of it, but no KOM points were on offer. The course was technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, except that the finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E
5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was raised {{with the aim of}} creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created to evoke the game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition, several stages of {{preparation}} are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills and the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw {{can be used to}} determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|Given the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task {{of educating}} his brother while earning a living, Jacques-Joseph {{decided to send}} his younger brother to the well-regarded school of the Abbé Dussert in November 1802, where Champollion would stay until the summer of 1804. During this period, his gift for {{languages}} first became evident: he started out learning Latin and Greek, but quickly progressed to Hebrew and other Semitic languages such as Arabic, Syriac and Chaldean. It was while a student here that he took up interest in Ancient Egypt, likely encouraged in this direction by Dussert and his brother, both orientalists.|$|E

5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E
5|$|Link also enters {{this mode}} when {{attacked}} by wandering monsters. Whenever the player traverses the various environments of Hyrule, enemy silhouettes appear and pursue him. Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health. This separate method of traveling and entering combat {{is one of many}} aspects adapted from the role-playing video game genre. Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map will automatically switch the game to a side-scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup.|$|E
5|$|Morgan's {{department}} always faced financial {{struggles in}} an era before much federal research funding was available. To raise funds, Morgan provided food service educational courses to teachers, nurses and other participants. These classes ultimately weakened the department's reputation at the university, as school officials viewed the training as vocational and considered it to be beneath {{the standards of the}} university. Because of this, Morgan was prohibited from accepting industry funding for research and the university provided her with very little space to conduct her research work. Adding to the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation was the fact that university officials had previously criticized Morgan for maintaining academic standards that were too high for a home economics program.|$|E

5|$|The {{computational}} <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clique {{problem has}} led {{it to be}} used to prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.|$|E
5|$|The on-disc soundtrack {{contains}} 93 mixes, each featuring {{one or two}} songs. These {{are arranged}} across 24 setlists, ordered roughly by <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mix, with more difficult mixes appearing later in the game. To access later tiers, the player must earn a pre-set number of stars on previous mixes at any difficulty. All mixes are immediately available {{to play in the}} Quickplay and competitive modes. The table below lists the mixes in the game, including the two songs that contribute to their mix as well as their individual artists; the mix artist that created the mix; whether the song is playable in the game's DJ vs Guitar mode; and the career tier in which the song is located.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the award}} system from Corruption was {{incorporated}} into the first two games. Players earn credits by accomplishing certain tasks, allowing them to unlock in-game items such as artwork, music, a screenshot feature, decorative items for Samus' ship in Corruption and the Fusion Suit in Prime, in which the latter was previously unlocked by connecting the Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion to the game. Credits could also be shared with registered Wii friends, who also {{have a copy of}} Trilogy, via WiiConnect24 which used the Wii's own 16-digit number as opposed to a separate Friend Code. Save files from the original version of Corruption cannot be transferred to the Trilogy version due to changes made to the source code. Trilogy also features the multiplayer mode from Echoes, but is limited to a local four-player game and does not feature online play, which is faithful to the original. In response to complaints from players and critics about Echoess high difficulty during some of the boss battles, the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encounters was lowered.|$|E
