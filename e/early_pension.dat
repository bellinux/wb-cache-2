40|$|Brazil {{is one of}} {{thirteen}} {{countries in the world}} whose social insurance system offers a pension based solely upon length of contribution, with no age requirement. This kind of benefit allows contributors to have access to pensions at relatively young ages (here defined as before 60 years old for men and 55 years old for women). The Brazilian legislation does not prevent pensioners from continuing to work and therefore it does not necessarily produce any impacts on labour market participation and productivity. However, what is the real impact of <b>early</b> access to <b>pensions</b> on the labour market? Does the economy lose in production and/or productivity when people have such <b>early</b> access to <b>pensions?</b> Based on data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics' National Household Sample Survey (Pnad), the authors apply a logistic model to measure if (and how much) <b>early</b> access to <b>pensions</b> decreases the probability of beneficiaries continuing to work. They also deploy two other strategies (Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of wage differentials and propensity score weighting) to evaluate whether there is a decrease in productivity among pensioners that continue to work.

50|$|The National Pension Scheme is {{the public}} pension scheme created in 1988 in South Korea. It {{is a part of}} Korea's Social Security Programs, and was {{established}} through the National Pension Act in 1986. In order for a person to qualify for pension, they must be at least 61 years old with at least ten years of contributions. Reduced <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> can be obtained at the age of 56.

The National Pension Scheme was created with a strong redistributive element and participation is mandated by law. Currently, only 29% of elderly received old-age pensions from the National Pension Scheme in 2013. One of the current issues with the National Pension Scheme is that not all retirees will be able to draw benefits from the pension because they have no completed the ten year contribution requirement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} effective pension age in Russia {{and in particular the}} role of special privileged early retirement programs in enlarging the number of pensioners in recent decades. When it is possible to receive a pension and continue to work, people often choose to draw the pension at the earliest possible age and continue to work as before. Binary logistic regression demonstrates that availability of pension benefits and disability status contributed significantly to the drop in employment of people at the ages below the normal pension age. Thus, while early retirement schemes do need to eliminate the right of getting earnings while drawing pensions, {{it should be possible to}} keep this option for people at the standard age.

40|$|In 1981 Chile shifted {{its social}} {{security}} system from a defined benefit to an actuarially fair defined contribution scheme, exempted all pensioners and non-pensioners over 65 (60 for women) from the payroll tax, tightened early retirement eligibility and eliminated the implicit tax on own-pensions of widows.

Using a retrospective data set of new and old system affiliates we ask whether work propensities increased for new-system members aged 50 - 70 and which rule changes had the greatest impact. We find large effects: Work probabilities were much higher among new-system affiliates, especially pensioners under 60 / 65 and non-pensioners over 60 / 65, who were exempt from the payroll tax in the new system but not the old. Aggregate work probabilities further increased as the proportion of non-pensioners rose due to tighter <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> rules, which made eligibility contingent on actuarially-determined replacement rates.

40|$|In 2011 a {{comprehensive}} {{reform of the}} Norwegian public pension system was implemented. A key feature of the new pension scheme is the decoupling {{of the decision to}} retire from the labour force and the decision to claim old age pension benefits. Agents eligible for <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> take-up can claim pension benefits in the age range 62 - 75, regardless of whether they retire from the labour force or not. When a potential claimant delays pension take-up by, say, a year, she forgoes pension benefits this year - but annual pension benefits {{for the rest of her}} life are increased. The decision to delay claiming can therefore be thought of as buying an annuity. Actuarial neutrality of a pension scheme requires that the expected value of future benefits is the same regardless of the timing of the pension take-up. In Norway, pensions are actuarially adjusted based on average longevity measures specific to each birth cohort. Since individual expected longevities may differ from the average longevity of a birth cohort, there is a potential scope for adverse selection. Individuals with lower than average expected longevity may increase their expected lifetime income by claiming as early as possible, while individuals with higher than average expected longevity may increase their expected lifetime income by delaying the pension take-up. When the pension scheme was implemented in 2011, all four combinations of retirement and claiming turned out to be rather common. Brinch et al. (2013) find some positive correlation between retirement and the claiming of pension benefits, but the relationship is far from perfect. In particular, the authors find that claiming is strongly associated with predictors of expected longevity. Individuals who retire without claiming pension benefits must rely on previous savings or some income stream to finance current consumption. Being in a couple may facilitate this option if agents can rely on the partners' income while delaying the pension take-up. This thesis investigates whether empirical evidence suggests that couples coordinate on claiming pension benefits. This thesis relates to two strands of the economic literature: the demand for annuities and economic models of household behaviour. There is no consensus among economists on the determinants of annuity demand, nor on the extent to which the household cooperates and pool their resources. The theoretical parts of the thesis investigate both issues thoroughly. The starting point for the empirical investigation of couples' take-up decisions are all Norwegian citizens who were born in 1949, members of a couple and eligible for <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> take-up in 2011. For these individuals I have data on annual incomes (2010 and 2011), wealth (2010), partner's income (2010) and pension take-up. I also have data on the relative money's worth (RMW) of delaying pension take-up from age 62 to 67. In their study of adverse selection in the Norwegian pension scheme, Brinch et al. (2013) estimate a mortality model and simulate the life span of each individual in the 1949 -cohort. The authors use the expected longevity to calculate the RMW of delaying pension take-up for each individual who was eligible for <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> take-up in 2011. The RMW is defined as the lifetime expected benefits conditional on claiming at age 67 in terms of expected benefits conditional on claiming at age 62. All regressions are done in Stata. The first empirical strategy is to investigate the decision to retire without claiming pension benefits. First, I estimate a linear probability model where the dependent variable is a dummy variable taking the value 1 if the individual retired without claiming pension benefits. I use own income and wealth, partner's income and the RMW of delaying pension take-up as regressors. The only significant regressor is a dummy variable indicating whether the individual is in the upper quartile of the income distribution in the sample. Importantly, wealth, partner's income and the RMW of delaying pension take-up are not significant. In the second step, I exclude individuals who did not retire from the sample, and use the same regressors to estimate the probability of not claiming pension benefits. Three regressors are significant: a dummy variable indicating whether the individual is in the upper quartile of the income distribution, a dummy variable indicating whether the individual is in the upper quartile of the wealth distribution and the RMW of delaying pension take-up. Partner's income is not significant. It is tempting to interpret the estimated result as the probability of not claiming benefits given that an individual has retired. Since the decision to retire and the decision to claim pension benefits may be simultaneous decisions, the estimated result should, however, be interpreted with caution. The second empirical strategy is to investigate couples where both members were born in 1949 and eligible for <b>early</b> <b>pension</b> take-up in 2011. First, I estimate a linear probability model on the sample of couples where only one member claimed benefits, using the difference in RMW as the sole regressor. The difference in RMW is not significant. Thereafter I estimate the probability of wife claiming while the husband did not claim, using the RMW of delaying the take-up of both the wife and the husband as distinct regressors. None of the regressors are significant, and we would not reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero. Similarly, I estimate the probability of husband claiming while the wife did not claim, using the RMW of delaying the take-up of both the wife and the husband as distinct regressors. In this regression the RMW of delaying the husband's take-up is significant. At last, I investigate whether empirical evidence suggests that individuals in the sample understand the incentives in the pension scheme. I estimate the probability of the wife claiming benefits, disregarding the husband's decision. I use the RMW of delaying the take-up of both the wife and the husband as distinct regressors, and find that only the RMW of delaying the wife's take-up is significant. I run a similar regression estimating the probability of the husband claiming pension benefits, regardless of what his wife did, and find that both regressors were significant. The findings suggest that claiming is strongly associated with the RMW of delaying pension take-up, and are thus in accordance with the findings of Brinch et al. (2013). None of the empirical findings suggest that Norwegian couples coordinate on claiming pension benefits. Empirical evidence suggests, however, that the individuals understand and respond to the incentives in the pension scheme. Lack of coordination should therefore not be interpreted as lack of understanding of the incentive structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} decades {{survival}} after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has improved, leading to {{an increasing number of}} patients returning to work, but little is known about factors that may influence their labour market affiliation. This study examines the impact of gender, co-morbidity and socio-economic position on subsequent labour market affiliation and transition between various social services in patients admitted {{for the first time with}} ACS. Methods: From 2001 to 2009 all first-time hospitalisations for ACS were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry (n = 79, 714). For this population, data on sick leave, unemployment and retirement were obtained from an administrative register covering all citizens. The 21, 926 patients, aged 18 – 63 years, who had survived 30 days and were part of the workforce at the time of diagnosis were included in the analyses where subsequent transition between the above labour market states was examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. Findings: A total of 37 % of patients were in work 30 days after first ACS diagnosis, while 55 % were on sick leave and 8 % were unemployed. Seventy-nine per cent returned to work once during follow-up. This probability was highest among males, those below 50 years, living with a partner, the highest educated, with higher occupations, having specific events (NSTEMI, and percutaneous coronary intervention) and with no co-morbidity.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1999, {{and in the course}} of macroeconomic growth, the age of access to retirement was rendered more flexible, according to contributions’ profiles. In this sense, a new law made it possible for workers at least 55  years old and a working career of 30 complete calendar years to become eligible for pension benefits. Even though there was a reduction factor linked to <b>early</b> retirement <b>pensions,</b> this flexibility imposed significant financial pressure on the Social Security system. As a consequence, the legal norms that allowed access to a pension before the worker reached the legal retirement age were suspended in 2005. Early retirement schemes became once again possible in 2007, over a new law that was published for discussion in November 2006, but with severe penalties imposed to pensions.
