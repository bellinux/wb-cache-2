Chief {{editor of the}} party organ, Il Lavoratore, and a key figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Circle, Pittoni also founded the Workers Cooperative of Trieste, Istria and Friulia. His participation in such causes increased the cultural and educational prestige of socialism, solving many of the movement's teething problems, and helping to spread the cooperative ideals among the Slovene population. He conditioned affiliation to these cooperatives on the desegregation and inter-ethnic solidarity of candidate unions.

During World War II, Polanyi's father sent him to Canada for three years when he was 11, so he would be safe from German bombings. While living in Toronto, he attended the University of Toronto Schools. [...] After returning to Britain, Polanyi finished high school and attended university at Manchester, where he received his undergraduate degree in 1949 and his PhD in 1952. Although his university education was focused in science, he was not convinced it was his calling after finishing high school, when he briefly considered a career as a poet. His father, Michael Polanyi, was a professor in the chemistry department during his first year of university, before transferring to a newly created position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> department. Polanyi's supervisor during his graduate studies was Ernest Warhurst, a former student of his father's. After completing his PhD studies, Polanyi did postdoctoral research at the National Research Council in Ottawa, Ontario from 1952 until 1954, where he worked with Edgar William Richard Steacie. From 1954 until 1956, he was a research associate at Princeton University.|$|E
