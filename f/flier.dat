5|$|He {{joined the}} {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe with 2./Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 14 (2nd Company of <b>Flier</b> Replacement Unit 14) in Detmold on 19 October 1936. There {{he was promoted to}} Feldwebel of the Reserves on 1 December 1940.|$|E
5|$|Ares: A {{large black}} <b>flier</b> (bat) bonded to Henry who chooses to save Gregor {{rather than his}} bond when the two fall off a cliff. He does not know of Henry's treachery until after the fact, and so Gregor decides to bond with him to save him from banishment.|$|E
5|$|Just before Werner landed, {{brothers}} Max and Otto Voss {{arrived at}} Jasta 10 for a visit. They were both {{now in the}} German military.

40|$|The {{shape of}} a wing {{influences}} the airflow over its surface and governs the aerodynamic forces acting on the wing. Therefore, wing shape is tightly correlated with flight performance. For bats and birds, faster <b>fliers</b> generally have more slender and elongated wings (high aspect ratio), while slower <b>fliers</b> have more broad and short wings (low aspect ratio). The preferred flight speed, and therefore wing {{shape of a}}n animal is usually adapted to its habitat, foraging strategy, and flight behavior. We examined the relationship of aspect ratio and wing shape (i. e., leading edge curvature and wing pointiness) of butterfly forewings, relative to habitat preferences, toxicity, and migration using geometric morphometrics. Pictures of 22 butterfly species from three different habitats (forest, open forest and open habitat) were digitized and analyzed using morphometric methods. Our preliminary {{results indicate that the}} previously shown relationship of wing shape and flight performance for larger <b>fliers</b> might not scale down to butterflies. We found a significant difference in aspect ratios for butterflies in different habitats. Suspected slower <b>fliers</b> had a higher aspect ratio than faster <b>fliers.</b> This could mean that we need to adjust our ecological interpretation of wing shapes for small <b>fliers</b> such as butterflies...|$|R
5|$|Outraged by {{this act}} of police violence, local anarchists quickly printed and {{distributed}} fliers calling for a rally the following day at Haymarket Square (also called the Haymarket), which was then a bustling commercial center near the corner of Randolph Street and Desplaines Street. Printed in German and English, the fliers claimed {{that the police had}} murdered the strikers on behalf of business interests and urged workers to seek justice. The first batch of fliers contain the words Workingmen Arm Yourselves and Appear in Full Force! When Spies saw the line, he said he would not speak at the rally unless the words were removed from the <b>flier.</b> All but a few hundred of the fliers were destroyed, and new fliers were printed without the offending words. More than 20,000 copies of the revised <b>flier</b> were distributed.|$|E

5|$|The floury {{baker is}} solitary and occurs in low densities. Individuals {{typically}} {{emerge from the}} soil through a three-month period from late November to late February, and can be encountered until May. The floury baker is found {{on a wide variety}} of trees, with some preference for species of paperbark (Melaleuca). It is a relatively poor <b>flier,</b> preyed upon by cicada killer wasps and a wide variety of birds, and can succumb to a cicada-specific fungal disease.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May he was graded First Class <b>Flier.</b> The {{grade was}} based upon his achievements; he had {{achieved}} a dead-stick landing within a fifty-yard marker, a 15-minute flight at 6,000 feet, a 60-mile cross-country flight and 15 hours solo flying. On 24 May he passed his final test with a two-hour flight from Salisbury, to Southampton and onto Basingstoke. His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum. By {{the time he left}} for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours, given 177 lessons as instructor, and had personally tutored 40 student pilots.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class <b>Flier.</b> He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{organizations}} who have implemented the guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The {{majority of them}} are small companies, but there are also big companies that have involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment. Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, people providing samples, among others.As stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide <b>fliers.</b> The goal is to create awareness on the customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in Montpelier, Vermont, where the New England Culinary Institute (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 <b>fliers.</b> Those <b>fliers</b> had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating <b>fliers</b> instead of placing its advertisements on the newspapers. The purpose of the <b>fliers</b> was to promote the company's self-defence classes for women.|$|R

5|$|The broad-billed parrot's {{head was}} large in {{proportion}} to its body, {{and there was a}} distinct crest of feathers {{on the front of the}} head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the hyacinth macaw, which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, and perhaps a red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak <b>flier,</b> but not flightless.|$|E
5|$|The huia's {{movements}} are little known, {{but it was}} most likely sedentary. The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and moving down into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the k≈çkako, the huia was a weak <b>flier</b> and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong <b>flier,</b> but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus‚Äîinstead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds‚Äîmay indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E

5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak <b>flier,</b> its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E
