50|$|Stealth {{inflation}} {{is a type}} of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers. The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract. The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional. Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue. A big example of stealth inflation can be overdraft fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and <b>installation</b> <b>fees.</b> Another form of stealth {{inflation is}} devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency.

40|$|Block rate pricing of {{piped water}} in Indonesian cities has a {{progressive}} structure: the marginal price paid increases with {{the volume of}} demand. This paper estimates household water demand in Salatiga city using the Burtless and Hausman model, and finds that its distribution is not unimodal—that data cluster around kinks.

The estimated model is used to investigate the social welfare consequences of a shift to uniform pricing. The principal beneficiaries would be large households, which are not necessarily wealthy. While replacing the complex rate structure by a uniform marginal price would have positive effects on average welfare, the equity consequences would be small.

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis was {{conducted}} in collaboration with Arvika Kraft AB and its purpose was to improve their hydropower station that is located in Rexed. During {{the last couple of}} years this specific hydropower station has had vast amounts of mechanical problems, mainly with their gearbox. The result of this has been that the hydropower station has been stationary over long periods of time. At the same time this has resulted in that the hydropower station only opens their turbine’s vanes to 80 % of its maximum capability to try to avoid the recurring mechanical problems. By only opening the turbine vanes to 80 % the incoming water flow is reduced, which in turn also reduces the amount on electricity that can be produced. The goal with this bachelor’s thesis has been to find a more economically beneficial solution than the one that is present in today’s hydropower station. It should also be noted that this thesis will only look into the possibility of changing the hydropower stations gearbox and generator. The turbine will not be dealt with in this thesis. Historical- and hydrological data has been analyzed so that the efficiency and a possible increase in the production of electricity for the hydropower station in Rexed could be calculated. This result was then compared with alternative solutions that were offered by Transmissionsservice in Jönköping through several investment calculations. The concept that was the most economically beneficial for the hydropower station in Rexed was exchanging the current gearbox for the one that Transmissionsservice in Jönköping had offered. This solution resulted in an increase of the produced electricity from 2 100 MWh up to approximately 3 000 – 3 400 MWh. With a price on electricity of 300 kr/MWh it generated an increase of income of 270 000 – 390 000 kr per year. The investment of 1 500 000 kr, for the new gearbox plus <b>installation</b> <b>fees,</b> is beneficial with an IRR of 5 %. From the investment calculations it can also be found that an investment up to 5 000 000 kr still is economically beneficial, since the IRR is higher than the cost of capital, for Arvika Kraft AB. Before Arvika Kraft AB decides if the investment will be made or not they should investigate the possibility of receiving a certificate for their hydropower station. By reconstructing this hydropower station they could receive this certificate, which would increase the income price of the electricity produced by 50 % for 15 years (or until the year 2035 if the reconstructed after 2020). With 3 000 – 3 400 MWh of electricity produced this certificate would allow for an investment up to 8 500 000 kr and still be economically beneficial, with an IRR of 5 %, for Arvika Kraft AB...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of appropriate pricing for water {{is critical to}} improve efficiency of the pipe-borne water supply system in many developing countries. A major problem faced by the water sector is that prices are almost universally below the level required for full-cost pricing. Under-pricing of pipe-borne water results in over-consumption, reduces new investments, diminishes {{the quality and quantity}} of water delivered, slows spatial coverage especially for poor settlements, and jeopardizes financial viability of water supplying entities. This thesis evaluates current and alternative pricing strategies for pipe-borne water in Sri Lanka against the criteria of efficiency, equity and the financial viability of the water utility. Existing literature on residential water demand has primarily focused on the developed countries. This thesis evaluates a demand model for residential water for Sri Lanka using the Cobb-Douglas and Stone-Geary functional forms on aggregate panel data. Price elasticity ranges from - 0. 06 to - 0. 58 and the income elasticity varies from 0. 03 to 0. 14. The Stone-Geary specification provides an estimate of the portion of water use insensitive to price changes as 2. 7 to 4. 5 cubic metres per month per household. The number of household members, temperature and rainfall are also important determinants of household water consumption. The analysis also includes an estimation of demand functions for the industrial and commercial water consumers. The sensitivity of water use in relation to price is observed in both user groups and the findings are consistent with the analyses conducted elsewhere: industrial water demand is highly responsive to price changes compared to commercial users. The price elasticity for commercial and industrial water demand is - 0. 16 and - 0. 76 respectively. The number of connections and weather variables are important determinants of commercial and industrial water demand. Production decisions of the water utility are modelled using a trans-log cost function. The average marginal cost in the short run (SRMC) is estimated at Sri Lankan Rupees (SLRS) 16. 50 and in the long run (LRMC) as SLRS 47. 25 per cubic metre. The LRMC estimates differ from the SRMC estimates by a substantial margin. Further, all estimates of marginal and average costs are substantially higher than the existing average volumetric charges. The results for both short-run and long-run indicate scale economies in the technology of water supply. Finally, this thesis evaluates the welfare effects of current and alternative pricing rules using the estimated residential, industrial and commercial demand coefficients and short-run and long-run cost coefficients. The simulation results show that a movement from the current tariff structure to a two-part tariff (volumetric charge equals to SRMC) leads to the highest welfare gains. In the absence of SRMC pricing, the deadweight loss per cubic metre for residential, commercial and industrial consumption is SLRS 0. 30, 3 and 19 respectively. In terms of consumer surplus calculations, SRMC pricing provides the maximum aggregate consumer surplus gain even though residential users lose the gains to industrial and commercial users outweigh these losses. Equivalent variation calculation for income deciles (residential consumers) showed that all income deciles lose from the alternative pricing rules (commercial and industrial users gain). However, with SRMC pricing, equivalent variation for the poorest and the richest groups are comparable. The findings of this thesis are useful for the policy makers and water utility managers in assessing the likely effects and prospects for demand management using the pricing mechanism. The continuous supply of water at the current subsidized rates may lead to a collapse of the water supply systems, while the inelastic nature of water consumption provides opportunities for revenue increases for the water utility by increasing water charges. The estimations of short-run and long-run marginal costs are significant to regulators in the design of water rate structures. Inefficient water pricing has been fiercely criticised for failing to provide potable water to all citizens. Further, policy makers can employ a mix of connection subsidies, education and communication campaigns to stimulate connections to the pipe water network. In order to improve equity, the water companies can reduce the <b>installation</b> <b>fees,</b> giving low-income households access to water connections or reinvest profits in network expansion to un-serviced areas...|$|E
