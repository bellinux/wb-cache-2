A naturally occurring, recessive, perinatally lethal mutation in the aggrecan core protein gene, cmdbc (Acancmd-Bc), that deletes the entire protein-coding sequence provided a model in which to characterize the phenotypic and morphologic effects of aggrecan deletion on skeletal development. We also generated a novel transgenic mouse, Tg(COL 2 A 1 -ACAN), that has the chick ACAN coding sequence driven by the mouse COL 2 A 1 promoter to enable the production of cmdbc/cmdbc; Tg(COL 2 A 1 -ACAN) <b>rescue</b> <b>embryos.</b> These {{were used to assess}} the impact of aggrecan on growth plate organization, chondrocyte survival and proliferation, and the expression of mRNAs encoding chondrocyte differentiation markers and growth factors. Homozygous mutant (cmdbc/cmdbc) embryos exhibited severe defects in all skeletal elements with deformed and shortened (50 %) limb elements. Expression of aggrecan in <b>rescue</b> <b>embryos</b> reversed the skeletal defects to varying degrees with a 20 % increase in limb element length and near-full reversal (80 %) of size and diameter of the ribcage and vertebrae. Aggrecan-null growth plates were devoid of matrix and lacked chondrocyte organization and differentiation, while those of the <b>rescue</b> <b>embryos</b> exhibited matrix production concomitant with partial zonation of chondrocytes having proliferative and hypertrophic morphologies. Deformation of the trachea, likely the cause of the mutation׳s lethality, was reduced in the <b>rescue</b> <b>embryos.</b> Aggrecan-null embryos also had abnormal patterns of COL 10 A 1, SOX 9, IHH, PTCH 1, and FGFR 3 mRNA expression in the growth plate.

Importantly, we demonstrate that Wnt 11 activity in this process is mediated by the GTPase Rab 5, a key regulator of early endocytosis, as blocking Rab 5 c activity in wild-type embryos phenocopies slb/wnt 11 mutants, and enhancing Rab 5 c activity in slb/wnt 11 mutant <b>embryos</b> <b>rescues</b> the mutant phenotype.

Endoglin null mice die in embryogenesis with numerous lesions in the cardiovascular tree including incomplete yolk sac vessel branching and remodeling, vessel dilation, hemorrhage and abnormal cardiac morphogenesis. Since defects in multiple cardiovascular tissues confound interpretations of these observations, we performed in vivo chimeric rescue analysis using Endoglin null embryonic stem cells. We demonstrate that Endoglin is required cell autonomously for endocardial to mesenchymal transition during formation of the endocardial cushions.

Human cytotrophoblasts proliferate in vitro under low O 2 conditions but differentiate at higher O 2 levels, mimicking the developmental transition they undergo as they invade the placental bed {{to establish the}} maternal–fetal circulation in vivo. Hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1), consisting of HIF- 1 α and ARNT subunits, activates many genes involved in the cellular and organismal response to O 2 deprivation. Analysis of Arnt−/− placentas reveals an aberrant cellular architecture due to altered cell fate determination of Arnt−/− trophoblasts. Specifically, Arnt−/− placentas show greatly reduced labyrinthine and spongiotrophoblast layers, and increased numbers of giant cells. We further show that hypoxia promotes the in vitro differentiation of trophoblast stem cells into spongiotrophoblasts as opposed to giant cells. Our results clearly establish that O 2 levels regulate cell fate determination in vivo and that HIF is essential for mammalian placentation. The unique placental phenotype of Arnt−/− animals also provides an important tool for studying the disease of preeclampsia.

By means of conditional transgenesis, we restricted HuR's mutation in either embryonic or endothelial compartments to demonstrate that embryonic lethality is consequent to defects in extraembryonic placenta. HuR's absence impaired the invagination of allantoic capillaries into the chorionic trophoblast layer and the differentiation of syncytiotrophoblast cells that control the morphogenesis and vascularization of the placental labyrinth and fetal support. HuR-null <b>embryos</b> <b>rescued</b> from these placental defects proceeded to subsequent developmental stages but displayed defects in skeletal ossification, fusions in limb elements, and asplenia.

Its zygotic expression is restricted to neural cells, the outer cells of the ventral blood island (VBIs), and the ectoderm overlying the blood precursors. Here, we report that depletion of zygotic xNAP 1 L in embryos produces no obvious morphologic phenotype, but ablates alpha-globin mRNA expression in the VBIs. Transcript levels of the hematopoietic precursor genes SCL and Xaml (Runx- 1) are also reduced in the VBIs. SCL expression can be rescued by injection of xNAP 1 L mRNA into the ectoderm, showing that the effect of xNAP 1 L can be non-cell autonomous. Fli 1 and Hex, genes expressed in hemangioblasts but subsequently endothelial markers, were unaffected, suggesting that xNAP 1 L is required for the hematopoietic lineage specifically.

5000|$|Embryos are {{manually}} excised {{and placed}} immediately onto a culture medium {{that provides the}} proper nutrients to support survival and growth (Miyajima 2006). While the disinfestation and explant excision processes differ for these three techniques, many {{of the factors that}} contribute to the successful recovery of viable plants are similar. The main factors that influence success are; the time of culture, the composition of the medium, and temperature and light. Timing mainly refers to the maturation stage of the embryo before excision. The optimal time especially for the rescue of embryos involving incompatible crosses would be just prior to embryo abortion. Nevertheless, due to difficulties involved with the rearing of young embryos compared to those that have reached the autotrophic phase of development, embryos are normally allowed to develop in vivo as long as possible. While in general, two main types of basal media are the most commonly used for <b>embryo</b> <b>rescue</b> studies, i.e. Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) [...] and Gamborg’s B-5 media (Bridgen, 1994), the composition of the medium will vary in terms of the concentrations of media supplements required.

The cdx genes encode homeodomain transcription factors that act as master regulators of the hox genes. In zebrafish, mutations in cdx 4 cause a severe, but not complete, deficit in embryonic blood cells. Here, we report the expression and function of cdx 1 a, a zebrafish Cdx 1 paralogue. Using morpholino-mediated knockdown of cdx 1 a in a cdx 4 mutant background, we show that a deficiency in both cdx genes causes a severe perturbation of hox gene expression and a complete failure to specify blood. The hematopoietic defect in cdx-deficient embryos does not result from a general block in posterior mesoderm differentiation as endothelial cells and kidney progenitors are still formed in the doubly deficient embryos.

Histone mRNA accumulation and translation are mainly restricted to S-phase in somatic cells, and the mechanism by which oocytes produce histones is unknown. In somatic cells, replication-dependent histone synthesis requires the stem–loop binding protein (SLBP). SLBP is expressed during S-phase, binds to the 3 ′-untranslated region of non-polyadenylated transcripts encoding the histones, and is required for their stabilization and translation. SLBP is expressed in oocytes of several species, suggesting a role in histone synthesis. To test this, we generated transgenic mice whose oocytes lack SLBP. mRNAs encoding histones H 3 and H 4 failed to accumulate in these oocytes. Unexpectedly, mRNAs encoding H 2 A and H 2 B were little affected. Embryos derived from SLBP-depleted oocytes reached the 2 -cell stage, but most then became arrested.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of precise topographic maps during neural development is {{facilitated by the}} pre-sorting of axons in the pathway before they reach their targets. In the vertebrate visual system such topography is clearly seen in the optic tract and in the optic radiations. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in pre-target axon sorting are poorly understood. Here we show that in zebrafish the RNA-binding protein, Hermes, which is expressed exclusively in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is involved in this process. Using a RiboTag approach, we show that Hermes acts as a negative translational regulator of specific mRNAs in RGCs. One of these targets is the guidance cue receptor Neuropilin 1 (Nrp 1) which is sensitive to the repellent cue Semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A). Hermes knockdown leads to topographic missorting in the optic tract through the up-regulation of Nrp 1.
