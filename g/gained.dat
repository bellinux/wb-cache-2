However, {{there is a lack of}} relevant data for the LED lighting heat <b>gain.</b> As the LED lighting fixtures are an emerging lighting technology, the need to identify LED lighting heat <b>gain</b> becomes highly demanded. In this project, fourteen LED lighting luminaries’ heat <b>gain</b> distributions were determined through systematically designed experiments. Specifically, the split between the convective heat <b>gain</b> and the radiative heat <b>gain,</b> and the split between the conditioned space heat <b>gain</b> and ceiling plenum heat <b>gain</b> (if applicable) were determined.

40|$|Q: What the {{difference}} between noise <b>gain</b> and signal <b>gain?</b> A: In the closing of RAQ 56, Amplifier, attenuator or both?, I indicated that you can force the noise <b>gain</b> (NG) while maintaining the signal <b>gain.</b> In a brief recap from op amp theory, two types of <b>gain</b> are associated with op amps: signal <b>gain</b> and noise <b>gain.</b> The signal <b>gain</b> {{is dependent on the}} amplifier configuration. With noninverting op amp configurations, the <b>gain</b> equation is G = (RF /RG) + 1; with inverting configurations, the <b>gain</b> is G = – RF/RG. The noise <b>gain</b> for both of these configurations is the same, and follows the same equation as the noninverting gain: NG = (RF /RG) + 1. The amplifier’s stability in a circuit is determined by the noise <b>gain,</b> not the signal <b>gain.</b> Most modern op amps are stable at unity <b>gain,</b> but some special-purpose amplifiers are not. Decompensated op amps can offer unique advantages, such as lower noise voltage and wider bandwidth, as compared to standard unity-gain stable op amps. So, in what situations would you need to manipulate the noise <b>gain?</b> Forcing the noise <b>gain</b> can help in a variety of applications. For example, to take advantage of one or more of its features, you may want to use a decompensated amplifier below its minimum stable <b>gain.</b> Normally it wouldn’t work, but if you manipulate the noise <b>gain,</b> you can “trick ” the amplifier int...|$|R

25|$|Finite gain: Open-loop <b>gain</b> is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC <b>gain</b> ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop <b>gain</b> (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback <b>gains)</b> is very large, the circuit <b>gain</b> will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop <b>gain).</b> In cases where closed-loop <b>gain</b> must be very high, the feedback <b>gain</b> will be very low, and the low feedback <b>gain</b> causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} the benefits associated with reductions in capital <b>gains</b> taxes. Plans which reduce capital <b>gains</b> taxes by excluding a fixed fraction of capital <b>gains</b> from taxable income, by taxing real rather than nominal <b>gains,</b> and by using a sliding scale capital <b>gains</b> exclusion are considered. We reach three main conclusions. 1. Using plausible measures of economic status, capital <b>gains</b> receipts are highly concentrated among those with high incomes. The richest 2 percent of Americans receive more than 50 percent of all capital <b>gains.</b> Claims that capital <b>gains</b> recipients only appear to be rich because their capital <b>gains</b> income is transitory are not supported by longitudinal data. Likewise, claims that a large fraction of the benefits from capital <b>gains</b> tax reductions flow to middle income taxpayers result from failing to consider tax shelters. Capital <b>gains</b> on corporate stocks are considerably more concentrated among high income indi-viduals than capital <b>gains</b> on other assets...|$|R
