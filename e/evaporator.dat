5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first <b>evaporator,</b> used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an <b>evaporator</b> was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch <b>evaporator,</b> as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{steering}} was by a contrabalanced rudder (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the rudder and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An <b>evaporator</b> produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the <b>evaporator</b> house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} of the forced/natural circulation <b>evaporators</b> is the cost. Circulation <b>evaporators</b> have particularly high construction costs, whereas falling film <b>evaporators</b> have a low investment cost. Falling film <b>evaporators</b> has no rotating internal part, and hence experience no mechanical deterioration, whilst circulation <b>evaporators</b> have high maintenance costs.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{disadvantages}} exist, primarily being the comparable {{lack of understanding}} of falling film <b>evaporators</b> compared to flooded <b>evaporators,</b> particularly for horizontal falling film <b>evaporators.</b> Furthermore the fluid distribution for horizontal falling film <b>evaporators</b> is a challenge, as the performance is severely limited if an uneven distribution of film over the tubes is created.|$|R
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the <b>evaporator.</b> Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect <b>evaporator,</b> and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
25|$|Subcooled liquid {{enters the}} <b>evaporator.</b> Due {{to the heat}} {{exchange}} with warm sea water, evaporation takes place and usually superheated vapor leaves the <b>evaporator.</b> This vapor drives the turbine and the 2-phase mixture enters the condenser. Usually, the subcooled liquid leaves the condenser and finally, this liquid is pumped to the <b>evaporator</b> completing a cycle.|$|E
50|$|Applications:There is a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} for rising tube <b>evaporators,</b> including effluent treatment, production of polymers, food production, thermal desalination, pharmaceuticals, and solvent recovery.Aschner, F.S. & Schaal, M. & Hasson, D. (1971). â€œLarge Long-Tube <b>Evaporators</b> for Seawater Distillation. In terms of applications within these industries, rising tube <b>evaporators</b> are mainly used as reboilers for distillation columns, or as pre-concentrators or flash <b>evaporators</b> or pre-heaters designed to remove volatile components prior to stripping.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} other {{processes}} {{that require the}} use of forced circulation <b>evaporators,</b> which work particularly well as crystallising <b>evaporators.</b> These include processes that produce salt, corn steep water and calcium carbonate.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{evaporation}} to dry or concentrate samples is {{a common}} preparatory step for many laboratory analyses such as spectroscopy and chromatography. Systems {{used for this purpose}} include rotary <b>evaporators</b> and centrifugal <b>evaporators.</b>|$|R
25|$|A multiple-effect <b>evaporator,</b> {{as defined}} in {{chemical}} engineering, is an apparatus for efficiently using the heat from steam to evaporate water. In 1843, Norbert Rillieux invented and patented the multiple-effect <b>evaporator</b> where its first installation and use was in a Louisiana sugar factory.|$|E
25|$|The low {{pressure}} in the <b>evaporator</b> is maintained by a vacuum pump that also removes the dissolved non-condensable gases from the <b>evaporator.</b> The <b>evaporator</b> now contains a mixture of water and steam of very low vapor quality (steam content). The steam is separated from the water as saturated vapor. The remaining water is saturated and is discharged to the ocean in the open cycle. The steam is a {{low pressure}}/high specific volume working fluid. It expands in a special low pressure turbine.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the fresh}} water {{production}} and the waste brine from the <b>evaporator</b> are led through an output cooler. This acts as a heat exchanger with the inlet seawater, pre-heating it to improve efficiency. The plant may operate at either a low pressure or slight vacuum, according to design. As the <b>evaporator</b> works at pressure, not under vacuum, boiling may be violent. To avoid the risk of priming and a carry over of saltwater into the vapour, the <b>evaporator</b> is divided by a bubble cap separator.|$|E

25|$|Heat pumps use a {{refrigerant}} as {{an intermediate}} fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the <b>evaporator,</b> and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses, in the condenser. The refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the <b>evaporator</b> and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.|$|E
25|$|Operation of an <b>evaporator</b> {{represents}} a costly consumption of main boiler steam, thus fuel. Evaporators for a warship {{must also be}} adequate to supply the boilers at continuous full power when required, {{even though this is}} rarely required. Varying the vacuum under which the <b>evaporator</b> works, and thus the boiling point of the feedwater, may optimise production for either maximum output, or better efficiency, depending on which is needed at the time. Greatest output is achieved when the <b>evaporator</b> operates at near atmospheric pressure and a high temperature (for saturated steam this will be at a limit of 100Â°C), which may then have an efficiency of 0.87kg of feedwater produced for each kg of steam supplied.|$|E
25|$|The {{refrigerant}} is boiled by {{the heat}} source in the <b>evaporator</b> to produce super-heated vapor. This fluid is expanded in the turbine to convert thermal energy to kinetic energy, that is converted to electricity in the electrical generator. This energy transfer process decreases {{the temperature of the}} refrigerant that, in turn, condenses. The cycle is closed and completed using a pump to send the fluid back to the <b>evaporator.</b>|$|E

25|$|In heating mode, {{the outdoor}} coil is an <b>evaporator,</b> while the indoor is a condenser. The {{refrigerant}} {{flowing from the}} <b>evaporator</b> (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around {{the inside of the}} building by an air handler.|$|E
25|$|Seawater {{is pumped}} into an <b>evaporator,</b> {{where it is}} boiled by a heating coil. Vapour {{produced}} is then compressed, raising its temperature. This heated vapour is used to heat the <b>evaporator</b> coils. Condensate from the coil outlet provides the fresh water supply. To start the cycle, an electric pre-heater is used to heat the first water supply. The main energy input to the plant is in mechanically driving the compressor, not as heat energy.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the <b>evaporator</b> section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for domestic hot water) causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the <b>evaporator</b> section where it expands through an orifice and into the <b>evaporator</b> section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E

50|$|A {{sea water}} {{distillation}} plant produces all the fresh water needed onboard using two <b>evaporators</b> and two reverse osmosis plants. The ship does not pump onboard water from shore water stations. The highly efficient <b>evaporators</b> are completely pollution free using {{a system of}} free heat recovery as the power source.|$|R
50|$|Circulation <b>evaporators</b> are {{a type of}} {{evaporating}} unit {{designed to}} separate mixtures unable to be evaporated by a conventional evaporating unit. Circulation evaporation incorporates the use of both heat exchangers and flash separation units in conjunction with circulation of the solvent in order to remove liquid mixtures without conventional boiling. There {{are two types of}} Circulation Evaporation; Natural Circulation <b>Evaporators</b> and Forced Circulation <b>Evaporators,</b> both of which are still currently used in industry today, although forced Circulation systems, which have a circulation pump as opposed to natural systems with no driving force, have a much wider range of appropriate uses.|$|R
25|$|A later form {{of marine}} <b>evaporator</b> is the flash distiller. Heated {{seawater}} is pumped into a vacuum chamber, where it 'flashes' into pure water vapour. This is then condensed for further use.|$|E
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an <b>evaporator</b> gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} <b>evaporator</b> equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in <b>evaporator</b> efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the <b>evaporator</b> and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
25|$|In {{cooling mode}} the cycle is similar, but the outdoor coil {{is now the}} {{condenser}} and the indoor coil (which reaches a lower temperature) is the <b>evaporator.</b> This is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate.|$|E
5000|$|Horizontal falling film <b>evaporators</b> have {{a number}} of {{potential}} advantages over their vertical counterparts in the petrochemical industry, such as the ability to use tubes with external enhancements. ( [...] Internally enhanced tubes are available for vertical falling film <b>evaporators,</b> but external enhancements are far superior for boiling applications). The chief disadvantage of horizontal falling film <b>evaporators</b> is that if a corrosive or fouling liquid is to be evaporated, it will have to placed on the shell side. This is against best practice, as it is easier to clean fouling found on the inside of tubes rather than the outside.|$|R

50|$|Limited product versatility:-Another major {{limitation}} of rising film <b>evaporators</b> is {{the requirement for}} the products to be of low viscosity and have minimal fouling tendencies. Competitive process designs like plate-type <b>evaporators</b> can handle liquids that are more viscous with higher fouling tendencies because the inner parts are more easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.|$|R
