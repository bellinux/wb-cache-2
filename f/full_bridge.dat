40|$|The {{three most}} {{commonly}} used switching circuits are the <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter, the half bridge converter, and the forward converter. All three circuits use the same pulse width concept for regulation with the major difference being how many transistors are used for power handling. The <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> uses four transistors, the half bridge uses two, and the forward converter uses one. In practical design, forward converters are used at 300 watts and below, half bridges at 300 to 600 watts, and full bridges above 600 watts.

40|$|<b>Full</b> <b>bridge</b> dc/de {{converter}} topology is extensively {{applied in}} medium to high power conversion. In a power level up to 3 kW, the <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter now employs MOSFET switches. High efficiency, high power density, high reliability and low EMI {{are some of}} the most desirable features in these applications, particularly for computer and telecom systems. To achieve these features, soft switching techniques are normally employed. However, the conventional soft switching <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter topologies would either lose the soft switching at some operating conditions, or become rather complex in design and implementation for a few kilo watts applications. This thesis presents and analyzes an improved zero voltage switching dc/dc <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter topology. The proposed topology employs asymmetrical auxiliary circuits that consist of only a few passive components. However, the advantage of the proposed topology is significant: it achieves soft switching independent of line and load conditions. Detailed steady state and dynamic analyses are performed to understand the operating principle of the proposed topology and its performance. A dc blocking capacitor is essential to prevent the current sense transformer from saturation, and the study of this thesis shows that contrary to the conventional pulse width modulated <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter, the peak current mode control can still be used along with the blocking capacitor in a phase shift <b>full</b> <b>bridge</b> converter. Design procedure for industrial application is presented.
