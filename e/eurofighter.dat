5|$|A single Jaguar was {{converted}} into the Jaguar Active Control Technology (ACT) with fly-by-wire controls and aerodynamic alterations to the airframe; the aerodynamic instability improved manoeuvrability {{and the test}} data {{was used in the}} development of the <b>Eurofighter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{a working}} group {{set up by the}} Finnish MoD {{proposed}} starting a program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18 Hornets. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35, and Saab JAS Gripen.|$|E
5|$|Following {{experience}} {{with both the}} Tornado and the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, the RSAF discontinued low-level mission training in the F-15E {{in light of the}} Tornado's superior low-altitude flight performance. In addition, 10 of the Saudi Tornados were outfitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions. The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon; the retired aircraft were being purchased back by the UK as of 2007.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)'s publication, the {{retirement}} of the entire Tornado fleet was under consideration, savings of £7.5billion were anticipated. The SDSR announced the Tornado would be retained {{at the expense of}} the Harrier II, although Tornado numbers are to decline in transition to the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon, and later on, the F-35 Lightning II.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{celebrated his}} 112th {{birthday}} {{with members of}} his family at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire as the guest of honour at a luncheon at the college. During the day the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performed a flypast which was followed by an aerobatic display from two Tutor aircraft. In June 2008, at his personal request, Allingham was taken on a guided tour of the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems in Warton, Lancashire, as part of the National Veterans' Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|BAE Systems makes large {{sections}} of the Typhoon <b>Eurofighter</b> at its sub-assembly plant in Salmesbury and assembles the aircraft for the RAF at its Warton plant, near Preston. It is also a principal subcontractor on the F35 Joint Strike Fighter – the world's largest single defence project – for which it designs and manufactures a range of components including the aft fuselage, vertical and horizontal tail and wing tips and fuel system. It also manufactures the Hawk, the world's most successful jet training aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the limited}} ground attack {{capabilities}} of the RAF Typhoons in the campaign against ISIL, the UK has delayed the retirement of one squadron of Tornados and is attempting to bring forward the deployment of Brimstone missiles on the <b>Eurofighters</b> to 2017.|$|R
50|$|The PS-05/A is a pulse-doppler radar {{currently}} {{used by the}} JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft (JAS 39A, B, C and D variants). It weighs 156 kg and was developed by Ericsson in collaboration with GEC-Marconi, sharing some technology with the latter's Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier (which inspired the <b>Eurofighter's</b> CAPTOR radar).|$|R
5|$|In 1996, Russia {{submitted}} the Su-27M and Su-37 for South Korea's F-X programme, which sought a 40-aircraft {{replacement for the}} Republic of Korea Air Force's F-4D/Es, RF-4Cs and F-5E/Fs. The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault Rafale, <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon, and F-15K Slam Eagle. Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased-grid radar and thrust-vectoring engines, and offered full technology transfer as well as final assembly in South Korea. The US$5billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt-reduction deal on money Russia owed to South Korea. However, the Su-27M was eliminated early in the competition, which was won by the F-15K.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{with major}} delays hampering the <b>Eurofighter,</b> the Aeronautica Militare began {{a search for}} another interim fighter. While the Tornado itself was considered, any long term {{extension}} to the lease would have involved upgrade to RAF CSP standard and thus was not considered cost effective. In February 2001, Italy announced its arrangement to lease 35 F-16s from the United States. The Aeronautica Militare returned its Tornado ADVs to the RAF, with the final aircraft arriving at RAF Saint Athan on 7 December 2004. One aircraft was retained for static display purposes.|$|E
5|$|The first Italian {{prototype}} {{made its}} maiden flight on 5 December 1975 from Turin, Italy. The Aeronautica Militare received {{a total of}} 100 Tornado IDS. 16 IDSs were subsequently converted to the ECR configuration; the first Italian Tornado ECR was delivered on 27 February 1998. As a stop-gap measure for 10 years the Aeronautica Militare additionally operated 24 Tornado ADVs in the air defence role, which were leased from the RAF to cover the service gap between the retirement of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter {{and the introduction of}} the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon.|$|E
5000|$|After some consideration, Germany's Defense Ministry {{committed}} to sending six <b>Eurofighters</b> (to reinforce the Portuguese rotation beginning in September) and leading [...] "minesweeping maneuvers" [...] in the Baltic Sea. A multinational {{group of four}} minesweeper ships and a supply ship from the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1 left Kiel, Germany on 22 April.|$|R
25|$|In July 2012, UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond {{suggested}} that a follow-on buy of F-35A aircraft would {{be determined by the}} Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2015, with the aim of replacing UK's Typhoons around 2030. The UK is to decide what mix of manned and unmanned aircraft to replace its <b>Eurofighters</b> with sometime between 2015 and 2020.|$|R
50|$|In February 1999 Raytheon {{added another}} interim level to their staged approach. The AIM-120B+ would feature the ERAAM/FMRAAM seeker and {{guidance}} section but {{attached to the}} AIM-120B solid rocket motor. This would be ready for <b>Eurofighter's</b> 2004 ISD and could be updated to the ERAAM or FMRAAM configurations in 2005 and 2007 by swapping the propulsion system and updating the software.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new digital avionics systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on {{the first month of}} Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} the station from RAF Coningsby on 2 May 2012 {{to take part in}} a security exercise as part of preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics. During the Games, the aircraft were deployed to the station to provide air superiority protection for London, in conjunction with other security measures by the British Armed Forces. Westland Sea King helicopters of the Royal Navy were also deployed to the station. The presence of the aircraft during the Olympics became the first time fighter aircraft had been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. The Typhoons and Sea Kings left Northolt on 16 August following the conclusion of the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The CAPTOR-E is {{an active}} {{electronically}} scanned array derivative of the original CAPTOR radar, also known as CAESAR (from CAPTOR Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar) being developed by the EuroRADAR Consortium, led by Selex ES. The German BW-Plan 2009 indicated that Germany intended to equip/retrofit their <b>Eurofighters</b> with the AESA Captor-E from 2012, but the contract award has been delayed until at least mid 2014.|$|R
50|$|As of 2014, a {{significant}} proportion of Germany's military aircraft were reported to be unserviceable. It has been reported that the Sea Lynx helicopters have experienced cracking in their tails, that around half of the <b>Eurofighters</b> and Tornadoes are not currently airworthy, and that the aging C-160 fleet remains in limited service while waiting for the introduction of the Airbus A400M, the first of which was delivered in December 2014. Ursula von der Leyen admitted that due to the poor state of the Bundeswehr's equipment, Germany was no longer able to fulfill its NATO commitments.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, Italian Harriers, {{operating}} from Giuseppe Garibaldi, worked alongside Italian <b>Eurofighters</b> and aircraft {{of other nations}} during Operation Unified Protector, part of the 2011 military intervention in Libya. They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over Libya, using the LITENING targeting pods while armed with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and AIM-9 Sidewinders. In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force Tornados and AMX fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from Giuseppe Garibaldi dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.|$|R
5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed in principle to conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced pulse doppler radar systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon's CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft to be provided with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E
5|$|When the Czech Republic {{became a}} NATO member in 1999, {{the need to}} replace their {{existing}} Soviet-built MiG-21 fleet with aircraft compatible with NATO interoperability standards became apparent. In 2000, the Czech Republic began evaluating a number of aircraft, including the F-16, F/A-18, Mirage 2000, <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon and the Gripen. One major procurement condition was the industrial offset agreement, set at 150% of the expected purchase value. In December 2001, having reportedly been swayed by Gripen International's generous financing and offset programme, the Czech Government announced that the Gripen had been selected. In 2002, the deal was delayed until after parliamentary elections had taken place; alternative means of air defense were also studied, including leasing the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|BAE Systems {{was formed}} on 30 November 1999 by the £7.7 billion merger of British Aerospace (BAe) and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). As a result, BAE Systems is the {{successor}} {{to many of the}} most famous British aircraft, defence electronics and warship manufacturers. Predecessor companies built the Comet, the world's first commercial jet airliner; the Harrier [...] "jump jet", the world's first operational Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft; the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] Blue Vixen radar carried by Sea Harrier FA2s and which formed the basis of the <b>Eurofighter's</b> CAPTOR radar; and co-produced the iconic Concorde supersonic airliner with Aérospatiale.|$|R
5000|$|Although no {{detailed}} {{performance requirements}} have been publicly released, they were understood to demand launch success and no-escape zones three {{times greater than}} those of the then [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] medium-range missile, AMRAAM. The missile external geometry would be constrained by the need for compatibility with <b>Eurofighter's</b> semi-recessed underfuselage launchers which had been designed for AMRAAM. Key features of the requirement included [...] "stealthy launch, enhanced kinematics, which will provide the missile with sufficient energy to chase and destroy a highly agile manoeuvring target, robust performance in countermeasures and the ability for the launch aircraft to fire and disengage at the earliest opportunity thus enhancing aircraft survivability". [...] These requirements were largely shaped by the perceived threat posed by advanced versions of the Russian Sukhoi Su-27 [...] "Flanker" [...] armed with extended range ramjet powered versions of the R-77 missile.|$|R
500|$|The Gripen entered service {{using the}} PS-05/A pulse-Doppler X band {{multi-mode}} radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi, {{which is based}} on the latter's advanced Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier that also served {{as the basis for the}} <b>Eurofighter's</b> CAPTOR radar. The all-weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120km (74mi) away, and automatically tracking multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. [...] It can guide several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously. [...] Saab stated the PS-05/A is able to handle all types of air defense, air-to-surface, and reconnaissance missions, and is developing a Mark 4 upgrade to it. [...] The Mark 4 version has a 150% increase in high-altitude air-to-air detection ranges, detection and tracking of smaller targets at current ranges, 140% improvement in air-to-air mode at low altitude, and full integration of modern weapons such as the AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and MBDA Meteor missiles.|$|R
5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry.|$|E
5|$|AirSpace officially {{opened to}} the public on 12 July 2008. Over 30 {{aircraft}} are on display, dating back to the First World War; early aircraft include rare examples of an Airco DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8. The former is one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example on display in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also on display is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 strike aircraft, one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development aircraft, which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009. Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society's Concorde and Comet described above.|$|E
5|$|Bournemouth is {{currently}} host {{to a number}} of festivals. Bournemouth Food and Drink Festival is a ten-day event which combines a market with live cookery demonstrations. The Arts by the Sea Festival is a mix of dance, film, theatre, literature, and music which was launched in 2012 by the local university, the Arts University Bournemouth, and is set to become an annual event. The Bourne Free carnival is held in the town each year during the summer. Initially a gay pride festival, it has become a celebration of diversity and inclusion. Since 2008, Bournemouth has held its own air festival over four days in August. This has featured displays from the Red Arrows as well as appearances from the Yakovlevs, Blades, Team Guinot Wing-Walkers, Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including Lancaster, Hurricane, Spitfire and also the last flying Vulcan. The festival has also seen appearances from modern aircraft such as the <b>Eurofighter</b> Typhoon. The air festival attracts up to a million people over the four-day event.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, the UK {{selected}} the MBDA Meteor as the long range air-to-air missile armament for her Typhoons with an in-service date (ISD) of December 2011. In December 2002, France, Germany, Spain and Sweden joined the British in a $1.9bn contract for Meteor on Typhoon, the Dassault Rafale and the Saab Gripen. The protracted contract negotiations pushed the ISD to August 2012, {{and it was}} further put back by <b>Eurofighter's</b> failure to make trials aircraft available to the Meteor partners. Meteor is now in production and first deliveries to the RAF were scheduled for Q4 2012 but full clearance on Typhoon was not planned until mid-2016.
