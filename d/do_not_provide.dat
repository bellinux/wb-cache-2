5|$|Past {{species have}} also left records of their {{evolutionary}} history. Fossils, {{along with the}} comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record. By comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species, paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species. However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> information on their ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> {{an actual}} picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in}} a traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{registered the}} cause of death as senile dementia. However, Smetana's family believed that his physical and mental decline was due to syphilis. An analysis of the autopsy report, published by the German neurologist Dr Ernst Levin in 1972, came to the same conclusion. Tests carried out by Prof. Emanuel Vlček in the late 20th century on samples of muscular tissue from Smetana's exhumed body provided further evidence of the disease. However, this research has been challenged by Czech physician Dr Jiří Ramba, who has argued that Vlček's tests <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> a basis for a reliable conclusion, citing the age and state of the tissues and highlighting reported symptoms of Smetana's that were incompatible with syphilis.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Western Roman Empire, domes {{became a}} {{signature}} feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire. A transition from timber-roofed basilicas to vaulted churches seems to have occurred between the late 5th century and the 7th century, with early examples in Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Cilicia. The first known domed basilica may have been a church at Meriamlik in southern Turkey, dated to between 471 and 494, although the ruins <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> a definitive answer. It is possible earlier examples existed in Constantinople, where {{it has been suggested that}} the plan for the Meriamlik church itself was designed, but no domed basilica has been found there before the 6th century.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the authors}} of the New Testament showed little {{interest}} in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. Although the gospels <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|No ancient {{biographies of}} Theramenes are known, but {{his life and}} actions are {{relatively}} well documented, due to the extensive treatment given him in several surviving works. The Attic orator Lysias deals with him at length in several of his speeches, albeit in a very hostile manner. Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: Thucydides' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes' career, and Xenophon, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives {{a detailed account of}} several episodes from Theramenes career; Diodorus Siculus, probably drawing his account from Ephorus at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon's at several points. Theramenes also appears in several other sources, which, although they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> as many narrative details, have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes' life and memory.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> thrust {{out of the}} blocks. Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>provide</b> this service.

These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
