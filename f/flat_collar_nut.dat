5000|$|Buckle <b>collars,</b> {{also called}} <b>flat</b> <b>collars,</b> with a buckle {{similar to a}} belt buckle, or a {{quick-release}} buckle, either of which holds the collar loosely around the dog's neck. Identification is commonly attached to such a collar; it also comes with a loop to which a leash can be fastened. This is the most standard collar for dogs. A <b>flat</b> <b>collar</b> should fit comfortably tight on your dog's neck. It should not be so tight as to choke your dog nor so loose that they can slip out of it. The rule of thumb says {{you should be able}} to get two fingers underneath the collar.|$|R
25|$|By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were {{discarded}} {{in favor}} of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, wide, <b>flat</b> <b>collars.</b> By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>collars</b> are {{commonly}} used in clicker training and other non-correction-based training, such as puppy kindergarten. They are also effective in training small dogs, however they tend to lift the dog off the ground when giving corrections while the dog is distracted or in high adrenal mode. They are typically made of nylon or leather, and fasten with a buckle or quick-release connection.|$|R
5000|$|From the 17th century on, a frock is a thigh- or {{full-length}} loose {{outer garment}} worn by shepherds, workmen, and farm workers in Britain, generally of heavy linen {{with a broad}} <b>flat</b> <b>collar,</b> now usually called a smock-frock. In some areas, this traditional frock buttons up the front {{in the manner of}} a coat, while in others it is a pullover style.|$|R

5000|$|The Peter Pan collar {{is a form}} of <b>flat</b> <b>collar,</b> one of {{the three}} basic collar types along with stand and roll collars. It is cut to fit around the neckline, {{following}} the curve, and to lie flat upon the torso. It can be made either as one part, with a front-fastening bodice, or in two parts to accommodate a back fastening while retaining the front opening. The collar is small and soft, with rounded corners.|$|R
5000|$|The men's {{redingote}} was an 18th-century {{or early}} 19th century long coat or greatcoat, {{derived from the}} country garment with a wide, <b>flat</b> <b>collar</b> called a frock In French, redingote is the usual term for a fitted frock coat. The form a men's redingote took could be of the tightly fitting frock coat style, or the more voluminous, loose [...] "great coat" [...] style, replete with overlapping capes or collars, such as a [...] "garrick" [...] redingote.|$|R

The following experiments performed with the own material and tools made by the author s design. Experiments {{in the production of}} the <b>flat</b> <b>collar</b> led to the speedy rotation of the sample ending. Experiments with the conical ending brought valuable results {{from the point of view}} of comparison of theoretical and measured powers, distribution of thicknesses and utilization of the deformation web to set voltage-deformation state. The dimension excent of the conical ending was limited by the formation of buckling in the cylindrical part of the tube...|$|R
5000|$|The {{portrait}} was {{inscribed with}} the year 1634 and the bride's age being 22, but {{since she was}} 22 when she married in 1631 it is probably a bit earlier. Similar to Hals' other wedding portraits of standing women, she is holding {{the back of a}} chair with her right hand. Her diadem cap is edged with lace in the manner of Hals' portrait of Sara Wolphaerts van Diemen. Her dress is the height of fashion and shows a moment when <b>flat</b> <b>collars</b> and wide millstone collars were worn together. She is holding a wedding glove that presumably matches the one in her husband's portrait. Her portrait was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: ...|$|R
5000|$|Sara's {{portrait}} {{was probably}} {{painted on the}} occasion of her marriage to Claes in 1622, aged 29. Similar to Hals' other wedding portraits of women, she is wearing a richly embroidered stomacher. Her dress is the height of fashion and shows a moment when <b>flat</b> <b>collars</b> and wide millstone collars were worn together. She wears her hair rolled in front of a winged diadem cap that is edged with lace trim. Her portrait doesn't seem to match up as well to its pendant as other Hals's wedding pendants, and {{it is possible that the}} portrait of Nicolaes was painted {{on the occasion of}} his first marriage. Her portrait was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: ...|$|R

50|$|This breed, {{like its}} {{ancestor}} the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes {{the face to}} occasionally look sad; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as the loose, elastic skin around the neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent {{of what they are}} tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This, combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that <b>flat</b> <b>collars</b> can easily be pulled off. The looseness of the skin results in the Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. The Basset's skull is characterised by its large dolichocephalic nose, which is second only to the Bloodhound in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells.|$|R
5000|$|In the 18th {{century in}} Britain and America, a frock was an unfitted men's coat for hunting or other country pursuits, with a broad, <b>flat</b> <b>collar,</b> {{derived from the}} {{traditional}} working-class frock. Late in the 18th century {{it came to be}} made with a cutaway front without a waist seam and this may have evolved into the standard dress coat with horizontally cutaway fronts worn for daytime wear by the early 19th century and from which the modern tail coat for white tie is derived. The great coat may similarly be historically derived from the frock as it similarly is single breasted, with a high and broad collar, waist pockets, and also lacked a waist seam early in its history {{as can be seen in}} an example in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|R
5000|$|On August 18, 1886, the U.S. Army Cavalry {{arrived in}} the new park system. Sent in to {{discourage}} poachers, defend the forests and stop rampant stagecoach robbery, the Cavalry was easily recognizable by their uniforms, unlike the early [...] "game keepers". These cavalrymen wore riding boots, jodhpurs, and short waist-length tunics of olive drab, which had <b>flat</b> <b>collars.</b> The most distinctive feature was the soldier's [...] "campaign hat", a stiff, wide-brimmed hat of straw or felt with a medium-sized, cylindrical crown that came to a rounded peak. In modern times, this hat has been popularized by the U.S. Forest Service's Smokey Bear, and NPS employees {{in the 21st century}} still wear the distinctive campaign hat (or [...] "flat hat" [...] as rangers call it) when in Class A uniform, a direct link back to the 19th century.|$|R

5000|$|The {{transition}} to the Late Bronze Age brought societal change to the British Isles, and also apparently increased availability of gold, {{which led to a}} trend to much larger and more massive pieces. The largest were jewellery worn round the neck in a range of styles, the most ostentatious wide <b>flat</b> <b>collars</b> or gorgets with ribbed decoration following the shape of the piece, and round discs at the side. The Mold Cape is unique among survivals, but fits in with the trend to massive pieces emphasizing the neck and chest. It was clearly not for prolonged wear, as the wearer could not raise their arms. In Ireland, lunulae were probably replaced as neck ornaments firstly by gold torcs, found from the Irish Middle Bronze Age, and then in the Late Bronze Age by the spectacular [...] "gorgets" [...] of thin ribbed gold, some with round discs at the side, of which 9 examples survive, 7 in the National Museum of Ireland.|$|R

50|$|The modern regular duty uniform is more functional, {{consisting}} of a simpler solid blue version of the more colorful tricolor grand gala uniform, worn with a simple brown belt, a <b>flat</b> white <b>collar</b> and a black beret. For new recruits and rifle practice, a simple light blue overall with a brown belt may be worn. During cold or inclement weather, a dark blue cape is worn over the regular uniform.|$|R
50|$|Riverside is a <b>flat,</b> blue <b>collar</b> {{residential}} {{area on the}} west side of Sioux City, along the banks and floodplain of the Big Sioux River. Riverside is historically significant as the site of original land holdings of the first white settler in the territory-- Theophile Bruguier-- whose farm included hundreds of acres running from the mouth of the Big Sioux River northwest toward the South Dakota state line—much of that area which today comprises suburb of Riverside.|$|R
50|$|A Peter Pan collar is a {{style of}} {{clothing}} <b>collar,</b> <b>flat</b> in design with rounded corners. It is named after the collar of Maude Adams's costume in her 1905 role as Peter Pan, although similar styles had been worn before this date.|$|R
50|$|Tags {{may make}} noise as animals move. A collar-mount tag, either slide-on or riveted-on, <b>flat</b> to a <b>collar's</b> surface, is silent and {{therefore}} eliminates the noise.

30|$|The TC is {{a typical}} double {{overhung}} rotor with a steel turbine and an attached aluminum compressor impeller. That is, the turbine and compressor impellers are outboard of two bearings. The rotor shaft, FRB, shaft seal, thrust <b>collar,</b> shaft <b>nut</b> and other parts {{are included in the}} TC. All rotor components should be taken into account in the rotordynamic computation to investigate the rotor vibration response, such as the stability analysis and the frequency components in the waterfall plot. The compressor and turbine impellers are generally regarded as rigid disk to model. Due to its complex structure, the mass of rotating components, moment of inertia, and the center of gravity position can be obtained by using CAE 3 -dimensional software to model and calculate, and then add to the rotor-shaft regarded as a rigid disk.|$|R
5000|$|René Lacoste, the French seven-time Grand Slam tennis champion, {{felt that}} the stiff tennis attire was too {{cumbersome}} and uncomfortable. He designed a white, short-sleeved, loosely-knit piqué cotton (he called the cotton weave jersey petit piqué) shirt with an unstarched, <b>flat,</b> protruding <b>collar,</b> a buttoned placket, and a shirt-tail longer in back than in front (known today as a [...] "tennis tail"; see below), which he first wore at the 1926 U.S. Open championship. Beginning in 1927, Lacoste placed a crocodile emblem on the left breast of his shirts, as the American press had begun to refer to him as [...] "The Crocodile", a nickname which he embraced.|$|R
50|$|Oopjen {{is wearing}} a <b>flat</b> lace <b>collar</b> with {{matching}} wrist collars in the latest fashion. Other Amsterdam brides of the regency class wore millstone collars well into the 1640s. She is also wearing a pearl necklace and a pearl bracelet, and pearls were considered more valuable than diamonds at that time. The format of the paintings showing the couple at full length was the most expensive form of marriage pendant and could only fit {{in a house with}} high ceilings. According to family inventories, they also owned another Rembrandt depicting the Holy Family. It is assumed that this is the Holy Family now in Munich, as that is also dated to 1634.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the tennis shirt, however, the upturned collar took on a whole new purpose. In 1929 René Lacoste, the French 7-time Grand Slam champion, decided that the stiff dress shirts and ties usually worn by tennis players were too {{cumbersome}} and uncomfortable for the tennis court. Instead, he designed a loosely-knit pique cotton shirt with an unstarched, <b>flat</b> protruding <b>collar</b> and a longer shirt-tail in back than in front. This {{came to be known as}} the tennis shirt. Lacoste's design called for a thick piqué collar that one would wear turned up in order to block the sun from one's neck. Thus, the tennis shirt's upturned collar was originally designed by the inventor of the tennis shirt, himself, for ease and comfort on the tennis court, aiding the player by helping to prevent sunburn.|$|R
