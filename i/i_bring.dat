Lawrence and the Sherifial Arab force could support a September {{attack by the}} EEF, {{recognising}} that harvests were being collected before that time, and that {{after the end of}} September they normally moved to camel-grazing lands in the Syrian desert. He wrote, [...] "They, naturally, won't and can't do much unless I move; and it is not much use their destroying the Turks' communications unless I take immediate advantage of such destruction...If <b>I</b> <b>bring</b> them into the fight and do not make progress myself, this will also expose them to retaliationwhich to some tribes, such as the Druzes, S. of Damascus, may mean annihilation."

500|$|Composer Bear McCreary {{changed his}} synth {{programming}} {{for the series}} from [...] "warm, round tones" [...] to a [...] "mangled under heavy distortion" [...] sound. He began the episode without any synths, describing his music for the episode's opening scene as [...] "among the most shamelessly orchestral I’ve ever done for this series ... I wanted the score to feel like it belonged in the 1940's, with a retro, adventurous attitude." [...] Then, [...] "just as the audience begins to get used to" [...] the orchestral sound, the episode cuts to [...] "modern day and suddenly <b>I</b> <b>bring</b> in the new synths, with distorted basses blazing over the nastiest groove I've ever written for the show. The transition is hopefully as jarring as I intended—jumping from soaring orchestra to blasting electronica, as we leap forward in time seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But I like to think <b>I</b> <b>bring</b> a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. <b>I</b> <b>bring</b> it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E

Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You just have to get it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E
