40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{research}} has suggested {{the existence of}} a psychosis continuum ranging from psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in the general population to psychotic symptoms in patients with affective and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Especially individuals <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> esoterism were more often reported having experienced PLEs. However, there is little information on the extent of PLEs in this subculture. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the extent of PLEs in a non-clinical population with <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism by means of an anonymized clinically used screening questionnaire. The 16 -item version of the Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ- 16), a self-report screening questionnaire assessing the presence of PLEs was administered to individuals with <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism (IE) and a control group without <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism (NI). The sample included 402 individuals. 224 subjects (55. 7 %) reported <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism and 178 subjects (44. 3 %) showed no such <b>interest.</b> <b>In</b> an ANCOVA, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism was shown to have a significant impact on the PQ- 16 score (< 0. 001). Also, age (p= 0. 022) and the interaction between age and <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism had a significant impact on the PQ- 16 score (p= 0. 004). Specifically, younger individuals <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> esoterism showed increased PQ- 16 scores, whereas scores decreased with increasing age. <b>In</b> individuals without <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism, age had no relevant impact on the score. Younger individuals <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> esoterism seem to be more prone to reporting psychotic-like experiences compared to individuals without <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> esoterism and compared to their older counterparts...|$|R
