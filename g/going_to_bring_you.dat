The spirit of this extraordinary relationship was captured in their joint publication Parallels and Paradoxes. This exchange gave rise to the idea of creating an orchestra in which musicians from Israel, Palestine, the Middle East and North Africa would play music together - harmonize in music - and thus create a foundation for discussion with the possibility of mutual understanding. Barenboim has spoken of the ensemble as follows:"The Divan is not a love story, and it is not a peace story. It has very flatteringly been described as a project for peace. It isn't.

[...] —Madonna speaking to Spanish radio station Los 40 Principales about the song. [...] When Madonna started working on her ninth studio album, the cultural mood of America was bleak and that of paranoia after the September 11 attacks. There was discontent and fear all around as the terrorism and hatred took people by surprise, as they started questioning the feasibility of the American Dream. While developing the songs for American Life with producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna interrogated and pondered upon those values. The confusion, disorientation and the anger they created seeped into the making of each and every song, including [...] "Hollywood". She later spoke about Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism and the long discussions they had about this, and society's obsession with fame and fortune.
