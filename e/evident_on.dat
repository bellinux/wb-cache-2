5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry air entrainment, limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of C. graminis {{have four}} instar stages, though the first instar may not possess the {{characteristics}} of the later instars. Larvae are brown, and dorsally convex with spiracles <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> eight segments. They usually have small, indistinct tubercles with very short setae. The head of each larva is a darker brown than the body and has six ocelli on each side. The mandibles have five apical teeth.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Its forward motion slowed after it passed the Lesser Antilles on November12. A large well-defined anticyclone persisted across much of the Caribbean Sea, providing a favorable environment for the system. A low-level circulation gradually became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery within the disturbance. Based on ship observations, the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system organized into a tropical depression on November17, about 280miles (450km) south of the western tip of Haiti.|$|E

5|$|On May24, the low {{pressure}} area reorganized as spiral rainbands became more <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> radar, and Alma was re-classified as a tropical depression. As the depression approached the Florida coast, radar imagery indicated the system remained well-organized, with a spiral band structure around an eye feature; however, wind shear limited convection and strength, and Alma moved ashore as a depression near Cedar Key on May25. It turned northeastward and moved across the southeastern United States, becoming extratropical in North Carolina on May27. After moving {{off the coast of}} Virginia, the remnants of Alma were absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimentation}} <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> Somewhere in Time {{continued on}} their next album, entitled Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which {{was released in}} 1988. A concept album, based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card, {{this would be the}} band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release. After his contributions were not used for Somewhere in Time, Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album. Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.1 in the UK charts, although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.|$|E

5|$|A weak surface trough of low {{pressure}} emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with {{the formation of}} a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low developed over Texas, providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear. A surface circulation was first <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi, and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound. As the upper-level low over Texas drifted southwestward, an anticyclone developed over the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On August 7, the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana. It continued to become better organized, and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain. This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} disturbance persisted northeast of Vanuatu, with persistent convection extending toward the Solomon Islands. On June 4, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi classified {{the system as}} a tropical depression. With a ridge to the south, it moved to the west-southwest, quickly intensifying into Tropical Storm Gina by June 5 about 970km (600mi) east-southeast of Honiara. By 0000UTC on June 7, the JTWC upgraded Gina to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, after an eye became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite images. Interaction with the nearby remnants of Tropical Cyclone Epi caused convection to decrease. On June 7, FMS reported that Gina attained peak intensity as a low-end Category3 tropical cyclone on the Australian intensity scale, with winds of 140km/h (90mph). The JTWC recorded winds of 170km/h (105mph). A compact cyclone with a well-defined eye, Gina encountered stronger wind shear and cooler waters. After turning southeast and then east-southeast in response to a rapidly approaching trough, Gina quickly deteriorated as the convection became displaced from the centre. By June 9, the centre became uncertain as Gina stalled to the west-northwest of Port Vila. Winds diminished below gale force the next day.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Gamede quickly intensified, and the JTWC {{classified}} it with {{winds of}} 120km/h (75mph) early on February 22. As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted outflow. At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, outflow became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) north-northeast of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted outflow.|$|E

5|$|An unusually severe Mediterranean {{tropical}} cyclone developed on 23September 1969 southeast of Malta, producing severe flooding. Steep pressure and temperature gradients above the Atlas mountain range were <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> 19September, {{a result of}} cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland; south of the mountains, a lee depression—a low-pressure area in a mountainous region—developed. Under the influence of mountainous terrain, the low initially meandered northeastward. Following the entry of cool sea air, however, it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a Saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22September. Along the front's path, desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction, and in northern Libya, warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the Mediterranean. The organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the Mediterranean Sea on 23September, upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis, rapidly intensifying while southeast of Malta as a cold-core cut-off low, and acquiring tropical characteristics. In western Africa, meanwhile, several disturbances converged toward Mauritania and Algeria, while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast, losing its closed circulation and later dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Later on June20, {{convection}} {{near the}} center of circulation began to decrease–an indication of weakening–and the eye was no longer visible. Upper-level wind shear rapidly increased to 55km/h (35mph), preventing re-intensification of the cyclone. Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June21. Around 1230UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85km/h (50mph 10-minute winds). Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land. Several hours later, the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression. The following day, the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline. The system later dissipated just offshore; a circulation was no longer <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, a large {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa. A tropical system along the wave axis contained a low pressure area as well as an impressive outflow pattern, though initially its convection was disorganized and limited. By September 1 a cyclonic circulation with a diameter of 690miles (1115km) was <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, well to the southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. Several hurricane forecast models anticipated development and strengthening. As it tracked quickly westward, the convection organized and developed into rainbands– bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center– and late on September 1 meteorologists began tracking the system using the Dvorak technique. Low amounts of wind shear and favorable outflow allowed vigorous deep convection to develop and persist near the center, and by 1800UTC on September 2 the system developed into Tropical Depression Nine about 450miles (730km) southwest of Praia, Cape Verde.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} peak intensity, a {{sharp increase in}} wind shear caused Emilia to weaken quickly to winds of 50mph (85km/h). Operationally, the NHC initially continued to assess the storm as with winds of 70mph (115m/h), with hurricane status predicted. However, the decrease in strength became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> July 24, when dry air became entrained in the circulation; at the same time, the convection became limited to the southern semicircle of the storm. On July 25, the wind shear decreased as the storm turned toward the Baja California peninsula, despite that tropical cyclones affecting the Baja California peninsula in the month of July are rare. Convection increased in coverage, and an eye feature re-appeared early on July 26 as it again attained peak winds of 65mph (105km/h).|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2010, a {{surge in}} the monsoon {{produced}} widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea. After a low-level circulation became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> May30, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated {{the system as a}} low pressure area. The low moved northwestward within an area of warm water temperatures of , moderate wind shear, and an upper-level environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first noted the system on May30 as an area of potential development. The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea. At 03:00Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on May31, the IMD designated the system as a depression about 1,000km (620mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260km (785mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman. At 18:00UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was experiencing slight easterly wind shear, which distorted the convection {{to the west}} of the circulation. However, favorable conditions for strengthening were expected, and the depression was forecast to reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before weakening. It tracked slowly northwestward along the southern periphery of a ridge, and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy after convection increased over its circulation center. By that time, wind shear had decreased to very low levels, and with very warm waters, the storm was expected to quickly intensify to reach hurricane status. By late on August30, the convection was wrapping into the center while an eye feature became intermittent. Organization continued, and Kristy attained hurricane status early on August31, about 30hours after forming. Six hours after attaining hurricane status, an eye-like featured was <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, and it is estimated Kristy attained peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) about 550mi (880km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California. However, satellite-derived intensity estimates suggested the hurricane could have been as strong as 105mph (170km/h), or as weak as a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|Upon intensifying into a {{tropical}} storm, Rananim had a better-defined circulation than earlier in its duration; however, the convection was displaced from the center. The structure gradually organized, with increasing outflow and convective symmetry. On August9, the storm {{turned toward the}} northwest due to a building ridge the northeast. At 0600UTC on August10, Rananim intensified into a typhoon about 715km (445mi) east-southeast of Taiwan. Steady strengthening continued, and the storm passed about 365km (225mi) southwest of Okinawa early on August11. Shortly thereafter, Rananim left the PAGASA area of warning responsibility. A small eye became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, and late on August11 the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak winds of 150km/h (90mph). The JTWC, however, assessed Rananim as intensifying slightly more despite decreased outflow, reaching peak winds of 165km/h (105mph).|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} forming, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda. Banding features increased, and outflow became well-established throughout the storm. Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10. Soon after, a large eye became <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> satellite imagery, which became more distinct and organized. The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification, and by August 12, Fernanda reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h); at that time, {{it was a}} Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and was located about 1070 miles (1725km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend. By August 14, the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters, while winds decreased to below major hurricane status, or Category 3 intensity. At that time, the NHC forecast Fernanda to decelerate and turn to the northwest, although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted.|$|E
5|$|As {{infantry}} disembarked {{from the}} landing craft, they often found themselves on sandbars 50 to 100 yards (45 to 90m) out. To reach the beach {{they had to}} wade through water sometimes neck deep, and they still had 200 yards (180m) or more to go when they did reach shore. Those that {{made it to the}} shingle did so at a walking pace because they were so heavily laden. Most sections had to brave the full weight of fire from small arms, mortars, artillery, and interlocking fields of heavy machine gun fire. Where the naval bombardment set grass fires burning, as it had at Dog Red opposite the Les Moulins strongpoint, the smoke obscured the landing troops and prevented effective fire from being laid down by the defenders. Some sections of G/116 and F/116 were able to reach the shingle bank relatively unscathed, though the latter became disorganized after the loss of their officers. G/116 was able to retain some cohesion, but this was soon lost {{as they made their way}} westwards under fire along the shingle in an attempt to reach their assigned objectives. The scattering of the boats was most <b>evident</b> <b>on</b> the 16th RCT front, where parts of E/16, F/16 and E/116 had intermingled, making it difficult for sections to come together to improvise company assaults that might have reversed the situation caused by the mis-landings. Those scattered sections of E/116 landing at Easy Red were able to escape heavy casualties, although, having encountered a deep runnel after being landed on a sandbank, they were forced to discard most of their weapons to make the swim ashore.|$|E
