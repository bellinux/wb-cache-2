5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> return home.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned {{to use them to}} develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> develop a video game at that time.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

5|$|The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies {{changed the}} nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, {{realising}} they probably could not breach it. This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis. However, as successful as this was, {{there was no need for}} the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign. Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance. In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus. Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.|$|E

As such, he sneaks into Smaug's lair {{to try to find a}} weak spot. Bilbo tricks Smaug (James Horan) into showing him his stomach, which is coated in diamonds, except for one small spot, where his skin is exposed. Bilbo leaves, telling the dwarves of Smaug's vulnerability, and is overheard by a nearby thrush, who heads towards Lake-town. Furious that he has been outwitted by Bilbo, Smaug bursts from the mountain and attacks Lake-town. However, the thrush tells Bard of the exposed skin, and Bard fires the Black Arrow into Smaug's chest, killing him.|$|E
25|$|The Carroll Brothers {{were also}} {{consultants}} {{to the many}} record companies who had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> market hip hop music. Vincent Carroll, the magazine's creator-publisher, {{went on to become}} a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting Blow-Up Media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in NYC's Tribeca district. At the age of 21, Vincent employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the culture's biggest and brightest stars (the Fugees, Nelly, the Outzidaz, feat. Eminem and many more). Later other publications spawned up including: Hip Hop Connection, XXL, Scratch, The Source and Vibe. Many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. The 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.|$|E

25|$|Asimov unsuccessfully {{tried to}} end the series with Second Foundation. However, because of the {{predicted}} thousand years until {{the rise of the}} next Empire (of which only a few hundred had elapsed), the series lacked a sense of closure. For decades, fans pressured him to write a sequel. In 1982, Asimov gave in after a 30-year hiatus, and wrote what was at the time a fourth volume: Foundation's Edge. This was followed shortly thereafter by Foundation and Earth. The story of this volume (which takes place some 500 years after Seldon) ties up all the loose ends and brings together all of his Robot, Empire and Foundation novels into a single story. He also opens a brand new line of thought in the last dozen pages regarding Galaxia, a galaxy inhabited by a single collective mind. However, this concept was never explored further. According to his widow Janet Asimov (in her biography of Isaac, It's Been a Good Life), he had no <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> continue after Foundation and Earth, so he started writing the prequels.|$|E
