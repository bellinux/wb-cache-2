5000|$|Fault <b>divorces</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming}} less common today because almost every state now recognizes no-fault divorces. [...] No-fault <b>divorces</b> <b>are</b> more common since {{no proof of}} fault is required. They are not as costly, can be completed faster, and can be less stressful on the family members. However, fault <b>divorces</b> <b>are</b> advantageous if a quick <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> desirable. This type of <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> granted quickly without the waiting period of no-fault <b>divorces</b> where parties <b>are</b> ordered to live apart for a specific amount {{of time before the}} <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> finalized. Another benefit of a fault <b>divorce</b> <b>is</b> the monetary gain. Proof of the accused party’s wrongdoing may result in the court granting the filing spouse a larger portion of the marital property or increased support and alimony. However, fault <b>divorces</b> <b>are</b> considerably more expensive to obtain than no-fault divorces.|$|R

5|$|<b>Divorce</b> <b>was</b> legalized by a {{law passed}} in 1987.
