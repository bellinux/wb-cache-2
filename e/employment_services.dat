The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of <b>Employment</b> <b>Services</b> created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to provide more than 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E

25|$|But by 1997, {{almost no}} {{economic}} development around the Anacostia station had occurred despite the Economic Development Zone incentives or {{existence of the}} new Metro station. In 1999, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams again made development of Poplar Point {{a major focus of}} the District government. The Oliver Carr Co., a major D.C. area real estate developer, offered to build the D.C. Department of <b>Employment</b> <b>Services</b> a new headquarters next to the Anacostia Metro station if the government would sell the company its building at 6th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, but the offer was not accepted. In 2001, the National Capital Planning Commission produced a master plan for the city's memorials and monuments which suggested that Anacostia (including the Anacostia Metro station) become a hub for new memorials.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{unemployment}} rose dramatically during Barry's first administration, as did crime rates, in {{part because}} many of his layoffs were centered {{in the police department}} (1,500 terminations by 1981). His campaign promise to [...] "take the boards off" [...] public housing– i.e., to rehabilitate dilapidated and condemned public housing units– was slow in fulfillment. The city's debt was a constant problem as well: Barry had recalculated the Washington Administration's claim of a $41 million surplus and found that the city was $285 million in debt, a long-term accrual that his annual surpluses were unable to surmount {{by the end of his}} term. Graft and embezzlement among Barry appointees, such as <b>Employment</b> <b>Services</b> director Ivanhoe Donaldson, began late in Barry's first term, although it would not be discovered for several years. Barry was personally touched by a number of [...] "mini-scandals". He had travels with finances he often kept secret. He was first reported to be using cocaine at downtown nightclubs.|$|E

In June, the Far Northeast/Southeast Council, {{a coalition of}} Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANC) and neighborhood civic associations, voted [...] "no-confidence" [...] in Chavous, saying he had been absent from too many community meetings and events and had failed to keep resident informed about major changes in their ward (such as the relocation of the D.C. Department of <b>Employment</b> <b>Services</b> {{and the opening of}} a new charter school). In late July, the Metropolitan Washington Council of the AFL-CIO declined to make an endorsement in the Ward 7 Council primary race, after the Washington Federation of Teachers accused Chavous of ignoring their input on education policy. (The teachers union also declined an endorsement in August.) By August 4, Chavous had only raised $2,100 in contributions, but spent more than $46,500. (He used funds left over from his 1998 mayoral race to reduce that deficit to just $7,100.) [...] Four individuals also challenged Chavous in the Democratic primary: Rev. Robert B. Hunter of Atonement Episcopal Church; Mary D. Jackson, a United States Senate archivist and an ANC member; Durand A. Ford, a financial management consultant; and Gary R. Feenster, a computing analyst. By the end of August, Chavous had raised $6,000 in new contributions, and said he hoped to raise $20,000 more before the general election.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{evaluation}} in the Swedish Public <b>Employment</b> <b>Service,</b> with particular focus on how the use of evaluations looks like. The study consists of two studies. The first one is an analysis of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Service’s</b> all policy documents that describe or mention evaluation as well as an interview-study with all the management staff in one of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Service’s</b> local labor market units. The second study is a comparative study with analysis of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Service’s</b> entire evaluation production for the years 2010 and 2015. The results show that the Swedish Public <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> is a hierarchically controlled governmental organization with routines for effective communication of management's messages to all levels in the organization. <b>Employment</b> <b>Service's</b> evaluation is governed and implemented centrally and communicated from the top, down through the organization. Evaluations are mainly used as a routine for checking and reporting, as well as accounting to the government. Managers on a middle and local level find that much of the evaluation is about control, and that control is not adapted to needs of the everyday business on the local level. Evaluation activities are extensive. Evaluations seems to have become an end in itself, used in legitimizing purposes rather than as a tool for developing of the service to the clients. Half of the evaluations that the <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> carried out by their own, is regular evaluations. Almost all evaluations carried out by the European Social Fund Council in Sweden and “Samordningsförbund” (associations for coordination of social projects) are single occasion-evaluations. Legitimizing dominates the use of evaluation, both 2010 and 2015 in evaluating production. Evaluation for improving of the service to the clients is mentioned only in a small number of policy documents. Evaluations that includes the client’s perspective as well as proposals for change occurs to a limited extent in both 2010 and 2015. The Organization of the <b>Employment</b> <b>Service's</b> evaluation activities are heavily influenced by New Public Management's management philosophy...|$|R
