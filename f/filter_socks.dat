5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the belt material. The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the <b>filter</b> <b>socks</b> and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

A simulated rainfall intensity/duration was chosen in order to pro-duce a direct runoff (Q) per linear unit length of treatment equivalent to that generated in 24 -hour 5 -year return for north Georgia (11. 25 cm [4. 5 in]) using the maximum drainage area allowed for silt fence on a 10 % slope. All sediment control treatments restricted peak runoff flow rates relative to the bare soil (control). All treatments discharged significantly lower tota...|$|E
40|$|MTBE complicates {{remediation}} and {{closure of}} properties contaminated with BTEX and other fuel hydrocarbons. Regulators and {{oil companies are}} becoming increasingly concerned about {{the environmental impact of}} MTBE, because some of its physical properties compromise active remediation methods such as air sparging and pump and treat systems. One of the options to address these limitations is in-situ aerobic bioremediation, which can be enhanced by ORC (Oxygen Release Compound). Several years ago, consultants using ORC noticed that MTBE concentrations decreased at an unusually high rate, relative to the literature in monitoring wells containing ORC <b>filter</b> <b>socks.</b> Working on this empirical foundation, a number of subsequent laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that oxygen can enhance the remediation of MTBE. These basic results and the implications will be discussed in detail. Also, some special features of the work, such as the role of co-oxidative mechanisms and competitive inhibition in MTBE bioremediation will be elucidated...|$|E

A <b>filter</b> <b>sock</b> or <b>filter</b> disk in the pipeline prevents large particulate contaminants from entering the milk bulk tank, but cannot remove bacterial contamination once it has occurred.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{research}} has been done to mastitis detection on farms milking with an AMS Lely Astronaut. The use of the report ‘Udder health’ by the farmers was observed and monitored to find out how farmers act on the mastitis alerts on the report. The study is performed on 7 farms in a circle of 12 kilometres around the town Sint Jacobiparochie, the farmers had to be motivated to participate in the study. A questionnaire was taken in the first visit about mastitis detection. The farmers got 5 visits in total. Each visit the farmer was interviewed about the alerts on the report ‘Udder health’ of that day. Main question was which cows he checked for mastitis, which cows he didn’t check and the reason why. After the interview, all alerts were checked for mastitis by the researcher. Farmers checked the report ‘Udder health’ from 10 times a day to 2 times a week by a quick glance for new alerts. Analysis of the data showed that only 15 alerts of the 421 alerts were checked for mastitis by the farmer, a small percentage of only 3 %. It was found that 80 % of the checked alerts by farmers the alerts appeared to be mastitic quarters, while 38 % of the unchecked alerts were quarters with mastitis. Criteria for farmers to check a cow were an alarming deviation of the milk production, flakes or clots on the <b>filter</b> <b>sock</b> in combination with a high conductivity, or in combination with a failure milking or in combination with an alarming milk production deviation. Cows with an alert on the report ‘Udder health’ were not checked because farmers found no flakes or clots on the <b>filter</b> <b>sock,</b> there was no alarming milk production deviation, the farmer had no time, or when the cow was known for having a repeated alert with a continously high conductivity. 60 % of all alerts on the list didn’t have a mastitis. The succes rate is a synonym for the positive predictive value and shows the percentage of correct alerts on the list. The success rate of the report for mastitis varied from 23 % to 56 % between farms due to differences in prevalence of clinical and subclinical mastitis on the farms and the detection models of the AMS. Because farmers don’t check all alerts, they miss clinical (and subclinical) mastitis cases. A high number of clinical mastitis cases was found in the study. 74 % of the clinical mastitis cases was not detected by the farmer. It appears farmers don’t check all ‘Udder health’ alerts, which leads to missed and untreated clinical mastitis cases on all farms...|$|R

40|$|In {{the closed}} {{chemical}} recovery cycle in the sulphate pulp mill {{it is important}} to remove non-process elements. This is done by clarification of the green liquor, either in clarifiers or in filters. This project focuses on a cassette filter developed by Kvaerner Pulping AB. The cassette filter is semi-continuous and the aim of the project was to model the filter {{in order to be able}} to control cycle time and feed towards optimization of the capacity. The green liquor sludge forms a compressible filter cake when filtered. The model was built on the filter equation for compressible cake filtration and parameters such as filter cloth resistance, compressibility index and specific resistance in the cake were to be determined. The parameters were calculated by minimizing the difference between the calculated model and the measured data. Some simulation experiments were done to examine if optimization was possible. It turned out that the two parameters describing the green liquor (specific resistance in the cake and compressibility) were not identifiable from each other and the third parameter (resistance in the filter cloth) was also sometimes unidentifiable. The simulation experiments showed that the capacity of the cassette filter is hard to optimize during unfavourable conditions controlling only cycle time and feed. Proper actions might be to add lime mud or aluminium to increase the filterability of the green liquor sludge or to wash the <b>filter</b> <b>socks</b> to decrease the resistance in the filter cloths...|$|E
40|$|Source control best {{management}} practices (BMPs) can effectively contribute to {{the reduction in the}} generation of stormwater pollutants. This white paper summarizes literature on source control and other BMPs used at construction sites, at private stormwater facilities, with illicit discharge detection and elimination (IDDE) programs, and in the context of inspections at businesses. The intended audience for this white paper is local government stormwater management program staff in Washington State, especially in the western Washington. Literature reviewed was from a preselected database of publication titles, and a series of ranked questions provided the organizing principle for this white paper. Key findings are as follows: Construction Source Control and BMPs Effective use of construction site TESC BMPs depends on the BMP type and operation and maintenance as well as the site and soil conditions. Based on the literature reviewed, compost blankets and <b>filter</b> <b>socks,</b> permeable check dams, and polyacrylamide (PAM) treatment of other BMPs have the best performance characteristics for controlling sediments and treating erosion at the source. A combination of source control BMPs, runoff BMPs, and chemical treatment BMPs are required to reduce construction site runoff down to permit benchmark levels (25 NTU) to meet water quality standard levels for turbidity. As a widely used TESC BMP, literature indicates that sediment ponds have relatively low performance for containing sediments. This could be improved by a review of sediment pond sizing and design standards...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Climate {{change is}} {{a clear and present}} threat in small {{tropical}} islands, requiring solutions at both global and local levels. The goal of this research was to take a community-based approach to building island resilience against climate change. The removal of local environmental stressors helps to restore natural ecosystem functions, promoting resistance to and more rapid recovery from global climate change impacts. The Humåtak Project was developed as a community-based initiative directed at reviving coastal watersheds, downstream coral reefs, and nearshore fisheries in Guam, Micronesia. A sixpart community engagement strategy was created and serves as a model for other communities. The Humåtak Project addresses accelerated erosion, a major local environmental stressor caused by poor land-use practices. Erosion results in terrigenous sedimentation on coral reefs, which smothers and kills corals, interferes with coral reproduction and recruitment, and destroys essential fish habitat. Nearly 2, 000 volunteer hours were contributed to reducing erosion in the La Sa Fu’a Watershed. Tree seedlings and sediment <b>filter</b> <b>socks</b> were tested as watershed restoration tools over a 21 -month period. These tools were effective in trapping 112 tons of sediment on land. Previous studies indicate a 75 % reduction in sedimentation rate is required to bring Fouha Bay below severe-catastrophic sedimentation stress (> 50 mg cm- 2 day- 1). Based on the observed sediment trapping efficiency of restoration tools in this study, an estimated 0. 05 km 2 of severely eroding hillsides must be treated with 19 km of socks and 11, 000 trees to trap 2, 121 tons of sediment to achieve the necessary reduction. To inform future monitoring efforts as restoration of the watershed continues, deposited sediment in Fouha Bay was analyzed to determine grain size fractions and composition. If sediment input into the bay is controlled, existing sediment will clear out with storm-driven swells. As shown in other high islands, coral reefs are resilient and can recover after sedimentation stress is reduced, provided recruitment and survivorship remain viable. The community engagement strategy and data generated on the effectiveness of watershed restoration tools can be used in management plans to build resilience against climate change in other tropical islands...|$|E

Yet while seatbased exercises, air conditioning <b>filters,</b> flight <b>socks,</b> earplugs, boiled sweets, inflatable pillows, and eyeshades may lessen some of the risks and discomfort associated with flying, the warm, pressurised, sealed cabins of passenger aircraft continue to offer the perfect environment in which certain pests and diseases may thrive and spread. Medical journals are replete with stories of airline passengers contracting a range of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, meningitis, measles, and influenza, from fellow (infected) travellers, while the rapid spread of the SARS virus to over 25 countries around the world in 2003 was attributed, in part, to the long-haul airline network. Since the birth of commercial aviation at the beginning of the twentieth century, airports have found themselves at the forefront of a worldwide battle against the spread of tropical and infectious diseases, and a range of public health interventions have been deployed to try and prevent pests and diseases being transported around the world aboard aircraft.

40|$|An {{erosion and}} {{sedimentation}} {{study was conducted}} and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to evaluate the suitability of using check dams as an erosion control practice on military bases. Military readiness and effectiveness is enhanced by constant training and use of their lands; this training leaves the landscape disturbed and more susceptible to erosion. Check dams are an ideal management practice to study because of their small size versus their relative impact. Five types of check dams were investigated: compost <b>filter</b> berm, compost <b>sock,</b> foam and geotextile berm, plastic dam with a compost blanket, and a riprap berm. The check dams were evaluated in two studies, one on the University of Illinois South Farms and one under a rainfall simulator. Many climactic and soil factors were measured, although the main focus was on runoff and sediment removal. The investigation revealed that all structures effectively reduced the amount of sediment lost; all except the compost sock reduced it by over 50 %. Some variability was observed and all products were statistically similar with high confidence. Compost berms were the least expensive form of check dam and would likely be the best all around option for the military to use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Since 1994, Irish cattle {{have been}} exposed to greater risks of {{acquiring}} Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection {{as a consequence of the}} importation of over 70, 000 animals from continental Europe. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported clinical cases of paratuberculosis in Ireland. This study examines the prevalence of factors that promote the introduction and within-herd transmission of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) on selected Irish dairy farms in the Cork region, and the association between these factors and the results of MAP screening tests on milk <b>sock</b> <b>filter</b> residue (MFR). A total of 59 dairy farms, selected using non-random methods but apparently free of endemic paratuberculosis, were enrolled into the study. A questionnaire was used to collect data about risk factors for MAP introduction and transmission. The MFR was assessed on six occasions over 24 months for the presence of MAP, using culture and immunomagnetic separation prior to polymerase chain reaction (IMS-PCR). Furthermore, blood samples from all entire male and female animals over one year of age in 20 herds were tested by ELISA. Eighteen (31 %) farms had operated as closed herds since 1994, 28 (47 %) had purchased from multiple sources and 14 (24 %) had either direct or indirect (progeny) contact with imported animals. Milk and colostrum were mixed on 51 % of farms, while 88 % of farms fed pooled milk. Thirty (51 %) herds tested negative to MFR culture and IMS-PCR, 12 (20 %) were MFR culture positive, 26 (44 %) were IMS-PCR positive and seven (12 %) were both culture and IMS-PCR positive. The probability of a positive MFR culture was significantly associated with reduced attendance at calving, and with increased use of individual calf pens and increased (but not significantly) if mulitiple suckling was practised. There was poor agreement between MFR culture and MFR IMS-PCR results, but moderate agreement between MFR culture and ELISA test results. This study highlights a lack of awareness among Irish dairy farmers about the effect of inadequate biosecurity on MAP introduction. Furthermore, within-herd transmission will be facilitated by traditional calf rearing and waste management practices. The findings of viable MAP in the presence of known transmission factors in non-clinically affected herds could be a prelude to long-term problems for the Irish cattle and agri-business generally. </p...|$|R
