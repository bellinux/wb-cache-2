Data from the HELIOS facility (HElium Loop for hIgh LOads Smoothing) at CEA Grenoble, France, are used as reference, together with the component models from the recently developed "Cryogenics" Modelica library.

40|$|This thesis {{starts from}} the {{recognition}} that a hydronic heating system can be optimised, but can never be totally perfect. Sooner or later, in practice, deviations - caused {{by one or more}} components having slightly different characteristics or settings than they are assumed or supposed to have - arise. The aim of this work is to show how system design affects the overall sensitivity to deviations, in terms of the effect on performance and return water temperature. The systems that have been analysed are radiator systems and air <b>heaters</b> <b>controlled</b> by <b>valve</b> groups, both supplied by heat from district heating. In particular, the analysis has been concentrated on differences between high-flow and low-flow systems. Based on fundamental theory in this area, as well as on physical measurements made in test rigs, models have been developed and/or applied in order to investigate system function in the desired manner. The effect of deviations have then been shown and quantified, using results from simulations. The simulations show that thermostatic radiator valves are most effective in low-flow systems. Low-flow systems, too, produce the lowest return temperatures. However, incorrect or changed radiator valve settings can result in substantial increased return temperature and differences in room temperatures in such systems. A direct connection of an air heater (that is without recirculation) presents the least risk of control instability, which means that performance tends to be more stable. In this respect, there is no difference whether the system is balanced for a high flow or a low flow. However, balancing does have a considerable effect on the <b>control</b> performance of <b>valve</b> groups with a recirculation connection and with low-flow systems running a greater risk of instability...|$|R

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

30|$|The suction end of {{the return}} piping {{arrangement}} was connected to an air manifold with three automated <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would close and another <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system.

There were six oil <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> on the system, including a lube oil pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> one flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for the oil system.

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty <b>control</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> with load velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional load <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to achieve load velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> achieve load velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the load velocity control ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> a fast opening feature. An actual load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

Complementary to that paper, this paper attempts to answer some questions related to the selection and operation of <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> in air-conditioning systems comprising multiple chillers and chilled water pumps. Explanations are given on the limits imposed on the cooling outputs of air-handling units when they are equipped with three-way <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and are fed with chilled water from a central plant comprising multiple chillers and pumps while some of the chillers and pumps have been shutdown under part-load conditions. The Interactions between the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and the chilled water pumps, as they are cycled on and off, in a single-loop and a two-loop pumping system are analysed. The conclusions Include that the differential pressure bypass <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> in a single-loop pumping system should be sized for a flow handling capacity significantly greater than the flow rate of one chiller. For minimising the disturbances to the temperature control function of air-conditioning systems, <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> with linear Inherent characteristics should be used for differential pressure bypass control. Furthermore, for a two-loop pumping system, both the chiller on and off settings for a conventional de-coupler bypass control system should be based on surplus flow rates, and the on/off control over the secondary-loop pumps should avoid requiring each pump to handle a flow rate significantly greater than its rated flow rate.
