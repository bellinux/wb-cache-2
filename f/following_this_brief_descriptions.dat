Self-gravity is important in determining the basic structures of cosmic bodies as well as producing some intriguing instabilities. Radiation, by which we observe these bodies, produces forces that may be disruptive to their basic structures and {{be a source of}} vigorous fluid dynamical activity in the form of photon bubbles and radiatively driven vortices...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPhagocytosis {{is defined}} as the receptor-mediated {{engulfment}} of large (≥ 0. 5 μm) particles into plasma membrane-derived vacuoles called phagosomes. Following scission from the plasma membrane, the phagosomes undergo a maturation process, sequentially fusing with endosomes and lysosomes, ultimately becoming phagolysosomes — highly acidic and hydrolase-rich organelles that degrade the internalized particles. <b>This</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> is a gross oversimplification of a highly complex and precisely choreographed process. Indeed, phagosome formation and maturation have emerged as paradigms to investigate many key questions in cell biology, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal remodeling, membrane dynamics and trafficking, and even gene expression...|$|R

Damp and soggy where it was not sharp and rocky, buffeted by storm winds and lashed by the sea, with the air {{continually}} a-tremble with the bellowing of two hundred thousand amphibians, it was a melancholy and miserable sojourning-place. Maud, who had prepared me for disappointment, and who had been sprightly and vivacious all day, broke down as we landed in our own little cove. She strove bravely to hide it from me, but while I was kindling another fire I knew she was stifling her sobs in the blankets under the sail-tent.|$|R

However, much of the life and interest of the subject, and indeed many of its original ideas, flow from a very wide range of applications, for example: astronomy, spatially distributed telecommunications, wireless network modeling and analysis, modeling of channel fading, forestry, the statistical theory of shape, material science, multivariate analysis, problems in image analysis and stereology. There are links to statistical mechanics, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and implementations of the theory in statistical computing (for example, spatstat in R). Most recently determinantal and permanental point processes (connected to random matrix theory) are beginning to play a role.|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in studies documenting the world’s languages. Most of these studies concentrate on spoken languages but there is a growing effort to document sign languages. In this short paper we describe one of the many undocumented sign languages of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory of Australia. This Indigenous sign language is known locally as Yolŋu Sign Language (YSL). Although this language is used in daily interaction, many of its users are not aware that it is a language per se. With <b>this</b> <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> of YSL we hope to make our readers aware of the existence of this language.
