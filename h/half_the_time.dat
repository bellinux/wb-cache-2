Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature of his recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{featured}} {{a mix of}} mostly four pitches: a four-seam fastball (90–93mph), a cutter (84–87), a curveball (76–79), and a changeup (83–86). Increasingly, he also threw a two-seam fastball at 89–91mph. Cain led with his four-seamer, throwing it over <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in his career. His changeup was his secondary pitch to left-handed hitters, while he threw cutters as a secondary pitch to right-handed hitters. Cain threw curveballs in roughly equal proportions to righties and lefties.|$|E

5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy! programs.

During 2007, the IBM team was given three to five years and a staff of 15 people to solve the problems. By 2008, the developers had advanced Watson such that it could compete with Jeopardy! champions. By February 2010, Watson could beat human Jeopardy! contestants on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its supercharging stations.

Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war.

The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E

The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, which had been a {{candidate}} for the 1976 Games. However, a change in provincial government brought in an administration which did not support the Olympic bid, so the offer was rejected. Salt Lake City, a candidate for the 1972 Games, offered itself, but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck, which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games. Despite only having <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted the invitation to replace Denver in February 1973.

25|$|Average load factor, {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity.

If a transit vehicle spends <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> running at 100% and <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> running at 0%, the average load factor is 50%.
