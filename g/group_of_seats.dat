60|$|Luke and Mr. Dobson {{were even}} now {{making their way}} to the same <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats.</b> They had--like the jury and the coroner--been in the {{mortuary}} to have a last look at the murdered man. Louisa thought that Luke looked years older than he had done yesterday. She saw him standing for a moment right against the dull, drabby background of the court room wall; and it seemed as if something of that drabbiness had descended upon his soul. Youth seemed to have gone out of him. He appeared to be looking out onto a dreary world through windows obscured by grime.|$|E

50|$|If an at-large {{election}} {{is called to}} choose a single candidate, a single-winner voting system must necessarily be used.

5000|$|On {{one side}} is the judge's bench, the tables for the plaintiff, the defendant, and their {{respective}} counsel, and a separate <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> known as the jury box where the jury sits (in jurisdictions that allow for jury trials). Apart from {{the parties to the}} case and any witnesses, only the lawyers can literally pass the bar (court personnel and jury members usually enter through separate doors), and this is the reason why the term [...] "the bar" [...] has come to refer to the legal profession as a whole (see bar association). There is usually a podium or lectern between the two tables where the lawyers may stand when they argue their case before the judge.|$|E
50|$|The theater's focus {{went back}} to first run films by the mid-1980s due to an {{increase}} in video VHS releases and cable. In the mid-1980s the theater owners did a $400,000 renovation. They removed a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> from the downstairs auditorium so a projector could be installed. The seating capacity was changed to 546 seats. The owners changed the balcony into two 125-seat each mini-theaters. The 1939-era carbon-arc projectors were replaced with platter-system projectors. The balcony screens received an ultrastereo sound system, while Dolby was used for the downstairs screens. The theater owners installed a café in the upstairs area and elevators. New paint in gray and blue was applied to the interior. On May 15, 1986, the renovated theater re-opened.|$|E

The children wear red Young Communist neckerchiefs and a Russian slogan {{on the wall}} behind them exhorts them to “Study and Learn”. One pupil on the right, however, looks away to the viewer’s right, like a typical schoolboy losing focus and finding something more interesting to see outdoors.|$|R

He perceived that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step. Before him, on that level, were <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>seats</b> and a little kiosk.

5000|$|In the Gospel of Mark (16:12) Jesus {{is said to}} have {{appeared}} to them [...] "in another form", which may be why he is depicted beardless here, as opposed to the bearded Christ in Calling of St Matthew, where a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>seated</b> money counters is interrupted by the recruiting Christ. It is also a recurring theme in Caravaggio's paintings to find the sublime interrupting the daily routine. The unexalted humanity is apt for this scene, since the human Jesus has made himself unrecognizable to his disciples, and at once confirms and surmounts his humanity. Caravaggio seems to suggest that perhaps a Jesus could enter our daily encounters. The dark background envelops the tableau.|$|R
