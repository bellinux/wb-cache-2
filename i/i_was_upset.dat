5|$|I sent MalcolmX {{some rough}} {{chapters}} to read. I was appalled {{when they were}} soon returned, red-inked in many places where he had told of his almost father-and-son relationship with Elijah Muhammad. Telephoning MalcolmX, I {{reminded him of his}} previous decisions, and I stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what was to lie ahead, then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama. MalcolmX said, gruffly, 'Whose book is this?' I told him 'yours, of course,' and that I only made the objection in my position as a writer. But late that night MalcolmX telephoned. 'I'm sorry. You're right. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> about something. Forget what I wanted changed, let what you already had stand.' I never again gave him chapters to review unless I was with him. Several times I would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read, but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that Hinrich {{dropped out of}} {{his commitment to the}} US national team so that he could focus on his wedding, and to [...] "hitting the weights" [...] hard. In April 2008, Hinrich revealed that he would not play for Team USA in the Beijing Olympics since his wife was expecting a baby. He said of the Olympics, [...] "It wasn't like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> about anything. It just wasn't working out for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wasn't upset for me ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> for the Medal of Honor, {{that they}} just didn't know what it even was. It {{represents}} all {{of the guys who}} lost their lives – the guys who never came back. Everyone who put {{their lives on the line}} for their country. You're supposed to know what the Medal of Honor is", he said. The incident led to a national debate about post 9/11 airport security practices and their ramifications on the average citizen.|$|E

"Bless you, miss, {{his father}} <b>is</b> a sceptic. <b>I</b> can't go while I've got no clothes--nothing better than this, miss; and <b>I</b> always <b>was</b> {{used to go}} decent and respectable.

2500|$|The {{cover was}} also {{inspired}} by a photograph taken during the Kosovo War, which Donwood said [...] "was of a square metre of snow and {{it was full of}} the detritus of war, all military stuff and fag stains. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> by it in a way war had never upset me before. It felt like it was happening in my street." [...] Donwood painted on large canvases with knives and sticks, then photographed the paintings and manipulated them with Photoshop.|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} game, Crisp reached base {{in his next}} at-bat, and {{attempted}} to steal 2nd Base once again. On this steal attempt however, Rays 2nd Baseman Akinori Iwamura was covering the bag. Unlike his previous steal attempt, Crisp slid feet first, resembling the way a runner would attempt {{to break up a}} double play by sliding into the player covering the base. Crisp was out on the play. Rays manager Joe Maddon engaged in a heated argument with Crisp upon Maddon making a mound visit, Crisp being in the Red Sox dugout at that time. Joe Maddon said after the game's conclusion, [...] "I was not pleased with the slide. I totally felt there was intent to hurt our middle infielder and that's what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> with. There's no place for that when you intentionally try to hurt somebody." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF in 1988, {{in part due}} to {{backstage}} problems between the Bulldogs, specifically the Dynamite Kid, and the Rougeau Brothers over a prank pulled by Curt Hennig. The Bulldogs, noted ribbers (pranksters) in their own right, were blamed for the prank, leading to a series of confrontations that culminated in Jacques Rougeau knocking out four of the Dynamite Kid's teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite, allegedly, brought to tears) in Miami. While Rougeau was playing cards backstage, from behind, Billington smacked Jacques in the ear and then punched and kicked him in the face several times and also struck Raymond, who was on crutches at the time. It was weeks before Jacques responded. Bret Hart wrote about the incident, in his book HITMAN: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling: [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset,</b> and contemplated getting involved. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that Tom had been asking for this for years and that everyone who'd been bullied by him would rejoice at the news." [...] After no disciplinary action was taken against Jacques, Billington quit the WWF, and Smith followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset,</b> I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E
2500|$|The shoot {{took place}} in Arizona during October. The crew were unused to the improvisational, {{on-the-fly}} directing style that Russell implemented. Rather than preparing organized shot lists, Russell preferred to use ideas as they came to him, often asking for longer hours. Early on, some of the crew began to feel a dislike for these methods and Russell along with them. Clooney noted that [...] "there's an element of David that was in way over his head... he was vulnerable and selfish, and it would manifest itself {{in a lot of}} yelling." [...] When Russell's frustration would lead to outbursts, Clooney would take it upon himself to defend crew members and extras, leading to increased tensions. When an extra had an epileptic seizure on set, Clooney ran to his aid while Russell apparently remained indifferent to the matter. Afterward, Clooney criticized Russell for ignoring the incident, though Russell later stated that he was busy setting up a shot some yards away from the extra and was not aware that the extra had suffered a seizure. Another on-set conflict between the two arose while shooting footage on a Humvee with a camera mounted to it. Clooney recalls Russell yelling at the driver to drive faster. Clooney then approached the director, telling him to [...] "knock it off". Russell remembers the incident differently: [...] "The camera broke, we were losing the day and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> about that. So I jumped off the truck and I was like, 'Fuck!' I was just kicking the dirt and everything like that. And then George had this big thing about defending the driver, whom I hadn't really said anything to." [...] During the shoot, Clooney was exhausted as he was still shooting ER in Los Angeles three days a week, while working on Three Kings the other four.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{glad that}} you take it in that way," [...] she said. [...] "I {{can assure you that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly <b>upset</b> over it when I heard it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--er--I really don't know, Thomas. You see <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much <b>upset,</b> {{thinking}} my bonds were no good. Perhaps {{the yellow}} envelope {{was in the}} box, under the bonds." ...|$|R

6000|$|Oh, don't {{say things}} like that to me. It breaks my heart. I wouldn't ever have told you only <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> by your going. If they'd only given me time {{to get used to the}} thought I wouldn't ... I wouldn't make such a fool of myself.|$|E

Only one person ever {{used to call}} me Cilla;' and she paused, and went on afresh--'So it was for Bertha's sake and Mervyn's that Honor escorted you abroad. So much Robert told me; but I don't {{understand}} it yet. It had haunted me the whole winter that Robert was the only Mr. Fulmort she could nurse; and if he told you <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset,</b> it was that I did not quite know whether he were ghost or body when I saw him there in the old place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{got good}} seats, but--well, {{you know how}} it is, once things start going wrong.

Put it on the floor and crammed it under the seat, just to save himself the trouble of holding it on his lap! And, when I showed him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset,</b> all he said was that he was a pitcher and not a hatstand!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Snowsill {{missed out}} on {{selection}} for the Australian London 2012 Olympic Triathlon Team. She appealed her omission but was turned down by the Tribunal. Snowsill decided not to take her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport saying [...] "Whilst <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>upset</b> with the outcome, I have to respect {{the decision of the}} Tribunal and will not be pursuing the matter further." [...] In a gracious response Snowsill went on to wish the three selected women (Emma Moffatt, Erin Densham and Emma Jackson) good luck for their race in London.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Philip sullenly, [...] "she does. It {{is a long}} story, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too <b>upset</b> to tell it you now. It {{will soon}} {{be all over the}} country I suppose." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I don't {{know that}} the actual time for my being consecrated, if I live, is nearer by reason of this letter: I think it most {{probable}} that it may take place when the General Synod meets, and, consequently, five bishops will be present, in 1862, at Nelson. But I suppose it is more fixed {{than it has been}} hitherto, and if the Bishop writes to you, as he may do, even more plainly than he speaks to me, you will know what especially to ask for me from God, and all you dear ones will recollect daily how I do inwardly tremble at the thoughts of what is to come. Do you remember how strangely <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset</b> before leaving home for my ordination as a deacon; and now it is coming to this--a church to be planted, organised, edified among the wild heathen inhabitants of Melanesia; and what hope can there be for me {{if there is to be}} no growth of a fervent, thankful, humble spirit of prayer and love and adoration? Not that, as I feel to my great comfort, God's work is dependent upon the individual growth in grace even of those who are entrusted with any given work; but it is in some way connected with it.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the crying}} of sheer rage. The brute! Not to have control {{enough to stop}} short of digging his claws into that {{precious}} mite! Just because the poor little thing cried at that cat's stare of his! The brute! The devil! And {{he would come to}} her and whine about it, and say: [...] "My Gyp, I never meant--how should I know I was hurting? Her crying was so--Why should she cry at me? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset!</b> I wasn't thinking!" [...] She could hear him pleading and sighing to her to forgive him. But she would not--not this time! He had hurt a helpless thing once too often. Her fit of crying ceased, and she lay listening to the tick of the clock, and marshalling in her mind a hundred little evidences of his malevolence toward her baby--his own baby. How was it possible? Was he really going mad? And a fit of such chilly shuddering seized her that she crept under the eider down to regain warmth. In her rage, she retained enough sense of proportion to understand that he had done this, just as he had insulted Monsieur Harmost and her father--and others--in an ungovernable access of nerve-irritation; just as, perhaps, one day he would kill someone. But to understand this did not lessen her feeling. Her baby! Such a tiny thing! She hated him at last; and she lay thinking out the coldest, the cruellest, the most cutting things to say. She had been too long-suffering.|$|E
6000|$|This form of mediumship {{gives the}} very highest results, {{and yet in}} its very nature is liable to self-deception. Are we using our own hand or is an outside power {{directing}} it? It is only by the information received that we can tell, and even {{then we have to}} make broad allowance for the action of our own subconscious knowledge. It is worth while perhaps to quote what appears {{to me to be a}} thoroughly critic-proof case, so that the inquirer may see how strong the evidence is that these messages are not self-evolved. This case is quoted in Mr. Arthur Hill's recent book Man Is a Spirit (Cassell & Co.) and is contributed by a gentleman who takes the name of Captain James Burton. He is, I understand, the same medium (amateur) through whose communications the position of the buried ruins at Glastonbury have recently been located. [...] "A week after my father's funeral I was writing a business letter, when something seemed to intervene between my hand and the motor centres of my brain, and the hand wrote at an amazing rate a letter, signed with my father's signature and purporting to come from him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>upset,</b> and my right side and arm became cold and numb. For a year after this letters came frequently, and always at unexpected times. I never knew what they contained until I examined them with a magnifying-glass: they were microscopic. And they contained a vast amount of matter with which it was impossible for me to be acquainted." [...] "Unknown to me, my mother, who was staying some sixty miles away, lost her pet dog, which my father had given her. The same night I had a letter from him condoling with her, and stating that the dog was now with him. 'All things which love us and are necessary to our happiness in the world are with us here.' A most sacred secret, known to no one but my father and mother, concerning a matter which occurred years before I was born, was afterwards told me in the script, with the comment: 'Tell your mother this, and she will know that it is I, your father, who am writing.' My mother had been unable to accept the possibility up to now, but when I told her this she collapsed and fainted. From that moment the letters became her greatest comfort, for they were lovers during the forty years of their married life, and his death almost broke her heart.|$|E
