The {{total number of}} bronze medals <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in three sports: badminton, boxing and table tennis (except the team events).|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, Texas had a gross state product (GSP) of $1.648 trillion, {{the second}} highest in the U.S. Its GSP <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> GDPs of Australia and South Korea, which are the world's 12th- and 13th-largest economies, respectively. Texas' economy is the fourth-largest of any country {{subdivision}} globally, behind England (as part of the UK), California, and Tokyo Prefecture. Its Per Capita personal income in 2009 was $36,484, ranking 29th in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> mean free path, if still less than the diffusion length. On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

5|$|If {{the target}} value <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{greatest}} {{value in the}} array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary, which empties {{into the}} Bristol Channel, has {{traditionally}} been thought to have the second largest tidal range in the world– about , exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy in Canada.

5|$|The {{total number}} of bronze medals <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{total number of}} gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in four sports: boxing, judo, karate and wrestling. In the women's 50m {{freestyle}} event of swimming, a tie for the second position between two swimmers from Italy meant that two silver medals (and no bronze) were awarded.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for {{second place in the}} parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{are awarded}} in each weight class. Therefore, {{the total number}} of bronze medals <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> total number of gold or silver medals. An {{exception}} was the men's 84kg Greco-Roman wrestling, where Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his medal due to his conduct during the medal ceremony. Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 100 metres in athletics and no bronze was awarded. Ties for third in swimming's men's 100 metre backstroke and men's 100 metre freestyle meant that two bronze medals were awarded for those events.|$|E

5|$|The console {{features}} parental controls, {{which can}} be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or Virtual Console game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the Internet Channel and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to Nintendo GameCube functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite {{the direction of the}} curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{atomic number}} 54; that is, its nucleus {{contains}} 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761kg/m3, about 4.5 times {{the density of}} the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217kg/m3. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even water. Under the same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640g/cm3, <b>is</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average density of granite, 2.75g/cm3. Under gigapascals of pressure, xenon forms a metallic phase.|$|E
