5|$|A lyotropic {{liquid crystal}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics <b>have</b> <b>another</b> degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases.|$|E

5|$|Muscle cells <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{specialized}} {{function of}} smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.|$|E

5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} of the capitol. After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush the ball in three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would <b>have</b> <b>another</b> election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} innings, Brown captained Australia while Bradman was absent with fibrositis. The {{tourists}} fell for 331, with debutants Sam Loxton and Doug Ring taking three wickets apiece. India eventually fell to another innings defeat, so Brown did not <b>have</b> <b>another</b> opportunity {{to score a}} Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86, in contrast to his away average of 1,369 runs at 50.70.

5|$|Groves {{expected}} to <b>have</b> <b>another</b> atomic bomb {{ready for use}} on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E

The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with this is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{precautions}} against further resistance, Darius sent {{soldiers to}} seize Intaphernes, {{along with his}} son, family members, relatives and any friends who were capable of arming themselves. Darius believed that Intaphernes was planning a rebellion, {{but when he was}} brought to the court, there was no proof of any such plan. Nonetheless, Darius killed Intaphernes's entire family, excluding his wife's brother and son. She was asked to choose between her brother and son. She chose her brother to live. Her reasoning for doing so was that she could <b>have</b> <b>another</b> husband and another son, but she would always have but one brother. Darius was impressed by her response and spared both her brother's and her son's life.|$|E
