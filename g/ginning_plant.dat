50|$|Robersonville soon {{developed}} into {{a leader of the}} industrial revolution, which has characterized the economy of Martin County in the last half-century. In 1910, the Robersonville Hosiery and Manufacturing Co. was incorporated. In 1912, the firm was reorganized as Robersonville-Tar River Hosiery Mill, Inc. The ruins of this brick building still stand on the corner of N. Railroad and Mill Streets. Most of the industry - a large cotton <b>ginning</b> <b>plant,</b> lumber mills, and grist mills - {{in the early part of}} the 20th century focused on the handling of agricultural or lumber products. Southeastern Tobacco Co. operated a large tobacco redrying and stemming plant for many years. John Henry Roberson, Jr., a direct descendent of the founders of Robersonville, owned his own farm south of Robersonville, and was involved in many civic affairs with his brothers David Roberson and Grover H. Roberson. Grover H. Roberson left the Robersonville area in early 1940 to join the U.S. Navy. Grover saw action at the Battle of Anzio. After the Battle of Anzio, Grover was in the company of a group of other naval officers and had a special audience with Pope Pius XIV at the Vatican in Rome, Italy. Some of the early industries were not directly related to agriculture. The D.B. Parker Buggy Co. began in 1903 and operated until its product was replaced by the automobile. Established in 1905, the Carolina Brick Co. made ornamental bricks with a capacity of 30,000 daily. Since the late 1950s, a wider range of industry has appeared. In 1958, a poultry processing company was opened by Austin Farms. This plant was later purchased by Central Soya of Athens, Inc. and then later owned by Perdue. Also in 1958, Robersonville Manufacturing Co. was chartered as a maker of children's clothes. John Henry Roberson, Jr. lived on Broad Street and worked in the local tobacco market for many years. It expanded and was acquired by Blue Gem, which had its origins as the Hamilton Pants Manufacturing Company. Later it was changed to Southern Apparel. Robersonville Products Co. opened in 1970. As a division of Hallmark, it produced display fixtures for retail stores. After closing in 1993, the building was used by Empire Brush Company. Also in 1970, Blue Ridge Shoe Co. opened and began making children's shoes. Later the building was bought by Sandra Manufacturing Co., a sewing plant later known as Generation II, and then later as Ithaca Inc. and recently Caraustar. Microcell Corp., a hydrogen fuel company is moving into the old Caraustar building. Carolina Peanuts was started by locals as a small company but later grew after being acquired by Anheuser-Busch. Eagle Snacks later changed to Guy Snacks and is now known as Ann's House of Nuts. For a few years, W.M. Green had a catalog showroom. Today the town's biggest entertainment venue is East Carolina Motor Speedway, a racetrack. East Carolina Motor Speedway opened its first season in 1989 with the thoughts of having a much needed attraction for racing fans throughout Eastern North Carolina. This D-shaped, 3/8 mile track has 24 degree banking in its turns as well as 10 degree banking on its straight-a-ways. The track is 40 feet wide, allowing cars to run three-wide for added excitement to its spectators. The grandstand can seat 3,000 fans and VIP booths located in turn four provide a first-class view of the entire track and pit area. The Filling Station Restaurant has an interesting historical artifact. Go check out the work of art while enjoying a delicious meal. In the 1940s, Bill Bemis worked at Jim Johnson's store in nearby Gold Point, North Carolina and painted pictures for a hobby. Using enamel paints, he created a mural on the inside walls of the store. The mural depicts then store owner Jim Johnson and his daughters Mable and Peggy and their dog, in a fox hunt scene. This store was later called the Grant Vandiford store until it was moved to Robersonville to be part of the dining room of the Filling Station Restaurant. After the move, Bill Bemis retouched his work, so, the fox hunt mural is as bright and colorful today as it was 60 years ago.The volunteer fire department was first organized in 1924 with William Gray as the first fire chief and police chief. The rescue squad was organized in 1959 and was the first one in Martin County. It was sponsored by the Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jay Cee's) under the leadership of John L. House and Robert E. Lee. A municipal building houses the police, fire, and rescue departments as well as the public library. Town council meetings are held 2nd Tuesday of every month at 7:30 p.m. in the Paul D. Roberson Boardroom at the Town Hall, located in the old Wachovia Bank building at 114 S. Main Street. Most of the meetings are open to the public. Although the railroad has been replaced by the new US 64 Bypass as the town’s main link to the outside world, Robersonville continues to thrive, providing needed services, industry and entertainment to local and out-of-town residents alike.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Numerous {{conventional}} {{roller gin}} stands were modified {{to run at}} high speed in commercial ginning plants in 2005 and 2006. The high-speed stands ginned both Pima and upland cotton. Results from a field test at a commercial <b>ginning</b> <b>plant</b> that compared roller ginning (including one high-speed stand) and saw ginning using one upland cultivar showed that HVI color grade, staple length, uniformity, and fiber value were improved when using the roller gin stands. Results from the 2006 California crop showed similar improvements in staple length and uniformity when comparing roller-ginned upland cotton (which included conventional and high-speed stands) and saw-ginned upland cotton. Textile mills that value the significance of improved fiber properties {{were willing to pay}} a premium for roller-ginned upland cotton.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of by-products from the cotton ginning industry for incorporation into growth media for three vegetable crops was examined. Composts were prepared by mixing the by-product with soil in 5 ratios (20 : 80, 40 : 60, 60 : 40, 80 : 20, 100 : 0, v/v compost and soil). Seeds of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and spinach (Spinacia oleraceae L.) were sown directly within the composts and in 100 % peat (control) in October (autumn crop) and December (winter crop). Plant growth (height, leaf number, dry and fresh weight, chlorophyll content) was recorded 19 and 17 days after transplantation (first and second sowing respectively) and at harvest. Fresh and dry weight was recorded at harvest. Overall, plant height and leaf number were higher when the growth media consisted principally of compost (higher ratios of cotton by-product: soil) {{than in the}} control (peat), whereas among the various ratios of compost: soil significant differences were recorded, media with a high compost content showing better growth in most cases. Similar results were reported for fresh and dry weight and chlorophyll content, except for dry weight in the second sowing, where growth media with a lower compost content had a higher dry weight. In conclusion, the incorporation of the cotton ginning by-product into compost resulted in better growth of lettuce, spinach and radish, suggesting {{that the use of}} this material may be of economical value as a spin-off product for the cotton <b>ginning</b> <b>plant</b> and also as a means of reducing present pollution of the environment due to the accumulation of waste material...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown the {{feasibility}} of production of masonry blocks and panels from agglomeration of cotton gin waste and calcium binders. Cotton gin waste {{is a serious problem}} for <b>ginning</b> <b>plants,</b> because in Argentina approximately 300, 000 t of lignocellulosic wastes are produced annually without any final disposal destination. The accumulation of these residues is associated with pests and fire hazards. Since these composites are produced with simple equipment and a minimum energy requirement, their cost depends mainly on the binder (Portland cement) used and the process efficiency, since with a high productivity model, labor and equipment depreciation costs are significantly reduced. This paper analyzes the influence of CaCl 2. 2 H 2 O (added as an accelerator for cement paste strength) on the minimum molding time required for composites manufacturing. A central composite experimental design was developed in order to study the interrelated variables. The influence of CaCl 2. 2 H 2 O content on physical-mechanical cement paste properties and their relationship with composites stability are also evaluated. The results of this work show that CaCl 2. 2 H 2 O content has significant influence on the efficiency of composites manufacturing as it reduces the molding time required...|$|R

In 1908, Gholston gained control of the Comer Oil Mill, <b>gin,</b> and fertilizer <b>plant.</b> At this point in time, the other wealthy families of Comer faded from the scene. With the coming of World War I, agriculture began to flourish again, until prices dropped again in the 1920s. In 1918, with even more money coming in, Gholston built the water system in Comer, which the City of Comer now owns. Approximately 2,000 feet of water mains were laid in town for the businesses, and the protection of private property. So confident of this system was Gholston, that he was never known to carry fire insurance.|$|R

40|$|Sugars have {{signaling}} {{roles in}} a wide variety of developmental processes in plants. To elucidate the regulatory components that constitute the glucose signaling network governing plant growth and development, we have isolated and characterized two Arabidopsis glucose insensitive mutants, gin 5 and gin 6, based on a glucose-induced developmental arrest during early seedling morphogenesis. The T-DNA-tagged gin 6 mutant abrogates the glucose-induced expression of a putative transcription factor, ABI 4, previously shown to be involved in seed-specific abscisic acid (ABA) responses. Thus, ABI 4 might be a regulator involved in both glucose- and seed-specific ABA signaling. The characterization of the gin 5 mutant, on the other hand, reveals that glucose-specific accumulation of ABA is essential for hexokinase-mediated glucose responses. Consistent with this result, we show that three ABA-deficient mutants (aba 1 - 1, aba 2 - 1, and aba 3 - 2) are also glucose insensitive. Exogenous ABA can restore normal glucose responses in gin 5 and aba mutants but not in <b>gin</b> 6 <b>plants.</b> Surprisingly, only abi 4 and abi 5 - 1 but not other ABA-insensitive signaling mutants (abi 1 - 1, abi 2 - 1, and abi 3 - 1) exhibit glucose insensitivity, indicating the involvement of a distinct ABA signaling pathway in glucose responses. These results provide the first direct evidence to support a novel and central role of ABA in plant glucose responses mediated through glucose regulation of both ABA levels by GIN 5 and ABA signaling by GIN 6 /ABI 4...|$|R

40|$|Arizona has {{experienced}} a trend toward increasing fiber micronaire values in recent years resulting in substantial discounts on fiber value. There is some evidence to suggest management can impact fiber micronaire. Approximately 250 cases were identified in cotton production areas in Arizona ranging from the lower Colorado River Valley to near 2, 000 ft. elevation with grower cooperators in the 2000 season. Field records were developed for each field by use of the University of Arizona Cotton Monitoring System (UA-CMS) for points such as variety, planting date, fertility management, irrigation schedules, irrigation termination, defoliation, etc. Routine plant measurements were conducted to monitor crop growth and development and to identify fruiting patterns and retention through the season. As the crop has approached cutout and the lower bolls began to open, open boll samples have been collected from the lowest four, first position bolls (theoretically the bolls with the highest micronaire potential on the plant) from 10 <b>plants,</b> <b>ginned,</b> and the fiber analyzed for micronaire (low 4).

In 1900 and 1912 Joshua suffered major fires. In spite of this, new businesses continued to open. The Citizen's Banking Company, opened in 1904, was run by J. W. Spencer. Two years later a public water system began. Truck gardens, orchards, and corn and cotton farms surrounded Joshua. In 1912 the Fort Worth South Traction Line began to provide service from Cleburne to Fort Worth and had a stop in Joshua. Service stopped in 1932 because of the growing importance of automobile travel. The first car in Joshua was purchased in 1913. By 1914 the community had a population of 824, two cotton <b>gins,</b> an ice <b>plant,</b> a bank, a newspaper named the Joshua Star, and four churches. Local farms grew cotton and potatoes. In the mid-1950s Joshua was incorporated, with Ted Strube as the first mayor. The population dropped to 550 during the 1950s and rose to 924 in 1970. By 1980 it was 1,470. Because of its proximity to Fort Worth, the population grew to 3,828 by 1990. Joshua had fourteen businesses in 1970 and fifty-eight in 1980, when seven local manufacturers made such items as aluminum products, boat trailers, leather goods, and windows.

These phenotypes could be rescued when the plants were grown on sucrose (Suc) or glucose (Glc). Here we address the question whether Glc-sensing hexokinase 1 (HXK 1) defective in the Glc insensitiv 2 (gin 2 - 1) mutant is involved in the sugar-dependent rescue of adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2. Triple mutants defective in the TPT, AGPase and HXK 1 (adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2 /gin 2 - 1) were established as homozygous lines and grown together with Col- 0 and Ler wild-type <b>plants,</b> <b>gin</b> 2 - 1, the adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2 double mutant and the adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2 /gpt 2 - 1 triple mutant (additionally defective in the glucose 6 -phosphate/phosphate translocator 2 [GPT 2]) on agar in {{the presence or absence of}} 50 mM of each Glc, Suc or fructose (Fru). The growth phenotype of the double mutant and both triple mutants could be rescued to a similar extent only by Glc and Suc, but not by Fru, All three sugars were capable of rescuing the HCF- and photosynthesis phenotype, irrespectively of the presence or absence of HXK 1. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of sugar responsive genes revealed that plastidial HXK (pHXK) was up-regulated in adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2 plants grown on sugars, but showed no response in adg 1 - 1 /tpt- 2 /gin 2 - 1. It appears likely that soluble sugars are directly taken up by the chloroplasts and enter further metabolism, which consumes ATP and NADPH from the photosynthetic light reaction and thereby rescues the photosynthesis phenotype of the double mutant. The implication of sugar turnover and probably signaling inside the chloroplasts for the concept of retrograde signaling is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Six {{upland cotton}} (G. hirsutum L.) {{varieties}} were crossed in all possible combinations. The parents and F 1 were sown in a replicated experiment. Hayman�s diallel cross analysis {{was employed to}} investigate the nature of gene action involved in the inheritance of number of sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant, boll weight, yield, ginning out turn %, staple length, fiber fineness and fiber strength. The diallel analysis revealed that all the characters were polygenically inherited and exhibited partial dominance with additive gene action. The estimation of component of variation for these characters suggested that the (D) additive component was significant in all the traits under study and was lower than dominant components (H 1 and H 2) of variation except for number of sympodial branches per plant, number of bolls per plant and seed cotton yield per plant, where the dominant components were higher in magnitude than additive. The positive estimate of F indicated that dominant genes were in excess than recessive genes in the parents for all the traits except for ginning out turn percentage and fiber fineness. The ratio of H 2 / 4 H 1 indicated largely asymmetry {{of positive and negative}} genes in parents for number of bolls per plant, seed cotton yield, staple length, fiber fineness and fiber strength, and symmetrical distribution of positive and negative genes in the parents was observed for number of sympodial branches per plant, boll weight and ginning out turn percentage.
