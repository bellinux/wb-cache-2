40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a novel three-speed <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> that {{integrates}} a basic epicyclic-type gear train with an exterior-rotor brushless DC (BLDC) motor to form a compact structural assembly. Unlike existing <b>gear</b> <b>motors,</b> the proposed device provides three speed ratios including an under drive, a direct drive, and an over drive, and is operated with a single clutch-to-clutch shaft. It provides a wider speed range than the traditional <b>geared</b> <b>motor.</b> Such an integrated design can be appropriately employed in high driving torque and low rotational speed applications or high rotational speed and low driving torque applications...|$|R

40|$|A DC motor's {{performance}} is usually {{characterized by a}} series of tests, which are conducted by pass/fail criteria. In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins. However, if the motor performance requirement is very stringent, {{a better understanding of the}} motor characteristics is required. The purpose of this paper is to establish a standard way to extract the torque components of the brushless <b>motor</b> and <b>gear</b> box characteristics of a high <b>gear</b> ratio <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> from the composite <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> testing and motor parameter measurement. These torque components include motor magnetic detent torque, Coulomb torque, viscous torque, windage torque, and gear tooth sliding torque. The Aerospace Corp bearing torque model and MPB torque models are used to predict the Coulomb torque of the motor rotor bearings and to model the viscous components. Gear tooth sliding friction torque is derived from the dynamo <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> test data. With these torque data, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> mechanical efficiency can be estimated and provide the overall performance of the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> versus several motor operating parameters such as speed, temperature, applied current, and transmitted power...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{field of}} {{research}} which deals with tactile sensation is called haptics. Many researchers have been investigated haptics in recent years. In the past research, 4 ch bilateral controller based on torque/force sensorless approach is developed so as to achieve high transparency as teleoperation systems. In actual system with <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> however, the high transparency leads to instability because of disturbances. In particular, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> has a large joint friction which affects the torque/force sensorless control, though its cost is low. This means that the high quality of tactile sensation is not expected in case the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> is used in experimental system. To improve the effect of friction, linear motor is often utilized in the past research, though its cost is high. To address this issue, this paper focuses on a novel control strategy to realize low cost teleoperation systems based on the <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> that is, master and slave systems. To reduce the effect of joint friction, a novel approach to master and slave control by force feedback based virtual impedance controller is proposed. By using the proposed method, position and force controllers can be designed independently {{and it is one}} of remarkable features. To verify the validity of proposed method, the performance of the controller is analyzed and evaluated by using “Reproducibility ” and “Operationality”. Furthermore experimental validation is conducted with 1 -DOF manipulator...|$|R

50|$|A <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> (external <b>gear)</b> {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} harvesting the electrical power by the piezoelectric actuator from vibration energy. This paper presents the energy harvesting technique using the piezoelectric element of a bimorph type driven by a <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> and a vibrator. The <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> {{is a type of}} PWM controlled device that is a combination of an oval shape cam with five gears and a speed controller. When using the <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> the piezoelectric element is size of 36 L× 13 W× 0. 6 H. The output voltage characteristics of the piezoelectric element were investigated in terms of the displacement and vibration. When using the vibrator, the electric power harvesting is based on piezoelectric effect and piezoelectric vibrator consists of a magnetic type oscillator, a cantilever, a bimorph actuator and controllers. Low frequency operating technique using piezoelectric vibrator is very important because normal vibration sources in the environment such as building, human body, windmill and ship have low frequency characteristics. We can know from this study results that there are many energy sources such as vibration, wind power and wave power. Also, these can be used to the energy harvesting system using smart device like piezoelectric element...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give an {{innovative}} concept to handle the bore well rescue operations without human intervention and to inspect any type of leakage in the pipe. Normal operation of child rescue is done by using big machines with large manpower involvement. It takes more time to rescue a child from the bore well and to check any kind of irregularities in pipe. Wheeled leg mechanism is employed in this design to go inside the pipe. The legs are circumferentially and symmetrically spaced out 120 o apart. The robot is made adaptive so that it can adjust its legs according to the pipeline dimensions. This structural design makes it possible to have the adaptation to the diameter of pipe and to have adjustable attractive force towards the walls of pipe. In this project, the condition of trapped child is captured with USB Camera and monitored on PC. LM- 35 Temperature Sensor and 16 X 2 LCD are interfaced with PIC 16 F 877 A microcontroller to sense the temperature inside the bore well and to display it respectively.

40|$|Sun, Jian-QiaoThe {{implementation}} of control {{systems in the}} automotive industry enabled by electronic actuators {{is referred to as}} X-by-wire technique. The application of steerby- wire technique in agriculture machine simplifies manufacture, decreases machine costs and increases machine flexibility. Previous study of Applied Controls Laboratory focused on vehicle velocity control through electrical signals, which leads to drive-by-wire agriculture machines without tactile feedback. Current research focuses on the tactile feedback control of steer-by-wire vehicles where the research goal is to improve the steering maneuverability comparable to traditional mechanical steering systems. A DC motor is regulated according to the movement status of the steering wheel to produce a smooth feedback force to the operator. A prototype windrower provided by Case New Holland LLC is modulated, developed and tested for the research where a conventional steering input system is modified by being mounted with a steering input sensor and a DC <b>geared</b> <b>motor.</b> The steering input system, including the steering wheel, the steering column, the mounted sensor and the DC <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> is mathematically modeled. The permitted angle of a steering wheel has been made up to 720 degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions whose big movement range brings a nonlinearity property into the steering mechanism. Furthermore, an H-bridge circuit has been designed and added to the control unit to enable the DC <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> to turn in both directions. To produce the desired feedback force, two cascaded controllers have been designed. The first is a hybrid controller with multiple control branches developed to regulate the DC motor to produce the desired feedback force. Each control branch is a proportional integral (PI) controller. The working ranges of each branch of the controller are decided according to the angle and angular velocity of the steering wheel. The stability of the designed closed loop controller is proved by Routh stability criterion and extensive simulations have been performed to verify the stability of the controller. The second is a current sense controller which is designed by the root locus method to regulate the electrical current of the DC <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> that varies due to environmental changes. Verified by simulation, an accurate control of the feedback force can be achieved. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S. M. E...|$|R
