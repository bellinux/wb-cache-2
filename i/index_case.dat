25|$|Aethina tumida is a small, dark-colored beetle {{that lives}} in beehives. Originally from Africa, the first {{discovery}} of small hive beetles in the Western Hemisphere was made in St. Lucie County, Florida, in 1998. The next year, a specimen that had been collected from Charleston, South Carolina, in 1996 was identified, and {{is believed to be}} the <b>index</b> <b>case</b> for the United States. By December 1999, small hive beetles were reported in Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin, and it was found in California by 2006.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} the <b>index</b> <b>case</b> was a two-year-old boy {{who lived in the}} village of Meliandou, Guéckédou located in the Nzérékoré Region of Guinea. Researchers from the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin believe the boy {{contracted}} the virus while playing near a tree that was a roosting place for free-tail bats infected with the virus. Dr Fabian Leendertz, an epidemiologist who was part of the investigative team, said Ebola virus is transmitted to humans either through contact with larger wildlife (gorillas, monkeys), or by direct contact with bats. The boy, later identified as Emile Ouamouno, fell ill on 2 December 2013 and died four days later. The boy's sister fell ill next, followed by his mother and grandmother. It is believed the Ebola virus later spread to the villages of Dandou Pombo and Dawa, both in Guéckédou, by the midwife who attended the boy. From Dawa village the virus spread to Guéckédou Baladou District and Guéckédou Farako District, and on to Macenta and Kissidougou.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} a 2-year-old boy was the <b>index</b> <b>case</b> of the current Ebola virus disease epidemic. He died in December 2013 {{in the village of}} Meliandou, Guéckédou Prefecture. His mother, sister, and {{grandmother}} then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented in Tai Forest chimpanzees, only one case had been reported in humans in West Africa. With this background and in the context of poor public health systems, the early cases were mis-diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus Ebola virus disease spread for several months before it was recognized as such. In late October 2014, the child was identified as Emile Ouamouno. In a Tuesday, December 30, 2014 online world news story article by Richard Ingham from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that was featured on the MSN homepage, it was revealed that a tree in the area where children had played at, playing with insect-eating free-tailed bats and hunting and grilling them to eat (they are a cousin of another well-known Ebola reservoir, the fruit bat, whose role in this outbreak is not as clear), {{is believed to be the}} point where human infection– likely by the bats– with Ebola in this current outbreak occurred, the 'ground zero' of the epidemic. This is not yet known decisively, but scientists have enough knowledge to go public with the story.|$|E

[...] The original study identifying Dugas as the <b>index</b> <b>case</b> had been completed by William Darrow, but it was called into question by University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Andrew Moss.

Sandra Panem in Science uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his [...] "glib" [...] treatment of the science involved in the epidemic. Author Douglas Crimp suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as [...] "murderously irresponsible" [...] is in actuality [...] "Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself", and that Dugas is offered as a [...] "scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that , like them, is horrified by such creatures." [...] Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{wanted to}} {{quantify}} HLA-A and -B phenotype and haplotype frequencies in Alabama index patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD), {{and in control}} subjects. Methods Phenotypes were detected using DNA-based typing (<b>index</b> <b>cases)</b> and microlymphocytotoxicity typing (controls). Results A and B phenotypes were determined in 240 <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> (114 CVID, 126 IgGSD) and 1, 321 controls and haplotypes in 195 <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> and 751 controls. Phenotyping revealed that the "uncorrected" frequencies of A* 24, B* 14, B* 15, B* 35, B* 40, B* 49, and B* 50 were significantly greater in <b>index</b> <b>cases,</b> and frequencies of B* 35, B* 58, B* 62 were significantly lower in <b>index</b> <b>cases.</b> After Bonferroni corrections, the frequencies of phenotypes A* 24, B* 14, and B* 40 were significantly greater in <b>index</b> <b>cases,</b> {{and the frequency of}} B* 62 was significantly lower in <b>index</b> <b>cases.</b> The most common haplotypes in <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> were A* 02 -B* 44 (frequency 0. 1385), A* 01 -B* 08 (frequency 0. 1308), and A* 03 -B* 07 (frequency 0. 1000), and the frequency of each was significantly greater in <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> than in control subjects ("uncorrected" values of p p p = 0. 0166). Most phenotype and haplotype frequencies in CVID and IgGSD were similar. 26. 7 % of index patients were HLA-haploidentical with one or more other index patients. We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD in first-degree or other relatives of 26 of 195 index patients for whom HLA-A and -B haplotypes had been ascertained; A* 01 -B* 08, A* 02 -B* 44, and A* 29 -B* 44 were most frequently associated with CVID or IgGSD in these families. We conservatively estimated the combined population frequency of CVID and IgGSD to be 0. 0092 in adults, based on the occurrence of CVID and IgGSD in spouses of the <b>index</b> <b>cases.</b> Conclusions CVID and IgGSD in adults are significantly associated with several HLA haplotypes, many of which are also common in the Alabama Caucasian population. Immunoglobulin phenotype variability demonstrated in <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> and family studies herein suggests that there are multiple gene(s) on Ch 6 p or other chromosomes that modify immunoglobulin phenotypes of CVID and IgGSD. The estimated prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes significantly associated with these disorders are also common in the general population. </p...|$|R

Sixty-three and sixty-two husbands and wives of <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>index</b> controls, respectively, were also studied. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence of GD was significantly higher (c 2 = 14. 52, P< 0. 001) in the 202 first-degree relatives of subjects with gallstones than that in the 201 first-degree relatives of subjects without gallstones (28. 6 % vs 12. 4 %, relative risk (RR) 1. 80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 29 - 2. 63). In particular, prevalence of GD was significantly higher in mothers, fathers, and sisters of <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> than that in the respective family members of index controls. The highest RR was observed in mothers (RR= 2. 35, 95 %CI 1. 38 - 4. 3).

40|$|Abstract Background Cholera {{remains an}} {{important}} public health challenge globally. Several pandemics {{have occurred in}} different parts of the world and have been epidemiologically linked by different researchers to illustrate how the cases were spread and how they were related to <b>index</b> <b>cases.</b> Even though the risk factors associated with the 2014 cholera outbreak were investigated extensively, the link between <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> and the source of infection was not investigated to help break the transmission process. This study sought to show how the <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> from various districts of the Greater Accra Region may have been linked. Methods We carried out a descriptive cross sectional study to investigate the epidemiological link of the 2014 cholera outbreak in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. An extensive review of all district records on cholera cases in the Greater Accra region was carried out. <b>Index</b> <b>cases</b> were identified with the help of line lists. Univariate analyses were expressed as frequency distributions, percentages, mean ± Standard Deviation, and rates (attack rates, case-fatality rates etc.) as appropriate. Maps were drawn using Arc GIS and Epi info software to describe the pattern of transmission. Results Up to 20, 199 cholera cases were recorded. Sixty percent of the cases were between 20 and 40  years and about 58 % (11, 694) of the total cases were males. Almost 50 % of the cases occurred in the Accra Metro district. Two-thirds of the <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> ate food prepared outside their home and had visited the Accra Metropolis. Conclusions The 2014 cholera outbreak can be described as a propagated source outbreak linked to the Accra Metropolis. The link between <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> and the source of infection, if investigated earlier could have helped break the transmission process. Such investigations also inform decision-making about the appropriate interventions to be instituted to prevent subsequent outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the yield and determinants of retrospective TB contact investigation in selected zones in Ethiopia. This was a community-based cross-sectional study conducted during June-October 2014. Trained lay providers performed symptom screening for close contacts of <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> with {{all types of}} TB registered for anti-TB treatment within the last three years. We used logistic regression to determine factors associated with TB diagnosis among the contacts. Of 272, 441 close contacts of 47, 021 <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> screened, 13, 886 and 2, 091 had presumptive and active TB respectively. The yield of active TB was thus 768 / 100, 000, contributing 25. 4 % of the 7, 954 TB cases reported from the study zones over the study period. The yield was highest among workplace contacts (12, 650 / 100, 000). Active TB was twice more likely among contacts whose <b>index</b> <b>cases</b> had been registered for TB treatment within the last 12 months compared with {{those who had been}} registered 24 or more months earlier (adjusted odds ratio, AOR: 1. 77 95 % CI 1. 42 - 2. 21).
