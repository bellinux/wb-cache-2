5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{preparing}} {{for the beginning of}} her new talk show, Dealbreakers. Jack's rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Carey and Diane Martel {{during the spring of}} 1998. The music video begins with Carey sitting alone in a limousine, recalling a night she shared some time previous. As scenes of Carey reminiscing in the limo are shown, clips of <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> in an old apartment are presented. Eventually, Carey joins a roof-top party one night, where she begins dancing and caressing her lover. As the passion between them grown, rain begins to fall, showering everyone atop the edifice. As these scenes end, Carey in the present opens the sun-roof of the limo and stands into the rainy night, trying to recapture those magical moments she shared on that rainy roof-top encounter. The video ends with a wet Carey lying {{in the back of the}} limousine, sad and lonely.|$|E

Aware {{that they are being}} monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore's closet; when Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room, Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus' release from the {{fortress}} of Bakhine from his coat pocket. After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria in a tank. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left them at home all along; he destroys the plans so that they cannot be used to create a weapon.|$|E

25|$|Scott's {{stage fright}} was worsening. During the October 19, 1952 live {{broadcast}} of NBC's Colgate Comedy Hour, Scott reportedly hid in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room until the casting director, Howard Ross, taunted her {{to face the}} audience. By the end of October 1952, of the original 48 big-name actors under contract to Paramount in 1947, only four were left—Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, William Holden, and Lizabeth Scott.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, the Phantom joins an {{overwhelmed}} Christine in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> {{room and}} the two share a rapturous moment ("Ah, Christine!"). Christine finds a letter from Raoul stating that he has left for good and she begins to panic when she realizes that Gustave is missing.

25|$|Lamarr {{went on to}} play {{a number}} of stage roles, {{including}} a starring one in Sissy, a play produced in Vienna, which won accolades from critics.

He became obsessed with getting to know her. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial status. Her parents, both of Jewish descent, did not approve, due to Mandl's ties to Mussolini and, later, Hitler, but could not stop the headstrong Hedy.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's post-retirement work {{in theater}} was intermittent, {{somewhat}} curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in <b>her</b> <b>dressing</b> room between scenes, yet emerged each time {{to perform a}} flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright punctuated with bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.|$|E

40|$|Through Margaret Thatcher’s {{private and}} public performances, the micro-politics of dress {{translated}} into the macro-politics of power. Thatcher’s changing career can be traced through <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> (see Young 1991 : 416 - 417); analysis of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> leading up to and during her Premiership reveals both her aspirations and increasing power. Understanding of Thatcher’s agency in <b>her</b> embodied, <b>dressed</b> performances can be informed and developed through Butler’s (1999) conceptualization of performativity. Through adaptation, repetition and divergent dress, Thatcher constructed different identities, some of which became iconic symbols of her self and her politics. Examination of Thatcher’s dress refines {{the understanding of the}} relationship between constraints and agency experienced by actors in the public realm. Upon becoming party leader, Margaret Thatcher’s gender, class and ideological viewpoints were incongruent with her unprecedented political status and she faced many challenges in attempting to overcome this. Dress became a potentially destabilising focus for her critics and symbolic of her “outsider” status. Yet {{in the face of these}} challenges she recognized and learned from the expectations of others, adapting and changing <b>her</b> <b>dress.</b> However, this was not an instantaneous, complete or permanent transformation. What Thatcher achieved, as she crafted <b>her</b> <b>dressed</b> performances, was agency over a further aspect of her life and her politics. There was also an evolving alignment of <b>her</b> <b>dress</b> with <b>her</b> political ideology and domestic and international roles over time...|$|R
25|$|Femme au miroir (en. Woman with a Mirror), Femme à sa toilette or Lady at <b>her</b> <b>Dressing</b> Table, is a {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. This distilled synthetic form of Cubism exemplifies Metzinger's continued interest, in 1916, towards less surface activity, with {{a strong emphasis on}} larger, flatter, overlapping abstract planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying geometric configuration, rooted in the abstract, controls nearly every element of the composition. The role of color remains primordial, but is now restrained within sharp delineated boundaries in comparison with several earlier works. The work of Juan Gris from the summer of 1916 to late 1918 bares much in common with that of Metzinger's late 1915, early 1916 paintings.|$|E
25|$|She renamed it the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, {{and began}} to {{renovate}} it to suit her needs. The facade was lit by 5,700 electric bulbs, 17 arc lights, and 11 projectors. She completely redecorated the interior, replacing the red plush and gilt with yellow velvet, brocade, and white woodwork. The lobby was decorated with life-sized portraits of her in her most famous roles, painted by Mucha, Louise Abbéma, and Georges Clairin. <b>Her</b> <b>dressing</b> room was a five-room suite, which, after the success of her Napoleonic play L'Aiglon, was decorated in Empire Style, featuring a marble fireplace with a fire Bernhardt kept burning year round, a huge bathtub that {{was filled with the}} flowers she received after each performance, and a dining room fitting 12 people, where she entertained guests after the final curtain.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculptures of}} Lipchitz, Laurens and Csaky, and the {{paintings}} of Gris, Severini and Gleizes represented Cubism in its most distilled form between 1916 and 1920. However, {{by the time of}} his exhibition at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1919—just as before the war—Metzinger was considered a leader of the movement. His paintings at this exhibition were perceived as highly significant. The fact that Metzinger's Lady at <b>her</b> <b>Dressing</b> Table was chosen to be reproduced in The Sun (New York) amongst over 100 artworks in the Rosenberg sale suggests that Metzinger was perceived as a leader of the Cubist movement abroad as well. For the general public, the idea of Cubism was for many years associated more with Metzinger than Braque or Picasso, {{due to the fact that}} these artists did not exhibit in the salons, but rather in a private gallery; essentially removing themselves from the public.|$|E
