5|$|The {{members of}} SG-1 and General Hank Landry (Beau Bridges) are {{travelling}} on the Earth ship Odyssey to the Asgard home world, Orilla, when the Asgard Thor beams aboard. He reveals that after millennia of genetic manipulation, a disease has brought his race {{very close to}} extinction, and SG-1 accepts his offer to upload {{the sum of all}} Asgard's <b>knowledge</b> <b>into</b> Odyssey as a way to preserve the Asgard legacy after their mass suicide. However, Orilla and Odyssey are soon attacked by Ori warships. Orilla erupts with huge explosions, and after Odyssey escapes to the next planet with a Stargate and beams the bulk of its crew down, the Ori fire a final energy beam upon the ship. Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) activates a localized time dilation field that makes time look frozen outside the field to give SG-1 and Landry time to find a defense.|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{knowledge}} oriented economy, {{the ability}} of an organisation to engage its employees to create, capture, share and apply their knowledge determines its prosperity. The research presented in this thesis focused on {{a case study of}} a multinational automobile supplier challenged with incorporating <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> its organisational routines. The research implements Feldman and Pentland’s concept in which a routine has two sides. The ostensive side of a routine represents the structural artefacts that sets a frame for action while the performative side represents the final actions carried out by the employees that use the routine. The implementation of <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> organisational routines is challenging and best planned and managed as a change process. However mechanisms and factors that drive change in organisational routines are not well understood. This gap results in a lack of implementation frameworks supporting practitioners during the implementation of <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> organisational routines. This thesis reports on the implementation of <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> three organisational routines. Observations and interviews were used to identify mechanisms and factors that drove changes in routines. The core contribution of the research is an framework supporting practitioners to implement <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> organisational routines. This framework is based on new knowledge about change in routines. The concept of routines provides a new perspective on the implementation of knowledge management at the operational level. This perspective complements previous frameworks that aim for organisation-wide implementation. The theory of organisational routines recognises the importance of stakeholders, the organisation and the business environment in which the stakeholders operate. Ttwo stakeholder were found to be especially important. Middle management played an important role as they helped to link knowledge management, which was to be implemented, to the ostensive and performative sides of the organisational routines. Knowledge management facilitators were critical because they improved the abilities of the stakeholders leading the implementation of <b>knowledge</b> management <b>into</b> the routines by providing subject matter knowledge on knowledge management, its implementation and changing organisational routines...|$|R

They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the 13th century, creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region.

25|$|Following the French Revolution {{there was}} an {{increase}} in the amount of poor quality French wine being produced. Jean-Antoine Chaptal, the Minister of the Interior for Napoleon, felt that a contributing factor to this trend was the lack of knowledge among many French vignerons of the emerging technologies and winemaking practices that could improve the quality their wines. In 1801, Chaptal compiled this <b>knowledge</b> <b>into</b> a treatise Traité théorique et pratique sur la culture de la vigne which included his advocacy of adding sugar to the wine to increase alcohol levels—a process now known as chaptalization. Chaptal's treatise was {{a turning point in the}} history of wine technology as it synthesized the knowledge current to the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
