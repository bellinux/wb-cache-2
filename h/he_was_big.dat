500|$|Veteran UPI {{reporter}} Helen Thomas {{suggested that}} in public, the Nixons [...] "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were [...] "very close". In private, Richard Nixon {{was described as}} being [...] "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>big</b> enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 1970, at 12:10a.m. at the Meadow Stud in Caroline County, Virginia, Somethingroyal foaled a bright-red {{chestnut}} colt {{with three}} white socks and a star {{with a narrow}} stripe. The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later. Howard Gentry, the manager of Meadow Stud, was at the foaling and later said, [...] "He was a very well-made foal. He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered." [...] The colt soon distinguished himself from the others. [...] "He was always the leader in the crowd", said Gentry's nephew, Robert, who also worked at the farm. [...] "To us, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>Big</b> Red, {{and he had a}} personality. He was a clown and was always cutting up, always into some devilment." [...] Some time later, Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one word entry in her notebook: [...] "Wow!" ...|$|E
500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>big.</b> He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Jim Thorpe {{was asked}} to choose the {{greatest}} football player of all time, he selected Mahan. [...] He explained his choice as follows:"Eddie Mahan of Harvard was the greatest football player I have ever seen. He had everything, he could run, pass and kick. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>big,</b> weighed 190 pounds, {{was smart enough to}} play quarterback and also good enough to play in the line. To me that's proof enough that Mahan was the tops. He was a specialist in all lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his later}} career, Arthur Mercante said: [...] "Ali {{knew all the}} tricks. He was the best fighter I ever saw in terms of clinching. Not only did he use it to rest, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>big</b> and strong and knew how to lean on opponents and push and shove and pull to tire them out. Ali was so smart. Most guys are just in there fighting, but Ali {{had a sense of}} {{everything}} that was happening, almost as though he was sitting at ringside analyzing the fight while he fought it." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Berkeley, Muncie {{was a star}} {{running back}} for the California Golden Bears during the 1970s. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>big,</b> fast and elusive, and was a good receiver. [...] He was {{instrumental}} in Cal's NCAA-leading offense which propelled the team to the co-championship of the Pac-8 in 1975, and {{he became the first}} Golden Bear to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Muncie set then-school single-season records for rushing yards (1,460), all-purpose yards (1,871), and rushing touchdowns (13). He was a runner-up for the Heisman Trophy behind two-time winner Archie Griffin of Ohio State. Muncie outrushed and outscored Griffin (1,357 yards and 4 touchdowns), but Ohio State was 11–0 and ranked No. 1 at the time. Muncie was awarded the 1975 W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. He finished his college career with then-school career records for rushing yards (3,052), rushing touchdowns (32), 100-yard rushing games (15) and all-purpose yards (4,194).|$|E
2500|$|... "Moneytalks" [...] is {{also one}} of AC/DC's biggest hits, {{breaking}} the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, the UK Singles Charts, and the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. It is still the band's highest charting single in the United States, at number 23 (no other AC/DC single has even cracked the top 30). During their subsequent world tour, thousands of [...] "Angus Bucks" [...] were dropped on the audience during the song. A music video of the song, directed by David Mallet, was also released, featuring a live performance during the tour. [...] Author Murray Engleheart states in his band memoir AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll: [...] "On songs like 'Mistress for Christmas' and [...] "Moneytalks,' Malcolm and Angus showed their working-class roots, despite multi-millionaire selling albums, by taking aim at the high flyers in the business world." [...] In a February 1991 interview with Guitar World Angus Young stated, [...] "I think the funniest song on this album is 'Mistress For Christmas.' That song's about Donald Trump. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>big</b> news at the time, so we thought we'd have a bit of fun and humor with it." [...] In the same interview, he declared that his best guitar solo on the LP was on the song [...] "The Razors Edge," [...] which also features a rare foray into finger picking. [...] Although AC/DC had always remained apolitical when it came to their music, the title track was a commentary of sorts, with Young explaining to Muchmusic in 1992: ...|$|E
