25|$|Spanish {{maritime}} intelligence {{knew that a}} convoy of at least twenty Dutch ships from Venice, broker of the Middle East, was always hostile to the Spanish and that the rich convoy had the necessity {{to pass through the}} Gibraltar Strait. All the Dutch ships would go well armed and equipped, and with an appreciable escort, thus capture it or destroy <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> desirable and appropriate for the Spanish admiralty.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form {{a certain kind of}} repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems very different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> far fetched.|$|E
500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mentalist Mark Edward relates from {{personal}} experience as a [...] "psychic performer" [...] how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience [...] "claims" [...] a phrase such as a [...] "clown in a graveyard" [...] statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, [...] "Does that mean anything to someone... whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that she knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing {{to get her to}} understand that he was not directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to the Quranic quote [...] "We have surely killed Jesus the Christ, son of Mary, the apostle of God", Muslim scholar Mahmoud Ayoub asserts this boast not as the repeating of a historical lie or the perpetuating of a false report, but an example of human arrogance and folly with an attitude of contempt towards God and His messenger(s). Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word. The words, [...] "they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him" [...] speaks to the profound events of ephemeral human history, exposing mankind's heart and conscience towards God's will. The claim of humanity to have this power against God is illusory. [...] "They did not slay him...but <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>so</b> to them" [...] speaks to the imaginations of mankind, not the denial of the actual event of Jesus dying physically on the cross.|$|E
