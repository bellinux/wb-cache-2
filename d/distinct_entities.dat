5|$|From 1941, forward, the Leibstandarte became four <b>distinct</b> <b>entities,</b> the Waffen-SS {{division}} (unconnected to Hitler's {{personal protection}} but a {{formation of the}} Waffen-SS), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his personal apartment and the Brown House NSDAP headquarters in Munich. Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.|$|E
5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as <b>distinct</b> <b>entities,</b> and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize {{the role of the}} reader of a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered <b>distinct</b> <b>entities.</b> Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} with the constituent colleges, the colleges of Knox, Massey, Regis, St. Michael's, Trinity, Victoria and Wycliffe continue to exist as legally <b>distinct</b> <b>entities,</b> each possessing a separate financial endowment. While St. Michael's, Trinity and Victoria continue to recognize their religious affiliations and heritage, they have since adopted secular policies of enrolment and teaching in non-divinity subjects. Some colleges have, or once had, collegiate structures of their own: Emmanuel College is a college of Victoria and St. Hilda's College is part of Trinity; St. Joseph’s College had existed as a college within St. Michael's until it was dissolved in 2006. Ewart College existed as an affiliated college until 1991, when it was merged into Knox College. Postgraduate theology degrees are conferred by the colleges of Knox, Regis and Wycliffe, along with the divinity faculties within Emmanuel, St. Michael's and Trinity, including joint degrees with the university through the Toronto School of Theology.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world {{can be thought of as}} either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
25|$|Dispensational premillennialism {{generally}} {{holds that}} Israel and the Church are <b>distinct</b> <b>entities.</b> It also widely holds to the pretribulational return of Christ, which believes that Jesus {{will return to}} take up Christians into heaven {{by means of a}} rapture immediately before a seven-year worldwide tribulation. This will be followed by an additional return of Christ with his saints (though there are post tribulation dispensationalists, such as Robert Gundry).|$|E

25|$|The loss of Mons proved irreversible. The Dutch Revolt {{never got}} {{another chance to}} rally the Walloon Protestants to the its cause, which {{remained}} confined to the North. Nine years later Mons {{became part of the}} staunchly Catholic Union of Arras which accepted the Spanish rule, and Protestantism there was stamped out. Thus, the Dutch rebels losing the chance to gain Mons was an important step towards the division of what had been the single Habsburg Netherlands into two <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> - ultimately the present Netherlands and Belgium.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically <b>distinct,</b> <b>entities</b> (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E
25|$|Today, {{also called}} The Today Show, is an American news and talk morning {{television}} show that airs on NBC. The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It {{was the first}} of its genre on American television and in the world, and is the fifth-longest-running American television series. Originally a two-hour program on weekdays, it expanded to Sundays (originally 90 minutes, now a one-hour program) in 1987 and Saturdays (running for two hours) in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007 (though as time has gone on, the third and fourth hours have evolved into <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> and treated as essentially their own shows).|$|E

25|$|Hippolytus supposes Valentinus to have derived {{his system}} {{from that of}} Simon; and in that as expounded in the Apophasis Megale, from which he gives extracts, the origin of things is derived from six roots, divided into three pairs; but all these roots spring from a single {{independent}} Principle, which is without consort. The name Sige occurs in the description which Hippolytus (vi. 18) quotes from the Apophasis, how from the supreme Principle there arise {{the male and female}} offshoots nous and epinoia. The name Sige is there given not to either of the offshoots but to the supreme Principle itself: however, in the description, these offshoots appear less as <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> than as different aspects of the same Being.|$|E

2500|$|East-Asian (Chinese) Buddhism {{emphasizes}} {{insight into}} Buddha-nature. This term {{is derived from}} Indian tathagata-garbha thought, [...] "the womb of the thus-gone" [...] (the Buddha), the inherent potential of every sentient being to become a Buddha. This idea was integrated with the Yogacara-idea of the ālaya vijñāna, and further developed in Chinese Buddhism, which integrated Indian Buddhism with native Chinese thought. Buddha-nature came to mean both the potential of awakening and the whole of reality, a dynamic interpenetration of absolute and relative. In this awakening it is realized that observer and observed are not <b>distinct</b> <b>entities,</b> but mutually co-dependent.|$|E

2500|$|Mereology {{has been}} {{explored}} {{in various ways}} as applications of predicate logic to formal ontology, in each of which mereology is an important part. Each of these fields provides its own axiomatic definition of mereology. A common element of such axiomatizations is the assumption, shared with inclusion, that the part-whole relation orders its universe, meaning that everything {{is a part of}} itself (reflexivity), that a part of a part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> cannot each {{be a part of the}} other (antisymmetry), thus forming a poset. [...] A variant of this axiomatization denies that anything is ever part of itself (irreflexivity) while accepting transitivity, from which antisymmetry follows automatically.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "college" [...] {{also applies}} to <b>distinct</b> <b>entities</b> within a {{university}} (usually referred to as [...] "federated colleges" [...] or [...] "affiliated colleges"), similar to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, Trinity College was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the University of Toronto, and {{is now one of}} its residential colleges (though it remains a degree-granting institution through its Faculty of Divinity). In the case of Memorial University of Newfoundland, located in St. John's, the Corner Brook campus is called Sir Wilfred Grenfell College. Occasionally, [...] "college" [...] refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither federated nor affiliated—College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science among others.|$|E
