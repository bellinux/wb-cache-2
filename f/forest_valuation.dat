40|$|Three {{different}} option value {{approaches are}} used to estimate {{the value of a}} typical New Zealand plantation stand, under the assumption that log prices follow a random walk. Crop values are compared with the Faustmann value, the benchmark for <b>forest</b> <b>valuation</b> in New Zealand. The increase in forest value can be substantial when log prices are low and close to the exercise cost. Gains quickly diminish and become small, both as an absolute difference and as a percentage of forest value, as price increases. However, results are very sensitive to the log price model adopted. Assuming log prices are mean reverting gives higher values than Faustmann for all log prices. Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) and Binomial Option Pricing (BOP) give very similar results. They evaluate the same harvest/defer harvest/never harvest options. A new Abandonment Adjusted Price approach gives results that have a similar pattern but are consistently lower than SDP and BOP. This approach only considers whether to harvest or not in the optimal year and does not allow the option of deferring harvest. At the present time, option valuation approaches have limited relevance for the practice of <b>forest</b> <b>valuation</b> in New Zealand. Practical issues (determination of the log price model, estimation of volatility, allowing for multiple log grades and modelling at the estate-level) need to be addressed before option value approaches can be routinely used for <b>forest</b> <b>valuation.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>valuation</b> Option value Stochastic prices Rotation age...|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{quality is}} a key factor of {{recreational}} demand, traditional methods of economic valuation have trouble incorporating this multi-dimensional aspect. Choice experiment, seen as an alternative, has its limits as well.

To valuate the environmental scheme, MP does not use the independent valuation and summation procedure but also takes into account changes due to the implementation of the scheme (Hoehn and Loomis, 1993).

40|$|The sample {{selection}} {{model is}} based upon a bivariate or a multivariate structure, and distributional assumptions are in this context more severe than in univariate settings, due to the limited availability of tractable multivariate distributions. While the standard FIML estimation of the selectivity model assumes normality of the joint distribution, alternative approaches require less stringent distributional hypotheses. As shown by Smith (2003), copulas allow great flexibility also in FIML models. The copula model is very useful in situations where the applied researcher has a prior on the distributional form of the margins, since it allows separating their modelling {{from that of the}} dependence structure. In the present paper the copula approach to sample selection is first compared to the semiparametric approach and to the standard FIML, bivariate normal model, in an illustrative application on female work data.

The study considers the breeding for three types of enhanced cultivars: increased pest and disease resistance, low caffeine contents and increased yields. Costs and benefits are compared for a 30 years discounting period, and result in a net present value of coffee genetic resources of 1458 and 420 million US$, at discount rates of 5 % respectively 10 %. The value estimate is prone to considerable uncertainty, with major sources of uncertainty being the length of breeding programs required to transfer valuable genetic information into new coffee cultivars, and the potential adoption rate of such enhanced cultivars. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates the high economic value of genetic resources, and it underlines the need for urgent action to halt the currently ongoing, rapid deforestation of Ethiopian highland forests...|$|R

40|$|Conventional <b>forest</b> <b>valuation</b> {{approaches}} do {{not account}} for discretions foresters have in making key irreversible decisions such as when and if to harvest {{in the light of}} uncertain future decision variables. Furthermore where they are sufficiently sophisticated as to make explicit forecasts of future valuation parameters such as log prices at harvest date as is the case for discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis they do so with unavoidable imprecision. These shortcomings - as well of those of even less sophisticated methodologies such as cost- or transaction-based valuations - become telling when attempting to assess the impacts of long-term climate change policies on forest values. This paper presents an alternative approach using real options analysis that captures enough complexity to meaningfully model the impacts of climate change policies on forest value while remaining relatively straightforward to implement using Monte Carlo simulation. It shows that foresters' discretions as to when and if to harvest or to convert to non-forest land uses give rise to real options whose value is captured by real options analysis but ignored by conventional <b>forest</b> <b>valuation</b> methodologies. It furthermore shows how forest values differ and conversion rates vary over time depending on which climate change policies or policy uncertainties are assumed. In short Kyoto forests (those first planted after 1989) are more valuable when carbon credits and harvest liabilities under the Kyoto Protocol are devolved by the Crown to their owners. Non-Kyoto forests (those planted before 1990) are more valuable when deforestation liabilities are not devolved to their owners.

National and voluntary carbon-offsetting schemes are emerging as alternatives to international compliance markets. We developed a choice experiment to explore determinants of local <b>forest</b> carbon-offset <b>valuation.</b> A total of 963 citizens from Guadalajara in Mexico were asked to consider a purchase of voluntary offsets from the neighbouring Biosphere Reserve of La Primavera and from two alternative more distant locations: La Michilía {{in the state of}} Durango and El Cielo in Tamaulipas.

The local La Primavera site attracted higher participation and valuation than the more distant sites. However, groups particularly interested in climate change mitigation or cost may accept cost-efficient options in the distant sites. Mean implicit carbon prices obtained ranged from $ 6. 79 to $ 15. 67 /tCO depending on the surveying methodology and profile of respondents. Survey application mode can significantly affect outcome of the experiment. Values from the market stall sessions were higher than those from the snowball and market research samples obtained online; this may be linked to greater cooperation associated with personal interaction and collective action.

The research aimed to quantify changes in forest use value over a successional continuum from fallow fields to old secondary forests. Suggestions for methodological improvements and future research focus on improved measurements of collection area sizes, the collection of data on all plant types, especially timber species, epiphytes, and herbaceous plants, and the inclusion of animal taxa. This study found only a limited use for a rapid survey approach to <b>forest</b> <b>valuation,</b> but suggested investigations on the potential of a two-stage rapid method. In terms of general resource use, the study found an impressive heterogeneity of use values at inter- and intracommunity levels, between different taxa, and among the three forest types studied. The median values of all secondary forests on private land holdings in the Cordillera Azul (6. 80 – 28. 60 $/ha/yr) are {{at the low end of}} previous estimates of forest product use values in the tropics. Open-access lands had the highest total value, but the large area they cover means per hectare values were negligible. Forest stands are less valuable than alternative land uses that follow forest clearing. The most valuable use categories were wood and food, and the relative value of the three forest types varied between the three communities surveyed. Based on these results land management suggestions were made regarding swidden-fallow cycles that would maximize composite forest value on family land holdings. The length of time a family resides in a community was the most important predictor of both forest use values and ecological knowledge. Data on the intensity of use and the local value of the most used plant and animal taxa provide baseline data that will inform integrated conservation and development programs aimed at protecting natural resources and ensuring the livelihoods of local people in the Cordillera Azul. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the relative importance of various sources of uncertainties in determining the net present value of forest stands and forested property. This was achieved by performing stand-level simulations that took into account: i) input data errors (airborne laser-scanning data vs. ocular standwise field inventory data), ii) stochastic future development of timber assortment prices and iii) errors in stand-level growth projection models. The starting point of the study was a simulated forest estate comprising 40 stands of various types sufficiently represented (e. g. with respect to species composition, development class distribution, and site quality). Stochastic timber price models were formulated, employing geometric mean-reverting principles. The results showed that sources of uncertainty all had significant effects on the probability distribution of the net present value of the stand. The relative standard deviations of stand net present values averaged 8 % for stochastic timber price, 29 % for errors in standwise field inventory data, 26 % for errors in airborne laser-scanning data and 33 % for errors in growth projection models when applying a 3 % discount rate. When all three sources of uncertainty were analysed simultaneously, the highest average standard deviation was 47. 4 %. Interestingly, errors in the growth projections and the quality of inventory data contributed more to the variation in stand net present value than fluctuation in timber price did, although this result was based on the assumption that the forestry industry maintains its competitiveness in the long run. Our modeling approach made it possible to compare various sources of uncertainty and to set confidence intervals for net present value estimates.
