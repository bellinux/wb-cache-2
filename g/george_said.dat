25|$|By February 1920 Wilson's Staff {{wanted to}} reduce {{commitment}} to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as {{occupation of the}} whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining {{about the cost of}} keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the UK), but Lloyd <b>George</b> <b>said</b> that Curzon “would not stand it”. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that “we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided”. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called “Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs” – Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would “hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who is stupid enough to back us”.|$|E
500|$|George's son, the Duke of Cumberland, {{commanded}} the king's troops in northern Germany. In 1757, Hanover was invaded and George gave Cumberland full powers to conclude a separate peace. By September, however, {{he was furious}} at Cumberland's negotiated settlement, which he felt greatly favoured the French. <b>George</b> <b>said</b> his son had [...] "ruined me and disgraced himself". Cumberland, by his own choice, resigned his military offices, and George revoked the peace deal {{on the grounds that}} the French had infringed it by disarming Hessian troops after the ceasefire.|$|E
500|$|Edward's womanising and {{reckless}} behaviour during the 1920s and 1930s worried Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, King George V, and {{those close to}} the prince. Alan Lascelles, the prince's private secretary for eight years during this period, believed that [...] "for some hereditary or physiological reason his normal mental development stopped dead when he reached adolescence". George V was disappointed by his son's failure to settle down in life, disgusted by his affairs with married women, and was reluctant to see him inherit the Crown. [...] "After I am dead," [...] <b>George</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the boy will ruin himself in twelve months." ...|$|E

500|$|Subsequently, India {{was signed}} to Ralph Mercado's record label RMM. Her first {{recording}} under the label was {{a cover of}} Basilio's song [...] "Vivir lo Nuestro", a duet with Anthony for the RMM compilation album Combinacion Perfecta (1993). It was released as a single where it peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The record was produced by American musician Sergio George who picked the song for the duo as {{he felt it was}} the right track for them to perform, despite the pair not being close friends at the time. <b>George</b> <b>said</b> he took the recording as a [...] "personal challenge" [...] because he believed India's voice was [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|... "Dangerous" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics. Jon Pareles, {{a writer for}} The New York Times, called it [...] " [...] latest song about a predatory lover" [...] and highlighted the lyrics [...] "I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity," [...] observing, [...] "He is a great dancer, yet his songs proclaim a terror {{of the body and}} of fleshly pleasures." [...] Music critic Nelson <b>George</b> <b>said</b> of the song, [...] " [...] a pile driving track...that explodes from radio speakers. 'Dangerous' in fact, opens another window into Michael's artistic process." [...] Writer Barry Farber noted that the same lyrics [...] "are an excellent representation of how sex can sometimes feel like a powerful biologically driven force." ...|$|E
500|$|For this {{compilation}} album, Arjona re-recorded some of {{his older}} songs in a different style from the original versions, and remastered others. [...] "Si El Norte Fuera El Sur" [...] {{was transformed into a}} ska-style song, which he performed with Panteón Rococó. Argentinian jazz musician Fernando Otero was featured on the new version of [...] "Jesús, Verbo No Sustantivo". [...] "Historia De Taxi" [...] was transformed into a salsa song, which Arjona performed with American singer Marc Anthony and pianist Sergio George; <b>George</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's been interesting to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music.", and that [...] "every time a reunion of this kind happens, it [...] a reason to celebrate." ...|$|E

500|$|George's {{relationship}} with his eldest son and heir, Edward, deteriorated in these later years. George was disappointed in Edward's failure to settle down in life and appalled by his many affairs with married women. In contrast, {{he was fond of}} his second eldest son, Prince Albert (later GeorgeVI), and doted on his eldest granddaughter, Princess Elizabeth; he nicknamed her [...] "Lilibet", and she affectionately called him [...] "Grandpa England". In 1935, <b>George</b> <b>said</b> of his son Edward: [...] "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself within 12 months", and of Albert and Elizabeth: [...] "I pray to God my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, George {{confirmed}} her {{departure from}} Grey's Anatomy, and several reasons were cited for her leaving. <b>George</b> <b>said</b> {{she had decided}} to leave to pursue another project, and offered praise to the cast members. However, a representative of the show claimed the actress' departure was due to a mutual agreement between Grey's Anatomy and George, explaining that the character's storyline [...] "came to a natural end", but that everyone was upset with her departure. Following Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith)'s departure, E! Online Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show, and the rewrite of Harris' storyline, was enforced by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), as part of an attempt to [...] "de-gay" [...] Grey's Anatomy, but these claims were rebuked by Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] was doing his TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And <b>George</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E

500|$|Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote [...] "the King {{has lost}} another little child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond." [...] Shortly afterward, King <b>George</b> <b>said</b> [...] "There {{will be no}} Heaven for me if Octavius is not there." [...] The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was {{completing}} {{the finishing touches on}} a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius' sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius' death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day [...] "increases the chasm I feel for want of that beloved object [...]" [...] In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} a {{collection}} of Arjona's past hits re-recorded in a [...] "tropical version", featuring genres such as salsa, bachata, merengue, vallenato, son and reggae. Several of Tropicos songs were originally included in another compilation Arjona released several years before, in 2001, entitled Arjona Tropical. The salsa version of [...] "Historia De Taxi", which Arjona performed with American singer Marc Anthony and pianist Sergio George, was included on the album. The song was originally recorded for Arjona's compilation album Quién Dijo Ayer, released in August 2007. <b>George</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's been interesting to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music", and [...] "every time a reunion of this kind happens, it [...] a reason to celebrate." [...] "Buenas Noches Don David", originally recorded for Sin Daños a Terceros, was performed by Puerto Rican salsa singer Gilberto Santa Rosa. Arjona produced both the original version as well as the new salsa version, and provided additional background vocals for the new version. [...] "Primera Vez", originally featured in Animal Nocturno, was performed by Victor Manuelle. [...] "Mujeres" [...] was re-recorded to feature a new merengue style, fitting the usual musical production of Elvis Crespo, who performed the song.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Boy <b>George</b> <b>said</b> {{about the}} music style of his band Culture Club, [...] "We play rock 'n' roll and I love rock 'n' roll music but I don't like the lifestyle.

2500|$|In 1903 Governor MacGregor's {{administration}} {{prepared a}} Newspaper Ordinance ostensibly {{designed to prevent}} libels being published. George, Williams and Johnson, the three Nigerian council members, all objected {{on the grounds that}} the ordinance would inhibit freedom of the press. <b>George</b> <b>said</b> [...] "any obstacle in the way of publication of newspapers in this colony means throwing Lagos back to its position forty or fifty years ago". Despite these objections, the ordinance was passed into law.|$|E
2500|$|Dealing with an {{intervention}} at this point, Lloyd <b>George</b> <b>said,</b> in passing, {{that he did}} not think that the First Lord was entirely responsible for all the things that happened in Norway. Churchill intervened to take complete responsibility for [...] "everything that had been done by the Admiralty, and my full share of the burden". Lloyd George retorted, [...] "The right hon. Gentleman must not allow himself to be converted into an air-raid shelter to keep the splinters from hitting his colleagues" [...] and resumed: ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawyers, environmentalists, {{and civil}} society groups are calling the dumping a [...] "blatant violation" [...] of two {{international}} moratoriums. <b>George</b> <b>said</b> that the Old Massett Village Council and its lawyers approved the effort and at least seven Canadian agencies were aware of it. In May 2013, the Haida Salmon Restoration Corporation removed George as {{a director of the}} company and ended his employment. The 2013 salmon runs defied all expectations, more than quadrupling, from 50 million to 226 million fish. However, many environmental groups objected to the process.|$|E
2500|$|David Lloyd <b>George</b> <b>said</b> of Gladstone in 1915: [...] "What {{a man he}} was! Head and {{shoulders}} above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular, {{and he had no}} real sympathy with the working-classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever heard. He was not so good in exposition." [...] Asquithian Liberals continued to advocate traditional Gladstonian policies of sound finance, peaceful foreign relations and the better treatment of Ireland. They often compared Lloyd George unfavourably with Gladstone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} that was agreed {{had also been}} on Lloyd George's mind for years. He met Tim Healy, a senior barrister and former nationalist MP, in late 1919 to consider his options. Healy wrote to his brother on 11 December 1919: [...] "Lloyd <b>George</b> <b>said</b> that, {{if he could get}} support for a plan whereby the six counties would be left as they are, he would be ready to give {{the rest of the country}} Dominion Home Rule, free from Imperial taxation, and with control of the Customs and Excise." [...] Healy considered that the idea had foundered on de Valera's insistence on having an all-Ireland republic, months before the war of independence became seriously violent in mid-1920.|$|E
