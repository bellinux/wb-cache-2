5|$|In Clifton, Goldney Hall {{was built}} {{first in the}} early 18th century by the wealthy {{merchant}} Goldney family and eventually {{became part of the}} university in 1956. It is a popular location for filming, with The Chronicles of Narnia, The House of Eliott and Truly, Madly, <b>Deeply,</b> <b>as</b> well as episodes of Only Fools and Horses and Casualty, being filmed there. The Grotto in the grounds is a Grade I listed building. Clifton Hill House is another Grade I listed building now used as student accommodation in Clifton. The original building was constructed between 1745 and 1750 by Isaac Ware, and has been used by the university since its earliest days in 1909. Manor Hall comprises five separate buildings, the principal of which was erected from 1927–1932 to the design of George Oatley following a donation from Henry Herbert Wills. One of its annexes, Manor House, has recently been refurbished and officially 'reopened' in 1999. Goldney Hall has beautiful gardens and modern accommodation complexes. Clifton Hill House has more dated facilities, but as with all the Clifton residences also possesses attractive gardens. Manor Hall houses the largest and most dated rooms, some dating back to the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
25|$|Dobbs' critics, {{including}} columnist James K. Glassman, {{author of}} Dow 36,000 {{and member of}} the American Enterprise Institute think tank, have accused him of inciting xenophobia. Others have accused him of Hispanophobia, a charge he denies and one which he has said offends him <b>deeply,</b> <b>as</b> his wife Debi Segura is a Mexican-American.|$|E

25|$|He {{devoted his}} life to caring for his younger brother Robert, who was {{disabled}} and lived with cerebral palsy, which was another factor in his lack of relationships. At some point in the 1920s, or possibly earlier, he read the writings of Mary Baker Eddy, including Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Cornell considered Eddy's works to be among the most important books ever published after the Bible, and he became a lifelong Christian Science adherent. Christian Science belief and practice informed Cornell's art <b>deeply,</b> <b>as</b> art historian Sandra Leonard Starr has shown.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} Canadian {{military}} assistance for Britain arose {{again during the}} Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa. The British asked for Canadian help in the conflict, and the Conservative Party was adamantly in favour of raising 8,000 troops for service in South Africa. English Canadian opinion was also overwhelmingly in favour of active Canadian participation in the war. However, French Canadians almost universally opposed the war, as did several other groups. This split the governing Liberal Party <b>deeply,</b> <b>as</b> it relied on both pro-imperial Anglo-Canadians and anti-imperial Franco-Canadians for support. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier initially sent 1,000 soldiers of the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry. Later, other contingents were sent, including the privately raised Strathcona's Horse.|$|E

500|$|Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 {{at the age}} of {{fourteen}} and married Henry of Orléans, the second son of King Francis I of France. Though she kept in touch with her native Florence, her taste matured at the [...] royal court of France. [...] Her father-in-law impressed Catherine <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> an example of what a monarch should be. She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own.|$|E
500|$|... "Les herbes de l'oubli ..." [...] {{follows the}} course of a larghetto phrase. [...] The tempo of [...] "Le coq" [...] is moderato, with a little more {{animation}} towards the end. [...] "La petite tortue ..." [...] proceeds naturally on a lento rhythm. [...] "La lune d'automne ..." [...] rises on an agitato wave. [...] "Alors ..." [...] returns to the larghetto of the second mélodie, and [...] "L'été ..." [...] unfolds calm. [...] The end is freely slow, dim. e morendo, with the freedom to let the instruments resonate as <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> possible.

500|$|After her {{retirement}} {{in the early}} 1980s, Hudson started to {{study the effects of}} nuclear bombs and radiation on the environment and people; because of what she found, she subsequently focused her ministry on peace and protesting nuclear proliferation. In 1983, she protested the introduction of nuclear cruise missiles to Michigan. In 1990, she was arrested and imprisoned for 6 months for illegally accessing a bunker on Wurtsmith Air Force Base and painting [...] "Christ lives, Disarm" [...] on the side of it. Hudson had a strong belief that she was doing the right thing and living out her faith, and stated that [...] " [...] put life before the law." [...] In this, she was acting upon a determination by her congregation that the members were free to take social stands about which they felt <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> individuals, without, however, representing the congregation.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the early}} concept for {{the album was}} to show the band's reality and {{development}} in a chronological order, the earthquake made the band re-evaluate {{what they wanted to}} express with their documentary theme. Instead, the band decided to express what living in 2011 was like. Yamaguchi felt inspired to create music that when listened to strongly expressed the sentiments of a certain era, which he saw in the music of John Lennon, Bob Dylan and in Japanese singer Yōsui Inoue's song [...] "Kasa ga Nai" [...] (1972); as a way for people in the future to be able to experience how people felt during the post-earthquake era. In addition to the earthquake, Yamaguchi expressed other events that happened to him in 2011 through the albums's lyrics, including the death of electronic musician Rei Harakami in July 2011 which affected him <b>deeply,</b> <b>as</b> well as a turbulent event in his love life.|$|E

2500|$|For evening wear, the {{corresponding}} code is black tie (sometimes called tuxedo in American English). The name [...] "black tie" [...] {{for this type}} of evening wear can be misleading because it is a generally accepted practice to substitute other colors for the traditional black tie. In formal evening dress, or white tie dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> it becomes more formal.|$|E

Rabbi Friedman subsequently issued an apology for the offensive remarks.|$|R
2500|$|Her spouse was {{described}} as [...] "principally known as useful and boring", but the marriage was a happy one, and she used {{to take him to}} the Utile Dulci Academy and sing with him. She had no children, but adopted a daughter. In 1797 the daughter was placed in a mental asylum, but died soon after her admission, an event which affected Lenngren <b>deeply,</b> <b>as</b> did the death of her father, who drowned under suspicious circumstances in 1798.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie and Reggie Montgomery {{were written}} as Maggie's two closest male friends, and [...] "voices of reason" [...] to Maggie's love life. Within the story, they urge Maggie {{to accept the}} reality of her {{feelings}} for Bianca. In one scene, Jamie tells a surprised Maggie that he knows what she and Bianca have going on is [...] "far more" [...] than friendship, and that everyone can see it. He tells her {{that when it comes}} to his romantic life, he wishes that someone loved him as <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> she loves Bianca. Reggie often says that Bianca and Maggie have a [...] "forever love." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book is {{narrated by}} several people, most notably a man {{returning}} {{after a long}} absence to his abandoned family home in Charity, Texas; other characters in the man’s family narrate their own sections, as do inanimate objects (a river, the wind, the woods). The text does not adhere to the usual structure of a novel: there is no “plot” to develop, and characters and events are explored <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> moments of life are recalled. The book is thus composed of linked accounts of {{people who lived in}} the town, loosely connected by the first-person narrator. “The focus of the novel is the leaving and returning of the self-exiled “children” of Charity—the interrelatedness of people and place.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Navy {{had used}} Swordfish torpedo planes, and their low speed {{was part of}} the reason the Taranto attack succeeded. The Imperial Japanese Navy no longer had any similar planes, so they had to develop other methods, both {{hardware}} and delivery technique. They independently developed shallow water torpedo modifications (called [...] "Thunder Fish") during the planning and training for the attack in 1941. Wooden fins were added to the tail and anti-roll [...] "flippers" [...] kept the torpedo upright once in the water. The fins kept the torpedo's nose level in the air and broke off on entering the water. The flatter [...] "flight" [...] trajectory helped keep them from diving so <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> to encounter bottom mud. (Despite these modifications, some Japanese torpedoes did indeed reach the bottom and several remain unaccounted for.) These simple modifications were not anticipated by the USN, and Admiral Bloch (commander of the Pearl Harbor Naval District) did not push to install torpedo nets or baffles at Pearl. Nor, it seems, did anyone else. Practical considerations also were an influence. Due to the shallow anchorage (which continues to require regular dredging), installation of torpedo nets would have severely restricted the mobility of vessels in the harbor.|$|E
