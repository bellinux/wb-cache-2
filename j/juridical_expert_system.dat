40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 62) <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> are {{the latest}} computer software systems developed to solve classes of problems different from problems solved by conventional software programs. <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> approach o problem {{in the same manner}} that humans reason and think. They are capable of this reasoning because of their stored knowledge of a specific area within their memory and their ability to reason. The use of this knowledge allows the <b>Expert</b> <b>System</b> to arrive at particular conclusions and solutions to a problem, similar to the conclusions that human experts arrive at. The novelty of this technology results in defining a need for an explanatory overview of <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> and guidelines to building <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> especially for managers interested in incorporating <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> development and use in the company's framework of operation. This paper was conceived to stress the importance of <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> to managers, provide an overview of the history, trends and projections of the <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> market, explain simply the technical concepts of <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> and differentiate the types of <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems.</b> Another major area covered is the provision of basic guidelines for managers to follow when building <b>Expert</b> <b>Systems</b> to eliminate major costly mistakes and to insure their success.

Testing rule-based <b>expert</b> <b>systems,</b> however, is a new area in software engineering which requires new testing techniques.

This is assumption impractical to make for <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> development, for the knowledge base of an <b>expert</b> <b>system</b> is quite simply a huge non-modular program.
