Ecological relationships regulate the flux of <b>energy,</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory.

40|$|Nutrition is {{the process}} of {{providing}} nourishment to the living organism for its healthy upkeep, growth and reproduction. Nutrient substances for this purpose are provided by food. An individuals nutritional status is dependent on the provision of sufficient nutrient substances, and good utilization of these nutrients.

The chief function of food is to supply nutrient material to meet the physiological needs of the organisms. such as to supply energy. to build and maintain the cells and tissues, and to regulate body processes. In general, {{there are two types of}} nutrients - <b>energy</b> <b>nutrients</b> (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) and non-energy nutrients (vitamins and minerals).

Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in two terciary care hospitals, with a probabilistic sample of 50 % of in-patients. Dietary intake was evaluated by a 24 -hour dietary recall, and undernutrition was screened through the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 tool. The overall frequency of inadequate <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake was estimated using Dietary Reference Intakes. Results: <b>Energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intakes from 258 patients showed very low values for both men and women. No significant differences were found for <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intakes across age groups (lt; 65 years and >= 65 years). When the proportion of study subjects with inadequate nutrient intakes was analysed, a high degree of inadequacy was found. The degree of inadequacy was higher for fibre, niacin, folate, vitamin B- 12, magnesium and zinc. No significant differences were found for <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrients</b> studied and for intakes below 113 of dietary recommendations from nutritionally-at-risk (n = 89) and well nourished (n = 169) patients.

According {{to the theory}} of fuzzy logic, this method is applicable to systems which cannot be precisely defined, such as human nutrient requirements.

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diet {{plays an}} {{important}} role in growth and development of children. However, dietary intakes of children living in either rural or urban areas can be influenced by household income. This cross-sectional study examined <b>energy,</b> <b>nutrient</b> and food group intakes of 749 urban children (1 - 10 years old) by household income status. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Children’s dietary intakes were obtained using food recall and record for two days. Diet adequacy was assessed based on recommended intakes of <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrients</b> and food group servings. RESULTS: For toddlers, all nutrients except dietary fiber (5. 5 g) exceeded recommended intakes. Among older children (preschoolers and school children), calcium (548 mg, 435 mg) and dietary fiber (7. 4 g, 9. 4 g) did not meet recommendations while percentage of energy from total fat and saturated fats exceeded 30 % and 10 %, respectively. The mean sodium intakes of preschoolers (1, 684 mg) and school children (2, 000 mg) were relatively high. Toddlers in all income groups had similar <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intakes and percentages meeting the recommended intakes. However, low income older children had lowest intakes of energy (P < 0. 05) and most nutrients (P < 0. 05) and highest proportions that did not meet recommended <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intakes. For all food groups, except milk and dairy products, all age groups had mean intakes below the recommended servings. Compared to middle and high income groups, low income preschoolers had the lowest mean intake of fruits (0. 07 serving), meat/poultr...|$|R

METHODS We used data from the first National Food Survey (2008 - 2009) of a one-day food log of a representative sample of the Brazilian population aged 10 years or older (n = 34, 003). For the analyses, we considered the sample weights and the effect of the study design. The mean (and standard deviations) and frequencies (%) of <b>energy,</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and food groups consumption were estimated for weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekend (Saturday and Sunday), we then estimated the differences according to the days of the week for the population strata analyzed. RESULTS The average daily energy intake for the weekend was 8 % higher than the one observed for weekdays. The average percentage contribution of carbohydrate to the daily energy intake was higher during the week compared to Saturday and Sunday (56. 3 % versus 54. 1 %, p < 0. 01). The inverse was observed for averages of the contribution to the daily intake of energy from total fat (26. 8 % versus 28. 4 %), saturated fat (9. 1 % versus 9. 9 %) and trans fat (1. 4 % versus 1. 6 %). The most significant changes between weekdays and weekend days were observed for eggs, sugar-added beverages, puff snacks and chips, beans, and pasta. During weekends, the frequency of beverage with added sugar consumption increased by 34 %, the amount consumed increased by 42 %, and the contribution to energy intake increased by 62 % when compared to weekdays. CONCLUSIONS The Brazilian population increases energy intake and unhealthy food markers on weekends compared to weekdays...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Taking {{examinations}} {{is central}} to student experience at University and may cause psychological stress. Although stress is recognised to impact on food intake, the effects of undertaking examinations on students' dietary intake have not been well characterised. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess how students' <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake may alter during examination periods. METHODS: The study design was a within-subject comparison of students' <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake during an examination period contrasted with that outside an examination period (baseline). A total of 20 male students from the University of Sheffield completed an automated photographic 4 -d dietary record alongside four 24 -h recalls in each time period. Daily <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake was estimated for each student by time period and change in <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake calculated. Intakes at baseline were compared to UK dietary recommendations. Cluster analysis categorised students according to their change in energy intake between baseline and the examination period. Non-parametric statistical tests identified differences by cluster. RESULTS: Baseline intakes did not meet recommendations for energy, non-milk extrinsic sugars, non-starch polysaccharide and sodium. Three defined clusters of students were identified: Cluster D who decreased daily energy intake by 12. 06 MJ (n = 5), Cluster S who had similar energy intakes (n = 13) and Cluster I who substantially increased energy intake by 6. 37 MJ (n = 2) between baseline and examination period. There were statistically significant differences (all p < 0. 05) in change in intake of protein, carbohydrate, calcium and sodium between clusters. Cluster D recorded greater energy, carbohydrate and protein intakes than Cluster I at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of students were dietary resilient. Students who demonstrated hypophagia in the examination period had a high <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake at baseline, conversely those who showed hyperphagia had a low <b>energy</b> and <b>nutrient</b> intake.
