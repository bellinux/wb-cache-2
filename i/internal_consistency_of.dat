25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the chiral flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the chiral limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with chiral perturbation theory. The <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by chiral perturbation theory.|$|E

500|$|Dirac {{described}} the quantization {{of the electromagnetic}} field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators {{with the introduction of}} the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, Werner Heisenberg and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, {{it would be possible to}} perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles. However, further studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, [...] in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} to the UCC caused a dual system in Soviet copyright law, with {{the effect that}} foreign works published after May 27, 1973, were actually granted a stronger copyright protection than Soviet works because for foreign works {{the definition of the}} UCC of [...] "publication" [...] applied, which was narrower than the definition of [...] "publication" [...] in Soviet law, which continued to be applied to Soviet works. The duality was also emphasized by the new licensing scheme. In the years following the {{accession to}} the UCC, considerable doctrinal confusion ensued amongst Soviet scholars on how to reconcile such dual treatment with the Soviet ideology or ideals. Scholars proposed further changes and clarifications beyond the changes necessary to conform to the UCC. Elst concludes that the accession to the UCC questioned the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> Soviet law and undermined several of its basic principles, and that the myriad of improvement suggestions by scholars actually caused new legal uncertainties.|$|E
2500|$|For many believers, the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the Jewish and Christian scriptures is {{important}} because they feel that any inconsistencies or contradictions could challenge belief in truth of their contents and the view that they are of divine origin. On {{the subject of the}} Jewish text, B. Barry Levy writes about the Torah that [...] "the textual integrity of every biblical book should be extremely important to those interested in either the Hebrew Bible or classical Jewish thought". Levy also writes that [...] "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected rabbinic leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies." [...] However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this [...] "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".|$|E

The invested effort subscale assessed students’ test-taking motivation defined according to Baumert and Demmrich’s ([2001]) definition—willingness to engage on test items. We assigned the other subscales to the test-related facets (test attractiveness, usefulness of the test) and to the person-related facets (emotional state, worry, distraction) of test-taking motivation.|$|R
40|$|The psychometric {{properties}} of the Swedish self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-s), and the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems as measured by the SDQ-s, were studied in 14 to 15 -year-old adolescents. The {{psychometric properties}} were found to be similar to those found in other language versions, in terms of similar factor structure and acceptable test-retest stability, but low <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> for some <b>of</b> the subscales. There was evidence of good convergent and discriminant validity. The results with regard to gender differences replicated previous findings in other countries, the girls reporting more emotional symptoms and more prosocial behavior, and the boys reporting more conduct problems and tending to report more peer problems. It is concluded that the results are in favor of using the Swedish SDQ-s as a screening instrument for adolescents, despite the low <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> some of its subscales...|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of adult testimonials occurred {{as a result}} of adults undergoing psychotherapy, in most cases therapy designed to elicit memories of SRA. Therapists claimed the pain expressed by the patients, <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> their stories and similarity of allegations by different patients was evidence for SRA, but despite this, the disclosures of patients never resulted in any corroboration; Allegations of alleged victims that were obtained from mental health practitioners lacked verifiable evidence, were anecdotal and involved incidents that were years or decades old. The concern for therapists revolved around the pain of their clients, which is for them more important than the truth of their patients' statements. A sample of 29 patients in a medical clinic reporting SRA found no corroboration of the claims in medical records or in discussion with family members. and a survey of 2,709 American therapists found the {{majority of}} allegations of SRA came from only sixteen therapists, suggesting that the determining factor in a patient making allegations of SRA was the therapist's predisposition. Further, the alleged similarities between patient accounts (particularly between adults and children) turned out to be illusory upon review, with adults describing far more elaborate, severe and bizarre abuse than children. Bette Bottoms, who reviewed hundreds of claims of adult and child abuse, described the ultimate evidence for the abuse as [...] "astonishingly weak and ambiguous" [...] particularly given the severity of the alleged abuse. Therapists however, were found to believe patients more as the allegations became more bizarre and severe.|$|E

30|$|A {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} is the number of items per subscale. For example, the test usefulness subscale had just one item, while the distraction subscale contained only two. The <b>internal</b> <b>consistencies</b> <b>of</b> these two subscales could be improved by adding further items to them. Due to the restricted testing time and the large number of questions in the student questionnaire, more items could not be implemented. However, good and substantial reliabilities confirmed the homogeneity of these scales.|$|R

30|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> {{reliability}} <b>of</b> {{the three}} scales in NUEPS was determined {{in the study}} by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the above sample. The results in Table  2 indicate that the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the three NUEPS scales. For the whole scale, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.98, and the half-split reliability of the scale was 0.93. For the ‘STA’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, with a half-split reliability of 0.93. For the ‘SRP’, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.95, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Finally, for the ‘LAPI’ sub-dimension, the Cronbach’s alpha (α) value was 0.92, and the half-split reliability was 0.90. Thus, the <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> reliability <b>of</b> the measures used in this study can be considered as favorable.|$|R
