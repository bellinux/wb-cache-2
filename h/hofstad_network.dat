5|$|On 10 November 2004, two {{suspected}} attackers {{were captured}} after an hour-long siege {{of a building}} in The Hague. They were in possession of three grenades and were accused of planning to murder Wilders {{as well as a}} fellow MP, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The suspects were presumed to be members of what the Dutch intelligence agency, the General Intelligence and Security Service, has termed the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network</b> (Hofstadgroep). Since this incident Wilders has been under constant security protection because of frequent threats to his life. In September 2007, a Dutch woman was sentenced to a one-year prison term for sending more than 100 threatening emails to Wilders. In 2009, a rapper from Rotterdam was sentenced to 80 hours community service and a two-month suspended jail term for threatening Wilders in a rap song. Wilders was listed as the most threatened politician in the Netherlands in 2008.|$|E

This {{was one of a}} series of raids on {{suspected}} Muslim terrorist cells following the 2 November 2004 assassination of filmmaker Theo van Gogh by fellow <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network</b> member Mohammed Bouyeri. Near the end of this siege, Walters threw a hand grenade at police.|$|E
50|$|A known {{operation}} of the UIM was on 10 November 2004 in The Hague. The police had tried to arrest Ismail A. and Jason W. (members of the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network)</b> in a house at the Laakkwartier, but failed, as three police officers had been injured by grenades thrown at them by the terrorists. UIM operators were ordered to secure and maintain the site. After a successful raid, the two young terrorists were arrested.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network</b> (Dutch: Hofstadnetwerk or Hofstadgroep, [...] or [...] ) is a {{group of}} mostly young Dutch persons, mainly North African ancestry, which Interpol has {{described}} as a terrorist organization. The name [...] "Hofstad" [...] was originally the codename the Dutch secret service AIVD used for the network and leaked to the media. The name likely refers to the nickname of the city of The Hague, where some of the suspected terrorists live.|$|E
50|$|The killer, Mohammed Bouyeri, a 26-year-old Dutch-Moroccan citizen, was apprehended {{by police}} after a chase, {{during which he}} was shot in the leg. Authorities have alleged that Bouyeri has {{terrorist}} ties with the Dutch Islamist <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network.</b> He was charged with the attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders, illegal possession of a firearm, and conspiring to murder others, including Hirsi Ali.

50|$|Belkacem {{was arrested}} in Whitechapel, London on 22 June 2005 on request of the Dutch authorities. Belkacems name arose in an {{investigation}} about people smuggling in the Dutch province of Zeeland. He was extradited on 2 August 2005. He was charged with {{being a member of}} a terrorist organisation. In addition he was charged with recruiting for armed struggle, several firearms offences and forging documents. Belkacem allegedly helped Redouan al-Issar, spiritual leader of the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network,</b> flee the Netherlands {{on the day of the}} murder of Theo van Gogh.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder of Theo van Gogh by Mohammed Bouyeri in November 2004 the {{organization}} gained attention from national media when an attempt to arrest suspected members Jason Walters and Ismail Akhnikh led to a 14-hour siege of a house in The Hague. During these events, the name <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network</b> became public and the media has continued to use this moniker {{to refer to the}} organization. In the months after the siege, a number of other suspected members of the organization were arrested. On 5 December 2005, the Hofstad court case against 14 suspected members started.|$|E

5000|$|At {{an early}} age {{he was known to}} the police {{as a member of a}} group of Moroccan [...] "problem-youth". For a while he worked as a {{volunteer}} at Eigenwijks, a neighbourhood organization in Amsterdam's Slotervaart suburb. After his mother died and his father remarried in the fall of 2003, he started to live according to strict interpretations of Sunni Islamic Sharia law. As a result, he could perform fewer and fewer tasks at Eigenwijks. For example, he refused to serve alcohol and did not want to be present at activities attended by both women and men. Finally, he put an end to his activities at Eigenwijks altogether. He grew a beard and began to wear a djellaba. He frequently visited the El Tawheed mosque where he met other radical Sunnis, among whom was the suspected terrorist Samir Azzouz. With the group of radicals he is said to have formed the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network,</b> a Dutch terrorist cell.|$|E
50|$|Majority of Muslims in the Netherlands {{belong to}} Sunni denomination, with a {{sizeable}} Shia minority. Approximately 1,500 {{belong to the}} Ahmadiyya sect in Islam.Muslim numbers began to rise after the 1970s {{as the result of}} immigration. Some migrants from former Dutch colonies, such as Surinam and Indonesia, were sometimes Muslim, but migrant workers from Turkey and Morocco are the biggest part, as well as their children. During the 1990s, the Netherlands opened its borders for Muslim refugees from countries like Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. Of the immigrant ethnic groups, 100% of Bosniaks; 99% of Moroccans; 90% of Turks; 69% of Asians; 64% of other Africans, and 12% of Surinamese were Muslims. Muslims form a diverse group. Social tensions between native Dutch and migrant Muslims began to rise in the early 21st century, with the murder of politician Pim Fortuyn by militant animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf and the murder of Theo van Gogh by extremist Muslim, Mohammed Bouyeri, part of the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>Network.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we analyze {{the shift from}} a politicized {{identity}} to a radicalized identity of (members of) the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>network.</b> Our findings are based on an analysis of texts written by the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>network</b> by Meijer who acted as an expert witness {{at one of the}} trials involving the network. We also include my observations and transcripts of chats and online debates that I gathered when I followed the activities of the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>network</b> on the Internet between 2002 and 2005 and conducted interviews with three informants within the network. After introducing the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>network,</b> we provide an analysis of the “assimilationist” discourse {{and the rise of the}} Salafi movement as a background for the politicization and radicalization of the members of the <b>Hofstad</b> <b>network.</b> This process is analyzed from a social movement perspective, following Gamson (1992), by focusing on their perception of injustice, the agency of the people, and their identity...|$|E
