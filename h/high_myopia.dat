25|$|Many {{people with}} Stickler {{syndrome}} are very nearsighted (described as having <b>high</b> <b>myopia)</b> {{because of the}} shape of the eye. People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye (ocular hypertension) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light-sensitive retina of the eye (retinal detachment). Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Stickler's Syndrome. The jelly-like substance within the eye (the vitreous humour) has a distinctive appearance in the types of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. As a result, regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised. The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{relationship}} between axial length and complications of phacoemulsification with intraocular lens(IOL) implantation in <b>high</b> axial <b>myopia</b> eyes and normal axis eyes. METHODS: A retrospective review of 843 consecutive patients(1 042 eyes) of cataract extraction with phacoemulsification and IOL implantation in our hospital from February 2012 to February 2013 was performed. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to the axial length: 853 eyes were in normal axis group(21 - 24 mm) and 189 eyes were in <b>high</b> axial <b>myopia</b> group(≥ 26 mm). The two groups were compared regarding surgical complications, such as vitreous loss, posterior capsular rupture, nucleolus drop, and abnormal location of IOL. RESULTS: Age was a risk factor in both groups. There was positive correlation between age and surgical complications, and between axial length and surgical complications, especially for complications with posterior capsular rupture and vitreous loss. CONCLUSION: As the results illustrate, in this survey, age and high axial lengthare statistically significant risk factors for incidence of complications of phacoemulsification.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{safety and}} {{predictability}} of refractive surgery for all degrees of myopia is now becoming established. It is therefore appropriate {{to evaluate whether}} there is a patient driven demand for such treatments and, if so, to establish guidelines for its provision within the National Health Service (NHS).  METHODS—A comparative study was designed to assess the effect of degree of myopia on quality of life ("high" (n =  30) - 10. 00 D, worse eye; "moderate" (n =  40) - 4. 00 to - 9. 75 D, worse eye; "low" (n =  42) <- 4. 00 D, worse eye) compared with a group of patients with keratoconus (n =  30) treated by optical correction. Data collection included binocular logMAR visual acuity, Pelli-Robson low contrast letter sensitivity, questionnaires to assess subjective visual function (VF- 14) and effect on quality of life (VQOL), and semi-structured interviews.  RESULTS—There {{were no significant differences in}} any of the measures between patients with a <b>high</b> degree of <b>myopia</b> and those with keratoconus, or between those with a low and those with a moderate degree of myopia. However, those with a <b>high</b> degree of <b>myopia</b> had highly significantly poorer logMAR, VF- 14, and VQOL scores than those with low and moderate myopia (p< 0. 001). Interview data supported these findings with patients with a <b>high</b> degree of <b>myopia</b> and those with keratoconus reporting that psychological, cosmetic, practical, and financial factors affected their quality of life.  CONCLUSION—Compared with low and moderate myopia, patients with a <b>high</b> degree of <b>myopia</b> experience impaired quality of life similar to that of patients with keratoconus. Criteria should therefore be identified to enable those in sufficient need to obtain refractive surgical treatment under the NHS. ...|$|R

40|$|Myopia is an {{epidemic}} health problem in Taiwan's schoolchildren. The prevalence of myopia {{has been increasing}} yearly, and the average age at which myopia develops has also become younger. Due to insufficient eye care in remote areas, the refractive status of aboriginal schoolchildren has not been well established. In 2005 and 2006, under the sponsorship of the Bureau of Health Promotion, we surveyed the ocular refraction of aboriginal schoolchildren in southern Taiwan mountain townships. From five primary schools in two townships, 371 children aged from 7 to 13 years of age were enrolled in our study. Refractive status under cycloplegia and subjective visual acuity were obtained. The crude prevalence of myopia (<− 0. 25 diopter [D]) was 25. 6 %. Although the prevalence increased with age, the annual change in mean refractive status was slower in the schoolchildren of mountain aborigines.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} different formulas used for IOL power calculation in patients with <b>high</b> axial <b>myopia</b> undergoing cataract surgery. MethodsA prospective clinical study was carried out on 53 eyes of 51 patients with an axial length from 25. 5 to 31. 4 mm including 21 males (41. 2 %) and 30 females (58. 8 %). Calculation of the IOL power to be implanted was done by three available IOL power formulas; Haigis formula, SRK/T formula, and Holladay I formula. The mean error (ME) was calculated from {{the difference between the}} formula predicted refractive error and the actual post operative refractive error. ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference between the mean error of the three formulas used in the overall performance or in the axial length subcategories. SRK/T formula caused the smallest mean error, (+ 0. 17 D). Haigis formula showed a higher ME (+ 0. 21 D) and Holladay formula caused a myopic postoperative refractive error (− 0. 20 D). ConclusionThe calculation of IOL power in patients with <b>high</b> axial <b>myopia</b> using the third or the fourth generation formulas help in improvement of the accuracy of the calculation and decreasing the post operative refractive error.

40|$|Myopia is {{of diverse}} aetiology. A small {{proportion}} of myopia is clearly familial, generally early in onset and of high level, with defined chromosomal localisations and in some cases, causal genetic mutations. However, in economically developed societies, most myopia appears during childhood, particularly during the school years. The chromosomal localisations characterised so far for <b>high</b> familial <b>myopia</b> {{do not seem to}} be relevant to school myopia. Family correlations in refractive error and axial length are consistent with a genetic contribution to variations in school myopia, but potentially confound shared genes and shared environments. High heritability values are obtained from twin studies, but rest on contestable assumptions, and require further critical analysis, particularly in view of the low heritability values obtained from parent–offspring correlations where there has been rapid environmental change between generations. Since heritability is a population-specific parameter, the values obtained on twins cannot be extrapolated to define the genetic contribution to variation in the general population. In addition, high heritability sets no limit to the potential for environmentally induced change. There is in fact strong evidence for rapid, environmentally induced change in the prevalence of myopia, associated with increased education and urbanisation. These environmental impacts have been found in all major branches of the human family, defined in modern molecular terms, with the exception of the Pacific Islanders, where the evidence is too limited to draw conclusions.

Study design: Prospective correlational study. Material and Method: LASIK was performed on 65 eyes of 33 patients for correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism.

Results: IOP reading was significantly reduced by mean of 2. 9 + 2. 5 mmHg (p = 0. 0001). The authors used Pearson analysis to study the correlation between the change in IOP and the reduction of CCT. In subgroup analysis the patients were divided by degree of myopia: group 1, myopia less than- 3 diopters (D) (n = 14); group 2, myopia- 3 to- 6 D (n = 31); group 3, myopia greater than- 6 D (n = 20)).
