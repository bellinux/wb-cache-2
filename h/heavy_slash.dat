5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through <b>heavy,</b> <b>slashing</b> brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|R

5000|$|The game is an action-adventure {{title with}} <b>heavy</b> hack and <b>slash</b> {{gameplay}}. The gameplay {{of the game}} resembles a martial arts title focused on melee combat while featuring opportunities for ranged attacks. The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the [...] "Heavenly Sword" [...] which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses {{as part of a}} unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.|$|R
50|$|The game uses a six-button layout: five {{of which}} are {{responsible}} for the attacks—punch, kick, slash, <b>heavy</b> <b>slash</b> and dust—, and the other one for taunting or respecting the other player. There are several other techniques which are triggered when two or three buttons are pressed simultaneously. A burst gauge is filled as time goes by or when the player receives damage; once the gauge is filled, the player can perform a Psych Burst {{to move away from the}} opponent. It unleashes a blast of energy that, if it successfully hits the adversary, completely charges another gauge, the tension gauge. The tension gauge allows the player to perform certain other special attacks.|$|E
5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and <b>heavy</b> <b>slash,</b> and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary furrower from Finland.|$|E

500|$|Combat in Kingdom Hearts II is in {{real-time}} {{and involves}} <b>heavy</b> hack and <b>slash</b> elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, {{similar to those found}} in Final Fantasy games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members. A new feature is the [...] "Reaction Command", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle. Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a boss battle. In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat. Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{is used to}} restock trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) cutblocks and factors controlling regeneration {{are areas}} of interest and concern to the forest industry. Harvest operations in Manitoba require that coarse woody debris, or slash, be left and distributed in cutblocks. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of slash loading on soil temperatures and aspen regeneration, and implications for harvest operations in the Duck Mountain area. Early sucker growth, initiation, and soil temperatures were surveyed in six winter and six summer cutblocks under different levels of slash loadings. A growth chamber study, using field temperature data as a guideline, examined the effects of diurnal temperature variation on sucker initiation and production. In winter and summer cutblocks, mean depths to sucker initiation from the parent root were 4. 6 + 2. 4 cm and 3. 4 + 2. 1 cm, respectively, and initiation of suckers occurred mainly from parental roots located in the LFH layer. Daily mean soil temperatures during the growing season were significantly lower under higher levels of slash (difference of 3. 6 oC during May). Higher amounts of slash also significantly shortened the length of the growing season (89 fewer days above 0 oC in one season) and decreased the number of suckers produced (150 000 ha– 1 decreased to 14 000 ha- 1), sucker volume (decreased by 256 cm 3 m- 2) and leaf area index (decreased by 0. 9). There was no difference in sucker production between any diurnal temperature treatments in the growth chamber study. Shallow depth to sucker initiation has important implications for harvest operations using heavy machinery especially those occurring during the summer season. Moderate levels of slash in summer cutblocks, and <b>heavy</b> levels of <b>slash</b> in winter cutblocks limit sucker growth. Although slash decreases diurnal temperature amplitudes, this may not be the reason for the decrease in sucker production associated with increased levels of slash. Both soil temperature and early sucker growth are strongly affected by slash loading; by monitoring harvest operations and the distribution of slash within cutblocks, the negative effect of heavy machine traffic and <b>heavy</b> piles of <b>slash</b> can be reduced and ensure successful forest regeneration...|$|R
500|$|Some protesters {{resorted to}} illegal means to {{demonstrate}} {{their opposition to the}} project. In December 1989, trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers. A field office belonging to M.J. Lee Construction Co., a contractor working on the project, was burglarized on March 4, 1990. The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents. A week later, the fuel lines on <b>heavy</b> equipment were <b>slashed.</b> On the night of April 26, several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M.J. Lee were vandalized; the vandals smashed windshields and headlights, stole fuel caps, and dumped mud into the fuel tanks. Messages reading [...] "Death to OTA", [...] "Death to [...] Bellmon" [...] and [...] "Death to Bartlett" [...] (who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman) were written in mud {{on the side of a}} water truck at the site. The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated $10,000 ($17,900 in [...] dollars) financial loss, not OTA, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party. Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs, and survey markers were relocated. Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism, offering an additional $500 reward for information. A member of the group's board stated [...] "We deplore this kind of cowardly, illegal action. There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor." [...] In response to the vandalism, Tulsa police launched an investigation, and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas. On August 11, 1990, a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane. As the employee approached the crane, four people fled the scene. The employee was able to detain two of them, both aged eighteen, until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief.|$|R
30|$|Some {{previous}} {{reports have}} suggested that MPB-killed stands may pose a fuels hazard many years after beetle attacks. Understory releases of various conifer species have been documented to occur 2 to 10 years after MPB outbreaks (Cole and Amman 1980, Heath and Alfaro 1990) and could contribute to increased fuel loading and fuel continuity in the post-MPB regenerating stand (Jenkins et al. 2008). A recent experimental burn was conducted in heavy fuels ∼ 20 to 25 years after severe MPB attacks in an eastern British Columbia lodgepole pine stand; measured spread rates were comparable to those in this study: ROS of 27.6 m min− 1 at an adjusted ISI of 9.4 (Kubian et al. 2009). Similarly, explosive crown fire behaviour was described many years earlier on the 1961 Sleeping Child Fire (Montana, USA), 30 to 35 years post-MPB attack, as discussed recently by Jenkins et al. (2012). Some of the areas most heavily affected by MPB may gradually resemble <b>heavy</b> <b>slash</b> as the dead overstory trees collapse; however, very little data on fire behaviour in these stands is currently available and most assumptions are still based on model outputs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Displacement {{of logging}} slash and forest floor litter {{in the process}} of {{harvesting}} can interfere with forest nutrient cycling and can modify soil climate in ways that could affect regeneration success and forest productivity. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess a visual method for estimating organic matter and slash biomass residues following a typical feller-buncher/grapple-skidder clearcut harvest. A 20 by 20 meter grid was established in six 20 -year-old loblolly pine plantations, each of which was 3. 2 ha in size. Pre-harvest biomass was estimated using biomass equations developed by Baldwin (1987). Post harvest slash and litter biomass remaining was measured across the grid network by making visual estimates of percent coverage for each of 4 size classes and relating that to biomass using simple linear regression. Harvest slash and litter were collected from 4 m 2 plots and weighed to estimated biomass as a function of percent cover for each size class. <b>Heavy</b> <b>slash</b> (> 2. 5 cm) on the wet harvest sites had a biomass of 2. 49 kg/m 2, compared to 1. 89 kg/m 2 on the dry harvest sites. The amount of light slash (c 2. 5 cm) was also signifi-cantly greater on the wet harvest sites, 2. 47 kg/m*, compared to that on the dry-harvested sites at 1. 99 kg/m 2. Litter biomass,- 2. 4 kg / mZ, and piles, 0. 7 kg/m*, were not significantly different between sites. Visual estimation procedures provide a rough but useful estimate of biomass remaining after harvest (Pi * = 0. 42 to 0. 67), an extensive spatial estimate that is difficult to ascertain in any other way. The method reveals a certain amount of homogeniza-tion after harvesting. Harvesting sites when dry compared to wet results in a larger amount of displacement from the interior of a logging site. These estimates can be used to judge whether harvesting disturbance on organic residues affects stand p r o d u c t i v i t y...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} {{regulating}} the productivity and diversity of forest ecosystems. Soil organic matter resulting from the decomposition of leaf litter and branch and bole material provides an important reservoir of nutrients for future forest growth. The structure of soils, in conjunction with soil texture, determines the ability of a soil to retain moisture. Forest harvest operations, through the use of <b>heavy</b> equipment and <b>slash</b> management practices, have the potential to damage soil structure and remove organic matter from the forest floor. We lack a clear understanding, however, of which soil types are most susceptible, and what degree of impact soils can sustain before the potential productivity and diversity are reduced. To address this issue, the US Forest Service initiated a nationwide Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) study to assess the effects of logging operations on the structure and organic matter content of forest soils (Powers et al. 1990). In the Lake States, study plots were installed on the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Huron National Forests. These plots represent the range of soil textures which occur across the Lake States: silt loams, clays, and sands, respectively. Using an experimental approach, different levels of soil compaction and organic matter removal were applied to harvested aspen stands across this soil gradient. Aspen reproduction, forest biomass, and the diversity of the ground-flora layers are being monitored on a periodic basis to assess their response to these treatments. The results of this experiment will allow us to predict the degree of protection required to sustain productivity and floristic diversity in aspen stands across a range of common Lake State soil types. The Lake States LTSP study included an analysis of floristic diversity to the suite of measurements made on the study plots. Biodiversity and forest management have become critical issues in the Lake States Forests. In Minnesota’s Generic Environmental Impact Statement, diversity was one of the key focal issues. Ground-flora has received wide use as ecological indicators and in ecological land classification systems across the Great Lakes (Spies and Barnes 1985, Host and Pregitzer 1991, Coffmann et al. 1983, Shadis et al. 1995, MN DNR 2003). A study by Berger, Peuttmann and Host showed a strong response of ground-flora to on-site operations, particularly on landings and skid trails, which receive a high degree of compaction (Berger, Peuttmann and Host 2004). The rate and degree to which sites recover from compaction, however, is poorly understood. The primary objective of this study was assess changes in species richness, diversity and community composition seventeen years after installation of the LTSP treatments on the Chippewa National Forest of north central Minnesota...|$|R
