5|$|The film's title {{comes from}} the fictional S video series {{directed}} by Rost. In the videos, Rost stalks women {{for a long time}} and, after learning about them, he asks them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a part of his films. All of the videos are first person with no dialogue. The film references other films, including Peeping Tom, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, , Kill the Scream Queen, and The Crucifier.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> climb a ladder.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

50|$|This {{referendum}} {{asked to}} abolish the law excluding ministers from ordinary prosecution. Italian voters had <b>to</b> say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> abolish the parliamentary board which substituted ordinary court in ministerial accusations, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain it.

5|$|Finn and Jake {{awake in}} a prison cell full of bananas, {{confused}} and unaware of how they arrived at their location. A demonic prison guard tells {{them that they are}} in the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson). The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need to seek an audience with Hunson Abadeer <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. Just then, a storm cloud appears in a mist, slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

Italian voters had <b>to</b> say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> forbid any worldwide nuclear engagement of Italy, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> continue an Italian nuclear research abroad. The referendum had a turnout of 65.1%.|$|R
50|$|This {{referendum}} {{asked to}} abolish {{the power of the}} State to oblige the local administrations to accept new nuclear plants in their territory. Italian voters had <b>to</b> say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> support local administrations, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> maintain statal supremacy about this theme. The referendum had a turnout of 65.1%.|$|R

Alternatively, pupils can be taught in Philosophy {{likewise}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> Visits to churches are included to the lessons in basic school.

25|$|The reverse tactic can be used, by {{fast and}} slow bowlers alike, by placing {{seven or eight}} fielders on the off side and bowling far outside off stump.

More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.|$|E
25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing the grass and forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, {{because this is the}} time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E

It tests knowledge of the Dutch language, political system and social conventions. The test must be taken before entering the Netherlands, preferably in a Dutch embassy in the person's country of origin. Immigrants coming from an EU state, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand cannot take this integration test, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it is not for the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E

Therefore, for example, an individual who only has New Zealand citizenship {{will never be able to}} apply for Singaporean citizenship because once her Singaporean citizenship application has been approved, she must first renounce her existing nationality before she can attend a Singaporean citizenship ceremony and officially obtain Singaporean nationality.|$|E
