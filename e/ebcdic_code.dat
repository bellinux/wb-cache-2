5000|$|Some implementations, {{for example}} IBM {{mainframe}} systems, support zoned decimal numeric representations. Each decimal digit {{is stored in}} one byte, with the lower four bits encoding the digit in BCD form. The upper four bits, called the [...] "zone" [...] bits, are usually set to a fixed value so that the byte holds a character value corresponding to the digit. EBCDIC systems use a zone value of 1111 (hex F); this yields bytes in the range F0 to F9 (hex), which are the <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>codes</b> for the characters [...] "0" [...] through [...] "9".

40|$|In today’s {{multimedia}} world, {{everything has}} got digital around us. Even in medical application the traditional diagnosis {{is replaced by}} e-diagnosis. Nowadays, transmission of digitized medical information has become very easy due to the availability and generality of internet. However the digital form of these images can easily be manipulated and degraded. The problem of copyright protection and medical security poses a big challenge to privacy protection using watermarking techniques. This paper presents a framework on digital watermarking as an effective technology to protect property rights and limit the distribution of multimedia data. In this paper a CT scan of head is taken as cover image in which the patient’s detail and doctor’s detail together taken as a watermark and encoded by <b>coding</b> technique called <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>coding</b> technique to enhance the robustness of proposed method. The scheme is blind so that the EPR(Electronic patient record) can be extracted from the medical image without the need of original image. Therefore proposed method is useful for telemedicine applications. The performance of different techniques is evaluated by considering the correlation factor for exact recovery of watermark and PSNR for perfect reconstruction of watermarked image. High value of PSNR indicates better reconstruction of medical image...|$|R
50|$|To {{produce the}} UTF-EBCDIC encoded {{version of a}} series of Unicode code points, an {{encoding}} based on UTF-8 (known in the specification as UTF-8-Mod) is applied first. The main difference between this encoding and UTF-8 is that it allows Unicode code points U+0080 through U+009F (the C1 control codes) to be represented as a single byte and therefore later mapped to corresponding <b>EBCDIC</b> control <b>codes.</b> In order to achieve this, UTF-8-Mod uses 101XXXXX instead of 10XXXXXX as the format for trailing bytes in a multi-byte sequence. As this can only hold 5 bits rather than 6, the UTF-8-Mod encoding of codepoints above U+009F is generally larger than the UTF-8 encoding.|$|R

5000|$|Some {{character}} sets provide a separate newline character <b>code.</b> <b>EBCDIC,</b> for example, provides an NL character code {{in addition to}} the CR and LF codes. Unicode, in addition to providing the ASCII CR and LF control codes, also provides a [...] "next line" [...] (NEL) control code, as well as control codes for [...] "line separator" [...] and [...] "paragraph separator" [...] markers.|$|R
5000|$|This {{may seem}} overly {{complicated}} {{compared to an}} approach such as converting all line terminators to a single character, for example [...] However, Unicode was designed to preserve all information when converting a text file from any existing encoding to Unicode and back. Therefore, Unicode should contain characters included in existing encodings. [...] is included in <b>EBCDIC</b> with <b>code</b> (0x15). [...] is also a control character in the C1 control set. As such, it is defined by ECMA 48, and recognized by encodings compliant with ISO-2022 (which is equivalent to ECMA 35). C1 control set is also compatible with ISO-8859-1. The approach taken in the Unicode standard allows round-trip transformation to be information-preserving while still enabling applications to recognize all possible types of line terminators.|$|R
50|$|In the OSI model: the {{presentation}} layer ensures {{the information that}} the application layer of one system sends out is readable by the application layer of another system. For example, a PC program communicates with another computer, one using extended binary coded decimal interchange <b>code</b> (<b>EBCDIC)</b> and the other using ASCII to represent the same characters. If necessary, {{the presentation}} layer {{might be able to}} translate between multiple data formats by using a common format.|$|R

5000|$|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange <b>Code</b> (<b>EBCDIC)</b> is an eight-bit {{character}} encoding used {{mainly on}} IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. EBCDIC {{descended from the}} code used with punched cards and the corresponding six bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. [...] It is also supported on various non-IBM platforms such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP.|$|R
50|$|In December 1966 SDS shipped the {{entirely new}} Sigma series, {{starting}} with the 16-bit Sigma 2 and the 32-bit Sigma 7, both using common hardware internally. The success of the IBM System/360 {{and the rise of}} the 7-bit ASCII character standard was pushing all vendors to the 8-bit standard from their earlier 6-bit ones. SDS was one of the first companies to offer a machine intended as an alternative to the IBM System/360; although not compatible with the 360, it used similar data formats, the <b>EBCDIC</b> character <b>code,</b> and in other ways, such as its use of multiple registers rather than an accumulator, it was designed to have specifications that were comparable to those of the 360. Various versions of the Sigma 7 followed, including the cut-down Sigma 5 and re-designed Sigma 6. The Xerox Sigma 9 was a major re-design with instruction lookahead and other advanced features, while the Sigma 8 and Sigma 9 mod 3 were low-end machines offered as a migration path for the Sigma 5. Meanwhile, the French national champion CII, as licensee of SDS, sold about 60 Sigma 7 machines in Europe, and developed an upgrade with virtual memory and biprocessor capability, the Iris 80. CII also manufactured and sold some 160 Sigma 2 systems.The Sigma range was very successful in the niche real-time processing field, due to the sophisticated hardware interrupt structure and independent I/O processor. The first node of ARPANET was established by Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA with an SDS Sigma 7 system.|$|R
50|$|Early {{computers}} used {{a variety}} of four-bit binary coded decimal (BCD) representations and the six-bit codes for printable graphic patterns common in the U.S. Army (FIELDATA) and Navy. These representations included alphanumeric characters and special graphical symbols. These sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding, called the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) as the Federal Information Processing Standard, which replaced the incompatible teleprinter codes in use by different branches of the U.S. government and universities during the 1960s. ASCII included the distinction of upper- and lowercase alphabets and a set of control characters to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions, such as page advance and line feed, and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media. During the early 1960s, while also active in ASCII standardization, IBM simultaneously introduced in its product line of System/360 the eight-bit Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange <b>Code</b> (<b>EBCDIC),</b> an expansion of their six-bit binary-coded decimal (BCDIC) representation used in earlier card punches.The prominence of the System/360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight-bit storage size, while in detail the EBCDIC and ASCII encoding schemes are different.|$|R
