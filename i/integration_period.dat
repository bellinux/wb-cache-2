40|$|General {{experience}} in hydrologic modelling {{suggests that the}} parameterisation of a model changes over different time and space scales. As a result, hydrologists often re-parameterise their models whenever different temporal or spatial resolutions are required. Here, we investigate theoretical aspects of this issue {{in a search for}} the cause(s) of the need for re-parameterisations. Based on Taylor series expansion, we present a mathematical approach for temporal up-scaling that involves covariance-based corrections. We apply the theory using a unique database of half-hourly pan evaporation measurements (comprising 237 days) and examine how the model parameters change when integrating from half-hour to daily and then monthly <b>integration</b> <b>periods.</b> We show that the model parameters change over different <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> because of changes in the covariance between the model variables. In our model system, we find that the covariance-based correction is highly variable from day to day but settles down to a reasonably constant value over periods longer than about 15 days. The 15 days timescale is likely to be specific to our model system, nonetheless the underlying principle that there is a characteristic timescale for the covariance-based scaling correction of a particular hydrologic process might be general. If that proved true it would open up the possibility of systematically searching for characteristic <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> for the key covariance-based scaling terms in other key hydrologic processes.

40|$|GNSS signals {{have been}} {{proposed}} as emitters of opportunity to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by tracking small items of space debris using bistatic radar. Although the scattered GNSS signal levels from small items of space debris are incredibly low, the dynamic disturbances of the observed object are very small, and the phase of the scattered signals is well behaved. It is therefore plausible that coherent <b>integration</b> <b>periods</b> {{on the order of}} many minutes could be achieved. However, even with long <b>integration</b> <b>periods,</b> very large receiver arrays with extensive, but probably viable, processing are required to recover the scattered signal. Such large arrays will be expensive, and smaller more affordable arrays will collect insufficient signal power to detect the small objects (relative to wavelength) that are necessary to maintain the necessary phase coherency. The investments necessary to build a large receiver array are unlikely without substantial risk reduction. Pini and Akos have previously reported on use of very large radio telescopes to analyse the short-term modulation performance of GNSS satellite signals. In this work we report on tracking of GPS satellites with a radio-astronomy VLBI antenna system to assess the stability of the observed GPS signal over a time period indicative of that proposed for passive radar. We also confirm some of the processing techniques that may be used in both demonstrations and the final system. We conclude from the limited data set that the signal stability when observed by a high-gain tracking antenna and compared against a high quality, low phase-noise clock is excellent, as expected. We conclude by framing further works to reduce risk for a passive radar SSA capability using GNSS signals...|$|R
