5|$|Unlike <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA,</b> RNA is a {{single-stranded}} molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{understanding}} genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{was shown to}} be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish {{a model of the}} <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.|$|E
30|$|The {{penetration}} of the cavities of the dendrimers and the flexibility of an asODN are different phenomena from those revealed from the interaction between dendrimers and <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> in previous articles [25]. In the latter, <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> is a more rigid structure and does not fold into the cavities of the dendrimer.|$|R

Following helicase treatment, the single-strand DNA is visually detected as {{separate from the}} <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis.

40|$|Gene {{targeting}} is {{a powerful}} genome engineering tool {{that can be used}} for a variety of biotechnological applications. Genomic <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks generated by engineered site-specific nucleases can stimulate gene targeting. Hybrid nucleases are composed of DNA binding module and DNA cleavage module. Zinc Finger Nucleases were used to generate <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks but it suffers from failures and lack of reproducibility. The transcription activator–like effectors (TALEs) from plant pathogenic Xanthomonas contain a unique type of DNA-binding domain that bind specific DNA targets. The purpose of this study is to generate novel sequence specific nucleases by fusing a de novo engineered Hax 3 TALE-based DNA binding domain to a FokI cleavage domain. Our data show that the de novo engineered TALE nuclease can bind to its target sequence and create <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks in vitro. We also show that the de novo engineered TALE nuclease is capable of generating <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks in its target sequence in vivo, when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that TALE-based hybrid nucleases can be tailored to bind a user-selected DNA sequence and generate site-specific genomic <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> breaks. TALE-based hybrid nucleases hold much promise as powerful molecular tools for gene targeting applications...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At {{the very end of}} the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the nucleus}} {{is the site}} of transcription, it also {{contains}} a variety of proteins that either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases, which unwind the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases, which change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{identification}} and functional analysis of nine genes from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and their phages {{that are similar to}} lambda (λ) bet or Escherichia coli recT. Beta and RecT are single-strand DNA annealing proteins, referred to here as recombinases. Each of the nine other genes when expressed in E. coli carries out oligonucleotide-mediated recombination. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing single-strand recombinase activity from diverse bacteria. Similar to bet and recT, most of these other recombinases were found to be associated with putative exonuclease genes. Beta and RecT in conjunction with their cognate exonucleases carry out recombination of linear <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA.</b> Among four of these foreign recombinase/exonuclease pairs tested for recombination with <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA,</b> three had activity, albeit barely detectable. Thus, although these recombinases can function in E. coli to catalyze oligonucleotide recombination, the <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> recombination activities with their exonuclease partners were inefficient. This study also demonstrated that Gam, by inhibiting host RecBCD nuclease activity, helps to improve the efficiency of λ Red-mediated recombination with linear <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA,</b> but Gam is not absolutely essential. Thus, in other bacterial species where Gam analogs have not been identified, <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> recombination may still work {{in the absence of a}} Gam-like function. We anticipate that at least some of the recombineering systems studied here will potentiate oligonucleotide and double-strand DNA-mediated recombineering in their native or related bacteria...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{semantic}} model based on DNA computing. In the model the vertexes denote either a {{name of the}} target or both the attributes and attribute values. One path from an initial vertex to a terminal vertex means one object named on the tag. We name this model a semantic model based on DNA computing. The model explains a target object is reasoned out by the combinations between the vertexes. We describe its application to reasoning system by using DNA computing algorithm from theoretical point of a view. Vertexes and edges of the model are encoded to four kinds of nucleotides. The model is represented by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Single-stranded DNAs are hybridized and ligated to let them the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNAs,</b> with the complementary sequences of input molecules and knowledge based ones. The generated DNAs are analyzed into necessary strands which are <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNAs</b> representing the target objects. We discuss the proposed model and application with a simulation of computational complexity...|$|R
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA.</b> The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E

An amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1 – 275) of NS 1 [GST-NS 1 (1 – 275) ], representing 41 % of the full-length NS 1 molecule, includes a domain that binds <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> in a sequence-specific manner at levels comparable to full-length GST-NS 1, as well as single-strand DNA and RNA in a sequence-independent manner. The deletion of 15 additional amino-terminal amino acids yielded a molecule [GST-NS 1 (1 – 275) ] that maintained (ACCA) 2 – 3 -specific <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> binding; however, this molecule was more sensitive to increasing ionic conditions than full-length GST-NS 1 and GST-NS 1 (1 – 275) and could not be demonstrated to bind single-strand nucleic acids. A quantitative filter binding assay showed thatE. coli- and baculovirus-expressed GST-NS 1 andE. coliGST-NS 1 (1 – 275) specifically bound <b>double-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> with similar equilibrium kinetics [as measured by their apparent equilibrium DNA binding constants (KD) ], whereas GST-NS 1 (16 – 275) bound 4 - to 8 -fold less well...|$|R

5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} viral DNA polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially <b>double-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
