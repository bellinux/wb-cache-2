2500|$|The {{founders of}} the first {{institutions}} of higher education in the United States were graduates of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities – they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to – small communities, <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these [...] "colleges" [...] assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority—for example, The College of William & Mary has a Royal Charter from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while Dartmouth College has a charter permitting it to award degrees [...] "as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, in {{this context}} a form of more regular [...] "re-recruitment" [...] should be {{mentioned}} that in practice had some quantitative importance: the ransoming of prisoners of war. Though in the first stages of the Eighty Years' War both parties had mercilessly executed prisoners of war (a practice that continued {{for a long time}} in the war on sea), this practice was soon recognized as a waste of money, as prisoners were often ready and able to offer large sums of money to regain their freedom. The practice of ransoming had long been customary in medieval wars and there was no reason to forgo its pecuniary advantages in this conflict. Informal ransoming was soon formalized in a so-called Cartel between the high commands of the two belligerents, first in 1599, and more definitely in 1602. This cartel was a formal treaty that enumerated the rates of exchange for different grades of prisoners and other conditions of treatment (and compensation for <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding).</b> The advantage for the commanders of both armies was that the losses due to the taking of prisoners could be replenished relatively cheaply and speedily. The cartel with Spain remained in force for the remainder of the war. Similar cartels were concluded in later wars.|$|E
50|$|The <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> {{of cattle}} and farm animals through the coldest months was {{introduced}} by the German, Swiss and Dutch farmers. This was not typically practices in England, Ireland and Scotland.|$|E

50|$|The post-war {{period was}} {{characterized}} by the extreme difficulties arising from the need of <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> the occupation forces {{as well as the}} refugees, while simultaneously state and private property was carried to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5000|$|One other {{description}} of the Islander accommodation was that is consisted of a [...] "circular structure" [...] located close to the river bank. By 1925 this structure was used by share farmers for <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> young calves.|$|E
50|$|Census records {{point to}} Samuel Schenck {{utilizing}} traditional farming technologies that were brought {{over by the}} German and Swiss settlers. These include; Crop rotation, co-planting, <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> cattle and animals in cold winter months, barns with stalls, large wagons for transporting hay, and the growing of hay.|$|E

50|$|The Blockley Almshouse had {{its roots}} in the Philadelphia Almshouse, a {{facility}} first located in the block between Third, Fourth, Spruce and Pine Streets. Constructed in 1731-32, this institution provided the first government-sponsored care of the poor in America, as it offered an infirmary and hospital for the sick and insane, besides <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> the impoverished.|$|E
50|$|With {{the mass}} {{mobilisation}} of New Zealand Forces McCristell was appointed as the Camp Quartermaster for Trentham Camp, {{where he was}} responsible for the <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> of several thousand new recruits.

5000|$|Improvements {{were not}} only applied to the road, but to ordinaries and inns along the turnpike as well. In Botetourt County, an account along the route states: [...] "The Fincastle-Blue Ridge Turnpike was {{completed}} in 1835, connecting to the Lynchburg-Salem Turnpike over the mountain through Black Horse Gap. Joseph and Polly operated the White Horse Stagecoach Inn on their farm, <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> many Turnpike travelers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Travelers Rest Travelers Rest {{is located}} on U.S Route 50 West of Burlington in Mineral County, West Virginia. It was built for the Wagon Trains going west.

Better known today as the [...] "Stone House" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{monument}} {{was destroyed}} by the overflow of the river Nam Khan. It was replaced in 1887 by a more durable crypt monument, and a maisonnette was built nearby to <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> visitors to the white shrine. Some restoration work was done on the tomb in 1951 by the EFEO (Ecole Française d'Extrème Orient—The French School of the Far East).|$|R
50|$|Populations of Edith's checkerspots use several {{different}} hosts to <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> their pupae. Though {{they usually do}} not pollinate the flowers of the host, larvae {{have been known to}} eat the leaves, the flowers, and sometimes the entire host plant, and have starved trying to find another. Adult females <b>and</b> females <b>feed</b> on flower nectar. Caterpillars <b>feed</b> on leaves <b>and</b> flowers of the host plant and sometimes surrounding plants.|$|R
50|$|As a daily {{stop for}} two stagecoach lines, {{as well as}} many other travelers, Cove Fort was heavily used for many years, often <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> up to 75 people at a time. In {{addition}} to providing a place to rest, a blacksmith/farrier resided at the fort, who shod horses and oxen, and also repaired wagon wheels. With its telegraph office and as a Pony Express stop, it also acted as a regional communications hub.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{non-native}} settlers {{since the}} Gold Rush occupied lands at the Portage {{in the early}} 1900s, which provoked the Declaration of the Lillooet Tribe (May 10, 1911) protesting the land alienations at [...] "the Short Portage". Further settlement came with {{the building of the}} Pacific Great Eastern Railway, which was open through the Lakes by 1914 and which required the <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> of hundreds of men, and with that the beginnings of the Bridge River Power Project.|$|E
50|$|Based on census records, Samuel likely planted potatoes, “Indian Corn” and oats in {{the spring}} and Winter Wheat and Winter Barley in the fall. He is not {{recorded}} as producing clover, but instead was producing 10-18 tons of hay plus seed. The production of hay, combined with the a surviving 1927 blueprint of a barn as large or larger than the house, eludes to Schenck both <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> his cattle and horses through the winter months rather than penning or sending them into the woods or field in the coldest months.|$|E
50|$|By {{the year}} 4001, {{industrialization}} in Japan {{had begun to}} consume {{every square inch of}} free space within the island nation's borders. To <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> its growing population, the country had built upon its own infrastructure centuries before, turning the whole of Japan into a towering pillar, hundreds of miles wide. Eventually, the nation detached from Earth entirely, and now orbits the planet.|$|R
5000|$|Like all cat-eyed snakes, it {{is a very}} {{voracious}} hunter, actively pursuing {{its prey}} that consists primarily of birds and their fledglings [...] They are usually found near chicken coops where they feed on eggs. They may sometimes enter <b>houses</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> on captive pet birds. Other prey may also be taken, given the opportunity. Frogs, lizards and small rodents may sometimes be eaten.|$|R
50|$|The Greek army {{evacuated}} {{not only}} Anatolia but also Eastern Thrace and {{the islands of}} Imbros and Tenedos (Treaty of Lausanne). A compulsory population exchange was agreed between the two countries, with over 1.5 million Christians and almost half a million Muslims being uprooted. This catastrophe {{marked the end of}} the Megali Idea, and left Greece financially exhausted, demoralised, <b>and</b> having to <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> a proportionately huge number of refugees.|$|R
50|$|The cannery {{was built}} in 1912 by the Sanborn Cutting Company. It was {{operated}} {{over the next several}} decades by Sunny Point Packing and the Alaska Pacific Salmon Packing Corporation, growing under the latter in the 1930s {{to become one of the}} largest fish packers in the region. During this time, the operators used generally race-based division of labor, assigning positions of responsibility to white men, and various lower-level menial tasks to immigrants from China, Japan, and elsewhere. Native Tlingit were employed to catch fish. Most of this labor was hired through contractor middlemen, who were responsible for <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> the workers.|$|E
50|$|In 1947, David and Sigrid Fleay {{travelled}} {{with three}} platypuses to New York's Bronx Zoo. The platypuses were accommodated {{in a new}} platypussary at the zoo, designed to Fleay's specifications. During the Fleay's stay in the United States, Fleay inspected the modern methods of <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> animals {{at a number of}} zoos including the New York Zoological Park, Staten Island Zoo, National Zoological Park in Washington and the Golden Gate Zoo in San Francisco. It is not known whether he brought back with him from the United States any ideas which he intended to implement in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The State Finance Department raised {{objections}} to a zoo in Odisha {{because of the}} cost of both establishing and maintaining the facility. While the issue was being debated, animals arrived back at Bhubaneswar in May 1960, posing problems to the forest department for <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> them. P. Mohandra (Divisional Forest Officer, Puri) and G. K. Das (Divisional Forest Officer, Deogarh) built temporary structures at Khandagiri for the animals, and the community of Jain helped feed them. Discussions about a real zoo started soon after Dr. H. K. Mahatab, then Chief Minister of Odisha, visited the animals.|$|E
50|$|The Benevolent Asylum may be {{likened to}} the English poorhouses which were {{established}} to <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> those {{members of the}} community who were unable to provide for themselves. Under 19th century legislation these poorhouses developed into the stricter regime of the workhouse. Conditions within these workhouses was generally appalling with inmates often being reduced to starvation levels, families separated and inmates forced to perform boring and demeaning work tasks.|$|R
50|$|There were {{no reports}} of {{societal}} abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, at times community members forced old women falsely accused of being witches to flee their villages. The Catholic Church funded-Delwende Center that <b>houses</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeds</b> women accused of witchcraft reported seven cases of this kind. The Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity, along with various other nongovernmental and religious organizations, also maintained similar shelters in Ouagadougou.|$|R
60|$|The {{inference}} {{seems to}} be that they would prefer that these derelicts should come on the rates or starve rather than that the Army should <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> them, giving them, in addition, such wage as their labour may be worth. Further comment {{seems to be}} needless, especially when I repeat that, as I am assured, this Hanbury Street Institution never has earned, and does not now earn, the cost of its upkeep.|$|R
5000|$|This first Quartering Act {{was given}} Royal Assent on May 15, 1765, and {{provided}} that Great Britain would house its soldiers in American barracks and public houses, {{as by the}} Mutiny Act of 1765, but if its soldiers outnumbered the housing available, would quarter them in [...] "inns, livery stables, ale houses, victualing houses, and the houses of sellers of wine and houses of persons selling of rum, brandy, strong water, cider or metheglin", and if numbers required in [...] "uninhabited houses, outhouses, barns, or other buildings." [...] Colonial authorities were required to pay the cost of <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> these troops.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recovery}} of Waveland {{was due in}} part to the faith-based disaster recovery effort in and around the Waveland area. Shoreline Park Baptist Church in Waveland and Pastor Ed Murphy were vital to this effort, <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> hundreds of missionaries from around the country for many years following Hurricane Katrina in what were referred to as [...] "Pods for God". Shoreline Park Baptist Church directed the repair and, in some instances, the rebuilding of homes in the area for many years after the devastation. Murphy retired from Shoreline Park Baptist Church in 2014 and died in Rock Hill South Carolina on April 27, 2015.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{location}} on the German-Austrian border, and in the south-east of the country, Passau {{has become a major}} migrant entry point into Germany. Refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa who have reached Europe, often entering either overland via Greece or across the sea via the Mediterranean (see Operation Triton), then head north and sometimes enter Germany. In 2015 the BBC reported that traffickers drive migrants and refugees through Austria and leave them {{on the side of the}} autobahn. The migrants and refugees then often walk unaccompanied into Passau, the first German town northwards. This situation has caused the government of Passau to divert funds from flood prevention to <b>housing</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> the refugees and migrants, around 10% of whom are unaccompanied children.|$|E
