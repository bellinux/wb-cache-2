25|$|Arendt’s {{analysis}} {{draws on}} the refugee upheavals {{in the first half}} of the 20th century along with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to legally recognize. The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This was primarily due to resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities. Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum were capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.|$|E

500|$|Many {{of those}} {{familiar}} with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her [...] "a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist". Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant, but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris. It is a commonplace of criticism that <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's. By focusing on misery and describing its cause as [...] "ceaseless persecution" [...] by [...] "the so-called just and righteous", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.|$|E

500|$|For many years, {{the museum}} sought {{to obtain a}} human penis. Sigurður was able to obtain human {{testicles}} and a foreskin from two separate donors; the foreskin was donated by Iceland's National Hospital after an emergency circumcision operation. The museum also contains sculptures of 15 penises based on the Iceland national handball team. As the team had won the silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the penises were made from a silvered material. Sigurður claims that although they are not displayed {{in the same order}} as the individuals shown in the photograph that accompany them, [...] "their wives would recognise them." [...] According to Slate, these sculptures were created by Sigurður's daughter, Þorgerður Sigurðardóttir, and were based on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> rather than any knowledge of the team.

500|$|In 2002, Fey was {{the head}} writer and a {{performer}} on the television show Saturday Night Live (SNL). She pitched the show that became 30 Rock to NBC, originally as a sitcom about cable news. NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly felt that [...] "Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> and [...] encouraged her to write what she knew." [...] The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an SNL-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005–2006 television season. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from SNL {{would result in a}} severe cut to the show's ratings.|$|E
500|$|In late July 1843 Balzac {{visited her}} in St. Petersburg, {{the first time}} they had seen one another in eight years. He was struck by Hańska's {{resilient}} beauty, but his condition had deteriorated over the years. Biographers agree that she was much less physically attracted to him at this time. Still they renewed their vows of love and planned to marry as soon as she won her lawsuit. In early October he returned to Paris. Soon afterwards, she wrote a story based on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> writing to Balzac for the first time. Unhappy with it, she threw it into the fire, but the French author begged her to rewrite it so he could adapt it. He assured her that she would [...] "know something of the joys of authorship when you see how much of your elegant and delightful writing I have preserved". Her story became Modeste Mignon, Balzac's 1844 novel about a young woman who writes to her favorite poet.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Streep played chef Julia Child in Nora Ephron's Julie & Julia, co-starring with Stanley Tucci {{and again}} with Amy Adams. (Tucci and Streep had worked {{together}} earlier in Devil Wears Prada.) The first major motion picture {{based on a}} blog, Julie and Julia contrasts the life of Child {{in the early years}} of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking. Longworth believes her caricature of Julia Child was [...] "quite possibly the biggest performance of her career while also drawing on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> to bring lived-in truth to the story of a late bloomer". In Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy It's Complicated (also 2009), Streep starred with Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. She received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for both Julie & Julia and It's Complicated; she won the award for Julie & Julia and later received her 16th Oscar nomination for it. She also lent her voice to Mrs. Felicity Fox in the stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox.|$|E
500|$|Koechlin {{made her}} debut as a screenwriter with Anurag Kashyap's 2011 thriller That Girl in Yellow Boots. She said that Kashyap {{asked her to}} write the script for the film as {{he was looking for}} a woman's {{perspective}} for the story. Co-starring with Naseeruddin Shah, Koechlin played a British woman name Ruth, who travels to Mumbai in search of her biological father. The role was partially based on <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> as a 'white-girl' in India. Shot in a short duration of thirteen days, the film was screened at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and the 67th Venice International Film Festival, among other venues. It opened to critical acclaim, with Koechlin being widely praised for her performance. Giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, Roger Ebert wrote that Koechlin [...] "creates a memorable woman who is sad and old beyond her years". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com described Koechlin as [...] "unrestrained and uncorrupted". NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee also lauded the film and deemed her performance as [...] "absolute perfection". Koechlin's final release of the year was the Sanjay Leela Bhansali-produced comedy My Friend Pinto. She played the role of an aspiring dancer in the film.|$|E
500|$|Tina Fey, {{the head}} writer and a {{performer}} on NBC's Saturday Night Live, pitched a pilot episode for a situation {{comedy about a}} cable news network to NBC in 2002. NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly, felt that [...] "Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> and [...] encouraged her to write what she knew." [...] The pilot, and subsequent series, was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series. Fey {{signed a contract with}} NBC in May 2003, which allowed her to remain in her SNL head writer position until at least the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was required to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video, Lorne Michaels' production company, and NBC Universal. During the 2004–2005 pilot season, Fey began developing a pilot project under the working title Untitled Tina Fey Project. The pilot, which became 30 Rock, centered on the head writer of a variety show and how she managed her relationships with the show's volatile star and executive producer. During development, some characters were altered; a second star of the variety show was added and the executive producer role changed to network executive.|$|E

500|$|In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub {{singer and}} young mother in Valerio Zurlini's Girl with a Suitcase. As {{a result of}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>experience</b> of early motherhood, Cardinale {{naturally}} conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a [...] "real" [...] actress, nor was she (yet) {{one of the most}} celebrated Italian beauties. However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: [...] "Zurlini {{was one of those who}} really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He was really very fond of me." [...] Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in Girl with a Suitcase, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her [...] "charming best". Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a brothel owner opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini's La Viaccia. Both Girl with a Suitcase and La Viaccia were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines including Paris Match began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil's French comedy Les Lions sont lâchés, and Auguste in which she had a cameo role.|$|E
