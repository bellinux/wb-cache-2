40|$|Gallium (Ga) {{implantation}} induced self-atom mixing in crystalline and amorphous germanium (Ge) is investigated utilizing isotopically controlled Ge multilayer structures {{grown by}} molecular beam epitaxy. The {{distribution of the}} Ga ions and the ion-beam induced depth-dependent mixing of the <b>isotope</b> <b>structure</b> was determined by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry. Whereas the distribution of Ga in the crystalline and amorphous Ge is very similar and accurately reproduced by computer simulations based on binary collision approximation (BCA), the ion-beam induced self-atom mixing is found to depend strongly {{on the state of}} the Ge structure. The experiments reveal stronger self-atom mixing in crystalline than in amorphous Ge. Atomistic simulations based on BCA reproduce the experimental results only when unphysically low Ge displacement energies are assumed. Analysis of the self-atom mixing induced by silicon implantation confirms the low displacement energy deduced within the BCA approach. This demonstrates that thermal spike mixing contributes significantly to the overall mixing of the Ge isotope structures. The disparity observed in the ion-beam mixing efficiency of crystalline and amorphous Ge indicates different dominant mixing mechanisms. We propose that self-atom mixing in crystalline Ge is mainly controlled by radiation enhanced diffusion during the early stage of mixing before the crystalline structure turns amorphous, whereas in an already amorphous state self-atom mixing is mediated by cooperative diffusion events...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{magnetometry}} plays {{a critical}} role in low-energy precision measurements and numerous other applications. In particular, permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) searches impose strict requirements on magnetic field sensitivity of the underlying atomic or molecular species. Other magnetometer properties [...] such as chemical reactivity, dielectric strength, and interaction cross-sections with other species [...] also impose limitations on experimental conditions. Here, we explore a novel approach to optical magnetometry, using multiphoton transitions of diamagnetic atoms to detect Larmor precession of polarized nuclei. Resonant probes are possible at moderate ultraviolet wavelengths, and hyperfine structure couples spin precession to fluorescence transitions with negligible backgrounds; paramagnetic rotation due to intensity-dependent dispersion may also be detectable. Nuclear spins and nonlinear optical excitation introduce new degrees of freedom, and evade limitations arising from rapid electronic decoherence. This dissertation reports progress towards two-photon optical magnetometry using ytterbium, rubidium, and xenon. We characterize the influence of probe polarization and magnetic fields on fluorescence spectra, for one- and two-photon continuous-wave (cw) excitation of ytterbium. Resolved hyperfine and <b>isotope</b> <b>structure</b> allow us to use spin-zero isotopes for diagnostics and normalization, and we develop analysis for overlapping two-photon resonances. We also report measurements of two-photon excitation in ytterbium and rubidium using picosecond laser pulses, and in xenon using a cw laser. Although hyperfine structure is unresolved, the rubidium measurements are sensitive to probe field polarization. Fluorescence spectra from two-photon excitation of ytterbium with femtosecond pulses show modulation when the repetition rate changes. Although techniques for polarizing noble gas nuclei are mature, existing cell designs are incompatible with two-photon magnetometry. We describe development of silicate-assisted hydroxide-catalysis bonding for both aluminosilicate EDM cells with silicon electrodes, and sapphire-windowed cells that transmit ultraviolet excitation light. Progress in measuring the 129 Xe nuclear EDM is discussed. Absolute referencing of the picosecond laser to potassium transitions is proposed for two-photon spectroscopy of ytterbium and xenon, and a compatible frequency-tripling method is outlined to produce excitation light for xenon. Novel possibilities including spatial resolution and multiphoton optical pumping of nuclear spins are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} a {{quantitative}} evaluation of genetic components of Arctic zone is difficult and diverse. That is caused, first of all, by a weak hydrological and hydro-geological level of researches of territory. Streamflow definition is especially complicated for the small rivers of Arctic regions (which watershed area less than 100 км 2). Therefore in practice often resort to methods of numerical modelling in which frameworks definition of components of the rivers flow in the Arctic region is especially actual. In the work features of run-off generation of the small rivers of Arctic regions on {{an example of the}} rivers are considered: Groen (an island West Spitsbergen), Neglinka (Kareliya). Besides, their comparison with the river Tom' (a southeast part of West Siberian plain) is resulted. Research objective - to establish laws intra-annual and inter-seasonal (taking into account phases of a hydrological cycle) distributions of genetic components of flow of small Arctic zone rivers to an example of the rivers Groen and Neglinka and to compare them to river Tom' characteristics. Isotope tracers are useful tools for better understanding hydrological processes. The use of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes as tracers in hydrologic studies has expanded over the past five decades following the initial description of systematic variations in world precipitation, development of theory describing isotopic fractionation during evaporation, and testing and validation under arrange of field conditions and scales. The processes that impact the isotopic composition of precipitating water are phase changes and mixing in the various storage watersheds. The most conventional application of stable isotopes in smaller catchments is the identification of “old-water” and “new-water”, in other words distinguishing surface runoff (that rapidly reached the river stream) from base-flow (that was in contact with the groundwater for extended periods) [6, 7, 8]. Variations in the relative abundances of these isotopes, measured as 18 O/ 16 O and 2 H/ 1 H ratios and expressed conventionally as 18 O and 2 H values often provide characteristic labeling of tremendous value in studies ranging from tracing of the origin and distillation history of atmospheric moisture parcels to the analysis of runoff generation. In work materials of field and laboratory researches of genetic components of the Arctic rivers are presented. The information received in works of expedition Svalbard- 2008 AARI is key and also approbations of natural waters in territory of Kareliya and a river Neglinka reservoir during the period February-March, 2009. This information has been added by approbation of natural waters in territory of Tomsk region, and also the data of researches of previous years. 86 samples of natural waters were analyzed on stable isotopes of water δ 2 Н and δ 18 О content as the parameters reflecting a condition and properties of waters of a various origin. For surface water following laws are marked: – The small rivers of the Arctic zone have the same as the river Tom' main component during the year - an atmospheric precipitation (snow); – The isotope data confirms, in the end of winter low-flow period, after an exhaustion of a stock of ground waters {{and in the absence of}} thaw, the feeding of the small rivers is almost completely provided at the expense of underground waters; - A natural feeding and completion of stocks of underground waters occurs mainly for the account infiltration thawing winter deposits in a spring high water period to what the <b>isotope</b> <b>structure</b> of underground waters which are facilitated concerning mid-annual deposits (are shifted lengthways LMWL downwards) testifies...|$|E
