40|$|Spiroplasma citri is a {{bacterial}} pathogen {{responsible for the}} economically important citrus stubborn disease. Sesame and citrus seeds serve as hosts for both S. citri and its leafhopper vector Circulifer haematoceps. To evaluate whether sesame could act as a reservoir for citrus-infecting strains or not, the genetic diversity among S. citri strains found in leafhoppers collected in citrus and citrus-free sesame fields was investigated. Among 26 periwinkle plants exposed to the collected C. haematoceps leafhoppers, 12 plants developed typical stubborn symptoms. All symptomatic periwinkles were polymerase chain reaction positive using S. citri-specific primer pairs targeting the spiralin and P 89 genes. Phylogenetic trees based on spiralin gene sequence analysis indicated that the novel field-collected strains clustered with those belonging to two <b>formerly</b> defined <b>S.</b> citri <b>groups</b> (groups 6 and 1). In addition, our results strongly suggest that group 1 strains could be transmitted from sesame-infected plants to citrus trees by C. haematoceps, while group 6 strains may not infect citrus trees...|$|R

40|$|The species Streptococcus macedonicus is {{associated}} with the food environment, especially with fermented dairy products. Here we present the complete 2. 1 -Mb genome sequence of strain ACA-DC 198, which was isolated from naturally fermented Greek kasseri cheese. Streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species,since its most frequent source of isolation to date is fermented foods, mainly of dairy origin (5). Within the genus Streptococcus, only Streptococcus thermophilus is considered nonpathogenic, due to its adaptation to the milk environment (3, 8). Even though S. macedonicus has been shown to possess important (bio) techno-logical features similar to those of S. thermophilus (5), it belongs to the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex (13).
