5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E
25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided {{he had had}} enough of London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio at the top of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He {{was at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her. She died a few months later.|$|E
25|$|The 12th Earl kept a tight {{grip on the}} county's representation. The {{capable and}} {{reliable}} Burley was returned five more times: in 1401, twice in 1404, in 1410, and for a final time in 1411. In 1401 he was paired with the aged Sir Hugh Cheyne, who was of the Mortimer affinity and custodian of Ludlow Castle during the minority of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. In 1404 he was accompanied first by the heavily indebted George Hawkstone but to the second parliament {{of the year by}} John Darras, another member of the Arundel affinity, who had been an active and violent participant in the Corbet family's feuds. In 1410 he was again MP alongside an Arundel ally: the lawyer David Holbache who was to represent the county no less than seven times. Finally, in 1411, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> Sir Adam Peshale, a slippery and quarrelsome character who represented Shropshire four times and the neighbouring county of Staffordshire as often.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's keenness {{to record}} his new {{material}} for Freewheelin paralleled a dramatic power {{struggle in the}} studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have John Hammond replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS. According to Dylan biographer Howard Sounes, [...] "The two men {{could not have been}} more different. Hammond was a WASP, so relaxed during recording sessions that <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> feet up, reading The New Yorker. Grossman was a Jewish businessman with a shady past, hustling to become a millionaire." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter {{said that}} while [...] "Colony" [...] was a [...] "crystallization of the series' mythology", it [...] "came about inadvertently", {{following}} David Duchovny's suggestion to face an alien bounty hunter. Thus <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the actor and decided to also add Mulder's disappeared sister. The alien weapon, described by {{the cast and crew}} as [...] "the ice pick", was done with an air hose that ran through Brian Thompson's arm. To create a unique and otherworldly sound made by the weapon used by the hunter, several sound effects were considered before co-producer Paul Rabwin voiced the noise himself on a microphone.|$|E
500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' car and drove to Albuquerque where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> still, <b>with</b> his sneering smile, {{conscious}} that Irene was sitting still, and smiling too.|$|R

60|$|A {{light that}} was almost tragic shone in the man's face. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>with</b> a sudden access of strength.|$|R
500|$|On 28 December 1879, {{the central}} {{section of the}} North British Railway's bridge across the River Tay near Dundee {{collapsed}} in the Tay Bridge disaster as an express train crossed it in a heavy storm. All 75 passengers and crew on the train were killed. As the newly elected President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Barlow was appointed {{as a member of}} the Board of Trade's Court of Inquiry into the disaster. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> Henry Cadogan Rothery and William Yolland, co-authoring one of the final reports with Yolland recommending a commission be established to examine wind loads on bridges. In its report dated 30 June 1880, the Court of Inquiry concluded that the bridge, designed by Sir Thomas Bouch and opened only the year before its collapse, had been [...] "badly designed, badly built and badly maintained". The entire central box truss section of the bridge known as the [...] "High Girders" [...] collapsed along with the thirteen trestles supporting it, leaving a gap of nearly half-a-mile in the [...] bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{labelled}} a Tory by {{the opposition}} and by subsequent historians, Eldon placed himself long-term in the Whig tradition, and defending [...] "a doctrine essentially similar to that which ministerial Whigs had held {{since the days of}} Burnet, Wake, Gibson and Potter". As an Ultra-Tory, protesting against Catholic Emancipation, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the Whigs during the 1830 parliamentary session and in 1825, following the defeat of the Tory Sir Francis Burdett's Emancipation Bill in the House of Lords by a majority of 48, drank [...] "the 48, the year 1688, and the glorious and immortal memory of William III".|$|E
2500|$|On {{his first}} day of trial, Whelan was noted as wearing an [...] "irreproachable" [...] black silk hat, black frock coat, white vest with narrow gold chain and back pants, and exhibiting a [...] "jaunty" [...] demeanor. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> folded arms, {{listening}} intently to the trial proceedings and eating apples. He was entranced by the flies walking on {{the ceiling of the}} courthouse, and laughed audibly when a constable lost his footing and slipped while trying to bring him out of the defendant's box. Agnes Macdonald wrote in her journal that he was a [...] "small, mean-looking" [...] man, who stroked his moustache nervously.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> chatting <b>with</b> her {{for some}} time. Presently Bertha was brought back by her partner to her mother's side.|$|R

2500|$|While {{he wrote}} [...] "Eureka", Yamaguchi became sick both {{physically}} and mentally, developing hives and becoming disillusioned {{with the idea of}} writing music for other entities. The song was inspired by Yamaguchi's feelings of becoming too accustomed to making songs for others. Yamaguchi's poor mental state affected the song while he was writing it. He wrote the song's lyrics over the course of one night in Adobe Illustrator, while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> the curtains shut in front of his computer in his apartment, but spent much of the time revising the song. The lyrics mention , a tea meant to detoxify the body according to Japanese folk medicine, because that was what he had been drinking during that night to aid himself.|$|E
2500|$|Doomadgee family spokesman, Brad Foster, {{claimed that}} after the men had been put into the cells, fifteen minutes lapsed before a seven-second check was done on the inmates. Forty two minutes later a second police officer {{observed}} that Mulrunji was a strange colour and was cold to the touch. The officer {{could not find a}} pulse. [...] When alerted to this, Arresting Officer Chris Hurley came into the cell and thought he could detect a pulse. According to statements an ambulance was then called taking fifteen minutes to arrive. [...] During this time no attempts were made to resuscitate the prisoner, although the autopsy found that {{there would have been no}} chance of saving him. The videotape footage from the cell shows Chris Hurley checking for breathing and pulse then [...] "sliding down the wall of the cell until <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> his face in his hands".|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May 1182, Saladin, {{along with}} half of the Egyptian Ayyubid army and {{numerous}} non-combatants, left Cairo for Syria. On the evening before he departed, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> his companions and the tutor of one of his sons quoted a line of poetry: [...] "enjoy the scent of the ox-eye plant of Najd, for after this evening it will come no more." [...] Saladin took this as an evil omen and he never saw Egypt again. Knowing that Crusader forces were massed upon the frontier to intercept him, he took the desert route across the Sinai Peninsula to Ailah {{at the head of the}} Gulf of Aqaba. Meeting no opposition, Saladin ravaged the countryside of Montreal, whilst Baldwin's forces watched on, refusing to intervene. He arrived in Damascus in June to learn that Farrukh-Shah had attacked the Galilee, sacking Daburiyya and capturing Habis Jaldek, a fortress of great importance to the Crusaders. In July, Saladin dispatched Farrukh-Shah to attack Kawkab al-Hawa. Later, in August, the Ayyubids launched a naval and ground assault to capture Beirut; Saladin led his army in the Bekaa Valley. The assault was leaning towards failure and Saladin abandoned the operation to focus on issues in Mesopotamia.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> forward <b>with</b> {{his elbows}} on his knees, tapping {{the back of his}} hand with one finger, in {{monotonous}} two-pulse like heart-beats.|$|R
60|$|Edward fell--that is, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> still; <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> a {{conscience}} {{which was not}} satisfied, but which was overpowered by circumstances.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} he had {{staggered}} and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> staring <b>with</b> frightened eyes at his accuser.|$|R
60|$|Pigling Bland made no objection; <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{his eyes}} half shut, and watched her.|$|E
60|$|Stanley at last {{took the}} chair {{he had so}} long refused. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> his arms folded.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>with</b> that carved {{grin on his}} face, {{looking at}} the fire, as I looked at him.|$|E
60|$|When at last, {{with his}} grim face {{turned toward the}} window, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> silently <b>with</b> his {{clinched}} hands on his knees before him, Islington asked where his wife was now.|$|R
60|$|There <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> silent, <b>with</b> {{his hand}} to his head, still {{struggling}} to marshal his wandering thoughts, still trying to see light through the darkness that was closing round him.|$|R
60|$|Malcolm rose in his place. Silence {{fell on the}} company; {{everybody}} looked suddenly {{alert and}} expectant, except Robert. <b>He</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> bowed head, wrapped in his own bitterness.|$|R
60|$|And {{then for}} two weeks <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> Mother {{in the sun and}} watched the motors go by.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>with</b> {{his hands}} in his pockets and his legs {{stretched}} out before him, looking at the fire.|$|E
60|$|Phrases and {{paragraphs}} {{began to}} shape themselves {{in his mind}} as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> one arm on his steering-wheel.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've had rough handling," [...] he said, and gasped. [...] "It's too fresh--too hot. I don't want to {{talk about}} it." [...] <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> an {{unavoidable}} air of sullenness.|$|R
