2500|$|In {{addition}} to Raynal's influence, Toussaint Louverture {{was a key}} <b>Enlightened</b> actor in the Haitian Revolution. <b>Enlightened</b> thought divided the world into [...] "enlightened leaders" [...] and [...] "ignorant masses"; Louverture attempted to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the <b>enlightened</b> few. Louverture was familiar with Enlightenment ideas {{within the context of}} European imperialism. He attempted {{to strike a balance between}} Western <b>Enlightened</b> thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint Domingue. As an extension of himself and his <b>Enlightened</b> education, Louverture wrote a Constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in <b>Enlightened</b> society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, Louverture exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language and accent of this text.|$|R

5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't <b>enlighten</b> the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off and it becomes the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and <b>enlighten</b> the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
