25|$|The 'doctrine of reserve' in the dialogues. There are {{numerous}} passages in the dialogues {{in which an}} especially important theme is introduced but then not further discussed. In many cases, the conversation breaks off <b>just</b> <b>where</b> it approaches {{the crux of the}} issue. These often concern questions which are of fundamental significance for philosophy. The defenders of the Tübingen School interpret these instances of 'reserve' as pointers to the content of the unwritten doctrines, which cannot be directly handled in written dialogues.|$|E

Provided that those objectives are met, what people get up to is their affair. As such, the Bill provides a more liberal regime for developers. On the other hand, activities {{will have to be}} compatible with hard environmental standards and society will set those standards. Clause 4 sets out the biophysical bottom line. Clauses 5 and 6 set out further specific matters that expand on the issues. The Bill has a clear and rigorous procedure for the setting of environmental standards – and the debate will be concentrating on <b>just</b> <b>where</b> we set those standards.|$|E
25|$|With a force then {{of about}} twelve {{thousand}} men, Peter the Great and his army advanced to lay siege to the fortress of Nöteborg. Nöteborg {{had originally been}} built {{by the people of}} Novgorod four centuries earlier, under the name of Orekhovo or Oreshek, on a small island of the river Neva, <b>just</b> <b>where</b> it flows out from Lake Ladoga. However, {{it has been said that}} Torgils Knutsson was the first one to have fortified the island. The island itself was in the shape of a hazel-nut, hence both the Russian and Swedish names. It served for a long time as a barrier against the incursions of the Swedes and Danes, and protected the commerce of Novgorod as well as of Ladoga.|$|E
25|$|A raggedly-dressed {{and dirty}} old man {{came on board}} there who {{appeared}} to be somewhat superior to the fishermen who brought him. Rather disconcerted at not being offered a seat, he expressed a desire to leave. Once it was learned that he was the principal person in the village, he was invited down to a seat on the gun-deck, where he was closely questioned as to <b>just</b> <b>where</b> the ship was and the extent of government and defenses. Being informed the ship bore an envoy anxious to reach the capital, the old man cheerfully said the ship might return northward to it in three or four days. This remark was forgotten at the time, and ruefully recalled after the mission failed to receive an official invitation to Hue.|$|E

25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit <b>just</b> <b>where</b> Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} the most {{detailed}} study of Odysseus's travels {{was that of the}} French Homeric scholar Victor Bérard. Although adopting the general frame of reference of the ancient commentators, Bérard differed from them in some details. For Bérard the land of the Lotus-Eaters was Djerba off southern Tunisia; the land of the Cyclopes was at Posillipo in Italy; the island of Aeolus was Stromboli; the Laestrygonians were in northern Sardinia; Circe's home was Monte Circeo in Lazio; the entrance to the Underworld was near Cumae, <b>just</b> <b>where</b> Aeneas found it in the Aeneid; the Sirens were on the coast of Lucania; Scylla and Charybdis were at the Strait of Messina; the Island of the Sun was Sicily; the homeland of Calypso was at the Straits of Gibraltar. From there Odysseus's route took him to Scherie, which Bérard, like so many of his ancient predecessors, identified with Corcyra.|$|E
25|$|Delay might {{endanger the}} outcome of the entire campaign, because it was {{essential}} that the main body of Allied troops be engaged before Army Group A established bridgeheads. To overcome this difficulty, the Germans resorted to unconventional means in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael. In the early hours of 10 May, DFS 230 gliders landed on top of the fort and unloaded assault teams that disabled the main gun cupolas with hollow charges. The bridges over the canal were seized by German paratroopers. The Belgians launched considerable counterattacks which were broken up by the Luftwaffe. Shocked by a breach in its defences <b>just</b> <b>where</b> they had seemed the strongest, the Belgian Supreme Command withdrew its divisions to the KW-line five days earlier than planned. Similar operations against the bridges in the Netherlands, at Maastricht, failed. All were blown up by the Dutch and only one railway bridge was taken. This stalled the German armour on Dutch territory for a time.|$|E

He later admitted, [...] "I thought I had Grant <b>just</b> <b>where</b> I wanted him and could finish {{him up in}} the morning." [...] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.; Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.|$|E
500|$|As {{the battles}} over the Channel {{continued}}, Galland shot down Spitfires on 25 and 28 July. [...] On 1 August 1940, Galland {{was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (...) for his 17 victories. Galland continued to make fighter sweeps over southern England before the main assault opened. On 11 August, Galland's unit engaged 74 Squadron. In a brief dogfight, one Spitfire was shot down. During these battles the RAF seemed to know <b>just</b> <b>where</b> and when to send their aircraft. This made Galland suspect {{a high level of}} organisation was at work controlling RAF fighters. The cloudy skies of Britain were a dangerous environment to confront an enemy that had an effective ground control system. Galland resolved to fly higher, where he could see most things and where the Bf 109 performed at its best.|$|E

500|$|Not all of {{the poems}} have been well received. Watson {{believes}} that Fears in Solitude [...] "shows how precarious Coleridge's new achievement was. It is a shameless return to the older, effusive manner, evidently written in a white heat of patriotic indignation against the degradation of English public opinion during the French wars, {{and it is only}} by stretching charity that it can be considered a conversation poem at all." [...] Holmes simply claims Fears in Solitude as [...] "one of the most difficult of [...] Conversation Poems". In discussing The Nightingale, Ashton writes that, [...] "Bantering though this is, and, however, beautiful the final lines about Hartley are, 'The Nightingale' is as a whole a less successful poem than the other conversation poems. It has rather a blank at the centre, <b>just</b> <b>where</b> the others pivot on a significant controlling idea." ...|$|E

He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record [...] "There's a moment in your life where you start going out every night, and it's so fun, but then you start to lose yourself; you {{get lost in the}} sauce". The singer compared the song's sentiment to [...] "Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places", adding [...] "It's another confession". In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you [...] "losing yourself", which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, [...] "If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life." ...|$|E
500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is <b>just</b> <b>where</b> we're at right now with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E
