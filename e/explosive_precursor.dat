For the safety of the participants, only the <b>explosive</b> <b>precursors</b> ammonium nitrate (AN) and potassium chlorate (KClO 3) were used to contaminate fingers. Results indicate that while the amount of residue deposited with successive fingerprints tended to show a decrease, there was significant variability among trials. Some trials suggest that particles may occasionally be deposited in aggregates resulting in some amounts well above the expected trend. Typically, the initial print contained several hundred micrograms of AN or chlorate. The tenth print was significantly reduced but still contained tens to hundreds of nanograms. Of the three surfaces on which prints were made, the highest amounts of AN were recovered from filter paper, while higher amounts of KClO 3 were recovered from polypropylene. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Multiphoton laser wave-mixing {{spectroscopy}} {{is presented}} as a sensitive and specific optical detection technique for liquid and gas phase analytes. Compared to other detection methods, wave-mixing offers numerous advantages including small laser probes, high spatial resolution, excellent sensitivity, and specificity that allows for the identification of analytes. The signal generated is a coherent laser-like beam, thus it can be spatially and optically modulated to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The laser wave-mixing signal exhibits a quadratic dependence on analyte absorptivity, thus small changes in concentration result in large changes in signal intensity. Furthermore, laser wave-mixing has a cubic dependence on laser power, allowing for the use of low power laser systems. Laser wave-mixing is shown to be a sensitive detection technique that is adapted for detection beyond normal lab scale distances. The simple two-beam forward scattering arrangement is used to detect molecular bromine gas in a sealed 10 cm gas cell. Bromine is detected at distances from 0. 25 to 6 meters while maintaining sensitivity in the parts per billion range. This proof of concept work has applications in environmental and medical applications that require real time detection of gaseous analytes. The detection of explosives in the visible range is an important technique for forensic, defense, and security applications. This work shows that laser wave-mixing {{can be applied to the}} colorimetric detection of both trinitrotoluene and triacetone triperoxide.

The project started in 2011 and was finished in 2015. The EMPHASIS system is composed of several different networked sensors. Strategically positioned area sensors, monitoring the vapour phase as well as static sensors, positioned in the sewer, monitoring the sewage for traces of explosives were used. Information from all sensors is transferred to and assessed in a command centre. Air and water monitoring sensors allow the narrowing of the area to be searched. Mobile sensors are then used to pinpoint the exact location of the bomb factory. The consortium consisted of eight partners, research institutes (FOI, Fraunhofer ICT and IAF, TNO), industry (Morpho), SMEs (VIGO, Cascade) and an end user (Institut National de Police Scientifique). This paper presents final results concerning the detection performance of the sensors in the sewer system. <b>Explosives,</b> <b>precursors</b> to <b>explosives</b> and compounds from pyrotechnics can be disposed through the drain in the manufacturing of IEDs. Most of these compounds are present as ions when dissolved in (sewage) water leading to changes of the pH and the conductivity of the water.

An ISE is a sensor which converts the activity of a specific ion dissolved in a solution into an electrical potential which can be measured by a voltmeter or pH meter. In EMPHASIS we used a bunch of ISEs with different selectivities in order to facilitate the detection of a variety of compounds. This application was a new analytical challenge for these sensors. Related applications are known from research tasks such as tap water monitoring, analysis of contaminants of ground water and detection of sea mines by explosive traces.
