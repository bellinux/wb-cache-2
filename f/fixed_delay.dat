25|$|Tuberous organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and amplitude coders. There are multiple forms of tuberous organs in each time and amplitude coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time coder fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential is always the same) at a <b>fixed</b> <b>delay</b> time after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and amplitude but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. Amplitude coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD amplitude. While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have amplitude coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the amplitude of the EOD. Tuberous electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency. This particular tuned-in frequency is usually closely matched to their own EOD frequency.|$|E

As these metal traces have a <b>fixed</b> <b>delay</b> per unit length independent of memory technology, the shorter lengths of the Z-RAM signal traces can offset the faster SRAM cell access times.

50|$|In optics, {{temporal}} coherence {{is measured in}} an interferometer such as the Michelson interferometer or Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In these devices, a wave is combined {{with a copy of}} itself that is delayed by time Ï„. A detector measures the time-averaged intensity of the light exiting the interferometer. The resulting interference visibility (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the {{temporal coherence}} at delay Ï„. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a <b>fixed</b> <b>delay,</b> here 2Ï„c, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time t equal to Ï„c.

40|$|Many real {{systems in}} nature such as biological, {{technological}} and dynamical {{systems can be}} described by various models of complex dynamical networks. Collective dynamics of networks, especially synchronization phenomena has gained {{a lot of interest}} due to its application in biological and social sciences. Synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators can well explain the many natural phenomena like rhythmic activity of brain, synchronized flashing of fire flies, pace maker cells of heart etc. [1] Coupled maps have been proven to be a useful tool for understanding the collective behavior in coupled networks composed of mutually coupled nonlinear units. Network synchronizabity and its relation with network topology have received a great deal of attention.

50|$|Another {{important}} {{classification of}} dashpot timers are mercury-displacement timers. These {{depend on the}} displacement of a pool of mercury that make connection with two electrodes. There {{are two kinds of}} mercury displacement timers, delayed-make displacement timers and slow break displacement timers. Delayed-make displacement timers work by having a plunger floating in a container of mercury, when energy is applied to the coil it pulls the plunger into its center. The mercury that is displaced by this enters the thimble though an orifice. Inert gas trapped {{at the top of the}} thimble prevents the mercury from rising. Eventually the gas escapes through a ceramic plug, and this permits mercury to fill the thimble. When the mercury rises to a certain level it makes contact between electrodes. The amount of delay that this produces is determined when it is manufactured. Slow-break displacement timers work in the same way as delayed-make displacement timers only that when the coil is de-energized, the plunger rises to its original position, and mercury flows through the orifice to reach outside level. when it falls below the lip of the ceramic cup, electrical contacts become open. Its physical size is used to regulate the delay time of connection break. These timers are designed with a <b>fixed</b> <b>delay</b> period, usually to a maximum of 20 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|Simmons {{developed}} {{methods for}} conducting psychophysical studies of sonar processing by bats, and researchers {{around the world}} have adopted these methods to address a wide range of research questions. Simmons was the first to use electronically delayed playbacks of the bat's echolocation signals to simulate target echoes for the study of perception in bats. He used such [...] "phantom target echoes to measure, for the first time, target range difference discrimination thresholds of echolocating bats. Simmons studied sonar ranging performance in bats by determining the minimum difference in echo delay that an echolocating animal can discriminate. With this paradigm, Simmons estimated that bats can discriminate a range difference of approximately 1 centimeter, corresponding to an echo delay difference of approximately 60 microseconds.Simmons continued to study sonar ranging performance in echolocating bats, and in the late 1970s, he introduced a new behavioral task, requiring the bat to discriminate a sonar target returning echoes at a <b>fixed</b> <b>delay</b> from one returning echoes that alternated between two delays. In this experiment, Simmons found that the echolocating bat can discriminate a jitter in echo delay in the submicrosecond range, corresponding to a change in target distance of less than 0.1 mm. This result, originally published in 1979 in Science, [...] "Perception of echo phase information in bat sonar, demonstrated astonishing ranging accuracy by the echolocating bat. Many researchers in the field challenged the report, because they asserted it was not biologically possible for the bat's sonar system to discriminate such small time differences at ultrasonic frequencies. Simmons continues to work on this problem to explore biological processes that could support sensitivity to small changes in echo delay.|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} optimal timing {{strategy}} {{for the detection of}} hypervascular liver tumors during the arterial phase of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, a test examination after injection of 2 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine was performed in 47 patients. The time course of the tumor-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for all studies together was determined relative to the start of injection, the time of peak aortic enhancement, and the time of peak enhancement in the tumor. All studies were grouped together and the highest CNR was transiently observed at the time of peak tumor enhancement. This CNR was significantly higher than those observed at <b>fixed</b> <b>delays</b> after peak aortic enhancement. However, the CNRs at peak tumor enhancement+/- 1. 5 seconds did not differ significantly from those obtained after peak aortic enhancement. Finally, the CNRs obtained at <b>fixed</b> <b>delays</b> after the start of injection remained significantly lower. In hypervascular liver tumors, a higher CNR can be obtained during the arterial phase when the MR imaging delay is determined relative to the time of peak enhancement in the tumor or the aorta rather than being fixed after the start of contrast material injection.
