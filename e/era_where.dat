5|$|In the pre-Islamic {{period on}} the island of Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were {{considered}} very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. The medieval era Indonesian literature equates Buddha with Siwa (Shiva) and Janardana (Vishnu).

5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an <b>era</b> <b>where</b> centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|The ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions {{related to}} Shiva, {{such as those}} that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India, {{celebrate}} the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule <b>era),</b> <b>where</b> millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (Nagas) get the honor of starting the event by entering the sangam first for bathing and prayers.|$|E
5|$|During the 820s, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire had {{suffered}} two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: {{the beginning of}} the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the fall of Crete to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an <b>era</b> <b>where</b> Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of Crete, which became a haven for Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their—albeit partial—control of Sicily allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake Crete {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an <b>era</b> <b>where</b> political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|The central Vishnu {{head and}} side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be {{influenced}} by other configurations in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the cosmic waters at the beginning of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction - the three functions in the Hindu universe. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta <b>era,</b> <b>where</b> their cults were at their peak.|$|E
5|$|The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains {{the upper}} hand after {{trapping}} Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power. As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt {{for her role in}} the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern <b>era</b> <b>where</b> Lucca found her. It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen. She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.|$|E

50|$|The dating is {{somewhat}} ambiguous, jumping from multiple regions {{as well as}} <b>eras</b> <b>where</b> it {{is believed to have}} been conceived and housed but scholars have reason to believe its origin to be around 1300. The psalter was recorded by Holmes in 1789 to have been in the Dominican library of Santa Maria del Rosario in Venice, to where it had been inherited from Apostolo Zeno at his death in 1750. There has been attempts to trace the manuscript back further in time from a faded Latin inscription on fol. 38r, dated June, 1590. This date suggest that it had been kept in the West, most likely Italy during this time.|$|R
5|$|Banks faced {{competition}} from five other goalkeepers, including 30-year-old Scotland international John Anderson and 25-year-old Dave MacLaren. He started the 1959–60 {{season as the}} reserve team's goalkeeper. This in effect made him the club's second choice, ahead of four of his rivals but behind first team choice MacLaren. He had played four reserve team games when MacLaren picked up an injury, and manager Matt Gillies selected Banks for his Leicester debut against Blackpool at Filbert Street on 9 September. The match finished 1–1, with Jackie Mudie's strike cancelling out Ken Leek's opener. Banks retained his place for the 2–0 loss to Newcastle United at St James' Park three days later. With McLaren fit again, Banks {{was sent back to}} the reserves but, after the first team conceded 14 goals in the next five games, he was recalled and became the first-choice goalkeeper {{for the remainder of the}} season. The defensive record did not improve at first, with Banks conceding six in a heavy defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, but he improved in each match and the Foxes settled for a comfortable 12th-place finish. In training, he worked extensively on improving his weaknesses, such as coming for crosses. He put in extra hours during training and came up with practice sessions to improve his skills – this was largely unique in an <b>era</b> <b>where</b> there were no specialized goalkeeping coaches. In the summer, both Anderson and MacLaren departed, leaving Banks as the club's undisputed number one ahead of a group of understudies.|$|E

To overcome, we must look back to find what we have accomplished, why we have sometimes failed, and how we can improve upon our past work...|$|R
5000|$|The Pocahontas tale is an American {{narrative}} {{that has been}} popularized at various points in time.

Strangely enough, there was several times that were well-suited for historical romance in America.

5000|$|The grain {{trade is}} {{probably}} nearly {{as old as}} grain growing, going back the Neolithic Revolution ( [...] around 9,000 BC [...] ). Wherever there is a scarcity of land (e.g. cities) people must bring in food from outside to sustain themselves, either by force or by trade. However, many farmers throughout history (and today) have operated at the subsistence level, meaning they produce for household needs and have little leftover to trade. The goal for such farmers in not to specialize in one crop and grow a surplus of it, but rather to produce everything his family needs and become self-sufficient. Only in places and <b>eras</b> <b>where</b> production is geared towards producing a surplus for trade (commercial agriculture), does a major grain trade become possible.|$|R
