5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional <b>data</b> <b>may</b> be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} {{has shown}} these two species diverged around 400,000years ago, more recently than was previously thought. Also, the orangutan genome {{was found to}} have evolved much more slowly than chimpanzee and human DNA. Previously, the species was estimated to have diverged 2.9 to 4.9mya. The researchers hope these <b>data</b> <b>may</b> help conservationists save the endangered ape, and also prove useful in further understanding of human genetic diseases. Bornean orangutans have 48diploid chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} registered crimes {{during the first}} four months of 2006 were: theft (335 instances, including 19 car thefts, constituting about 50% {{of the total number of}} crimes); rape (259 instances or about 38.5% of the total); robbery (44 instances or about 6.5%); and bodily injury (20 instances or about 3%).

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum.

That <b>data</b> <b>may</b> only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E
