500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, Collins read the Book of Revelation. As well, Collins has said he {{somewhat}} based his character around his younger brother, who has something [...] "angelic about him", as he [...] "has this way of, very calmly, <b>just</b> <b>staring</b> into someone's eyes" [...] making one feel [...] "like he can get into your soul." [...] To avoid the biblically toned dialogue from sounding too [...] "campy", Collins does his best to [...] "play it as real as possible". Because Castiel's true voice shattered windows in his premiere episode, Collins decided to use a [...] "gruff, resonant voice" [...] for the character. However, when portraying the angel's host Jimmy Novak, he tried to create {{a distinction between the}} two characters, providing different physical and personality traits, as well as using a [...] "more boyish kind of sound" [...] for Jimmy's voice.|$|E

2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or <b>just</b> <b>staring</b> blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E

2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was <b>just</b> <b>staring</b> ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E

I went up this afternoon to scold her about the state the house was in--you can see that Irene's away by the perfect mess; but when I saw her through the crack of the door I hadn't the heart. She sat there with her hands in her lap, <b>just</b> <b>staring.</b> And, my goodness! she JUMPED so when she saw me; and then she fell back, and began to laugh, and said she, 'I thought it was my ghost, mother!'

6000|$|He {{showed me}} then {{to what he}} called the Warder's Library--an iron-barred room, more bare and brown than any I had seen since I left school. While I stood there waiting and staring out into the prison court-yard, there came, rolling and {{rumbling}} in, a Black Maria. It drew up with a clatter, and I saw through the barred door the single prisoner--a young girl of perhaps eighteen--dressed in rusty black. She was resting her forehead against a bar and looking out, her quick, narrow dark eyes taking in her new surroundings with a sort of sharp, restless indifference; and her pale, thin-upped, oval face quite expressionless. Behind those bars she seemed to me {{for all the world like}} a little animal of the cat tribe being brought in to her Zoo. Me she did not see, but if she had I felt she would not shrink--only give me the same sharp, indifferent look she was giving all else. The policeman on the step behind had disappeared at once, and the driver now got down from his perch and, coming round, began to gossip with her. I saw her slink her eyes and smile at him, and he smiled back; a large man; not unkindly. Then he returned to his horses, and she stayed as before, with her forehead against the bars, <b>just</b> <b>staring</b> out. Watching her like that, unseen, I seemed to be able to see right through that tight-lipped, lynx-eyed mask. I seemed to know that little creature through and through, as one knows anything that one surprises off its guard, sunk in its most private moods. I seemed to see her little restless, furtive, utterly unmoral soul, so stripped of all defence, as if she had taken it from her heart and handed it out to me. I saw that she was one of those whose hands slip as indifferently into others' pockets as into their own; incapable of fidelity, and incapable of trusting; quick as cats, and as devoid of application; ready to scratch, ready to purr, ready to scratch again; quick to change, and secretly as unchangeable as a little pebble. And I thought: [...] "Here we are, taking her to the Zoo (by no means for the first time, if demeanour be any guide), and we shall put her in a cage, and make her sew, and give her good books which she will not read; and she will sew, and walk up and down, until we let her out; then she will return to her old haunts, and at once go prowling and do exactly the same again, what ever it was, until we catch her and lock her up once more. And in this way we shall go on purifying Society until she dies." [...] And I thought: If indeed she had been created cat in body as well as in soul, we should not have treated her thus, but should have said: 'Go on, little cat, you scratch us sometimes, you steal often, you are as sensual as the night. All this we cannot help. It is your nature. So were you made--we know you cannot change--you amuse us! Go on, little cat!' Would it not then be better, and less savoury of humbug if we said the same to her whose cat-soul has chanced into this human shape? For assuredly she will but pilfer, and scratch a little, and be mildly vicious, in her little life, and do no desperate harm, having but poor capacity for evil behind that petty, thin-upped mask. What is the good of all this padlock business for such as she; are we not making mountains out of her mole hills? Where is our sense of proportion, and our sense of humour? Why try to alter the make and shape of Nature with our petty chisels? Or, if we must take care of her, to save ourselves, in the name of Heaven let us do it in a better way than this! And suddenly I remembered that I was a Grand Juryman, a purifier of Society, who had brought her bill in true; and, that I might not think these thoughts unworthy of a good citizen, I turned my eyes away from her and took up my list of indictments. Yes, there she was, at least so I decided: Number 42, [...] "Pilson, Jenny: Larceny, pocket-picking." [...] And I turned my memory back to the evidence about her case, but I could not remember a single word. In the margin I had noted: [...] "Incorrigible from a child up; bad surroundings." [...] And a mad impulse came over me to go back to my window and call through the bars to her: [...] "Jenny Pilson! Jenny Pilson! It was I who bred you and surrounded you with evil! It was I who caught you for being what I made you! I brought your bill in true! I judged you, and I caged you! Jenny Pilson! Jenny Pilson!" [...] But just as I reached the window, the door of my waiting-room was fortunately opened, and a voice said: [...] "Now, sir; at your service!"...|$|E

2500|$|Willy DeVille {{was married}} in the early 1970s to Susan Berle (February 19, 1950August 12, 2004), who was known as Toots Deville.

Alex Halberstadt, Doc Pomus's biographer, wrote about Toots, [...] "Half French and half Pima Indian, Toots favored a pair of nose rings, snow-white kabuki make-up and a Ronettes-style beehive the color of tar.

5000|$|Occasionally {{it got a}} bit frosty and negative. But, {{generally}} speaking, it was <b>just</b> people <b>staring</b> at {{the ceiling}} and thinking about a line for 25 minutes.

Rowan Atkinson(2003) Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis wrote the scripts for Blackadder episodes separately using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts for each other to add or remove jokes and dialogue. Curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny, then it was never put back.|$|R

5000|$|A {{recurring}} gag {{was that}} many of the characters in the cartoon were seemingly based on the residents of Eliot's apartment building. The bulldog crime-boss Bugsy Vile was inspired by the building's grouchy bulldog superintendent Bruno. Ace's love interest Rosie was based on Eliot's deep feelings for his neighbor Colleen, and so on. The Muppet characters were unaware of this. In the first episode, Bruno asks Eliot how a loser like him could have created a great character like Bugsy. Eliot replies [...] "Sometimes it's <b>just</b> <b>staring</b> you in the face".|$|E

50|$|Many {{guests and}} hotel staff have heard and seen {{what appears to}} be a 4 or 5 year old child running down the hallway on the 3rd floor, {{sometimes}} crying or laughing.

The sounds of a newborn baby's cry is common on the 3rd and 4th floors, as well as the faint smell of baby powder and zinc oxide. The baby's crying has alerted enough guests that they've phoned the front desk out of concern; the location being a vacant room.|$|E
50|$|In {{some parts}} of South America the act of ojear, which could be {{translated}} as to give someone the evil eye, is an involuntary act.

This may produce illness, discomfort or possibly death on babies or animals and failures on inanimate objects like cars or houses. It's a common belief that since this is an involuntary act made by people with the heavy look, the proper way of protection is by attaching a red ribbon to the animal, baby or object, {{in order to attract}} the gaze to the ribbon rather than to the object intended to be protected.|$|R
2500|$|Vishniac's {{photographs}} from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished. His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes <b>just</b> sitting; <b>staring.</b> The scenes are dramatic: [...] "There is barely {{a hint of a}} smile on any of the faces.

Once while visiting Jobs, he showed it to one of the top executives of Atari, Inc., Al Alcorn, who was so impressed that he offered Wozniak a job right on the spot.
