Different combinations of <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> indices were selected as explanatory variables for specific regional probability model.

40|$|Bush fire is {{a natural}} part of the Australian {{environment}} with the potential to devastate rural and urban communities through loss of life, property and infrastructure. While better risk assessment offers some hope in ameliorating the impacts of bushfire, these assessments are challenging due to the complexity of physical and social landscapes, the limited amount of available data describing these landscapes and community’s subjective assessment of the inherent value of natural and built environments. This paper demonstrates how the difficulties of preparing a <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> assessment can be met through the application of a Fuzzy Geographic Information Systems approach to Parkland areas of Sydney Olympic Park. The factors of <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> are grouped into four main categories: Physical Factors, Asset Values, Conservation Values and Mitigation. These factors were interpreted into fuzzy terms, based on the thresholds predefined by expert knowledge and past experience of parklands <b>fires.</b> A <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> model was built with different fuzzy operations and applied to the fuzzificated data layers to map the degree of <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> across the 420 Ha site, resulting in a <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> gradient map.

Moreover, it’s a cost-effective method for broad scale <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> assessment with general applicability beyond the limits of the Parklands.

Remote sensing and digital terrain data have been introduced for efficient discrete classification of <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>fire</b> danger potential. In this study, two time-series data of Landsat imagery were used for determining spatio-temporal change of <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> and danger potential in Korudag forest planning unit in northwestern Turkey.

The {{meteorological}} conditions associated with elevated and extreme long- and short-timescale forest <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> are investigated by validating and diagnosing the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) {{in the context}} of Tuscany in Italy, and Thessaloniki, Athens and Heraklion in Greece. The aim is to provide information to assist diagnosing experiments that use output from climate models to calculate FWI values. Links are made from <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> to the widely used FWI, and then to the underlying meteorology, complementing other more complex <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> model studies. First, the information about Mediterranean <b>fire</b> <b>risk</b> provided by the FWI is assessed by comparing the observed number of fires per day with FWI values based on the locally observed meteorology. This shows that the FWI provides some relatively consistent information for different locations, and suggests useful FWI thresholds indicating elevated and extreme <b>fire</b> <b>risk.</b> Then, the FWI system is split according to contributions from long- and short-timescale components, in a different way than usually adopted in the literature.
