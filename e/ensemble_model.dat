40|$|Abstract — Classification is an {{important}} technique of data mining. In this paper feature selection technique and an <b>ensemble</b> <b>model</b> is proposed to improve classification accuracy. Feature selection technique is used for selecting subset of relevant features from the data set to build robust learning models. Classification accuracy is improved by removing most irrelevant and redundant features from the dataset. <b>Ensemble</b> <b>model</b> is proposed for improving classification accuracy by combining the prediction of multiple classifiers. Three decision tree data mining classifiers CART, CHAID and QUEST are considered in this paper for classification. The ionosphere dataset investigated {{in this study is}} taken from UCI machine learning repository which is classified under two category “Bad” and “Good”. The proposed <b>ensemble</b> <b>model</b> combines the classifiers CART, CHAID and QUEST by using confidential-weighted voting scheme. A comparative study is carried on the performances of the classifiers before and after carrying out feature selection. The performance of each classifier and <b>ensemble</b> <b>model</b> is evaluated by using statistical measures like accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Gain chart and R. O.

Here we present one such approach, the "biological <b>ensemble</b> <b>modeling</b> approach,'' using the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua callarias) as an example. The core of the approach is to expose an <b>ensemble</b> of <b>models</b> with different ecological assumptions to climate forcing, using multiple realizations of each climate scenario. We simulated the long-term response of cod to future fishing and climate change in seven ecological models ranging from single-species to food web models. These models were analyzed using the "biological <b>ensemble</b> <b>modeling</b> approach'' by which we (1) identified a key ecological mechanism explaining the differences in simulated cod responses between models, (2) disentangled the uncertainty caused by differences in ecological model assumptions from the statistical uncertainty of future climate, and (3) identified results common for the whole <b>model</b> <b>ensemble.</b> Species interactions greatly influenced the simulated response of cod to fishing and climate, {{as well as the}} degree to which the statistical uncertainty of climate trajectories carried through to uncertainty of cod responses. Models ignoring the feedback from prey on cod showed large interannual fluctuations in cod dynamics and were more sensitive to the underlying uncertainty of climate forcing than models accounting for such stabilizing predator-prey feedbacks. Yet in all models, intense fishing prevented recovery, and climate change further decreased the cod population. Our study demonstrates how the biological <b>ensemble</b> <b>modeling</b> approach makes it possible to evaluate the relative importance of different sources of uncertainty in future species responses, as well as to seek scientific conclusions and sustainable management solutions robust to uncertainty of food web processes in the face of climate change...|$|R

We initially develop location specific models by employing ANNs, LR and RF, and achieving correlation coefficients between 0.406 and 0.641 for the GMA stations, and between 0.693 and 0.742 for the TMA stations. The best performance was provided by the LR models, followed by the RF and the ANN models. In addition, we developed and tested three types of <b>ensemble</b> <b>models</b> per area, namely the local, the foreign and the cross <b>ensemble</b> <b>models.</b> Their application proved the local <b>ensemble</b> <b>models</b> to be the superior for both ANNs and LR algorithms.

This suggests that city authorities may develop effective AQ models by targeting their investment in AQ monitoring to the parameters of interest, a vast feature space not being necessary for the success of the modelling approach.|$|R
