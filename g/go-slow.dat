50|$|Civil {{resistance}} is political action {{that relies on}} the use of nonviolent resistance by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or regime. Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, <b>go-slows,</b> boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments. The phenomenon of civil {{resistance is}} often associated with the advancement of democracy.|$|R

Dundar came from a Kurdish nationalist family which claimed his body and held a funeral for him in Nusaybin {{in which he was}} brought to the city's main mosque and 5000 people which held a march. On the way back the march turned violent and protesters clashed with the police, during which both sides fired upon each other and many people were injured. A curfew was then placed in Nusaybin, tanks and special forces were brought in and some 700 people were arrested. Riots spread to nearby towns and in Cizre over 15,000 people, constituting about half the town's population took part in riots in which five people were killed, 80 injured and 155 arrested. Widespread riots took place throughout the Southeast on Nowruz, the Kurdish new-year celebrations, which at the time were banned.

40|$|The book {{outlines}} how {{class is}} {{single most important}} factor in understanding the British army in the period of industrialisation. It challenges the 'ruffians officered by gentlemen' theory of most military histories and demonstrates how service in the ranks was not confined to ‘the scum of the earth’ but included a cross section of ‘respectable’ working class men. Common soldiers represent a huge unstudied occupational group. They worked as artisans, servants and dealers, displaying pre-enlistment working class attitudes and evidencing low level class conflict in numerous ways. Soldiers continued as members of the working class after discharge, with military service forming one phase of their careers and overall life experience. After training, most common soldiers had time on their hands and were allowed to work at a wide variety of jobs, analysed here for the first time. Many serving soldiers continued to work as regimental tradesmen, or skilled artificers. Others worked as officers’ servants or were allowed to run small businesses, providing goods and services to their comrades. Some, especially the Non Commissioned Officers who actually ran the army, forged extraordinary careers which surpassed any opportunities in civilian life. All the soldiers studied retained much of their working class way of life. This was evidenced in a contract culture {{similar to that of the}} civilian trade unions. Within disciplined boundaries, army life resulted in all sorts of low level class conflict. The book explores these by covering drinking, desertion, feigned illness, self harm, strikes and <b>go-slows.</b> It further describes mutinies, back chat, looting, fraternisation, foreign service, suicide and even the shooting of unpopular officers...|$|R

More especially the analysis {{focuses on the}} implementation of the incentive schemes without the involvement of the workers 'unions, a situation which has led to misunderstanding between management and the unions. The study also focused on the following specific objectives: • To investigate the effect of lncentive Schemes on employee satisfaction, employee relations and productivity; • To investigate employees satisfaction with and perceptions of the implementation and awarding of Incentives; • To investigate employees perceptions of the effect of Union bargaining on employee satisfaction and productivity; • To investigate whether perceptions with regard to unions and incentive schemes differ depending on demographic classifications. The study sought to answer the following research questions; 1. 3. 1 Does the failure to negotiate incentive schemes with the unions cause friction between employees? 1. 3. 2 [s the imposing of the incentive schemes on employees leading to mistrust between employees and supervisors because the employees feel unfairly treated? l. 3. 3 Are incentive schemes extended to supervisory. middle and senior management jobs because of the criteria for awarding the incentives have not been negotiated with the unions? 1. 3. 4 Are strikes and <b>go-slows</b> a result of employees 'misconception that management has the ability to pay salary increases if management is able to give incentives? 1. 3. 5 Do employees feel de-motivated thinking other employees are paid more than them a result of simply not understanding the scheme as it is not negotiated with their unions? The data collected was subject to quantitative analysis. A questionnaire was developed and used as a data collection instrument. There were 122 completed questionnaires returned using simple random sampling technique. Out of the returned questionnaires, 119 were completed satisfactorily. The number of 119 returned questionnaires was considered an adequate sample size according to Krejcie and Morgan (1970 : 608). The study revealed that there was a positive correlation between incentive scheme concerns and other variables like age and citizenship, indicating that environmental concerns were true. Results revealed a positive correlation between knowledge of incentive concerns and other variables like citizenship and length of service indicating that incentive concerns were true. Other results revealed a correlation between satisfaction of the incentive scheme concerns and the age of respondents. Other concerns included the correlation between collective bargaining arid the incentive scheme. Master...|$|R
50|$|A {{slowdown}} (UK: <b>go-slow)</b> is {{an industrial}} action in which employees perform their duties but seek to reduce productivity or efficiency in their performance of these duties. A slowdown {{may be used}} as either a prelude or an alternative to a strike, as it is seen as less disruptive as well as less risky and costly for workers and their union. Striking workers usually go unpaid and risk being replaced, so a slowdown is seen as a way to put pressure on management while avoiding these outcomes. Other times slowdowns are accompanied by intentional sabotage on the part of workers to provide further disruption.|$|E

50|$|During 1918-1919 {{there was}} a series of {{protracted}} strikes at the Ross River and Alligator Creek meatworks, which began with the workers' rejection of compulsory arbitration in favour of direct bargaining. They staged ongoing wildcat strikes and <b>go-slow</b> campaigns to achieve their aims. At the same time the companies wanted to remove a clause from employment contracts giving preference to union members, which they achieved for a short time, hiring returned servicemen in place of industrial activists. Support was then offered by the Queensland Rail Union and the Waterside Workers Federation and the strikes continued. By July 1919 the ongoing dispute degenerated to the point where riots occurred in Townsville with police firing shots to disperse the crowd of 1000 people who were protesting the imprisonment of strike leaders. This strike is {{regarded as one of the}} most ferocious in Australian history. In 1920 the Arbitration Court restored a modified union preference clause into the employment contracts.|$|E

Snow was also photographed picking at the seam of a Kookaburra cricket ball, which caused a furore in the Australian press until it was realised that the Kookaburra did not have a seam and Snow had been playing a practical joke on the cameraman.

5000|$|Business {{interests}} largely supported McKinley's <b>go-slow</b> policies. Wall Street, big business, {{high finance}} and Main Street businesses {{across the country}} were vocally opposed to war and demanded peace. After years of severe depression, the economic outlook for the domestic economy was suddenly bright again in 1897. However the uncertainties of a long expensive war posed serious threat to full economic recovery. [...] "War would impede the march of prosperity and put the country back many years," [...] warned the New Jersey Trade Review. The leading railroad magazine editorialized, [...] "From a commercial and mercenary standpoint it seems peculiarly bitter that this war should come when the country had already suffered so much and so needed rest and peace." [...] McKinley paid {{close attention to the}} strong anti-war consensus of the business community, and strengthened his resolve to use diplomacy and negotiation rather than brute force to end the Spanish tyranny in Cuba. On the other hand, humanitarian sensibilities reached fever pitch as church leaders and activists wrote hundreds of thousands of letters calling for intervention to political elites at the state and national level; they in turn put pressure on McKinley. Thus the call for a humanitarian intervention was a major factor in forcing McKinley to turn the decision over to Congress, which he knew would declare war.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conflicts}} of 1947-48 {{were not very}} representative of the prevailing industrial relations culture in the NHS. Despite recurrent complaints about low pay and long hours, NHS staff were not prone to outbreaks of collective protest in the 1950s and 1960s. With the exception of an overtime ban and work-to-rule by administrative staff in 1957, organised by NALGO, and a <b>go-slow</b> by laundry workers in Carshalton in 1950, the NHS had little formal workplace conflict. Groups of miners, printers, dockers and car workers did stage a one-hour strike in solidarity with nurses' claims for pay increase in 1962, but the nurses' professional organisation the Royal College of Nursing repudiated their actions and generally preferred to trade on respectability rather than militancy. At that time the Rcn was reluctant to refer to itself as a trade union and nurses looking for more conventional workplace representation looked to the Confederation of Health Service Employees (COHSE) and the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE). The latter was generally strongest amongst ancillary staff and former amongst psychiatric nurses. Recognising the sensitive nature of hospital work both remained cautious regarding industrial action in the NHS until the 1970s, fearing that advocating action that might affect patients would drive away potential members. A combination of cautious organisations, staff who often saw their work as a vocation, and the domineering influence of doctors {{over the rest of}} the workforce, led to an [...] "old colonial" [...] system of industrial relations, structured largely by personal patronage and paternalism.|$|E
40|$|Aposematic prey use {{conspicuous}} {{warning signals}} to advertise their defenses to predators. It {{has long been}} recognized that the efficiency of a warning signal may be reduced if poorly defended prey (automimics) {{are present in the}} population. The handicap principle suggests that the use of warning signals by poorly defended prey may be kept in check if signaling is costly. Three mechanisms that involve signal costs have been proposed to facilitate honest warning signals in prey: <b>go-slow</b> behavior in predators, resource allocation trade-offs, and costs of detection alone. We study all three in a unified game-theoretical framework. We find that the <b>go-slow</b> mechanism and the resource allocation mechanism can introduce differential benefits and differential costs of signaling, respectively, and can support honest signaling in accordance with the handicap principle. When honest signaling is maintained by the <b>go-slow</b> mechanism, conspicuous prey will necessarily suffer more attacks on average than cryptic prey. In contrast, when honest signaling is maintained by the resource allocation mechanism, cryptic prey will suffer more attacks. The detection cost mechanism lacks differential costs and benefits, and its potential for maintaining honest signaling equilibria is limited. We relate our results to intra- and interspecific correlations between conspicuousness and defense. © 2012 University of Chicago Pres...|$|E
