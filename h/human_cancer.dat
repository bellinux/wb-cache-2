5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita exitialis contain a unique purine {{nucleoside}} that is {{coupled with an}} amino acid derivative named N2-(1-methoxycarbonylethyl)guanosine. The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α-amino nitrogen (the nitrogen bonded to the α-carbon) to a nucleobase aglycone by a C-N (carbon to nitrogen) bond. The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines. Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β-carboline and russulaceramide (a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms).|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{appear in}} {{folklore}} and traditional medicine around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and convulsion in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E

Researchers {{have found that}} some plant stress hormones share the ability to adversely affect <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. For example, sodium salicylate {{has been found to}} suppress proliferation of lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate, breast, and melanoma <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> cells. Jasmonic acid, a plant stress hormone that belongs to the jasmonate family, induced death in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Methyl jasmonate has been found to induce cell death in a number of cancer cell lines.|$|E

40|$|Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA {{was one of}} {{the first}} somatic {{epigenetic}} alterations discovered in <b>human</b> <b>cancers.</b> DNA hypomethylation is postulated to occur very early in almost all <b>human</b> <b>cancers,</b> perhaps facilitating genetic instability and cancer initiation and progression. We therefore examined the nature, extent, and timing of DNA hypomethylation changes in <b>human</b> prostate <b>cancer.</b> Con-trary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all <b>human</b> <b>cancers,</b> we show that reductions in 5 meC content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a signifi-cant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease. Furthermore, we found that, whereas some LINE 1 promoter hypomethylation does occur in primary prostate cancer...|$|R

To gain an insight {{into the role of}} DNA hypermethylation in <b>human</b> <b>cancers</b> and allow direct comparison of tissue specific methylation, we generated methylation profiles in 328 <b>human</b> <b>cancers,</b> including 24 breast, 48 colon, 61 stomach, 48 liver, 37 larynx, 24 lung, 40 prostate, and 46 uterine cervical cancer samples by analyzing CpG island hypermethylation of 13 genes using methylation-specific PCR. The mean numbers of methylated genes were 6. 5, 4. 4, 3. 6, 3. 4, 3. 1, 3. 1, 3. 1, and 2. 1 in gastric, liver, prostate, larynx, colon, lung, uterine cervix, and in breast cancer samples, respectively. The number of genes that were methylated at a frequency of more than 40 % in each tumor type ranged from nine (stomach) to one (breast). Generally genes frequently methylated in a specific cancer type differed from those methylated in other cancer types. The findings indicate that aberrant CpG island hypermethylation is a frequent finding in <b>human</b> <b>cancers</b> of various tissue types, and each tissue type has its own distinct methylation pattern...|$|R

Copper-SBH complexes were more cytotoxic than complexes of other transitional metals (Cu > Ni > Zn = Mn > Fe = Cr > Co) in MOLT-4 cells, an established human T-cell leukemia cell line.

25|$|NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with and ubiquitinate the tumour suppressor protein PTEN in vitro, resulting in PTEN proteasomal degradation or trafficking. The in vivo role of NEDD4 in PTEN regulation is less clear. There is some evidence from NEDD4 deficient mice that NEDD4 does not target PTEN for degradation or trafficking. However, in other in vivo models, and in many <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> cell lines, NEDD4 does appear responsible for the degradation of PTEN. NEDD4 regulation of PTEN may only occur in specific biological contexts.|$|E
25|$|Dictyostelium discoideum is {{a species}} of soil-living amoeba {{belonging}} to the phylum Amoebozoa, infraphylum Mycetozoa. Commonly referred to as slime mold, D. discoideum is a eukaryote that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of D. discoideum is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes D. discoideum a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.|$|E

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} non-coding RNAs of 18 - 25 {{nucleotides}} in length that function as negative regulators. miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by either inhibiting mRNA translation or inducing mRNA degradation, {{and participate in}} a wide variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes. Recent reports have revealed that the deregulation of miRNAs correlates with various <b>human</b> <b>cancers</b> and is involved in the initiation and progression of <b>human</b> <b>cancers.</b> miRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to inhibit the expression of cancer-related target genes and to promote or suppress tumorigenesis in various tissues. Therefore, abnormal miRNA expression can be regarded as a common feature of <b>human</b> <b>cancers,</b> and the identification of miRNAs and their respective targets may provide potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies to treat cancers.

25|$|While {{this method}} of {{modeling}} <b>human</b> <b>cancer</b> in cell culture is effective and {{has been used for}} many years by scientists, it is also very imprecise. The exact changes that allow for the formation of the tumorigenic clones in the above-described experiment are not clear. Scientists addressed this question by the serial introduction of multiple mutations present in a variety of human cancers. This has led to the identification of mutation combinations that form tumorigenic cells in a variety of cell types. While the combination varies by cell type, the following alterations are required in all cases: TERT activation, loss of p53 pathway function, loss of pRb pathway function, activation of the Ras or myc proto-oncogenes, and aberration of the PP2A protein phosphatase. That is to say, the cell has an activated telomerase, eliminating the process of death by chromosome instability or loss, absence of apoptosis-induction pathways, and continued mitosis activation.|$|E
25|$|The name p53 {{was given}} in 1979 {{describing}} the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates {{that it is a}} 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53α) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the full-length protein, the human TP53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in <b>human</b> <b>cancer,</b> indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. TP53 gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.|$|E
25|$|In blind mole rats (genus Spalax), {{the process}} of {{necrosis}} replaces {{the role of the}} systematic apoptosis normally used in many organisms. Low oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats' burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In adaptation to higher tendency of cell death, blind mole rats evolved a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p53 (which is also used in humans) to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. <b>Human</b> <b>cancer</b> patients have similar mutations, and blind mole rats were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to a study conducted at the University of Rochester), the cells in blind mole rats release interferon-beta (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind mole rats. Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind mole rats and other spalacids are resistant to cancer.|$|E
