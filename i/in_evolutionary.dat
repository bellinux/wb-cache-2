5|$|Nevertheless, {{biologists}} still often {{write about}} evolution as if organisms had goals, and some philosophers of biology such as Francisco Ayala and biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane consider that teleological language is unavoidable <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} evolutionary synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> theory.

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, {{but also that}} of close relatives. <b>In</b> <b>evolutionary</b> terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> terms, as {{it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E
5|$|In {{biological}} classification humans are animals, a basic point {{which has been}} known for more than 2,000 years. The creationist J. Rendle-Short asserted in Creation magazine that if people are taught evolution they can be expected to behave like animals: since animals behave in all sorts of different ways, this is meaningless. <b>In</b> <b>evolutionary</b> terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Biochemical {{networks}} are the backbones of physiological systems of organisms. Therefore, a biochemical network should be suffi ciently robust (not sensitive) to tolerate genetic mutations and environmental changes <b>in</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process. <b>In</b> this study, {{based on the}} robustness and sensitivity criteria of biochemical networks, the adaptive design rules are developed for natural selection <b>in</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process. This will provide insights into the robust adaptive mechanism of biochemical networks <b>in</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process. We fi nd that if a mutated biochemical network satisfi es the robustness and sensitivity criteria of natural selection, {{there is a high}} probability for the biochemical network to prevail during natural selection <b>in</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process. Since there are various mutated biochemical networks that can satisfy these criteria but have some differences in phenotype, the bio-chemical networks increase their diversities <b>in</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> process. The robustness of a biochemical network enables co-option so that new phenotypes can be generated in evolution. The proposed robust adaptive design rules of natural selec-tion gain much insight into the evolutionary mechanism and provide a systematic robust biochemical circuit design method of biochemical networks for biotechnological and therapeutic purposes in the future...|$|R

5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> history.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> history.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{objections}} to evolution allege that evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events. It {{is argued that}} {{the teaching of evolution}} degrades values, undermines morals, and fosters irreligion or atheism. These may be considered appeals to consequences (a form of logical fallacy), as the potential ramifications of belief <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> theory {{have nothing to do with}} its objective empirical reality.|$|E

5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} <b>in</b> <b>evolutionary</b> biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian, {{takes its name from}} the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. <b>In</b> <b>evolutionary</b> studies the Cambrian is the period when most major groups of complex animals appeared (the Cambrian explosion).
