5|$|After the {{assassination}} of civil rights leader <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, riots {{broke out in the}} District, primarily in the UStreet, 14thStreet, 7thStreet, and HStreet corridors, centers of black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned; rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Religion {{and worship}} are {{cornerstones}} of the South Side communities. The nearby hub of Bronzeville at 47th and <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King, Jr. Drive (known as King Drive and formerly Grand Boulevard) was a cultural {{center of the}} rising ghetto that fostered a cultural identity. In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions. The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973. It is a Washington Park landmark {{and one of the}} largest African American museums in the country.|$|E

5|$|Due to the non-rectangular {{shape of}} the Washington Park {{community}} area, the original Washington Park Race Track actually occupied the Southern two-thirds of the Washington Park Subdivision, which is an 8-city block by 3-city block area in northwest corner of the Woodlawn community area and bounded by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King Drive to the west, South Cottage Grove Avenue to the East, East 60th Street to the North and East 63rd Street to the South.

5|$|Much of the 1964 {{session was}} devoted to a bill to desegregate public {{accommodations}} in Kentucky. A rally {{in favor of the}} bill was held in March and was attended by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King, Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill did not make it out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing a federal law to integrate them. Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the Conference's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King Jr. Boulevard).

She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther</b> King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E

40|$|The {{constitution}} of ELCSA was {{adopted in the}} constitutional assembly held on 15 to 19 December 1975 at Rustenburg, Tlhabane. The {{constitution of}} South Africa was adopted on 08 May 1996 and amended on 11 October 1996 by the constitutional assembly. It is obvious from this situation that the ELCSA constitution was put together and adopted during {{the rule of the}} National Party in consideration of the constitution of South Africa at the time. This suggests that the bill of rights was not taken into account when the constitution of ELCSA was written. The church‘s top down management system of administration is questionable. The harmony of rights and the ELCSA constitution was tested. The labour relations requirements are not taken into consideration by the ELCSA constitution given the procedures followed to add in addressing employee disputes. The ELCSA constitution was critically evaluated for compliance. The areas of the South African Constitution that were not considered at the initial stage of the church constitution were identified during the study. It is imperative though that the Church should not find her self-making concessions on issues that are contrary to Christian beliefs and norms that form the basis of the faith. <b>Dr</b> <b>Martin</b> <b>Luther’s</b> two kingdoms provided some guidance when the church was under pressure regarding certain issues that are required by the law of the country. Particularly the church does not condone abortion. In this study it was established that some areas require the church to mobilise and challenge the state. The study is concluded by a discussion of areas that present conflict between the church and legal requirements, areas that the church is omitting to do and areas that the church has to take a stand on. This discussion included recommendations that the church has to consider ensuring that legislation is complied with and that there is no conflict with the church constitution.
