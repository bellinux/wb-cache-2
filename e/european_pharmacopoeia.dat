As his studies, at a previous period of his life, had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day, it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received. Skilful men, of the medical and chirurgical profession, were of rare occurrence in the colony. They seldom, it would appear, partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the Atlantic. In their researches into the human frame, {{it may be that}} the higher and more subtle faculties of such men were materialised, and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism, which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself. At all events, the health of the good town of Boston, so far as medicine had aught to do with it, had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary, whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favour than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma. The only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor. To such a professional body Roger Chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition. He soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic; in which every remedy contained a multitude of far-fetched and heterogeneous ingredients, as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the Elixir of Life. In his Indian captivity, moreover, he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots; nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple medicines, Nature's boon to the untutored savage, had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeia,</b> which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Insulin is {{a widely}} used {{antidiabetic}} drug, which regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism of human body. This hormone is mostly formulated in hexamer by addition of zinc as an excipient but only the monomeric form is active once dissociated in the bloodstream. Insulin is prone to unfold when submitted to denaturating factors as temperature, ionic strength, agitation and pH. An accumulation of unfolded proteins results in a high tendency to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils. A deposit of those fibrils in the subcutaneous tissue leads to a complication called “insulin-derived amyloidosis”. Moreover, during its production, insulin is often subjected to extreme conditions making lack of aggregates an important parameter to be controlled during its quality control. United States and <b>European</b> <b>Pharmacopoeias</b> use both size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to assess the level of covalent high molecular weight species. This technique is reproducible, {{and easy to use}} but shows many drawbacks including possible changes in the aggregates composition by dilution into the HPLC system or adsorption of sample onto the stationary phase. For those reasons other techniques have been considered in the literature for studying aggregation of insulin. Optical microscopy, electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, turbidimetry, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thioflavin T fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy are some of them. In any cases, the use of orthogonal techniques is essential to assess the relevance of the results. Results: In this study, insulin aggregates were generated after optimization of incubation conditions (pH, temperature, agitation…). Those aggregates were then analyzed by SEC and capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE shows many advantages in terms of sample and solvent consumption and enables analysis of samples under their native form. We showed that capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) is a promising technique to analyze covalent aggregates of insulin {{due to the fact that}} it separates the aggregates according to their size and not to their size/charge ratio. The use of a laser-induced fluorescence detector was also found attractive to enhance the sensitivity of the method...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Because {{of their}} colour, rarity and other {{physical}} features, minerals were valued {{for at least}} 40. 000 years. Minerals and gemstones gave prestige and power to their owners and were believed to give or protect health. Their medical and apotropaic use {{was and still is}} universal. In this study we investigate mainly the medical use of hematite or bloodstone (iron oxide) in folk medicine. The first representation of medical use was found in the tomb of the Egyptian sculptor Apy (1200 BC) : hematite paste was used to cure eye diseases. Also many Greek and Roman sources show the use of hematite in connection with eye diseases and complaints involving blood loss (a. o. Evax-Damigeron, Celsus. Pline the Elder, Dioscorides, Galen). During the Middle Ages many antidotaria and lapidaria were published (Nicolaus Salernitanus, Marbod de Rennes, Jacob van Maerlant, Johannis de Cuba, Teifaschi). Albertus Magnus (ca. 1208 - 1280) demystified the healing power of minerals and gemstones by formulating a rational explanation for their properties. These lapidaria and medical books were written in Greek, Latin or Arabic, but knew very early translations and many reprints into a striking number of vernacular tongues. This is illustrating the need and demand for more accessibility to medical information in times where all social groups were touched by plagues and epidemics. From the sixteenth century on, a critical approach involving experiments tried to get an insight into the mechanism of nature (Joannes van Helmont) and rejected the iatromathematical medicine which was based on magic of sympathy and antipathy of the stars, planets, minerals, etc [...] . Although not everybody believed in the curing properties of minerals like hematite, it will be {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century that stones will disappear from the <b>European</b> <b>pharmacopoeias.</b> The German encyclopaedist Zedler (1706 - 1751) and the French pharmacist Panckoucke (1788 - 1844) do not reject the curing potential of all minerals: both do believe in the curing properties of hematite and its derivates. Nevertheless the use of minerals still has addicts not only during the twentieth century (Süssenguth), but even today (homeopathy, lithotherapy, modem witches, alternative healing systems, etc.). The internal use of hematite as potential source of iron to the body is questionable. Medical publications consider that hematite - as well as other iron minerals - is not, or at a negligible level, taken up by the gastric system. Important in this respect is autosuggestion; the psychological influence of the healer may also play an important role...|$|R
