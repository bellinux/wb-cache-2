40|$|In the Gulf of Maine, the {{entanglement}} of humpback {{whales in}} fishing gear {{is a substantial}} source of human-caused mortality. The current mortality and serious injury of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is twice the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level set for this population. Researchers and managers are challenged to reduce entanglement to below PBR without extensive information on many important factors. The goal {{of this study was}} to describe entanglement injuries and investigate whether different fishing gear types, particularly pot and net fisheries, resulted in distinctive entanglement patterns of humpback whales from the Gulf of Maine. I searched the Center for Coastal Studies' entanglement database for whales that fit the following criteria: the entanglement occurred between 1995 and 2002, the whale was photographed during the disentanglement, and the <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> <b>or</b> line <b>type</b> of the entangling gear was known. Sixteen cases were identified that fit the criteria. Three cases involved entanglements in pot fishery gear, four in net gear, and nine cases with known line type. I qualitatively analyzed photographs from these sixteen cases to describe the injuries and to investigate whether any entanglement patterns could be determined based on gear type in terms of location of entanglement on whale, presence of trailing gear, presence of buoys or high flyers, free swimming versus anchored in <b>gear,</b> disentanglement success, <b>or</b> <b>type</b> of injury. I was unable to find a relationship between entangling gear type and any of the factors assessed. I discuss potential reasons for the finding of no relationship as well as considerations for future research in this area...|$|R
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} motor (Air motor) or compressed air engine {{is a type}} of motor which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion. Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor, piston air motor, air turbine <b>or</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> motor.|$|R

40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of lever type, cam <b>type,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> <b>or</b> mixed <b>type</b> are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control. During the execution of tasks, slip sensors provide information for grasping and manipulating the objects with certainty. The force sensors provide the magnitude of optimum force during grasping without slip. Thus the prototype gripper {{has been found to}} be capable of grasping the objects of different shapes with an optimal force...|$|R
40|$|Sustainability {{is a key}} policy {{requirement}} for fisheries throughout the world. Until recently {{it was difficult to}} assess fisheries sustainability, especially when it required the integration of information on the ecology, as well social and economic aspects. RAPFISH is a new multi-disciplinary rapid appraisal technique for evaluating the comparative sustainability of fisheries based on a large number of easy-to-score attributes. Fisheries may be defined flexibly as entities with a broad scope, such as all the fisheries in a marine gulf, or with narrower scope, such as those in a single jurisdiction, target species, <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> <b>or</b> vessel.

40|$|The use of {{couplings}} {{for high}} speed turbocompressors or pumps {{is essential to}} transmit power from the driver. Typical couplings are either of the lubricated <b>gear</b> <b>or</b> dry diaphragm <b>type</b> design. Gear couplings have been the standard design {{for many years and}} recent advances in power and speed requirements have pushed the standard design criteria to the limit. Recent test stand and field data on continuous lube gear type couplings have forced a closer examination of design tolerances and concepts to avoid operational instabilities. Two types of mechanical instabilities are reviewed in this paper: (1) entrapped fluid, and (2) gear mesh instability resulting in spacer throw-out onset. Test stand results of these types of instabilities and other directly related problems are presented together with criteria for proper coupling design to avoid these conditions. An additional test case discussed shows the importance of proper material selection and processing and what can happen to an otherwise good design...|$|R
40|$|Fisheries {{managers}} have established many marine protected areas (MPA’s) in the Federal and state waters off Alaska to protect ecological structure and function, establish control sites for scientific research studies, conserve benthic habitat, protect vulnerable stocks, and protect cultural resources. Many MPA’s achieve multiple objectives. Over 40 named MPA’s, {{many of which}} include several sites, encompass virtually all Federal waters off Alaska {{and most of the}} state waters where commercial fisheries occur. All of the MPA’s include measures to prohibit a particular fishery <b>or</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> (particularly bottom trawls) on a seasonal or year-round basis, and several MPA’s prohibit virtually all commercial fishing. Although the effectiveness of MPA’s is difficult to evaluate on an individual basis, as a group they are {{an important component of the}} management program for sustainable fisheries and conserving marine biodiversity off Alaska...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a bioeconomic model is {{developed}} {{for a commercial}} fishery with multiple gear types {{in the case of}} two independent fish species. Where most bioeconomic fishery models focus on either multiple <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> <b>or</b> multiple species (mostly predator-prey relationships) this model combines both aspects for four gear types and two independent fish species. The objective of the paper is to find the optimal allocation of four gear types per period to obtain the highest net benefits while harvesting at a sustainable rate. This is done by developing a discrete time LP-model for a sole owner fishery, given a Total Allowable Catch for the two fish species. The model is applied to the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation commercial fishery in Lake Huron and Georgian Bay (Ontario, Canada). Sensitivity analyses are performed on price changes {{as well as on the}} average harvest levels per boat...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliography. Recent {{declines in}} the biomass of the closely-related deep-water rock {{lobsters}} Palinurus gilchristi and P. delagoae off South Africa suggest that both these resources are currently overfished, and that the existing management procedures are inadequate. A lack of detailed fisheries, biological and ecological knowledge is partly to blame, as this deficiency limits the scope and utility of resource assessments, and impairs the capacity of managers to forumulate species-specific management strategies. This thesis aimed to expand the biological and ecological bases on which effective resource assessment rests, and to recommend methods to improve the management of these deep-water rock lobster populations. The steps taken were: (1) determination and interspecies comparison of biological parameters, including spatial and temporal size composition trends, somatic growth rates, size at sexua maturity, female fecundity, mortality rates, moulting, recruitment and migration; (2) assessment {{of the effect of}} fishing with different <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> <b>or</b> arrays on abundance and its indices; and (3) incorporation of new information into resource assessments, with recommendations aiming to improve the management of the fisheries...|$|R

50|$|Epicyclic <b>gearing</b> <b>or</b> {{planetary}} <b>gearing</b> is a {{gear system}} consisting of one <b>or</b> more outer <b>gears,</b> <b>or</b> planet <b>gears,</b> revolving about a central, <b>or</b> sun <b>gear.</b> Typically, the planet gears are {{mounted on a}} movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate {{the use of an}} outer ring <b>gear</b> <b>or</b> annulus, which meshes with the planet <b>gears.</b> Planetary <b>gears</b> (<b>or</b> epicyclic <b>gears)</b> are typically classified as simple <b>or</b> compound planetary <b>gears.</b> Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound planetary <b>gears</b> involve one <b>or</b> more of the following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|R
