5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
25|$|After {{my return}} from Vietnam, the {{opportunity}} to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, {{not only for the}} potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not {{over the hill}} as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E

25|$|The Director General {{has advised}} {{me that he}} has found no {{evidence}} of any truth in the allegations. He <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> his personal assurance that the stories are false. In particular, he has advised me that all the Security Service officers who have been interviewed have categorically denied that they were involved in, or were aware of, any activities or plans to undermine or discredit Lord Wilson and his Government when he was Prime Minister. The then Director General has categorically denied the allegation that he confirmed the existence within the Security Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right wing views. He has further stated that he had {{no reason to believe that}} any such faction existed. No evidence or indication has been found of any plot or conspiracy against Lord Wilson by or within the Security Service.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra {{for the whole of}} a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E

One of his writings on his family's foundation's website states, [...] "In the Pujols family, God is first. Everything else is a distant second." [...] He writes, [...] "My life's goal is to bring glory to Jesus. My life is not mostly dedicated to the Lord, it is 100% committed to Jesus Christ and His will. God <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the ability to succeed in the game of baseball. But baseball is not the end; baseball is the means by which my wife, Dee Dee, and I glorify God. Baseball is simply my platform to elevate Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivia {{continued}} to socialise and had many friends, one of whom, Wyndham Lewis, painted her portrait; he enjoyed her company despite finding {{it difficult to}} relate to others. She stopped writing but remained an avid reader, turning to detective stories for light relief although she also kept up with literary authors. She became friendly with Thomas MacGreevy, whom she invited for tea, later writing to him, [...] "WBY <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the new edition of Reveries and the Veil, & I am re-reading it all. It is very beautifully done. He was about 29 when I first knew him". McGreevy told Yeats that Olivia was [...] "always a symbol of elegance, a kind of gold and ivory image". Harwood writes of her, [...] "Olivia Shakespear was avant-garde in literature, agnostic in religion, and conservative in politics, at least later in life".|$|E

Luka is often described as an 18-year-old woman from [...] "Holland", but records indicate she was 28 and from Germany, her real name was [...] After the war, Pechersky insisted that the relationship was platonic. Her fate after the escape was never established and she was never seen alive again. During an interview with Thomas Blatt, Pechersky said the following regarding Luka: [...] "Although I knew her only about two weeks, I will never forget her. I informed her minutes before the escape of the plan. She <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> a shirt. She said, 'it's a good luck shirt, put it on right now', and I did. It's now in the museum. I lost her in the turmoil of the revolt and never saw her again." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach {{operation}} {{which was}} performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For {{the last five years}} of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: [...] "I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me,</b> the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892‚Äì1935.|$|E
500|$|When Nelson {{returned}} to the Mediterranean St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, First Lord of the Admiralty: [...] "I do assure your Lordship that the arrival of Admiral Nelson <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. His presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential." [...] St Vincent detached Nelson to pursue Napoleon in his invasion of Egypt Rear-Admiral Sir John Orde who was senior to Nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. Jervis ordered Orde home. Orde requested that he be court-martialled in order {{that he might have}} the opportunity to clear his name. The Board refused. Orde then requested that St Vincent be brought before a court-martial. Again, the Board refused. The Board censured Jervis for not having supported his subordinates. Orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. The challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered Jervis to decline. Before the challenge was formally declined, Orde wrote to the Board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.|$|E

500|$|A Sixth Army report {{indicated}} that the raid demonstrated [...] "...what patrols can accomplish in enemy territory by following {{the basic principles of}} scouting and patrolling, 'sneaking and peeping,' [...] use of concealment, reconnaissance of routes from photographs and maps prior to the actual operation, ... and the coordination of all arms in the accomplishment of a mission." [...] MacArthur spoke about his reaction to the raid: [...] "No incident of the campaign in the Pacific <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> such satisfaction as the release of the POWs at Cabanatuan. The mission was brilliantly successful." [...] He presented awards to the soldiers who participated in the raid on March3, 1945. Although Mucci was nominated for the Medal of Honor, he and Prince both received Distinguished Service Crosses. Mucci was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 1st Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division. All other American officers and selected enlisted received Silver Stars. The remaining American enlisted men and the Filipino guerrilla officers were awarded Bronze Stars. Nellist, Rounsaville, and the other twelve Scouts received Presidential Unit Citations.|$|E
500|$|The second witness {{called by}} the defense was United Press International (UPI) {{journalist}} and Hendrix's friend Sharon Lawrence, who testified that she was with Hendrix in California when, after complaining about feeling ill, an unnamed fan gave him something. When Malone suggested that her memory was suspiciously acute, she explained that her training as a reporter prepared her to notice fine details. Hendrix's manager and producer, Chas Chandler, was called next, and he corroborated the defense's assertion that rock stars, particularly Hendrix, would regularly receive gifts from fans and that those gifts often included drugs. In its closing argument, the defense reiterated {{that in order to}} be guilty of possession of narcotics Hendrix had to have knowledge of the illegal drugs. After a trial that had lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for more than eight hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. Torontoist Kevin Plummer wrote: [...] "As the all-male jury announced its acquittal, the courtroom‚Äîcrowded with young people‚Äîerupted into applause." [...] In remarks to reporters after the verdict was announced, Hendrix commented: [...] "Canada <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> the best Christmas present I ever had", while flashing a peace sign.|$|E
500|$|St. Vincent {{had already}} been {{preparing}} for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind, and the rear-admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship HMS Vanguard on 2 May. St Vincent was overjoyed {{to be able to}} place Nelson in command of the mission, writing that [...] "the arrival of Admiral Nelson <b>has</b> <b>given</b> <b>me</b> new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential". His preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals Sir William Parker and Sir John Orde provoked a storm of protest, which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel, and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain. On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line HMS Alexander and HMS Orion under Captains Alexander Ball and Sir James Saumarez the frigates HMS Emerald and HMS Terpsichore under Captains Thomas Moutray Waller and William Hall Gage and the sloop HMS Bonne Citoyenne under Captain Robert Retalick at Gibraltar, and passed into the Mediterranean. Despite leaving under cover of darkness, Nelson's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz, and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot, striking Alexander but inflicting negligible damage.|$|E
