The bonds, which were linked {{to the price of}} gold, were certificates held under a trust mortgage with the Chatham Phenix National Bank and Trust Company. Prospective purchasers of the bonds were told that Horch and an associate guaranteed payment of principal and interest personally and that the income from rentals was expected far to exceed expenses, including both <b>interest</b> <b>costs</b> and amounts to be committed to the sinking fund.|$|E
5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in <b>interest</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The company {{collected}} NOK73.5 {{million in}} tolls, {{in addition to}} accumulating NOK16.3 million in <b>interest.</b> <b>Costs,</b> mostly for running of the toll plaza, were NOK7.6 million, in addition to financial costs of NOK20.0 million. This gave a profit of NOK62.4 million, including the necessary repayments of the initial loan. Because the debt had been financed with bonds, the company chose to place revenue in the bank with a higher interest instead of paying off the bonds faster. The preferred shares were repaid in 1980, while all bonds had been repaid by 1985. A/S Sotrabrua was formally liquidated on 9 February 1989.|$|E

The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual <b>interest</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home mortgage <b>interest</b> <b>costs</b> from taxable income (unless the taxpayer {{is subject to the}} Alternative Minimum Tax).

Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E

40|$|There is {{some degree}} of misperception {{concerning}} {{the superiority of the}} competitive sale as the evidence suggests that large portion of municipal emissions take the form of negotiated purchase. The following article describes the procedure for negotiation of the eventual bond emissions in municipality of Shtip, Republic of Macedonia. The aim is to predetermine the most cost-effective method for evaluation of underwriter’s municipal bond purchase proposal due to the substantial inexperience and deficit of expertise of the city’s internal services. The literature offers various measures available to compare the relative costs of bond financing proposals. While net <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> and net-present value are considered improper, it is thought that the best reliance for the purpose comes from the true <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> method. The procedure incorporates calculation of true <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> and duration of the underwriter’s proposal and matching them with those for a sample group of similar bonds. In this particular case, as there are no other municipals to compare with, that would be the only available bond market index of the Macedonian Stock Exchange named OMB, with a portfolio completely made of long-term government securities...|$|R
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their <b>interest</b> <b>costs.</b> By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

Bergen Municipality was concerned about that such a road would {{have a negative impact}} on the neighborhoods it would run through, and on 28 October 1985 voted for a tunnel from the bridge to Storavatnet and that a new highway would have to be built from there to the city center before the bridge be built. Specifically this involved the construction of two new tunnels, the Lyderhorn Tunnel and the Damsgård Tunnel. The latter was part of the existing plans for road construction and was scheduled for completion in 1992. However, the Lyderhorn Tunnel would have to be pushed forward, as it was planned completed in 1996. The toll company offered to advance NOK50 million of the necessary NOK70 million that the tunnel costs, on condition that it be refunded in 1994 and 1995 and that Bergen Municipality pay half the <b>interest</b> <b>costs.</b> The proposal was passed by both municipalities.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the existing literature by presenting the substantive essays on the Malaysian CPO futures market. In the first essay, the market efficiency test for the long-run, short-run and relative efficiency is applied under both open-outcry and electronic trading systems in the Malaysian Derivatives Markets. The findings reveal that the Malaysian CPO futures market is efficient in the long-run but inefficient in the short-run for both trading systems. The relative efficiency ratio test suggests {{that the level of}} inefficiency is higher in the electronic trading system and tends to increase with time to maturity. The second essay examines price discovery by utilizing the cost-of-carry model with incorporating an endogenously convenience yield. This model also is able to detect the market characteristics whether in backwardation or contango. The main result shows that the futures price is the main contributor to the price discovery function in the Malaysian CPO market. Furthermore, the long-run backwardation is significantly exist in the CPO futures market. Another finding reveals the positive CPO convenience yields and its value increases with time to maturity. The third and final essay explores the long memory properties of futures-spot basis and <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> on market efficiency. The empirical result shows that the CPO futures basis can be characterised by both long memory and structural breaks. Moreover, the <b>interest</b> <b>cost</b> also shows the evidence of the long memory component. These findings are not consistent with unbiasedness hypothesis and therefore, past prices can be used to predict the future spot price. A new finding reveals that the level of persistence in futures basis and <b>interest</b> <b>cost,</b> increases when time to maturity increases.
