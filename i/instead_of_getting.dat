5|$|Gradually, the Khalids were pardoned {{and allowed}} back to Bahrain after {{the leaders of}} the Shia {{community}} in Sitra were persuaded that the Khalids would not attack their villages again. Ibrahim bin Khalid, the eldest of the Khalids, who was exiled to Zubara (Qatar) for 10 years, was convicted in 1929 of being responsible for a failed assassination attempt on the ruler, his first cousin, in 1926. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> tried, the ruler appointed Ibrahim at his Sakhir Palace. His brother Salman, originally exiled for 10 years, was allowed back in 1928, while Abdulla was probably not exiled as he was an infant when the 1923 and 1924 incidents occurred.|$|E
5|$|While Evolve carried some game {{mechanics}} from Left 4 Dead, {{others were}} discarded. The team originally {{thought that it}} could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments.|$|E

The limit is configurable on Apache2 using the [...] directive, which specifies the number of bytes from 0 (meaning unlimited) to 2147483647 (2 GB) that are allowed in a request body.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{entering}} the forest, Maruyama has José whistle {{since he is}} apparently {{the only one who}} can, while Paifu practices his whistling since José will eventually get exhausted. José, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> fatigued from whistling, suddenly falls ill to the Monster Flu as well. Their fear of the monster finding them becomes a reality and they are attacked by the forest monster Baroaba. Maruyama holds his own against the behemoth and tells Paifu to start learning how to whistle immediately before they are killed. Although several attempts had been unsuccessful, Paifu finally prospered in whistling and Baroaba is literally downsized by the sound, proving the weakness true, and is pounded by Maruyama. Before Maruyama finishes him off, he discovers that Baroaba only attacks to protect the forest's rare wildlife; Baroaba apologizes for the misunderstanding and decides to help them get to their destination, the witch's house.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 2002 the Austrian {{government}} announced {{its decision to}} buy the Typhoon as its new air defence aircraft, it having beaten the General Dynamics F-16 and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen in competition. The purchase of 18 Typhoons was agreed on 1 July 2003, and included training, logistics, maintenance and a simulator. On 26 June 2007 Austrian Minister for Defense Norbert Darabos announced a reduction to 15 aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered on 12 July 2007 and formally entered service in the Austrian Air Force. A 2008 report by the Austrian government oversight office, the Rechnungshof, calculated that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> 18 Tranche 2 jets at a price of €109 million each, as stipulated by the original contract, the revised deal agreed by Minister Darabos meant that Austria was paying an increased unit price of €114 million for 15 partially used, Tranche 1 jets.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{independence}} of Indonesia, Jakarta trams was still operated by the private company BVM. In the early 1950s, Jakarta tramways stretched across Jakarta from Pasar Ikan in the north to Jatinegara in the south. Trams (or Trem in Indonesian) were very popular because of its low cost. Many native passengers felt that as an independent nation, {{they are no longer}} required to pay fares, so many decided to skip paying their fares. Trams are always overflow with people so the conductors could not check the passengers on board. Many people decided to hold onto the tram <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> in. Very often people go in and out through the windows instead. There was also a rise in labor unrest as increasingly confident workers sought better conditions. Greater competition from buses was also an issue. All of these caused huge impact on \BVM's finances.|$|E

Several months later he went to Springfield and reenlisted in Captain Lowe's company. Initially holding dreams of glory, the 18-year-old Reavis soon discovered the realities of military life did not match his romanticized ideals. About this time, he accidentally discovered that he could accurately reproduce his commanding officer's signature. Using this new-found skill, Reavis began producing passes to avoid the drudgery of army life and instead spent time visiting his mother. When his fellow soldiers noticed the frequency and manner by which he obtained his passes, Reavis began selling forged passes to them. When some of his superiors became suspicious of Reavis, he obtained leave supposedly to get married. He used the leave to surrender to Union forces <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> married. Following his surrender, Reavis joined the Union Army and briefly served in an artillery regiment.|$|E

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a [...] "community" [...] with [...] "members" [...] instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid $75,000 while those who joined afterwards were paid $50,000. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever {{took advantage of the}} privilege. NeXT's health insurance plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications. The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time: <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> paid twice a month {{at the end of the}} pay period, employees would get paid once a month in advance.|$|E
