25|$|Those who {{believed}} Dean and Angeli were deeply in love claim {{a number of}} forces led them apart. Angeli's mother disapproved of Dean's casual dress and what were, for her at least, radical behavior traits: <b>his</b> <b>T-shirt</b> attire, late dates, fast cars, {{and the fact that}} he was not a Catholic. Her mother said that such behavior was not acceptable in Italy. In addition, Warner Bros., where he worked, tried to talk him out of marrying and he himself told Angeli that he didn't want to get married. Richard Davalos, Dean's East of Eden co-star, claimed that Dean wanted to marry Angeli and was willing to allow their children to be brought up Catholic.|$|E
500|$|André and Hogan began feuding {{in early}} 1987 when, {{according}} to the storyline, André became tired of Hogan being the top wrestler in the WWF and was jealous of Hogan's reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion and in believing that his own accomplishment of 15 years of never being defeated by pinfall was a more noteworthy accomplishment than Hogan's three years as champion, {{said it was not}} acknowledged to his satisfaction. On an episode of Piper's Pit, André turned on Hogan by taking on Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan as his manager -- Heenan, a mutual enemy of Hogan and André, had in storyline previously done all he could to destroy André -- challenging him to a match for the championship and tearing <b>his</b> <b>T-shirt</b> off him.

500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling <b>his</b> <b>T-shirt</b> business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We all started with good motives, but there was lots of naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E
