5|$|The castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill. Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of £3,431 (£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on the <b>floor.</b> <b>Like</b> other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise, in this case by a local butcher, who was paid £150 a year (£15,400) to run the facility. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility.|$|E

25|$|The other {{dominant}} {{center of}} the early 1990s was David Robinson. Playing college ball at the United States Naval Academy, his entry into the NBA was delayed by his military service, but he unanimously won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1990 and, in 1995, was voted the MVP. Offensively, Robinson excelled in fast-breaks, running the <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> no 7-footer (2.13 m and above) before or since, while also possessing an effective left-hand jumper. Defensively, his speed and agility helped him hold {{the distinction of being}} the only player in NBA history to rank among the top five in rebounds, blocks and steals in a single season.|$|E

25|$|The early labyrinthodonts possessed well {{developed}} internal gills {{as well as}} primitive lungs, derived from the swim bladders of their ancestors. They could breathe air, {{which would have been}} a great advantage for residents of warm shoals with low oxygen levels in the water. There was no diaphragma and the ribs in many forms were too short or spaced too closely to aid in expanding the lungs. Likely air was inflated into the lungs by contractions of a throat sac against the skull <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> in modern amphibians, which may be the reason for the retention of the very flat skull in later forms. Exhalation with the aid of the ribs probably evolved only in the line leading to amniotes. Many aquatic forms retained their larval gills in adulthood.|$|E

She made funny, exaggerated faces; twirled her hair (when it was not floating); and spoke to the crowd like a knowing buddy. She was working off a teleprompter for her between-song patter, but improvising frequently, and for the better ... Beyoncé persevere, with a voice that skips up octaves and still gains power, with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward, with legs that treat the stage <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> an enemy in need of a thorough stomping. Even in moments of uncertainty, these are her constants. They survive her missteps.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room <b>floor,</b> <b>like</b> a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E

2500|$|The Dorothy Vernon {{room in the}} Deanery was {{designed}} by {{the architects of the}} second renovation, Archer and Allen, and Lockwood de Forest. De Forest decorated the spaces between the dark, exposed ceiling beams with decorative brass panels with East Indian patterns.

50|$|Another factor {{adding to}} the game's immense {{difficulty}} {{is the fact that}} the player can only lose five lives before being forced to start the entire game over. Also, in between levels, the player is taken to an elevator that travels between different <b>floors,</b> <b>like</b> in the arcade game. If the player gets off at the correct floor, they can continue the game. If the player gets off at the wrong floor, they are forced to replay a previous level.|$|R

The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:– 5 x 5.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the water}} column is also {{partly due to the}} introduction and rapid spread of zebra mussels from Europe, which had the effect of covering [...] "the basin <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> shag carpeting" [...] with each creature filtering [...] "a liter of fresh water a day," [...] helping to restore the lake to a cleaner state. The 1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement also significantly reduced the dumping and runoff of phosphorus into the lake. The lake has since become clean enough to allow sunlight to infiltrate its water and produce algae and sea weed, but a dead zone persists in the central Lake Erie Basin during the late summer. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has studied this cyclic phenomenon since 2005. There have been instances of beach closings at Presque Isle off the coast of northwestern Pennsylvania because of unexplained E. Coli contaminations, possibly caused by storm water overflows after heavy downpours.|$|E
2500|$|After {{carrying}} out the shooting, the gunmen calmly walked away. Shortly after, a married couple came upon {{the scene of the}} killings and began praying beside the victims. They found the badly-wounded Alan Black lying in a ditch. When an ambulance arrived, Black was taken to hospital in Newry, where he was operated on and survived. The Catholic worker, Richard Hughes, had managed to stop a car and was driven to Bessbrook RUC station, where he raised the alarm. One of the first police officers on the scene was Billy McCaughey, who had taken part in the Reavey killings. He said [...] "When we arrived it was utter carnage. Men were lying two or three together. Blood was flowing, mixed with water from the rain". Some of the Reavey family also came upon the scene of the Kingsmill massacre while driving to hospital to collect the bodies of their relatives. Johnston Chapman, the uncle of victims Reginald and Walter Chapman, said the dead workmen were [...] "just lying there like dogs, blood everywhere". At least two of the victims were so badly mutilated by gunfire that immediate relatives were prevented from identifying them. One relative said the hospital mortuary [...] "was like a butcher's shop with bodies lying on the <b>floor</b> <b>like</b> slabs of meat".|$|E

[...] It received mixed reviews. [...] The Times reviewer wrote: [...] "This is a very stylised, overdrilled production, no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion." [...] The Guardian liked it the most, stating that [...] "it's a delight, with one brilliant tippy-tappy-toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart." [...] Whats On Stage, {{like most of the}} papers, gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a [...] "downbeat vision" [...] and that [...] "all told it's a somewhat disappointing show", but their [...] "average reader rating" [...] was four stars. A review in The Telegraph commented, [...] "Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical's nightmarish aspects but doesn't over-labour them.

Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built [...] "hutments" [...] (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. [...] Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T.

During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses {{was developed}} in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.|$|E
