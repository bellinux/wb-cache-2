40|$|The {{core part}} of the major {{education}} reform in Hong Kong was {{the introduction of a}} normative 4 -years undergraduate curriculum and for some-disciplines a school based admission (SBA) system in 2012. With students one year younger and having just completed a new secondary school curriculum, significant challenges were anticipated at the university level to enable a smooth transition from secondary school to university, and this has well proven to be problematic. On the other hand, accrediting bodies for engineering qualifications, including the Washington Accord, have recently developed a set of graduate attributes and professional competencies for the next generation Engineers, with considerable emphasis on Engineering leadership, teamwork and communication. A "two birds one stone" solution is introduced in this paper. While the need for an effective academic advising and mentoring system for first-year students is distinct, a large-scale <b>intergenerational,</b> multi-dimensional <b>learning</b> community framework has been developed, within the School of Engineering of HKUST, as a platform for the creation and execution of "serve and learn" types of transformative learning.

40|$|Mind the Gap is {{a family}} {{learning}} project aiming to facilitate <b>intergenerational</b> engagement with <b>learning</b> in schools through the vehicle of a stop-motion animation project. 1 Implicit in the animation process is reflective and strategic thinking that helps to make {{the process of learning}} explicit (Learning to Learn: Wall et al.). The animation project takes place in school and targets Year 4 children (aged 8 and 9 [*]years old) and their dads/male guardians. The project is accompanied by staff development in school to promote the same Learning to Learn approaches across curriculum and home/school boundaries. A team of researchers at Durham University is engaged in two projects: first, developing better understanding of the intervention elements and, second, evaluating the impact. This article will focus on data arising from the former and will explore the space for family learning created in the project. We propose that the context of an inherently challenging animation project, which includes schools, parents and children working together in new ways to learn new skills associated with information technology and creative story making, increases the likelihood of dialogue about learning.

40|$|The role of artistry in {{transformative}} {{maintenance of}} law and custom is a theme widely researched and discussed in Aboriginal arts related literature. However, it is {{the aim of this}} paper to contribute to a wider discourse about learning and economic participation in remote Australia, and in particular the role of multimodality as a significant asset. The paper draws from relevant literature and two case studies; one from Keringke Arts, and one from Eastern Arrernte teacher and artist, Kathleen Kemarre Wallace. In customary form, multimodality combines and recombines various modalities — including dance, song, sand drawing, body painting and design, storytelling, stories, rhythm, petroglyph and ochre-painted rock art — enabling the <b>intergenerational</b> teaching and <b>learning</b> of rich cultural heritage in ways which connect that experience to the law and custom of the homelands. Multimodality, as it is used in this paper, draws on the concept of ‘form-relationality’; the way various modalities are combined and recombined, as elements which together describe a body of knowledge and yet separately provide myriad detail. Although {{beyond the scope of this}} paper, multimodality is also a mediating influence between contemporary and customary elements and contexts.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} towards understanding how entrepreneurial learning might be understood as being socially situated, embedded in everyday practice in the context of family business. The study is framed by three main principles drawn from situated learning theory. First, the family and the business are examined as overlapping communities of practice, as sites of practice‐based knowledge. Second, the concept of legitimate peripheral participation is explored in relation to members of the family business. Finally, how practice is both reproduced and transformed over time is examined in the context of two generations' participation in a family business. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on an empirical study of two generations from five families, the founders of a business and their successors. The interview approach adopted phenomenological techniques. A thematic analysis identified conceptual frameworks to make sense of the data in a “quasi grounded” approach. Finally, the three main principles introduced from situated learning theory – communities of practice, legitimate peripheral participation, and cycles of reproduction and transformation provided a conceptual framework to analyse the empirical material. Research limitations/implications – This is an interpretive, qualitative study based on a small sample of families based in the North West of England. The findings are not intended to be generalised to a population, but to offer empirical insights that extend theoretical frameworks in order to better understand the entrepreneurial phenomenon. Practical implications – The experience of the second generation both in the family business and in overlapping contexts of learning‐in‐practice brings innovation and change as well as continuity. The study also suggests that the complex process of succession might be informed by the understanding of the importance of the nature and extent of participation in the family business over time. Originality/value – This paper introduces conceptual frameworks that capture the social complexity of <b>intergenerational</b> entrepreneurial <b>learning</b> and contributes an empirical illustration of situated learning theory within the context of family business. The situated learning perspective contrasts with much of the existing entrepreneurial learning literature, which has tended to focus on “the entrepreneur” and individual learning processes.

30|$|Play is an {{activity}} “mediated by tools and artifacts {{as well as}} symbolic systems such as language” (Black & Reich, 2011, p. 53). It is also a common means for grandparents and grandchildren to build relationships, enjoy each other’s company, learn together, resolve problems collaboratively, and get close through mutual encouragement (Zhang & Kaufman, 2016 a). Today, many younger people and older adults have integrated digital games into their daily leisure activities (De Schutter & Malliet, 2014). In 2015, 26 % of game players in America were aged 50 and over (ESA, 2016). Kun (2015) recruited 354 older adults who played World of Warcraft (an online digital game) through a Web survey, and 6.2 % of respondents were in {{the age group of}} 80 and older. Intergenerational digital gameplay creates a natural context for common goals, cooperation, and equal status that are key factors for intergenerational interaction (Chua et al., 2013). Zhang and Kaufman’s (2016 a) review study identified 11 digital games developed to facilitate <b>intergenerational</b> interaction and <b>learning,</b> such as Distributed Hide-and-Seek (Vetere, Nolan, & Raman, 2006), Curball (Kern, Stringer, Fitzpatrick, & Schmidt, 2006), TranseCare (Derboven, Van Gils, & De Grooff, 2011), Age Invaders (Khoo, Cheok, Nguyen, & Pan, 2008), etc. Digital games can transcend the dimensions of time, space, and close personal relationships and allow players to practice intergenerational skills in a safe environment (Ypsilanti et al., 2014). In addition, there are tremendous empirical findings showing that playing digital games can improve older adults’ physical and cognitive function (Zhang & Kaufman, 2016 b) and enhance the quality of their socio-emotional life (Schell, Hausknecht, Zhang, & Kaufman, 2016; Zhang & Kaufman, 2015).|$|R

In particular, no in-depth research has been undertaken evaluating the needs of senior people in the broader teaching, learning and research opportunities at third level. There was also a notable lack of a coherent theoretical framework. <b>Intergenerational</b> <b>Learning</b> initiatives are often perceived as peripheral to any substantial learning in Higher Education. This overlooks the potential engagement of senior and younger learners together in an <b>intergenerational</b> <b>learning</b> context. The tacit knowledge, expertise, wisdom and lived experiences of senior people is rarely transferred or handed down to third level students. The aim of this project is {{to address this issue}} by employing an innovative approach by using both third level and older learners who adapt the dual and equitable role of both tutors and students together. This aim was achieved by 1) researching the benefits of <b>intergenerational</b> <b>learning</b> as part of third level teaching, learning and research; by investigating the benefits of mentoring skills; and the benefits of having access to the lived experience and perspectives of older people.

40|$|Purpose Ageing {{is a very}} {{important}} societal problem that we are facing today. According to WHO, health refers to physical, mental and social well being while active ageing refers to the process of optimizing opportunities for health, social participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age [WHO, 2012]. Earlier research has shown that intelligent technologies can support elderly to cope with the changes of ageing and remain healthy and active (Blaschke et al., 2009). We recognise three important challenges when designing for healthy and active ageing using intelligent technologies. First, to what extend can we design for elderly technology acceptance? Second, How to design for and with elderly in this context to enable behaviour change? Lastly, ageing is a wicked problem. It requires a multi-stakeholder approach. How to design for and with the multi-stakeholder in this context? Through a number of design cases we aim at creating design guidelines for designing for healthy and active ageing with intelligent technologies. Method We conducted a number of design cases with specific focuses on the three identified challenges. In case 1 we explore the use of Senior Technology Acceptance Model especially social relationship [Chen and Chan, 2014] when designing for technology acceptance in our context. In case 2 we explore the use of the persuasive principle “reciprocity” [Chatterjee, Price, 2009] to design for and with elderly. In case 3 we explore the use of probes and co-creation approach to create a shared value among the involved stakeholders. Through qualita-tive analysis we derived some design guidelines for designing for healthy and active ageing using intelligent technologies Results 2 ̆ 6 amp; Discussion The design cases suggest that (social) participation is an important enabler for designers to work with when designing for healthy and active ageing using intelli-gent technologies. It can lead to better technology acceptance through <b>intergenerational</b> tech-nology <b>learning,</b> better motivation towards the intended behaviour change via reciprocal sup-port, and better aligned multi-stakeholder network via co-creation and probing.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of {{research}} into family violence has been around the ideas of <b>intergenerational</b> transmission of <b>learned</b> behaviours. We know {{a good deal about}} what constitutes risk for children, the outcomes of that risk and the processes that work to translate difficult childhoods into difficult adulthoods - for some children. We also all know children who seem to have 'weathered' the most appalling childhoods and to have emerged strong and resilient and who do not repeat the patterns of relating they experienced as children in their adult lives. It is this group that is the focus of the study. A purposively selected sample of eight, seven women and one man, with a range of backgrounds, was interviewed in depth using qualitative research methods informed by feminist standpoint theory. All of the eight had identified as having experienced significant violence as children, mainly in their families of origin. They also stated that they did not currently relate to their partners or children in violent ways, nor were they the victims of violent relationships. They consequently fell into the category of those who have "broken the cycle" of intergenerational abuse. Each person identified the things that helped them through their experiences and their reflections were then examined in more detail in the context of other studies on resilience. The interviews yielded an interesting array of findings which were consistent with literature which identifies certain attributes of the person and of their environment as protective. Findings are discussed with a view to their relevance to social work practice and policy. The list of protective factors may serve as an 'inventory' of potential resources for those working in the field of family violence. This study supports earlier work which challenges the idea of the inevitability of the intergenerational transmission of abuse, working instead from a paradigm which suggests that there are a multiplicity of 'resilience factors,' both integral to the individual and environmental, which interact in complex ways to enable many people to survive abuse and to relate in healthy ways in their adult lives...|$|R

Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion {{with the support of}} friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement. This model is based on evidence that the most resilient, adaptive, and effective learning involves individual interest as well as social support to overcome adversity and provide recognition. This report investigates how we can use new media to foster the growth and sustenance of environments that support connected learning in a broad-based and equitable way. This report also offers a design and reform agenda, grounded in a rich understanding of child development and learning, to promote and test connected learning theories. We begin with an analysis of current economic, social, and technical trends that frame the educational challenges faced by many countries, especially in the Global North [...] including the contraction of economic opportunity, growing inequity in access to educational and economic opportunity, and the risks and opportunities of media engagement. Connected learning addresses the gap between in-school and out-of-school <b>learning,</b> <b>intergenerational</b> disconnects, and new equity gaps arising from the privatization of learning. In doing so, connected learning taps the opportunities provided by digital media to more easily link home, school, community and peer contexts of learning; support peer and intergenerational connections based on shared interests; and create more connections with non-dominant youth, drawing from capacities of diverse communities. We also offer an approach to learning, design and program building that can expand the opportunities afforded by a changing media environment while minimizing the risks. Our approach draws on sociocultural learning theory in valuing learning that is embedded within meaningful practices and supportive relationships, and that recognizes diverse pathways and forms of knowledge and expertise. Our design model builds on this approach by focusing on supports and mechanisms for building environments that connect learning across the spheres of interests, peer culture, and academic life. We propose a set of design features that help build shared purpose, opportunities for production, and openly networked resources and infrastructure...|$|R

Looking to {{the policy of the}} European Union (EU), in particular to lifelong learning, we see how the notion for intergenerational and intercultural learning has been embedded more and more into policy. The question is if this makes sense, or better: how will it make sense? Senior education is transforming in <b>intergenerational</b> <b>learning</b> - <b>intergenerational</b> <b>learning</b> becomes more and more intercultural learning as well. Therefore lifelong learning should be intergenerational and intercultural learning...|$|E
