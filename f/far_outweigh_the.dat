25|$|Trees {{should not}} be labeled as polluters because their total {{benefits}} on air quality and emissions reduction <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions will occur at higher temperatures. In desert climates, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, {{the best way to}} slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, {{the most effective way to}} lower temperatures is with an increased canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{mortality}} rates for females in child-bearing age groups {{were higher than}} for males at the same age. This {{is no longer the}} case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more tobacco, alcohol and drugs than women in most societies, {{and are more likely to}} die from many associated diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as occupational, war or car accidents) or intentional (suicide). Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease. These <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|Studies from China, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom {{show that}} regular cyclists live longer because {{the health effects}} <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> risk of crashes. A {{reduction}} in the number of cyclists is likely to harm the health of the population more than any possible protection from injury. UK figures show that it takes at least 8000 years of average cycling to produce one clinically severe head injury and 22,000 years for one death. De Jong developed a mathematical model to evaluate the health-risk trade-offs of all-age mandatory helmet laws, if they were to be introduced in various North American and Western European countries. He concluded that helmet laws appear to offer net health benefit only in those countries with more dangerous bicycling environments under optimistic assumptions of the efficacy of helmets. Newbold suggested improvements to the De Jong model, and, using published cycling statistics for the United States in his revised model, found that mandatory bicycle helmet laws would seem to have positive net public health benefits there. However, Newbold stressed that there were many parameters to these models which require further research to properly quantitate, and that results should be considered provisional rather than definitive.|$|E

500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> benefits.

The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the American Indian Movement stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us.

500|$|Criticism of {{the style}} of the book has {{centered}} on its political aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as [...] "didactic", and the novel was derided for [...] "exposition [...] inserted in large indigestible chunks". Author Ken MacLeod's 2003 analysis of the political nature of Starship Troopers stated that it was [...] "a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> thin and tensionless combat scenes". Scientist and author John Brunner compared it to a [...] "Victorian children's book", while the Science Fiction Handbook published in 2009 said that the novel provided [...] "compelling images of a futuristic military" [...] and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Anthony Boucher, founder of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had [...] "forgotten to insert a story". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem [...] "vibrantly appealing".|$|E

[...] Robert Stack {{provided}} the Treasury position that [...] "Treasury and the IRS have designed our regulations {{in a way}} that minimizes administrative burdens and related costs." [...] Estimates of the additional revenue raised seemed to be heavily outweighed by the cost of implementing the legislation. In March 2012 the Association of Certified Financial Crime Specialists (ACFCS) said FATCA was expected to raise revenues of approximately US$800 million per year for the US Treasury with the costs of implementation more difficult to estimate. ACFCS claimed it was extremely likely that the cost of implementing FATCA, [...] borne by the FFIs, would <b>far</b> <b>outweigh</b> <b>the</b> revenues raised by the U.S. Treasury, even excluding the additional costs to the US Internal Revenue Service for the staffing and resources needed to process the data produced. Contrary to established congressional practice, FATCA was not subject to a cost/benefit analysis by the Committee on Ways and Means. Perhaps not considered by Congress, the cost to the global financial institutions to implement FATCA has been reported to range from Forbes's estimate of US$8 billion a year (approximately ten times the amount of estimated revenue raised), to US$200 billion (based on per capita costs for Australia and the UK), to 1-2 trillion USD (chapter of the Chamber of Commerce).|$|E
