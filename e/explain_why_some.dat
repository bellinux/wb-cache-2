It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

25|$|Also, the {{so-called}} neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintained that Piaget's theory {{does not do}} justice either to the underlying mechanisms of information processing that explain transition from stage to stage or individual differences in cognitive development. According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as speed of processing and working memory, are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> individuals develop faster than other individuals (Demetriou, 1998).|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} {{hypotheses}} contended that dark skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although {{it is true}} that eumelanin has antibacterial properties, its importance is secondary as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is not consistent with the evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests. Humans living in hot and sunny environments have darker skin than humans who live in wet and cloudy environments. The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> populations (like the Inuit or Tibetans) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR have darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.|$|E

25|$|The oldest characiform is Santanichthys of {{the early}} Cretaceous (Albian stage) of Brazil. While all extant species are freshwater, this species was {{probably}} either brackish or marine. Many other fossils are also known. Characiformes likely first diversified during the Cretaceous period, though fossils are poorly known. During the Cretaceous period, the rift between South America and Africa would be forming; this may explain the contrast in diversity between the two continents. Their low diversity in Africa may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> primitive fish families and Cypriniformes coexist with them while they are absent in South America, where these fish may have been driven extinct. The characiforms had not spread into Africa soon enough to also reach the land bridge between Africa and Asia. The earliest they could have spread into Central America was the late Miocene.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} distribution of springtail species {{is affected by}} environmental factors which act at the landscape scale, such as soil acidity, moisture and light. Requirements for pH can be reconstructed experimentally. Altitudinal changes in species distribution can be at least partly explained by increased acidity at higher elevation. Moisture requirements, among other ecological and behavioural factors, <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> species cannot live aboveground, or retreat in the soil during dry seasons, but also why some epigeal springtails are always found {{in the vicinity of}} ponds and lakes, such as the hygrophilous Isotomurus palustris. Adaptive features, such as the presence of a fan-like wettable mucro, allow some species to move at the surface of water (Sminthurides aquaticus, Sminthurides malmgreni). Podura aquatica, a unique representative of the family Poduridae (and one of the first springtails to have been described by Linnaeus), spends its entire life at the surface of water, its wettable eggs dropping in water until the non-wettable first instar hatches then surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most {{probable}} interpretation {{is that the}} Mugharrarin reached the Sargasso Sea, {{a part of the}} ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda yet one thousand miles away from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the Mugharrarin presumably met some Guanche tribe. This would <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> of them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) and why they were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.|$|E

25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of unchanged drug in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The terminal half-life in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in synovial fluid is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in synovial fluid 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short plasma half-life. The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E
500|$|In the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas {{regarded}} conscience as {{the application}} of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13). [...] Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with synderesis, the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of Natural Law) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles. According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or conscientia was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the natural law (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (Summa Theologiae, I–II, I). Aquinas also discussed conscience {{in relation to the}} virtue of prudence to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>some</b> people appear to be less [...] "morally enlightened" [...] than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.|$|E
