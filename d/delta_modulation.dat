40|$|Analog and mixed-signal {{testing is}} far more complex than its digital equivalent. This thesis will {{identify}} the analog test requirements through an extensive analysis of integrated circuit testing, possible error sources, and the different levels of test hierarchy. The results will show that analog testing requires spectrally pure, high-quality predictable test signals. These signals are most robust when reproduced through digital techniques such as direct digital frequency synthesis. Delta-sigma ($ <b>Delta</b> Sigma$) <b>modulation</b> {{is perhaps the most}} versatile technique, as it can precisely encode arbitrary analog waveforms into a pulse-density modulated (PDM), infinite-length, single bit-wide pattern. The noise-shaping characteristics of the $ Delta Sigma$ modulator also allow for simple reconstruction of the embedded signal. Unfortunately, on-chip signal generation using this method is currently hindered by the high area overhead and limited programmability of $ <b>Delta</b> Sigma$ <b>modulation</b> oscillators. We will introduce the concept of forcing the PDM pattern to be finite in length and thus periodic. Although other periodic encoding algorithms exist, forced-periodic PDM patterns will be shown to be far superior for their precise control over signal amplitude, frequency, phase, and also for their ability to encode an arbitrary waveform. Its effectiveness will be demonstrated with several experiments of single- and multi-tone waveforms of varying degrees of complexity. By creating a fixed-length pattern, we can take advantage of many common digital built-in self-test (BIST) concepts such as scan and RAMBIST, found on most digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, to supply the necessary hardware. We will show how analog signal generation can be integrated into digital ICs using any or all of the IEEE 1149. 1 - 1990 standard, embedded RAMs, and scan chains. These applications will indeed prove that with very little additional hardware, on-chip, high-quality analog signal gen...|$|R

50|$|In a {{conventional}} ADC, an analog signal is integrated, or sampled, with a sampling frequency and subsequently quantized in a multi-level quantizer into a digital signal.

The {{first step in}} a delta-sigma modulation is <b>delta</b> <b>modulation.</b> In <b>delta</b> <b>modulation</b> the change in the signal (its delta) is encoded, rather than the absolute value. The result is a stream of pulses, as opposed to a stream of numbers {{as is the case with}} PCM. In delta-sigma modulation, the accuracy of the modulation is improved by passing the digital output through a 1-bit DAC and adding (sigma) the resulting analog signal, to the input signal (the signal before <b>delta</b> <b>modulation),</b> thereby reducing the error introduced by the delta-modulation.|$|E

40|$|Time-interleaved delta-sigma (<b>Delta</b> Sigma) <b>modulation</b> digital-to-analog {{converters}} (TIDSM DACs) {{have the}} potential for a wideband operation. The performance of a two-channel interleaved Delta Sigma DAC is very sensitive to the duty cycle of the half-rate clock. This brief presents a closed-form expression for the signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR) loss of such DACs due to a duty-cycle error for modulators with a noise transfer function of (1 - z(- 1)) (n). Adding a low-order finite-impulse-response filter after the modulator helps to mitigate this problem. A closed-form expression for the SNDR loss in the presence of this filter is also developed. These expressions are useful for choosing a suitable modulator and filter order for an interleaved Delta Sigma DAC in the early stage of the design process.

40|$|An analog-to-digital {{conversion}} (ADC) {{scheme based on}} asynchronous <b>Delta</b> Sigma <b>modulation</b> and time-to-digital conversion is presented. An asynchronous Delta Sigma modulator translates the analog input to an asynchronous duty-cycle modulated signal. Next, the edge locations are digitally measured using a time-to-digital converter (TDC). This information is then digitally processed into a conventional digital signal. The performance of this novel ADC scheme is theoretically analyzed and verified with simulations. With the proposed digital demodulation algorithm, 11 -bit resolution can be obtained with an overcycling ratio (OCR) of only four, which is suitable for high bandwidth applications such as very high bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL). When a higher OCR can be tolerated, a gated ring-oscillator (GRO) TDC with an inherent first-order noise shaping property is suggested in combination with a digital continuous-time moving-average (CTMA) filter. This allows for resolutions in excess of 13 bits, which is suitable for ADSL 2 +. The proposed technique shifts the complexity toward the digital domain, leading to more compact ADC and reduced power consumption, and is, therefore, particularly suited for ADC in ultralow-voltage nanometer technologies that are used for high-speed data communication applications. status: publishe...|$|R
