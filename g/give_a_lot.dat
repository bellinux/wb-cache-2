25|$|There {{have been}} few shrewder captains than Ian Chappell, {{who knew how to}} squeeze the last drop out of any {{situation}} that might help give his team an advantage. He was an absolute master at putting pressure on the opposition with just the right run rate or with a field that could be almost impossible to pierce... Some of his tactics were quite intimidatory and stank of out-and-out gamesmanship that made old pros like me wince. It was an open secret that he used to encourage his players to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of verbal abuse to rival batsman when they were at the wicket in an attempt to break their concentration.|$|E

But I will tell you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They were smart about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

500|$|The National Wildlife Federation {{described}} her as [...] "a passionate, articulate, and tireless {{voice for the}} environment". Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her, saying, [...] "She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be, and she didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of credibility to excuses about why they're not like that. She would give these wonderful, curmudgeonly speeches to {{which there was no}} response. You can't holler back to grandmotherly scolding. All you can do is shuffle your feet and say, 'Yes, Ma'am.'" [...] She was aware of it; she was reported saying, [...] "People can't be rude to me, this poor little old woman. But I can be rude to them, poor darlings, and nobody can stop me." [...] Her ashes were scattered over the [...] of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park.|$|E
500|$|Allen and May's {{first series}} in control {{resulted}} in a 3–2 win over South Africa. In 1956, the Australians toured England. The home team won the five-match series 2–1. The selectors made several important decisions throughout the series. In the third Test, Allen pushed {{for the inclusion of}} Cyril Washbrook, who was then 41 years old and had not played a Test for five years. The decision was controversial, and Quelch suggests that, with the series in the balance after England lost the second Test, Allen was feeling the pressure. He was also criticised in the press by Bill Bowes, a former England teammate, for forcing one of the England team, Fred Trueman, to bowl at a handkerchief during practice before the match, in an attempt to improve his accuracy. The incident took place before a large crowd; although Trueman kept his counsel at the time, he felt humiliated and believed that Allen and the Establishment intended to keep him in his place. Washbrook scored 98, and England won the match. In the fourth game, David Sheppard, who had barely played in 1956, was selected and scored a century, and in the final Test Denis Compton was recalled after a long-term injury and scored 94. The Wisden editor Norman Preston judged the selectors to have done a good job that season, making choices with which critics disagreed. He wrote: [...] "I think it is appropriate, therefore, that tribute be paid to [...] for the time and patience they devoted to their task last summer. Nothing was too much trouble for them." [...] Allen was involved in one controversial episode, when the Australians accused him and other selectors of arranging for the pitches during the Test matches to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of assistance to spin bowlers, which led to Laker's extraordinary success in the series. Allen denied any involvement. During the winter, Allen was part of an advisory group which looked for ways to revitalise county cricket.|$|E

2500|$|After making {{just one}} {{substitute}} appearance for Stevenage, Madjo joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November 2011. He aimed to [...] "prove himself" [...] at the club, having previously had a trial at Vale Park {{before he turned}} professional at Bristol City in 2005. He made his debut for the club a day after signing, playing 80 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United; he was praised for his performance despite being 'rusty' and short of match fitness. In his second appearance for the club, he scored only his fourth league goal in the Football League, as he [...] "displayed quick feet, an assured touch and deadly instincts in front of goal" [...] to net the winning goal of a 2–1 victory at Dagenham & Redbridge. He dedicated the goal to coach Geoff Horsfield, after the pair spent many hours on the training ground working on Madjo's finishing skills. For his performance, Madjo was named on the League Two Team of the Week. He scored a 60-minute hat-trick in his third appearance for the club, a 4–0 home win over Aldershot Town; despite this he stated that [...] "I didn't play that well in the first half. I feel I can <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more." [...] For this achievement he was named on the League Two Team of the Week for a second time. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored four goals in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
