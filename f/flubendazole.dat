50|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of broad-spectrum {{anthelmintics}} in the 1960’s, treatment of worm infections in pigs has become increasingly reliant on mass-treatment with anthelmintic drugs. When selecting a drug for the control of helminth infections, several things need to be taken into account. Namely, 1) the margin of safety of the used compound, 2) the efficacy of compound against the different stages of the parasite, 3) the spectrum of activity, 4) the mode of administration and last but not least, 5) the cost of the drug. All of the modern anthelmintics are found to be very safe. Treatments with doses exceeding several times the recommended dose could not show any clinical effect in pigs. For the effective control of helminth infections on a pig farm it is advantageous to select an anthelminticum that kills the larval stages and has a broad spectrum of activity. The drugs pyrantel, fenbendazole, <b>flubendazole</b> and levamisole also have shown activity against migrating stages of A. suum (Kennedy et al., 1987; Oakley, 1974; Stewart et al., 1984; Thienpont et al., 1978). Piperazine and pyrantel have restricted activity against the other common porcine nematode infections (Trichuris suis & Oesophagostomum spp.) (Rochette, 1985) and are therefore not the drugs of choice when co-infections with these parasites are present on a farm. Anthelmintics of the macrocyclic lactone family (e.g. ivermectin, doramectin) have a significantly longer residual effect in comparison with the other anthelmintics. Lichtensteiger et al., (1999) reported that the anthelmintic activity of ivermectin persisted for less than 7 days and over 7, but less than 14 days for doramectin. Moreover, these compounds are also highly efficient against ectoparasites like mange mites (Sarcoptes scabiei var suis) and hog lice (Haematopinus suis) (Lee et al., 1980; Lichtensteiger et al., 1999; Logan et al., 1996; Stewart et al., 1981b; Yazwinski et al., 1997).Anthelmintics are available in a variety of formulations. Administration of the drug in either water or feed is the easiest and most economical way, but has the disadvantage of variable dosages being delivered when numbers of pigs are being treated in groups from a single source of medication. Delivery by injection on the other hand, is more accurate in dosage but is time- and labour intensive, which adds to the overall cost of treatment. Injectable anthelmintics have a significantly longer withdrawal period (a minimum of 28 days for doramectin) in comparison with in-feed formulations and are usually conserved for the treatment of the breeding stock (Conder and Baker, 2002). The overall cost of anthelmintic treatment will vary, depending on the choice of anthelmintic, number of treatments, and weight of the animals being treated. In general, for the choice of anthelmintic, pig farmers will base themselves on information received from their veterinarians or feed companies and more importantly, on their previous experiences with a selected anthelmintic (Theodoropoulos et al., 2001). To date, no studies have reported anthelminticum resistance in A. suum in pigs. Whether anthelmintic resistance would be easily induced in A. suum is unknown. However, the development of anthelmintic resistance in Oesophagostomum spp. and in the closely related horse parasite, Parascaris equorum (Boersema et al., 2002; Laugier et al., 2012; Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999; Nareaho et al., 2011) suggests that continued malpractice in this area might eventually lead to anthelmintic resistance in A. suum.|$|E

Biotransformation of benzimidazoles was determined in in vitro and ex vivo experiments. <b>Flubendazole</b> and mebendazole were metabolized in much greater extent than albendazole. The activity of antioxidative enzymes, which also can participate in drug biotransformation, was detected mainly in the cytosol. Neither cytochromes P 450 nor flavin-containing monooxygenases were detected. Reductive enzymes were determined by means of specific [...] ...|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: Biotransformation of <b>flubendazole</b> and {{albendazole}} {{in plant}} cells Benzimidazole anthelmintics, the drugs against parasitic worms, {{are widely used}} in human {{as well as in}} veterinary medicine. Following excretion, these substances may persist in the environment and impact non-target organisms. Phytoremediation might be a suitable method for elimination of anthelmintics from the environment. In order to test detoxification abilities of plants, biotransformation pathways of albendazole (ABZ) and <b>flubendazole</b> (FLU) were studied in reed (Phragmites australis) in vitro. It was found that reed cells were able to uptake and biotransform both anthelmintics. These drugs did not significantly affect viability of the reed cells. Using HPLC/MS 10 ABZ metabolites and 5 FLU metabolites were found. Some atypical biotransformation metabolites (glucosylglucosides, acetylglucosides and xylosylglucosides), which have not been previously reported were identified. Based on the obtained results, the schemes of metabolic pathways of ABZ and FLU in reed were proposed. The amount of main metabolites (reduced FLU, ABZ-sulfoxide, [...] ...|$|E

Veronika Srpová Consultant: Ing. Barbora Szotáková, Ph. D. Title: The {{effect of}} dicrocoeliosis on {{biotransformation}} of anthelmintics in mouflon Parasitic infections can modify the host's ability to metabolize drugs and other xenobiotics by altering the biotransformation enzymes. These changes may have various pharmacological, toxicological or physiological consequences. In our study, in vitro metabolism of albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide and <b>flubendazole</b> was tested and compared in non-infected mouflons and in mouflons infected by lancet fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum). Two groups of 5 - 7 years old mouflon ewes (Ovis musimon) {{were used for}} our study. Animals in the first group were parasitologically negative and the second group consisted of fluke positive animals. Subcellular fractions of liver homogenates from non-infected and Dicrocoelium-infected mouflons were isolated. The hepatic microsomal and cytosolic fractions were incubated with albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide or <b>flubendazole.</b> The anthelmintics and their metabolites were analyzed using HPLC.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>flubendazole</b> (FLU) therapy on in vitro FLU {{biotransformation}} and {{the activities of}} selected biotransformation en-zymes were investigated in male and female lambs. Four experimental groups were used: control (untreated) ewes and rams and FLU-treated ewes and rams (orally, 15 mg/kg per day, for three consecutive days). Subcellular fractions were prepared from liver and intestinal mucosa 24 h after the final dosage was administered. Activities of cytochromes P 450 (CYP), flavine mono-oxygenases (FMO), carbonyl reducing enzymes, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) and glutathione S-transferase were tested. Significant gender differences were observed for FMO-mediated activity (2 -fold higher in ram lambs) and UGT activity (up to 30 % higher in ewe lambs), but no gender differences were observed in FLU metabolism. FLU-treatment of lambs moderately changed the activities of some CYPs, FMO, and UGT in liver microsomes. In vitro FLU reduction was not altered in the liver, but was slightly higher in the small intestine of FLU pre-treated lambs. This correlated with the higher carbonyl reductase activities measured in the gut mucosa of these animals. Key words: <b>flubendazole,</b> ruminants, sheep, drug metabolism, anthelmintic...|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: HPLC Determination of Benzimidazoles In this thesis we {{have investigated the}} possibility of establishing benzimidazole with HILIC chromatography using a chromatographic column Ascentis Express HILIC 10. 0 cm x 3. 0 mm; 2. 7 microns. Two groups of benzimidazoles were tested. The first one was focused on albendazole and its metabolites. Experiments with these substances did not produce satisfactory results, because the mobile phase composition which enables separation of the studied analytes was not found. The second group was formed by <b>flubendazole</b> and its reduced and hydrolyzed form. In this case, several mobile phase compositions were tested. Finally, distribution of individual analytes in a mixture, using a mobile phase ACN:HCOOH 0. 03 mol/l (90 : 10), was successfully achieved. Ricobendazol was chosen as an internal standard. When separation conditions were found, calibration curve for the determination of reduced <b>flubendazole</b> in biological samples was subsequently constructed using ricobendazol as the internal standard {{with the use of}} fluorescence detection.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis summarises {{the experience with}} the use of selected anthelmintics against both mouflon muelleriosis and dicrocoeliosis. All experimental studies were carried out in the game enclosure of Vlkov, Czech Republic in 1996 - 2003. Anthelmintics were administered orally and the intensity of the infection was evaluated. Intra-vital diagnostics were carried out {{with the use of}} coprological methods (modified Breza method, modified Baermann method), post-mortem diagnostics on the basis of helminthological organ control (lungs, liver). A long-term effect of repeatedly administered anthelmintics on the actual parasitostatus of the mouflon population was monitored. Two benzimidazoles (<b>flubendazole,</b> albendazole) were tested; both anthelmintics adminitered in the form of medicated feed were found as high effective against muelleriosis, a lower effectivity was determined against dicrocoeliosis. Albendazole was highly effective against dicrocoeliosis after individual administration {{in the form of an}} oral suspension. Closantel in combination with <b>flubendazole</b> (medicated feed was used only) reached a minimal effect against dicrocoeliosis. The total state of the studied parasitoses in the treated mouflon herd has an improving character namely in muelleriosis.

Title of a thesis: <b>Flubendazole</b> {{influence}} on breast cells proliferation and activity of acenaphthenol dehydrogenases This thesis investigates {{the effect of}} <b>flubendazole</b> (FLU) on the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 and nonmalignant breast line MCF- 10 A. The anthelmintic drug FLU is widely used for treatment cestodoses and nematodoses. The mechanism of FLU's effect against nematodes and cestodes is disruption of the cytoplasmic system of microtubules. In 2010 it was found out that FLU disrupts the microtubules of tumor cells and significantly inhibits the proliferation of leukemia and myeloma cells. The main aim {{of this paper was}} to determine whether FLU also inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells. Another objective was to determine whether FLU interferes with the synthesis of estradiol, because this active estrogen {{plays an important role in}} the development of breast cancer.
