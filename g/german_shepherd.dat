5|$|B ^ The <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Dog breed {{was renamed}} in the UK by The Kennel Club in 1919 to Alsatian Wolf Dog. During the 1920s, the Wolf Dog {{part of the}} name fell out of use and dogs of this breed were simply known as Alsatians. The name had been reverted in most {{countries}} by 1977 to <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Dog.|$|E

50|$|Currently, the ROC Air Force is {{considering}} the Formosan Dog for military purposes. At {{this time the}} ROC Air Force is using <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> for security, but <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> have some downsides. For instance, it was often found that <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> who perform intensive security duties {{on a daily basis}} will suffer from serious bruising on their paws. Furthermore, they found that many German Shepherds' guarding mechanism towards strangers was not quite at the desired sensitivity. In many cases, strangers will need to get close for the dog to react. These factors caused the ROC Air Force to look to replace <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Labrador Retrievers {{have proven}} {{to have a high}} success rate at {{becoming}} guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds)</b> trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|R

50|$|<b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> are {{a popular}} {{selection}} {{for use as}} working dogs. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally thousands of <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> {{have been used by}} the military. Usually trained for scout duty, they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards. <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs. A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.|$|R
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, Alexander {{was injured}} while {{walking through the}} grounds of the Tatoi estate. A {{domestic}} Barbary macaque belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Dog, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not cauterized. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.|$|E
50|$|Well-trained and socialized <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> have a {{reputation}} of being very safe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that nearly 4.5 {{million people in the}} United States are bitten by dogs each year, but bully breeds are less often to blame than many other breeds, including chow chows and <b>German</b> <b>shepherds.</b> However, while an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales, once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of GSD attacks drops to 38th while Pit Bull Terriers are the most likely to attack when popularity is taken into account.|$|R

50|$|<b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> are {{moderately}} active {{dogs and}} {{are described in}} breed standards as self-assured. The breed {{is marked by a}} willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become over-protective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers. <b>German</b> <b>Shepherds</b> are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as being protective of their owners.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in dogs diagnosed with chronic superficial keratitis (CSK). The study was performed on 25 <b>German</b> <b>shepherds</b> (14 males and 11 females, aged between 3 and 11 years). The VEGF levels were determined in blood serum using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Quantikine Canine VEGF Immunoassay, R&D Systems). The test group of affected <b>German</b> <b>shepherds</b> was subdivided into two subgroups, based on the area of corneal neovascularisation. The first subgroup (9 patients) comprised dogs with neovascularisation observed in 1 to 2 quadrants of the right and left cornea, while the second subgroup (16 patients) comprised dogs with neovascularisation observed in 3 to 4 quadrants of the right and left cornea. The control group comprised 12 clinically healthy <b>German</b> <b>shepherds</b> (7 males and 5 females, aged between 3 and 9 years). The results were then statistically analysed by the Mann-Whitney test. The study indicated that the median serum VEGF concentration in healthy dogs was 14. 9 pg/mL. The VEGF level observed in sick <b>German</b> <b>shepherds</b> was elevated (19. 5 pg/mL) as compared to the values found in healthy dogs; however, a statistically significant increase in VEGF concentration, as compared to the values observed in healthy dogs, was only noted in the first subgroup, where the median VEGF concentration was 22. 0 pg/mL. Elevated serum VEGF concentration was observed in <b>German</b> <b>shepherds</b> diagnosed with CSK. A statistically significant increase in VEGF levels was observed in dogs in the first stage of the disease, i. e. the early stage of neovascularisation...|$|R
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|The Scottie and the <b>German</b> <b>Shepherd</b> are {{the only}} breeds of dog that {{have lived in the}} White House more than three times. President Franklin D.

Roosevelt had several Scotties before Fala, including one named Duffy and another named Mr. Duffy. Eleanor Roosevelt had a Scottish Terrier named Meggie when the family entered the White House in 1933. More recently, President George W.
