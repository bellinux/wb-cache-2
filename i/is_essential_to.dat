5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean {{algorithm is}} used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> many proofs of number theory.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme that <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the pathogen's survival is absent or {{very different in}} humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria. Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences {{in the structure of}} the ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|Copper <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{all living}} organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is}} a key {{constituent}} of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E
5|$|Efficiency <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{slowing the}} energy demand growth so that rising clean energy {{supplies}} can make {{deep cuts in}} fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the {{metabolism}} of all animals. It {{is a key}} constituent of cobalamin, {{also known}} as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound {{which can only be}} produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Food <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> life. Feeding {{more than}} seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the {{appropriation}} of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly {{when exposed to}} air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is {{the first and the}} prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but does show some antimicrobial activity.|$|E

Although {{it is not possible to}} woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots.|$|E
5|$|Manganese <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{iron and}} steel {{production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Mary Alice Young is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The character {{was created by}} television producer and screenwriter Marc Cherry and is portrayed by Brenda Strong, who also serves as the narrator of the series from beyond the grave; the character's suicide in the pilot episode served as the catalyst of the series. The narration provided by Mary Alice <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> the tale of Wisteria Lane, as the series revolves around her sharing the secrets of her friends and neighbors. Her narration technique is akin in style to Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915).|$|E

5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the power}} of a {{powerful}} substance known as aer, mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E
5|$|Water <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> {{a thermal}} power station, heated to create steam {{to turn the}} steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two {{licensed}} boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E
