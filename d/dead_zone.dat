25|$|The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> was {{expected}} to be renewed for a seventh season; however, due to low ratings and high production costs the series was canceled in December 2007, without a proper series finale.|$|E
50|$|Other marine <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> have {{appeared}} in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the largest}} <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> were those in {{northern}} Europe’s Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, which affects a $2.8 billion U.S. fish industry. Unfortunately, <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> rarely recover and usually grow in size. One {{of the few}} <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> to ever recover was in the Black Sea, which returned to normal fairly quickly {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in the 1990s due to a resulting reduction in fertilizer use.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Climate has a {{significant}} impact on the growth and decline of ecological <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b> During spring months, as rainfall increases, more nutrient-rich water flows down the mouth of the Mississippi River. At the same time, as sunlight increases during the spring, algal growth in the <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> increases dramatically. In fall months, tropical storms begin to enter the Gulf of Mexico and break up the <b>dead</b> <b>zones,</b> and the cycle repeats again in the spring.|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax {{legislation}} prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver. Recent popular series produced in Vancouver include The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone,</b> Smallville, Andromeda, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, The 4400, Sanctuary and the reimagined Battlestar Galactica.|$|E
25|$|The biggest culprit are {{rivers that}} empty into the ocean, {{and with it}} the many {{chemicals}} used as fertilizers in agriculture as well as waste from livestock and humans. An excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals in the water can lead to hypoxia {{and the creation of a}} <b>dead</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{major groups}} of algae are Cyanobacteria, green algae, Dinoflagellates, Coccolithophores and Diatom algae. Increase in input of {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom and this causes <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b> Cyanobacteria are no good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. Other algae are consumed and hence do not accumulate {{to the same extent}} as Cyanobacteria. <b>Dead</b> <b>zones</b> can be caused by natural and by anthropogenic factors. Use of chemical fertilizers is considered the major human-related cause of <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> around the world. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.|$|R
50|$|Areas where {{mobile phones}} cannot {{transmit}} {{to a nearby}} mobile site, base station, or repeater are known as <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b> In these areas, the mobile phone {{is said to be}} in a state of outage. <b>Dead</b> <b>zones</b> are usually areas where mobile phone service is not available because the signal between the handset and mobile site antennas is blocked or severely reduced, usually by hilly terrain, dense foliage, or physical distance.|$|R

25|$|The {{political}} <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> {{near the}} centre of the sea is also the focus of a mounting dispute between the United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark. It is significant for the global energy market because it may hold 25% or more of the world's undiscovered oil and gas resources.|$|E
25|$|Hall diversified his {{roles to}} avoid {{becoming}} typecast as his geek persona, joining the cast of Saturday Night Live (1985–1986) and starring in films such as Out of Bounds (1986), Johnny Be Good (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft's Bill Gates in the 1999 television film Pirates of Silicon Valley. He had the {{leading role in the}} USA Network series The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> from 2002 to 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{installment}} featured several guest stars. Kirsten Nelson, Sage Brocklebank, and Liam James all reprised {{their roles}} as the reoccurring characters police chief Karen Vick, officer Buzz McNab, and Young Shawn Spencer, respectively. Nico McEown played the young bully in the flashback introduction, Tracy Trueman played Robert Dunn's ex-girlfriend Amy, and John Dadey acted as the murdered Dr. Blinn. The episode's main guest star was Frank Whaley, who played Robert/Regina/Martin. Whaley had been an actor on NCIS and The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> before his role on the episode, and was described as an actor who fades into the background.|$|E

50|$|Cel-Fi is a device, {{similar to}} a {{cellular}} repeater, designed to eliminate in-building <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> and improve indoor mobile phone reception.|$|R
30|$|Reducing the FAP {{transmit}} power from 20 to 10 dBm reduces the <b>dead</b> <b>zones</b> from 20 to 12 % of ground floor.|$|R
25|$|Walken's {{first film}} of the 1980s was the {{controversial}} Heaven's Gate, directed by Cimino of Deer Hunter fame. Walken also starred in the 1981 action adventure The Dogs of War, directed by John Irvin. He surprised many critics and filmgoers with his intricate tap-dancing striptease in Herbert Ross's musical Pennies from Heaven (1981). In 1982, he played a socially awkward but gifted theater actor in the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s short story Who Am I This Time? opposite Susan Sarandon. Walken then played schoolteacher-turned-psychic Johnny Smith in David Cronenberg's 1983 adaptation of Stephen King's The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone.</b> That same year, Walken also starred in Brainstorm alongside Natalie Wood and (in a minor role) his wife, Georgianne.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} abruptly {{went into}} a 30 through 40 degree left bank. Geib initially believed that an engine failure had occurred. Hanson re-entered the cockpit, and continued to fly the aircraft by hand with Fagan. Geib declared an emergency and began a diversion to Anchorage. While trying to declare the emergency, the plane was in a communications <b>dead</b> <b>zone</b> between North America and Asia. Even with a weak signal, they contacted another Northwest Airlines flight, Flight 19, who helped Flight 85 declare the emergency since they were closer to Alaska. Flight 85's captain reported {{that none of the}} emergency procedures available could correct the problem. The pilots established a conference call with Northwest Airlines at the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and the Northwest employees there were unable to find a solution to the sudden bank. The flight crew took back control of the aircraft and landed at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. In order to steer the aircraft they had to use asymmetric engine thrust, or varying input into the engines; they were unable to use the ailerons at the time.|$|E
25|$|Since SG-1 {{ratings were}} good from a {{financial}} standpoint, the Sci Fi Channel picked up MGM's offer {{to continue the}} show into a sixth season, yet with a slightly reduced budget. Sci Fi aired new episodes of Stargate SG-1 in the 9 p.m. Friday slot between The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> and Farscape, while it aired older SG-1 episodes in a four-hour block every Monday at 7 p.m. Episodes were broadcast in US syndication six months after their premiere on Sci Fi. The sixth season {{was supposed to be}} the show's last, but Sci Fi renewed SG-1 at the last minute. The sixth and seventh seasons made Stargate SG-1 Sci Fi's highest-rated original series with an average of 2 million viewers in over 1.3 million households, elevating Sci Fi into the top 10 cable networks in the United States. For the next few years, the producers believed each current season to be the show's last and repeatedly wrote big series finales, but the success of Stargate SG-1 put off their plans of ending the show to write a new Stargate feature film. Sci Fi cut the length of an SG-1 season from 22 to 20 episodes from Season 8 onwards.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>zones</b> are hypoxic (low-oxygen) {{areas in}} the world's oceans and large lakes, caused by [...] "excessive {{nutrient}} pollution from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete the oxygen required to support most marine life in bottom and near-bottom water. (NOAA)". In the 1970s oceanographers began noting increased instances of <b>dead</b> <b>zones.</b> These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated.

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} features Otto Mann in a Partridge Family-like bus, {{while the}} chalkboard gag makes {{a reference to}} the film Inception. The Glee cast members sing a version of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] by the Beach Boys. Krusty the Clown had a Super Bowl [...] "nip slip", appeared on The Electric Company and was seen using a child as a human shield in a similar manner to the character Greg Stillson from The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone.</b> Lisa listens to This American Life, a public radio program voiced by Ira Glass. Also, Ethan and Kurt have a map of Middle Earth on the wall of their apartment. Krusty's comment that [...] "I ain't gonna play Sun City" [...] is a reference to Steven van Zandt's famous protest song.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin {{rated the}} film a [...] "BOMB" [...] {{in his book}} Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, and called it a [...] "Tiresome {{follow-up}} to Resident Evil that plays more like a remake." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a score of half a star out of four, saying: [...] "The movie is an utterly meaningless waste of time. There {{was no reason to}} produce it, except to make money, {{and there is no reason}} to see it, except to spend money. It is a <b>dead</b> <b>zone,</b> a film without interest, wit, imagination or even entertaining violence and special effects. [...] Parents: If you encounter teenagers who say they liked this movie, do not let them date your children." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1980 Donen {{made the}} science fiction film Saturn 3, {{starring}} Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel. Donen first {{read the script}} when its writer (and Movie Movies set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen [...] "only {{a tiny bit of}} what Barry shot ended up in the finished film." [...] It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen {{did not want to be}} credited as director. In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to [...] "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" [...] and that the script that they worked on together was [...] "very close to the script that David wound up making." ...|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone,</b> a.k.a. Stephen King's <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> (in USA) is an American/Canadian {{science fiction}} drama {{television}} series starring Anthony Michael Hall as Johnny Smith, who discovers {{he has developed}} psychic abilities after a coma. The show, credited as [...] "based on characters" [...] from Stephen King's 1979 novel of the same name, first aired in 2002, and was produced by Lionsgate Television and CBS Paramount Network Television (Paramount Network Television 2002-06) for the USA Network.|$|E
2500|$|Hall {{began his}} first regular series role in 2002, {{starring}} as Johnny Smith in USA Network's supernatural drama The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone,</b> a TV series adapted from Stephen King's best-selling novel.

The show debuted on June 16, 2002, and drew higher ratings for a premiere than any other cable series in television history with 6.4 million viewers. The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and Hall receiving strong reviews. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review wrote that [...] "Hall's Johnny flashes the qualities - comic timing, great facial expressions - {{that made him a}} star in the 1980s movies Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club." [...] The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone,</b> Hall said, [...] "has transformed my career." [...] The show proved to be one of USA Network's top shows and one of the highest-rated programs on basic cable.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Dead</b> <b>Zone</b> opening credits list Hall as co-{{producer}} (seasons 1-3), producer (seasons 5) and co-executive producer (season 6).
