40|$|This paper {{determines the}} <b>energy</b> {{consumption}} <b>ratio</b> and overall bio-energy production costs of microalgae cultivation, harvesting and conversion to secondary energy carriers, thus helping to clarify future perspectives of micro-algae production for energy purposes. A limitation growth model is developed, which determines {{the productivity of}} micro-algae for different climate profiles. Total direct and indirect <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratios</b> {{for the production of}} heat, fuels and electricity derived from micro-algae are calculated. Overall direct <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratio</b> for raceway ponds is 0. 06 for the optimal case, indirect <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratio</b> for that case is 0. 74. Direct <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratio</b> in horizontal tubular systems is 0. 32 for the optimal case, indirect <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratio</b> for that case is 117. The implementation of different improvement options could reduce the indirect <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratio</b> by fifty percent for both raceway ponds and horizontal tubular systems in the optimistic scenario. Prominent elements of the <b>energy</b> consumption <b>ratios</b> are carbon dioxide supply for raceway ponds and circulation power consumption for horizontal tubular systems. The lower end of fuel production cost calculated for raceway ponds is 136 € 2010 /GJ and 153 € 2010 /GJ for horizontal tubular systems (non-renewable gasoline and diesel is about 5 – 20 €/GJ). Considering possible improvement options overall bio-energy production costs could be reduced by one-fourth. Current results suggest that micro-algae cultivation is not suitable for dedicated bio-energy production in considered cultivation, harvesting and conversion options. Coproduction of bio-energy with high-value products are more viable, but is not considered in this research. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

(Such contrasts to chemical rockets where propulsive efficiency varies with the ratio of exhaust velocity to vehicle velocity at the time, but near maximum obtainable specific impulse tends to be a design goal when corresponding to the most energy released from reacting propellants). Although the specific impulse of an electric thruster itself optionally could range up to where mass drivers merge into particle accelerators with fractional-lightspeed exhaust velocity for tiny particles, trying to use extreme exhaust velocity to accelerate a far slower spacecraft could be suboptimally low thrust when the energy available from a spacecraft's reactor or power source is limited (a lesser analogue of feeding onboard power to a row of spotlights, photons being an example of an extremely low momentum to <b>energy</b> <b>ratio).</b>|$|E

The study&# 13; examined the effects of activation energies on the unsteady, steady and homogenous reactions of the&# 13; resulting energy equation and provided the numerical and exact solutions of the equations.

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen {{to be used as a}} fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H2), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the on-board storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H2 gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25-45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage efficiency. This method allows for a volume to <b>energy</b> <b>ratio</b> slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range.|$|E

It is found that there exist five basic waves in an infinite electro-microelastic solid, namely an independent longitudinal micro-rotational wave, two sets of coupled longitudinal waves influenced by the electric effect, and two sets of coupled transverse waves. The existence of the two sets of coupled longitudinal waves is new. In the absence of microstretch and electric effects, these two coupled longitudinal waves reduce to a longitudinal displacement wave of micropolar elasticity. Amplitude and <b>energy</b> <b>ratios</b> of various reflected and transmitted waves are presented when (i) a set of coupled longitudinal wave is made incident and (ii) a set of coupled transverse wave is made incident.
