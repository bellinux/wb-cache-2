40|$|For {{high-rise}} building <b>evacuations,</b> <b>travel</b> on stairs {{accounts for a}} large portion of the total egress time. Previous research has typically focused on the relationship between speed and density, with the results being relatively poor for predicting how long an individual requires to descend the stairs. In this dissertation, methods for measuring fundamental variables for determining speed and density are presented. The inverse of speed (normalized time) is shown to be more conservative for prediction methods. Furthermore, the interactions between individuals and flow units and the characteristics of individuals provide a deeper understanding of the flow dynamics and lead to more accurate predictions than relying on density alone. Rather than all of the occupants behaving in a uniform manner, flow units form where all of the occupants in them descend at the same rate. The first persons in flow units were found to be engaging in five different types of behavior that set the pace for their followers. There are also flow states identified that previous researchers have not identified. How occupants interacted with one another was also found to vary based on individual characteristics. The behavior of individuals was not random, but appeared to be based on variables like gender and exit lane. These characteristics, in turn, were found to influence their descent rate. These findings are then applied to a blind data set and the actual observations are accurately predicted. This allowed equations to be presented that are representative of the flow dynamics...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: There are {{two types}} of emergencies; those which can be {{anticipated}} and those that cannot. Among those that can be anticipated are such events as cyclones, floods, bush fires, and tsunamis. When such events are anticipated, one course of action that may be taken is the evacuation of residents from a threatened area. When evacuation takes place, there often remains a need to provide access for emergency vehicles and personnel to the threatened area creating a conflict between the needs to maximise capacity for evacuation, while continuing to provide access to the threatened area. Relatively little is known about when residents will decide to evacuate. A model of evacuation behaviour is needed that would predict the proportions of the population that would leave within certain time periods, thus leading to the development of an <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> demand model.

40|$|Large-scale {{disasters}} {{are constantly}} occurring around the world, {{and in many}} cases evacuation of regions of city is needed. ‘Operational Research/Management Science’ (OR/MS) has been widely used in emergency planning for over five decades. Warning dissemination, evacuee transportation and shelter management are three ‘Evacuation Support Functions’ (ESF) generic to many hazards. This thesis has adopted a case study approach to illustrate the importance of integrated approach of evacuation planning and particularly the role of OR/MS models. In the warning dissemination phase, uncertainty in the household’s behaviour as ‘warning informants’ has been investigated along with uncertainties in the warning system. An agentbased model (ABM) was developed for ESF- 1 with households as agents and ‘warning informants’ behaviour as the agent behaviour. The model was used to study warning dissemination effectiveness under various conditions of the official channel. In the transportation phase, uncertainties in the household’s behaviour such as departure time (a function of ESF- 1), means of transport and destination have been. Households could evacuate as pedestrians, using car or evacuation buses. An ABM was developed to study the evacuation performance (measured in <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> time). In this thesis, a holistic approach for planning the public evacuation shelters called ‘Shelter Information Management System’ (SIMS) has been developed. A generic allocation framework of was developed to available shelter capacity to the shelter demand by considering the <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> time. This was formulated using integer programming. In the sheltering phase, the uncertainty in household shelter choices (either nearest/allocated/convenient) has been studied for its impact on allocation policies using sensitivity analyses.

40|$|Abstract. Wildland {{firefighters are}} often {{called on to}} make {{tactical}} decisions under stressful conditions in order to suppress a fire. These decisions can be hindered by human factors such as insufficient knowledge of surroundings and conditions, lack of experience, overextension of resources or loss of situational awareness. One potential tool for assisting fire managers in situations where human factors can hinder decision-making is the Wildland–Urban Interface Evacuation (WUIVAC) model, which models fire minimum travel times to create geographic trigger buffers for evacuation recommendations. Utilising multiple combinations of escape routes and fire environment inputs based on the 2007 Zaca fire in California, USA, we created trigger buffers for firefighter evacuations on foot, by engine and by heavy mechanised equipment (i. e. bulldozer). Our primary objective was to examine trigger buffer sensitivity to evacuation mode and expected weather and fuel conditions. <b>Evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> time {{was the most important}} factor for determining the size and extent of modelled trigger buffers.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that driving {{behavior}} differs strongly in emergency conditions compared with behavior in normal traffic conditions. In this paper, these findings are followed up with an investigation of how these differences in driving behavior affect travel time reliability. In particular, {{the focus is on the}} effect of relatively strong heterogeneity in driving behavior. The microscopic simulation framework S-PARAMICS is adapted accordingly and applied to the emergency evacuation network of the Dutch city of Almere. This experimental setup allows a structured and in-depth analysis of the relationship between a number of driving behavior parameters and the emergent travel time reliability. The main findings from this study are thus insightful and directly applicable to evacuation planning and management studies. For instance, it is found that although a reduction in drivers’ mean time headway and minimum gap acceptance typically improves the overall <b>evacuation</b> time, <b>travel</b> times are simultaneously less reliable. Also, the reliability of travel times decreases over time and results in much less reliable travel times for those travelers who depart later.

30|$|Sky-bridges can be {{employed}} in order to evacuate occupants at a level different than the ground floor. However, the feasibility of this design solution is linked to several factors, such as {{the height of the}} building and its general design. The immediate benefit deriving from the use of sky-bridges is the reduction of the vertical <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> distance and the increase in the options available for the evacuation. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of a sky-bridge is strictly linked to the evacuation strategy adopted and the other egress components available (Wood 2007). The placing of the sky-bridges should be done to ensure the maximum efficiency of the egress circulation and then to benefit evacuation. For this reason, a sky-bridge should be placed at a level where there is the lift zoning changeover (Wood 2003). In addition, it should be placed in a position between the higher and lower floors of the building, since otherwise the majority of the occupants would need to travel significant distances through vertical means of escape (Wood et al. 2005), taking into account also the expected occupant load of the different floors (Wood 2003). The use of a sky-bridge would also {{have a significant impact on}} the planning of the building since the connection floors would become sky-lobbies (i.e., including stair and lift lobbies) (Wood 2003). There is currently a lack of knowledge about the effectiveness of sky-bridges during evacuation and studies addressing their use in combination with other egress components are required.|$|E
40|$|Despite an {{improved}} understanding of serious injury and illness during travel, accidents, near accidents, and maladies continue to befall tourists. With {{knowledge of these}} risks, travellers should be armed with preventive strategies, emergency treatment supplies, a working knowledge of first aid, and appropriate travel insurance coverage. Travellers should know how to access appropriate care at their travel destination, ideally through the emergency assistance service of their travel insurer. The traveller should understand the indications for and logistics of emergency assistance and aeromedical <b>evacuation.</b> <b>Travel</b> insurers normally underwrite travel, medical, and dental expenses incurred by travellers abroad, who take out "travel insurance", and provide emergency assistance and arrange aeromedical evacuation of travellers under specified conditions. Medical and dental claims {{make up more than}} two-thirds of all claims (Leggat & Leggat, 2002). Travellers sbould be advised 10 read their policies carefully to see what is covered, the level of the excesses, and to check for any exclusions. In particular, those travellers who have known pre-existing conditions, who are working long-term overseas, or who are going to undertake any form of hazardous recreational or occupational pursuit may need to obtain a special travel insurance policy, and this may attract a higher premium. In addition, travel insurance companies normally provide a service, usually through their emergency assistance contractors, to assist travel 1 ers abroad. This may include assisting with medical care while overseas, including aeromedical evacuation. Use of the emergency telephone service provided by the travel insurance company was reported in almost one-fifth of claims in a recent study of general claims in Australia (Leggat & Leggat, 2002). In a recent Swiss study, more than two-thirds of claims made through the travel insurer's assistance centre were for illness, while the remainder were due to accidents (Somer Kniestedt & Steffen, 2003). The risk of severe injury is thought to be greater for people when travelling abroad (Bewes, 1993).

40|$|Floods in {{populated}} areas expose humans to serious threats to life. In {{light of this}} fact, evacuation of flood-affected populations is considered the most appropriate protective measure to minimize the negative impacts of floods. Yet, unplanned or spontaneous evacuations during flood disasters can cause severe traffic congestion that makes evacuees more vulnerable and exposes them to further risk. Therefore, efficient and effective planning of flood disaster evacuation operations is important for minimising the devastating consequences of flood disasters. In Australia, flooding caused by rainfall is the costliest natural disaster. Flood hazards range in scale and intensity from regular, planned-for events to manageable emergencies, and sometimes even to devastating disasters. Similarly, affected population evacuation modelling methods might range from simple, certain models to complicated, uncertain models, hence, not every evacuation model is appropriate for every flood hazard event. Riverine flood-related risks are usually manageable due to the gradual development of the flood and the predictability of the factors causing them, such as rainfall, floodplain locations, and flooding’s spatial and temporal distributions. Safer evacuations are possible when the evacuation is pre-warned, and evacuation can therefore {{be used as a}} protective measure for riverine flood disasters. Therefore, the planning of evacuation operations for a riverine flood disaster is vital for minimising their negative impacts on human lives. This research’s ultimate objective is to develop a systematic method to simulate, model and optimise riverine flood evacuation trip distribution between flood-affected areas and disaster relocation shelters. To achieve this ultimate objective, three stages of this research have been devised. Stage 1 describes how to utilise the theoretical contributions that have been identified from the analysis of flood-related resources outlined in the literature review. These contributions and knowledge gaps are explained in detail in chapter 2 and are then incorporated in the proposed model. Stage 2 discusses the methodology, and the requirements of building a robust evacuation model are explained in detail. The model inputs, processing, and outputs from different data and information sources are described, including geographical information requirements, and utilisation of a strategic transport planning model (STPM). In stage 3, the adaptation of transportation problem (also known as the Hitchcock problem) is described and compared with the shortest path method for a single evacuee simulation and the gravity distribution model, which is used in strategic transport planning modelling. Stage 3 clarifies that traditional strategic transportation planning focuses on long-term and strategic transport issues, and it does not adequately consider short-term operational issues and problems, including planning for riverine flood disaster evacuation trip purposes. Moreover, by focusing only on traffic assignment modelling, it {{does not take into account}} the effects of generated trips from flood-affected areas and the inundation of some disaster relocation shelters to which evacuees will be distributed. Stage 3 has proven the feasibility of adapting the transportation problem to optimise and plan riverine flood disaster evacuation trip distributions, achieving shorter total evacuation times than the strategic transport planning model method. Flood-affected dynamic populations and the <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> time matrix between flood-affected areas and disaster relocation shelters, as estimated and calculated in the riverine flood disaster GIS developed in stage 2, were used as inputs in the investigation of three evacuation trip distribution methods. These three methods include the 1) single evacuee method (shortest path method), 2) the gravity distribution method, which is used in strategic transport planning modelling during normal peak periods, and 3) the proposed evacuation planning and optimisation method. These three evacuation methods are investigated using three types of evacuation time certainty environments that might coincide with different flood disaster severity levels. These three evacuation time knowledge environments are 1) the certain, 2) the approximate, and 3) the uncertain evacuation time certainty levels. Maps and statistical analytical tools are used to analyse and compare the evacuation trip distribution methods. These analyses have indicated that the evacuation distribution optimisation method achieves shorter total and average evacuation times between flood-affected areas and disaster relocation shelters than the single evacuee and strategic transport planning methods...|$|E
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 23, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Hurricane evacuation has attracted renewed emphasis since hurricane Katrina in 2005. Every coastal state is establishing their evacuation guidelines and searching {{new methods to}} improve evacuations. In this dissertation, first, hurricane evacuation of the Hampton Roads region of Virginia is investigated using large-scale regional mesoscopic traffic simulation models. Fourteen evacuation scenarios consisting of various combinations of storm categories and traffic control strategies are evaluated. The evaluation of scenarios provided information on the clearance time, average travel times, bottleneck locations, and congestion durations. The major findings from scenario evaluations include: (1) The differences in participation rates (100 % versus 70 %) did not impact the clearance times in a Category 1 storm evacuation, but have significant impact in a Category 3 storm evacuation, (2) The status (open or close) of a critical tunnel crossing, the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel did not have impact on the evacuation performance in Category 1 and 2 storm. However, opening the tunnel would improve the performance in a Category 3 storm, (3) The clearance times derived from simulations {{can be used to}} determine when to issue evacuation orders for various storm intensities, and (4) The bottleneck locations and durations identified for each evacuation scenario can be used to allocate the limited traffic monitoring equipment during an evacuation. The second focus of this dissertation is to investigate the impact of assumptions made regarding evacuee route choice on evacuation performance estimates. In the hurricane evacuation literature, very few studies have documented the realistic route choice behavior of evacuees during a hurricane. Due to this lack of realistic route choice behavior data, modelers make assumptions about the route choice behavior and traffic assignment. User-equilibrium traffic assignment has been extensively used in past evacuation studies. In this dissertation, realistic route choice behavior was determined by evaluating findings of a few published studies. The impact of route choice behavior on evacuation performance, especially travel times, is then investigated using the regional simulation model of the Hampton Roads region. The analysis found that the user-equilibrium traffic assignment significantly underestimates the travel times during an evacuation. The extent of underestimation of <b>evacuation</b> <b>travel</b> times depends on the total evacuation demand (a function of storm intensity), and the percent of evacuees willing to use en-route information to seek alternate routes when facing congestion. For the three en-route percentages reported in the literature i. e., 30 %, 50 %, and 70 %, the UE travel times were 58 %, 42 %, and 33 % lower than actual travel times realized in a Category 1; 94 %, 71 %, and 57 % lower in a Category 2; and 90 %, 69 %, and 54 % lower in a Category 3 evacuation. These findings illustrate the need to collect real-world data on evacuee route choice in order to build accurate evacuation models. The third focus of dissertation is to propose a procedure to assess the benefit of adding additional intermediate crossovers on a contra flow facility. Contra flow operation in which the direction of traffic on one or more travel lanes is reversed in order to increase the capacity of a road network is becoming a critical component of the evacuation plans of coastal states. Several coastal states have a contra flow plan in place for evacuation, however only a few states have intermediate crossovers between the origin and termination points. The impact of intermediate crossovers on network performance has not been well investigated in previous research. This dissertation investigates the benefits of having intermediate crossovers between regular and contra flow lanes. Based on the investigation, it can be concluded that adding intermediate crossovers did improve network performance for medium and high evacuation demand situations. Adding intermediate crossovers for low demand situations did not improve the network performance and thus any considerations for intermediate crossovers for the low demand evacuations must be based solely on providing access to road-side services (gas, food, and others). For high and medium demand situations and for the road network studied in this section, a 28 % improvement in the average travel time was observed by deploying four intermediate crossovers out of the 44 potential crossover locations. The iterative elimination procedure proposed in this dissertation is the first attempt in the literature to provide a systematic approach to determine the critical intermediate crossover locations within reasonable computation times...|$|E

40|$|The {{environment}} {{in which we live}} relentlessly threatens to decay or destroy our built cultural heritage through climatic and man-made means. Fire presents the most severe threat to the fabric and content of historic buildings. The destruction, when it occurs is extremely swift, the loss caused is often complete and the indirect damage from smoke and water can also be significant. The incidences of fires in churches is currently exceeding those in all other historic building types. This trend is destroying irreplaceable national treasures as arguably, England and Wales contains the greatest collection, in terms of number and antiquity, of ancient parish churches in the world. This thesis presents an investigation into the fundamental principles underlying fire safety in parish churches. It identifies that the danger to life from fire is not high, {{due to the fact that}} the natural layout of churches facilitates good <b>evacuation</b> routes and <b>travel</b> distances. The threat to church property, however, is considerable as churches generally possess very limited fire safety measures. In addition, problems of building isolation, restricted access and limited water supply means that early intervention is unlikely. Such evidence prompted the need for a decision making tool to aid the custodians of churches in the management of fire safety and in the allocation of scarce resources. The aims of this thesis were to develop a prototype fire safety evaluation procedure for the property protection of parish churches and to examine, using a sample of churches, the effectiveness of the methodology. This has been achieved by developing a 'points scheme' technique to enable the judgement on the adequacy of fire safety to be undertaken. The work involved assigning numerical values to qualitative descriptions of events, techniques and processes by a group of experts representing the interests of those involved in the use, management, and preservation of churches as well as fire safety engineering. The opinions gathered were brought to a consensus in a series of Delphi group meetings, through discussion and matrix manipulation. A 'collated norm' was established, from a collection of fire safety guidance documents for places of worship, against which technical value judgements are made and the acceptable level of fire safety is adjudicated. The procedure is unique in its evaluation configuration, in that it balances the level of fire safety against the vulnerability of property fabric and content. The assessment is undertaken through an 'observational survey'. This is conducted by an expert, knowledgeable in ecclesiastical building construction and fire safety, observing all parts of the building and making judgements on the adequacy of eighteen identified fire safety components. Features of the building which are highlighted through the assessment as being a high fire risk can receive a more in-depth survey, beyond the scope of this evaluation procedure. The practical operation of the evaluation procedure has been tested on ten churches. The outcome shows a broad spread of results. An independent qualitative observational assessment by experts support the outcome of the evaluation procedure in nine out of ten cases. Preliminary repeatability application trials have also been conducted. They showed an encouraging level of consistency, illustrating further that the developed procedure is of positive value and utility. The versatility of the evaluation procedure enables a direct link to be made between potential improvements in the assessment score and the actual cost of making fire safety improvements. This facility enables decision makers to evaluate fire safety upgrade options...|$|R
