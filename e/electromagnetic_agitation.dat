40|$|This paper {{presents}} the electro-thermal-magnetic field phenomena which {{take place in}} the molten pool when an external magnetic field is applied. Some types of agitation, the basic concept about <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation,</b> the numerical simulation of the electro slag welding with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation</b> and the graphical result of the simulation are presented. The agitation by electromagnetic way of the melted slag, due to the field of speeds, influences – through the equation of movement – the density of current and in the end the distribution of the temperature in the slag welding pool. The phenomena from the slag welding pool, during the welding process, are determined by the presence and the interaction of the following fields: the electrical field, the magnetic field, the thermal field, th...|$|E
40|$|VNIIMETMASh {{has been}} dealing {{for a long}} time with the {{problems}} of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation</b> at continuous pouring of profi ed and round billets. The principle of the maximum possible close approach of the EPM stator to liquid phase of ingot is put into basis of the concept of VNIIMETMASh. Being the design engineer of the MNLZ equipment including crystallizers, VNIIMETMASh has developed a typical number of the EMP devices built in the case of crystallizer without essential change of its construction. </p...|$|E
40|$|The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation</b> of {{the melted}} slag affects, {{according}} to the equation of movement, the current density and finnally the temperature distribution in the slag welding pool. The slag welding pool phenomena, during the welding process, are induced by the presence and {{the interaction of the}} following fields: electrical field, magnetic field, thermal field and hydrodynamic field. The metal cast structure of the weld obtained in the slag welding pool has an anisotropy of the mechanical properties that is prooved by a minimum resistance in the seam area. The properties of this area depend very much {{by the nature of the}} structural homogeneity, produced after the crystallisation of the welding pool and by the siz...|$|E
30|$|The base liquid was {{prepared}} by adding 0.2 wt.% of cationic dispersant (water-soluble chitosan) to distilled {{water as a}} dispersant to obtain good suspension for nanofluid. The Al 2 O 3 /water nanofluid produced by two-step synthesis method was then used as the experimental sample, and homogenization, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation,</b> and ultrasonic vibration were alternately used to disperse the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles into three weight fractions (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 wt.%) in the base liquid. The reason for using a lower concentration of nanofluid was to avoid blocking pipes and an overly high pressure drop caused by the sedimentation of nanoparticles and increased viscosity from {{a high concentration of}} nanofluid. The Al 2 O 3 /water nanofluid used in this study contains commercial nanoparticles (Al- 13 P, Yong-Zhen Technomaterial, Taipei, Taiwan). The real density of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles is approximately 3, 880 kg/m 3, which can be converted to be weight fraction and volume fraction by Equation 6.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to the non-transparency {{of metals}} {{it is nearly}} {{impossible}} to observe how inclusions behave within a liquid metal. At the same time numerical models, which generally are powerful tools for design of different types of metallurgical and other equipment associated with liquid metal, usually contain a high number of degrees of freedom due to the complexity of turbulent flows. Therefore, experimental verification of the numerical models is an essential task, which was hitherto not satisfactorily solved by established technologies. This contribution presents a recent and break-through experimental method, which makes liquid metal transparent: dynamic neutron radiography. It allows to visualize dynamics of solid inclusions in liquid metal flows within a scaled-down equipment, keeping fixed non-dimensional hydrodynamic and electromagnetic parameters and applying a permanent magnets technology for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>agitation</b> in the sep-up. Such method allows to step forward in understanding two-phase liquid metal flows as well as ensure innovative experiments for improvements in metallurgical equipment, bubbly liquid metal columns, preparation of metal matrix nanocomposites and others...|$|E
