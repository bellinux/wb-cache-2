40|$|Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is {{the first}} and rate-limiting step along the kynurenine pathway and is thought to {{play a key role}} in immune {{homeostasis}} through depletion of tryptophan and accumulation of kynurenines. In this review we summarize recent research into the possibility of harnessing the IDO pathway for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of IDO activity, or knockout of the gene encoding IDO, was shown to cause an increase in the severity of collagen-induced arthritis, an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis. The increased severity of disease was associated with elevated numbers of pathogenic Th 1 and Th 17 cells in the <b>joints</b> and <b>draining</b> lymph nodes. In another study, analysis of the kinetics of expression of downstream kynurenine pathway enzymes during the course of arthritis revealed a potential role for tryptophan metabolites in resolution of arthritis. Furthermore, the therapeutic administration of L-kynurenine or [3, 4 -dimethoxycinnamonyl]-anthranilic acid (a synthetic derivative of 3 -hydroxy-anthranilic acid) significantly reduced both clinical and histological progression of experimental arthritis. These findings raise the possibility of exploiting the IDO pathway for the therapy of autoimmune disease...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal store-operated calcium uptake {{has been}} {{observed}} in peripheral T lymphocytes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and sustained intracellular calcium signalling is known to mediate the functions of many types of immune cells. Thus, it is hypothesized that regulating calcium entry through CRACM 1 (the pore-forming subunit of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels; also known as ORAI 1) may be beneficial {{for the management of}} RA. Localized CRACM 1 knockdown in the <b>joints</b> and <b>draining</b> lymph nodes (DLNs) of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was achieved via lentiviral-based delivery of shRNA targeting mouse CRACM 1. Consistent with CRACM 1 knockdown, calcium influx in synovial cells and the histopathological features of CIA were reduced. These effects were also associated with reduced levels of several notable inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 6, IL- 17 A, and IFN-γ, in the joints. Additionally, CRACM 1 -shRNA reduced the number of bone marrow-derived osteoclasts in vitro as well as osteoclasts in CIA joints, which was associated with reduced RANKL levels in the serum and joints. In summary, inhibiting calcium entry by CRACM 1 knockdown suppressed arthritis development and may be therapeutically beneficial for RA patients...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the joint}} is {{surrounded}} by soft tissue, as in the shoulder and hip, fluid under pressure may leak out of the joint space through the surgical portals and collect in the patient's soft tissue. A typical arthroscopy can result in 1 - 3 liters of irrigation fluid being absorbed into the patient's interstitial tissue. This buildup of irrigation fluid in the soft tissue may cause edema. This swelling can interfere with the arthroscopic procedure by collapsing the surgical space, or migrating into the patient's neck and causing airway blockage. In hip arthroscopy, a feared complication is abdominal flooding where the irrigation fluid leaks from the hip <b>joint</b> capsule and <b>drains</b> into the abdominal cavity. Risk factors for fluid extravasaton include procedure length (> 90 - 120 min), obesity, and age (> 45 - 50) with accompanying lack of muscle tone.|$|R
40|$|Vaccination in {{autoimmunity}} {{can have}} beneficial, but also detrimental effects. In this thesis, {{we tried to}} identify {{factors that contribute to}} a favourable or an unfavourable outcome of vaccination in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and experimental arthritis. In the first part, we focused on the potential unwanted effects of vaccination against Meningitis type C in two studies in JIA patients receiving the Meningococcal C vaccine. In chapter 2 we describe that no clinical disease aggravation was detected after MenC vaccination in a large cohort of JIA patients. Although geometric mean titers of anti-MenC antibodies were lower in treatment groups receiving immune suppressive medication, functional MenC bactericidal capacity of these antibodies was adequate in all patients. These were encouraging results, supporting the positive advice of administration of vaccines to children with JIA. However, the results of chapter 3 raise a concern for JIA patients with non-remitting disease. The increased pro-inflammatory cytokine profile raised by vaccine specific T cells after vaccination in these patients in combination with an aberrant FOXP 3 + regulatory T cell (Treg) response theoretically could hold a risk for aggravating autoimmunity, although this potential clinical effect was not observed in our study. For the second part of this thesis, we studied the potential protective effects of nasal peptide vaccination against rat adjuvant induced arthritis. First, we hypothesized that mucosal vaccination with a bystander antigen like heat shock protein (HSP) (peptide immunotherapy) may be able to protect against autoimmune arthritis (reviewed in chapter 4). In chapter 5 we show that mucosal administration of such a bystander peptide derived from bacterial HSP 60 protects against experimental arthritis, and that this protection was transferable by CD 4 + T cells. Skewing of the peptide-specific immune response towards a regulatory phenotype might have played a role, as peptide treatment was associated with a reduction of peptide specific tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) production by CD 4 +Tcells and the presence of suppressive CD 4 +FoxP 3 + Treg cells. Addition of a mucosal adjuvant (CpG) to peptide specific immunotherapy clearly enhanced clinical efficacy in experimental arthritis (chapter 6). Co-treatment of p 1 with CpG increased both the number and activation status of plasmacytoid DC in draining MLN, which was accompanied by augmented p 1 -specific T cell proliferation and IL- 10 production. After arthritis induction, p 1 - and p 1 /CpG-treated rats showed increased amounts of CD 4 +FoxP 3 + Tregs in the <b>joint</b> <b>draining</b> lymph nodes, which correlated with lower arthritis scores. The data in chapter 7 show an improvement in the clinical and immunological effect of nasal HSP peptide immunotherapy in a therapeutic (instead of preventive) setting. Peptide immunotherapy with a bacterial HSP 60 peptide after initiation of adjuvant arthritis was most effective when combined with low dose TNFα receptor blockade (Etanercept), reaching the same level of protection as full dose Etanercept treatment. Combination treatment led to an increase in peptide specific IL- 10 production by CD 4 + T cells and an upregulation of FoxP 3 gene expression in CD 4 +CD 25 + Treg cells. These new approaches for more effective peptide immunotherapy could pave the way for a promising future of peptide specific immunotherapy in autoimmune disease...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} {{located in}} cold climates have been experiencing premature joint deterioration. Entrapment of {{moisture in the}} joints saturates the surrounding concrete, rendering it susceptible to freeze-thaw damage. To identify and to isolate the variables that might be causing this localized deterioration, concrete cores were obtained from deteriorated and non-deteriorated sections of US 35, SR 38 and SR 3 located near Indianapolis, Indiana and I- 94 (located near Michigan City, Indiana). The visual evaluation of {{the condition of the}} pavement revealed that the drainage of the joints contributes significantly to their performance. Specifically, all deteriorated <b>joint</b> core holes <b>drained</b> poorly when compared to well performing joint core holes or mid panel joint core holes. Hardened air void parameters were determined following the procedure described in ASTM C 457 and results for cores from deteriorated and non-deteriorated regions of the pavements were compared. The chemical and microstructural changes occurring in concrete were investigated using scanning electron microscope. Concrete panels with poor values of spacing factor and specific surface area were more prone to premature joint deterioration. Visual observation of coring sites on I- 94 showed that unsealed joints performed better than sealed joints...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory cytokines {{have been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of rheumatoid arthritis. To validate a key role for IL- 1 in arthritic processes we have studied the protective effect of neutralizing antimurine IL- 1 antibodies in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Combination of anti-IL- 1 alpha and anti-IL- 1 beta given before onset of arthritis was shown to prevent disease completely. Remarkably, a single treatment was also highly effective in the established phase of arthritis, reducing both inflammation as well as cartilage destruction. Suppression was most pronounced with the combination, but anti-IL- 1 beta alone also induced significant relief. Finally, we studied the protective effect of IL- 1 neutralization on cartilage metabolism in a unilateral expression model of collagen arthritis. To this end zymosan was injected in one knee joint before onset of disease, resulting in accelerated expression in that particular <b>joint</b> and the <b>draining</b> paw. Anti-IL- 1 treatment started after accelerated expression of arthritis was able to fully normalize chondrocyte synthetic function, which was highly suppressed in the control group. It is concluded that IL- 1 is an important determinant in both inflammation and cartilage destruction in collagen arthritis, and this may have implications for therapy in human arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Michigan {{is located}} in a wet-freeze climate zone. During winter the deicing-salt {{application}} is needed to melt snow on highways. Freezing {{in the presence of a}} deicing salt solution is considered a severe concrete exposure condition. Prolonged exposure in pavement joints has been found to erode the concrete binder material (portland cement paste) when coupled with its low internal frost resistance (i. e. insufficient air and poorly <b>drained</b> <b>joints).</b> This creates a weak zone resulting in joint spalling from heavy wheel loading. Many highways have been found to suffer this type of distress within ten years requiring expensive joint repairs. This research investigates the material level mechanisms for frost deterioration under deicing salt exposure by the aid of systematic application of various experimental techniques, such as sub-freezing length change measurement, micro- and macro-characterization of scaling properties and nitrogen sorption test. A new conceptual model is provided for the surface deterioration that occurs within a thin surface layer when exposed to a deicing salt solution. The major stress producing mechanism is ice-growth within the capillary pores exacerbated by cryogenic suction of the liquid brine present on the surface, thus feeding further ice-growth and leading to high tensile stresses in the direction of least internal restraint and “popping” of thin mortar flakes. This process repeats itself for every freeze-thaw cycle. These findings pave the way for the proposal of sorptivity as a performance-based criterion to evaluate scaling resistance in concrete and its theoretical nature is enhanced by a refined model capable of capturing the effect of pore size characteristics (pore volume, its size distribution and connectivity). This further leads to the identification and application of effective mitigation techniques, including reconfiguration of paste pore system towards a more refined and discontinued structure and utilization of a hydrophobic pore liner in the silicate substrate of hydration products as surface treatment...|$|R
40|$|Preclinical {{studies to}} assess biodistribution, safety, and initial {{efficacy}} of ART-I 02, an adeno-associated type 5 (rAAV 5) vector expressing human interferon β (hIFN-β), were {{performed in a}} total of 24 rhesus monkeys with collagen-induced arthritis. All monkeys were naïve or showed limited neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers to AAV 5 {{at the start of the}} study. Animals were injected with a single intra-articular dose of ART-I 02 or placebo, consisting of 3. 2 × 10 (13) vg (Dose A=maximum feasible dose), 4. 58 × 10 (12) vg (Dose B), or placebo in the first affected finger joint, the ipsilateral knee, and ankle joint at the same time point. Animals were monitored for clinical parameters and well-being with a maximum of 4 weeks, with the option that the severity of arthritis could necessitate an earlier time point of sacrifice. No adverse events were noted after injection of ART-I 02. No abnormalities were observed after histological evaluation of all organs. At both dose levels, immunohistochemical staining indicated expression of hIFN-β. In animals injected with Dose A, we observed stabilization or a reduction in swelling in the finger joint in which vector was administered. The highest copy numbers of vector DNA were detected in synovial tissue of the injected <b>joint</b> and the <b>draining</b> lymph node of the injected knee. High titers of Nab to rAAV 5 were observed at the end of the study. Five monkeys developed an rAAV 5 -specific T-cell response. Two monkeys developed Nab to hIFN-β. In conclusion, intra-articular injection of ART-I 02 was well-tolerated and did not induce adverse events. After administration of Dose A of ART-I 02, we observed a beneficial effect on joint swelling, substantiated by decreased histological inflammation and bone erosion scores. A GMP vector for clinical application has been manufactured and is currently being tested in GLP rodent studies, with the aim to move forward to a clinical tria...|$|R
