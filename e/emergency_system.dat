5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The amount of food permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

500|$|According to BBC News, most {{patients}} {{who suffer from}} extreme hypothermia die, even if doctors are able to restart their hearts. The survival rate for adults whose body temperature has decreased to below [...] is 10%–33%. Prior to Bågenholm's accident, the lowest survived body temperature was , which had been recorded in a child. [...] Gilbert said [...] "victims of very deep accidental hypothermia with circulatory arrest should be seen as potentially resuscitable with a prospect of full recovery. The key success factors of such marginal resuscitation efforts are early bystander actions with vigorous CPR and early warning of the <b>emergency</b> <b>system,</b> early dispatch of adequate rescue units (ground and air-ambulances) and good co-ordination between the resources outside and inside the hospital, aggressive rewarming and a spirit not to give up." [...] General practitioner Jel Coward from Tywyn, Wales, said persons who are victims of extreme hypothermia are often mistakenly thought dead because {{it can be difficult to}} detect a pulse on them. He said this case [...] "really does bring it home to us how cautious one has to be before diagnosing death in people who are cold." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that indicia of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that reasonable cause for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number of the pickup truck, Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows the other car was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 <b>emergency</b> <b>system</b> are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E
500|$|The {{last day}} with SM91 in service was on 1 November 2002. By then, 27 of the SL95-trams had been delivered, and Oslo Sporveier {{was able to}} operate its entire network with only {{articulated}} trams. Until 2003, trams 142 and 149 were not in service for long-term repairs. On 8 July 2004, a computer error caused tram 161 neither {{to be able to}} run nor open the doors, even with the <b>emergency</b> <b>system.</b> This was caused by the computer indicating that the tram was running at [...] while it stood still. All trams were later altered so the motorman could override such incidents. The final trams were delivered in 2004, and no. 142 was put into service in January 2005. At the same time, corrosion was discovered inside the articulation of tram 141. In 2006, Oslo Sporveier introduced a program to upgrade all the SL95-trams, including removing corrosion from the bodywork and the inside, as well as simplifying the lubrication of the joints, which prior to the upgrades required the entire trams to be de-hooked. These upgrades are planned to be completed by 2009. The trams have also had problems with the air supply freezing during cold spells, making it impossible to retract the side mirrors when changing direction, and terminating the secondary suspension. This requires the trams to be operated at walking speed without passengers.|$|E

The objective of research was {{to find out the}} implementation of <b>emergency</b> response <b>system</b> as the attempt of preventing and controlling fire in PKU Muhammadiyah Surakarta Hospital. Method: This research was conducted using descriptive method giving a description on the implementation of <b>emergency</b> response <b>system</b> against fire. The data of fire <b>emergency</b> response <b>system</b> was collected through field observation, interview with the workers and library study. The data obtained was then discussed by comparing it and the regulation and standard related to fire <b>emergency</b> response <b>system.</b> Result: The attempt of preventing and controlling fire in PKU Muhammadiyah Surakarta Hospital included emergency condition policy, recommendation and facility provision to deal with disaster, emergency response team, and emergency response procedure. Conclusion: The implementation of fire <b>emergency</b> response <b>system</b> in PKU Muhammadiyah Surakarta Hospital had been consistent with the legislation. It was recommended that the internal audit be held on <b>emergency</b> response <b>system</b> periodically.
