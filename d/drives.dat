5|$|Michel Glautier {{argues that}} {{conscience}} {{is one of}} the instincts and <b>drives</b> which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these <b>drives</b> or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) <b>drives</b> (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} <b>drives.</b> Most <b>drives</b> are AC-AC <b>drives</b> in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, <b>drives</b> are configured as DC-AC <b>drives.</b> The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI <b>drives</b> provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) <b>drives</b> (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash <b>drives</b> and more recently, solid-state <b>drives</b> to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk <b>drives.</b> Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
