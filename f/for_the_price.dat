5|$|Black Prince {{was ordered}} on 6 October 1859 from Robert Napier and Sons in Govan, Glasgow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of £377,954.

She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, {{but was not}} completed until 12 September 1862. Black Prince {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet until 1866, then spent a year as flagship on the Irish coast. Overhauled and rearmed in 1867–68, she became guardship on the River Clyde. The routine of that duty was interrupted in 1869 when she and Warrior towed a large floating drydock from Madeira to Bermuda.|$|E

As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E

5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism.

Since then, attendance has been rising, and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year.

Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs.
