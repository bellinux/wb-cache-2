The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self on the hillside without Rory. The Doctor takes out the object he pulled from the crack: a burnt piece of the TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{build-up}} for the pay-per-view {{began in}} the middle of May, plans were in the works behind the scenes for several months in advance.

5|$|Politics was a {{frequent}} subject of discussion in the Bradley household, {{and some of his}} relatives held local and county political offices. He majored in history at Princeton, and was present in the Senate chamber when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. Van Breda Kolff and many others who knew him predicted that Bradley would be Governor of Missouri, or President, by 40. He spent his time at Oxford focusing on European political and economic history. In 1978, he said that congressman Mo Udall, himself a former professional basketball player, had told him ten years earlier that professional sports could <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> him for politics, depending on what he did with his non-playing time.|$|E

5|$|During the 1900 campaign, Harvey {{had visited}} Northwest Arkansas, an area {{known for its}} unique {{pristine}} natural beauty. In October 1900 he purchased 320acres (130ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> {{the house for the}} rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.|$|E
5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E

5|$|In March 1941, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one {{of several}} Allied units {{deployed}} to Greece to <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> for an expected invasion by Italian and German troops. When the invasion began on 6 April 1941, the 20th Battalion briefly saw action at Thermopylae before being withdrawn, but Hinton missed this fighting as he was with the division's reinforcement battalion, which was initially based in Athens before it moved to the port of Kalamata. It had been decided that the Allied forces would abandon Greece; at Kalamata, the reinforcement battalion, along with several thousand other, mainly Australian, troops, was awaiting evacuation. On 28 April, the New Zealanders were waiting for transport when advance units of the German 5th Panzer Division began to attack the town with machine-gun fire and self-propelled 6-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|States of {{emergencies}} were {{declared in}} Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey {{due to the}} storm. Hermine affected {{the east coast of}} the United States during the busy Labor Day weekend, causing many beaches to be closed in Delaware, New Jersey, and New York.

In Charleston, South Carolina, the city government provided 3,000sandbags to residents, preparing {{less than a year after}} damaging floods hit the state. Outer Banks ferry service was cancelled and bridges in Dare County, North Carolina, were closed due to the high winds.

The Virginia National Guard utilized 270members to <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> for the storm's potential flooding and power outages.

5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and <b>help</b> <b>prepare</b> against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of the computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
