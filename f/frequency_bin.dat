When different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each <b>frequency</b> <b>bin,</b> {{the result is that the}} main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies. This can be an advantage for communication links, and is used with the SPS-48 radar.|$|E
30|$|From Figure  2 {{we can see}} that, {{when time}} domain signals are {{transformed}} to T-F domain by STFT, neighboring <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> usually have strong correlation; however, two <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> may be weakly correlated if they are far apart from each other [10]. Original IVA algorithms [13 – 16] treat all <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> as a whole, and although this approach is easy to implement and its computational time is relatively short, weakly correlated <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> will degrade the separation performance.|$|R

30|$|By {{computing}} {{the correlation}} coefficient between any <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> pair of interest, a SU can next cluster sequential <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> together into discrete bands {{based on their}} correlation value and, thus, create groups of <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> that present coherent behavior. As explained earlier, each such group essentially corresponds to a technology-specific channel and thus the underlying spectrum environment picture can be successfully and effectively reconstructed with various benefits explained in the sequel.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, as an {{improvement}} over the simple correlation method, {{it is possible to}} perform a single operation covering all code phases for each <b>frequency</b> <b>bin.</b> The operation performed for each code phase bin involves forward FFT, element-wise multiplication in the frequency domain. inverse FFT, and extra processing so that overall, it computes circular correlation instead of circular convolution. This yields more accurate code phase determination than the simple correlation method in contrast with the previous method, which yields more accurate carrier frequency determination than the previous method.|$|E

50|$|As an example, {{assume that}} the {{granularity}} for the search in code phase is 0.5 chips and in frequency is 500 Hz, then there are 1,023/0.5=2,046 code phases and 10,000 Hz/500 Hz=20 frequencies to try {{for a total of}} 20×2,046=40,920 local replicas. Note that each <b>frequency</b> <b>bin</b> is centered on its interval and therefore covers 250 Hz in each direction; for example, the first bin has a carrier at −4.750 Hz and covers the interval −5,000 Hz to −4,500 Hz. Code phases are equivalent modulo 1,023 because the ranging code is periodic; for example, phase −0.5 is equivalent to phase 1,022.5.|$|E

50|$|For highly {{stationary}} signals, such as long {{notes in}} musical performance, the Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT) is used. This tool {{is unique to}} Dolby Digital Plus (and unsupported in Dolby Digital), and uses an additional Type II Discrete cosine transform to combine six adjacent transform blocks (located within a syncframe) into an effectively longer block. In addition to the two-stage transform, a different bit-allocation structure is used, and two ways of representing encoded mantissas are deployed: use of vector quantization, which gives the highest coding gain, and use of gain-adapted quantization (GAQ) when greater signal-fidelity is required. Gain-adaptive quantization may be independently enabled for each <b>frequency</b> <b>bin</b> within a channel, and permits variable-length mantissa encoding.|$|E

30|$|The {{cornerstone}} for {{our study}} is the observed correlated behavior of <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> spanned by a single technology-specific PU channel (Figure 1). In particular, when a PU channel (e.g., a GSM one) spans several <b>frequency</b> <b>bins,</b> their measured power exhibit correlated behavior. Although important, such correlation properties have not been sufficiently studied and exploited in the literature where relevant, but simplistic and not practically validated, assumptions dominate. In this paper, we advocate that SUs can raise and exploit their awareness on their underlying transmission environment by estimating the statistical correlation of acquired power measurements of adjacent <b>frequency</b> <b>bins,</b> and then clustering the highly correlated ones into distinct groups. In this manner, SUs will be capable of efficiently detecting frequency regions that present coherent behavior and define sets of <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> that are uniformly affected by a single PU. Therefore, SUs become able to infer the ranges of typically unknown technology-specific channels that are defined by primary systems, thus managing to reconstruct the landscape of their underlying spectrum environment, with the benefits that will be explained in Section 5.|$|R
30|$|The {{interpretation}} of the correlation coefficient and the respective threshold rthr, above which strong dependency can be inferred, mainly relies on the context and purposes of each examined measurement set. In our case, this dependency does appear since each PU signal spans a superset of <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> (i.e., a 200 -kHz GSM channel spans over multiple 4 kHz bins), with each such block constituting a nominal channel assigned to a PU. Therefore, {{as shown in the}} example of Figure 5, the power values of <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> that correspond to the same technology channel present extremely high correlation values and thus, the selection of a high threshold rthr, e.g., 0.75, allows for inferring correlated blocks of consecutive <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> with well-defined boundaries.|$|R

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the convoluted {{mixture in}} the time domain is converted into instantaneous mixtures for individual <b>frequency</b> <b>bins.</b> Many frequency-domain BSS methods independently separate the mixed signals for all the frequency bins; thus, an ambiguity arises in the output order. The system must arrange the separated signals in the correct order for the <b>frequency</b> <b>bins.</b> This is called the “permutation problem”. The permutation problem should be solved {{in order to achieve}} frequency-domain BSS.|$|R
40|$|In the frequency-domain, a convolutive mixture can be {{interpreted}} as several instantaneous mixtures which may be separated using many existing algorithms. The main limitation of this approach is the large number of frequencies that must be considered. In addition, a permutation/amplitude correction must be performed when the sources are recovered in a different order or with different amplitudes in some <b>frequency</b> <b>bins.</b> In this paper we propose a novel approach for solving the convolutive problem using only two <b>frequency</b> <b>bins.</b> The idea deals with finding a invertible matrix which relates the signals recovered in these <b>frequency</b> <b>bins</b> and the temporal sources.
