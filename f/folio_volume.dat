John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three <b>folio</b> <b>volume,</b> Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643.|$|E

25|$|Several early German and French {{scholars}} compiled old {{works and}} conducted new research on birds. These included Guillaume Rondelet who described his observations in the Mediterranean and Pierre Belon who described {{the fish and}} birds {{that he had seen}} in France and the Levant. Belon's Book of Birds (1555) is a <b>folio</b> <b>volume</b> with descriptions of some two hundred species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in comparative anatomy. Volcher Coiter (1534–1576), a Dutch anatomist made detailed studies of the internal structures of birds and produced a classification of birds, De Differentiis Avium (around 1572), that was based on structure and habits. Konrad Gesner wrote the Vogelbuch and Icones avium omnium around 1557. Like Gesner, Ulisse Aldrovandi, an encyclopedic naturalist began a 14-volume natural history with three volumes on birds, entitled ornithologiae hoc est de avibus historiae libri XII which was published from 1599 to 1603. Aldrovandi showed great interest in plants and animals and his work included 3000 drawings of fruits, flowers, plants and animals, published in 363 volumes. His Ornithology alone covers 2000 pages and included such aspects as the chicken and poultry techniques. He used a number of traits including behaviour, particularly bathing and dusting, to classify bird groups.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{printing}} used a black letter typeface {{instead of}} a roman typeface, which itself made a political and a religious statement. Like the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, the Authorized Version was [...] "appointed to be read in churches". It was a large <b>folio</b> <b>volume</b> meant for public use, not private devotion; {{the weight of the}} type mirrored the weight of establishment authority behind it. However, smaller editions and roman-type editions followed rapidly, e.g. quarto roman-type editions of the Bible in 1612. This contrasted with the Geneva Bible, which was the first English Bible printed in a roman typeface (although black-letter editions, particularly in folio format, were issued later).|$|E
2500|$|In 1530, Henry VIII {{had issued}} an {{instruction}} governing {{the conduct of}} heraldic visitations, in which Clarenceux and Norroy Kings of Arms (or their deputies) were to tour their areas of authority, recording coats of arms and pedigrees of armigers, with powers to forcibly prevent the bearing of unauthorised arms. Flower's visitations began in 1563–64 and his last visitation was in 1575, with Glover acting as his deputy. The entry books of Flower's visitations of Yorkshire in 1563–1564 (printed, 1881), of Lancashire, 1567 (printed, 1870), of Nottingham, 1569 (printed 1871) and of Durham, 1575 (printed, 1820) are preserved in the College of Arms in London. A manuscript of the 1567 visitation in Glover's hand (in the British Museum) is frequently described as Glover's Visitation. [...] This manuscript forms a <b>folio</b> <b>volume</b> of 104 pages, and includes the pedigrees of 112 families, each illustrated with armorial bearings.|$|E

60|$|This {{treatise}} {{is one of}} the ten 'excellent manuscripts' which Bunyan {{had prepared}} for the press, when his unexpected decease prevented his publishing them. It first appeared in the <b>folio</b> <b>volume</b> of his works, printed under the care of Charles Doe, in 1692. It has since been re-published in every edition of Bunyan's work, but with the omission of the Scripture references, and many errors. It is now accurately corrected by the first edition.|$|E
60|$|It {{was first}} published, with a {{selection}} of Bunyan's Works in a <b>folio</b> <b>volume,</b> in 1692, about {{four years after the}} author's decease; and although it is a treatise exhibiting very deep research and calculated for extensive usefulness, it does not appear ever to have been published as a separate volume.

60|$|THIS admirable Treatise {{upon the}} most {{important}} of all subjects, that of the soul's salvation, was first published in a pocket volume, in the year 1675.

Our copy is reprinted from the first edition published after the author's decease, in a small <b>folio</b> <b>volume</b> of his works, 1691. Although it is somewhat encumbered with subdivisions, it is plain, practical, and written in Bunyan's strong and energetic style; calculated to excite the deepest attention, and to fix the mind upon those solemn realities which alone can unite earth with heaven.|$|E

60|$|He {{was soon}} {{up to his}} ears in medical studies, being employed, morning, noon, and night, in rolling pills, {{filtering}} tinctures, or pounding the pestle and mortar, {{in one corner of}} the laboratory; while the doctor would take his seat in another corner, when he had nothing else to do, or expected visitors, and, arrayed in his morning-gown and velvet cap, would pore over the contents of some <b>folio</b> <b>volume.</b> It is true, that the regular thumping of Dolph's pestle, or, perhaps, the drowsy buzzing of the summer flies, would now and then lull the little man into a slumber; but then his spectacles were always wide awake, and studiously regarding the book.|$|E

All his manifestations were gentle and soft, but of a simplicity most unlike the feline softness which we are apt to associate with a noiseless tread and movement in the male sex. The sunshine came through the ivy and glimmered upon his great book, however, with an effect which a little disturbed the patient's nerves; besides, he desired to have a fuller view of his benign guardian.|$|E

His back was turned toward the door, but he recognised his wife without looking round.|$|E
