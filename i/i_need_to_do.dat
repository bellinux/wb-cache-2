Beginning in 1958 he {{suffered from}} a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 {{he wrote in a}} letter: [...] "Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective).

Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E

500|$|Franken said {{he learned}} that 21% of Americans {{received}} most of their news from talk radio, an almost exclusively conservative medium. Said Franken, [...] "I didn't want {{to sit on the}} sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference." [...] In November 2003, Franken talked about moving back to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. At the time the seat, once held by Wellstone, was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman. At a 2004 Democratic presidential campaign event, Franken tackled a man who was allegedly threatening other attendees and heckling Governor Howard Dean. [...] In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: [...] "I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order to do it." [...] In late 2005, Franken started his own political action committee, called Midwest Values PAC. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.|$|E

If I train {{as hard as he}} does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world.

In an interview with MMA Junkie the day prior to his GWC fight, Lashley indicated that he had two potential fights lined up for August 2013, saying [...] "If I'm going to fight, I need to fight.

2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the {{head coach of the}} Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that we had all hoped... It's a long grind and I feel (that) after 20 years as a head coach there are other things <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I simply believe this is the right time for me to move on because this team needs new leadership." ...|$|E

[...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore.

5000|$|Rothman {{later said}} that she was asked to have a rape scene in the film but could not bring herself to shoot it. [...] "I would not want to be {{responsible}} in any way for showing how it could be done," [...] said Rothman. She elaborated:in a film like Terminal Island 1973, practically the whole film involves violence because the subject matter is violent people. I accepted that. I recognized that if I was going to make films, and I was going to make them for the market, I was making them for it. I wanted to make films very much and that's what <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> What <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was try <b>to</b> refine that and give it some meaning beyond the violence itself, or beyond the nudity itself. In that sense, I tried very hard to not make it exploitative.The film was originally more violent but scenes had to be cut out. Rothman was uncomfortable with the violence that she did show. [...] "I was unhappy with the movie and still continue to feel so," [...] she said in 1981.|$|R

So at that time, although it seems odd now, going to Europe was a way of living cheaply. I lived in Europe for almost three years on nothing and with nothing, and that time was spent trying to find myself and my voice.|$|R
