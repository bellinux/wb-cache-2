5|$|Presently, the {{porcupine}} ray {{is caught}} incidentally in trawls, tangle nets, and beach seines. Its skin {{continues to be}} highly valued, while the meat and cartilage may also be utilized. In the Farasan Islands and some {{other places in the}} Red Sea, its liver is eaten as a seasonal dish. However, the economic importance of this ray is limited by how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> handle. The multi-species coastal fisheries that catch the porcupine ray are largely unregulated, which seems to have resulted in its dramatic decline or local extinction in the Bay of Bengal, the Gulf of Thailand, and likely elsewhere in its range. Potential additional threats to this species include habitat degradation from coastal development, and depletion of its food supply from overfishing. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|As breasts become larger, {{their shape}} and the {{distribution}} of tissue within them changes. The breasts may become ptotic. This makes measurements increasingly unreliable. The heavier a person's build, the more <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> obtain accurate measurements, as measuring tape sinks into the flesh more easily.|$|E

25|$|Surface tension {{describes}} how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> extend {{the area of}} a surface (by stretching or distorting it). If surface tension is high, {{there is a large}} free energy required to increase the surface area, so the surface will tend to contract and hold together like a rubber sheet.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Turing degree is {{fundamental}} in computability theory, where sets of natural numbers are often regarded as decision problems. The Turing degree {{of a set}} {{is a measure of}} how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> solve the decision problem associated with the set, that is, to determine whether an arbitrary number is in the given set.|$|E
25|$|Noise {{typically}} appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal {{received in the}} radar receiver. The lower {{the power of the}} desired signal, the more <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> discern it from the noise. Noise figure {{is a measure of the}} noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver, and this needs to be minimized.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{noting the}} obvious {{relevance}} {{of this to}} their own proposed scenario Marlovians do not seek multiple parallels between Marlowe's known or predicted life and these stories, believing that the plays are so rich in plot devices that such parallels can be found with numerous individuals. On the other hand, there are some places where they point out how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know just why something was included {{if it were not}} some sort of in-joke for those who were privy to something unknown to most of us.|$|E
25|$|Multiplexes {{can make}} use of {{statistical}} multiplexing at the MPEG video coder whereby the bitrate allocated to a channel within the multiplex can vary dynamically depending on how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> code the picture content at that precise time, and how much demand there is for bandwidth from other channels. In this way, complex pictures with much detail may demand a higher bitrate at one instant and this can result in the bitrate allocated to another channel in the same multiplex being reduced if the second channel is currently transmitting pictures which are easier to encode, with less fine detail.|$|E
25|$|According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects {{how easy}} or <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{navigate}} through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to {{extent to which}} the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise {{the amount of time spent}} finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.|$|E
50|$|The game became {{somewhat}} infamous for {{its very}} high difficulty level. Cranford acknowledged this in interviews, stating {{that it may}} not have been playtested enough and that while he wanted to make a challenging game, he did not realize just how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> complete the quest.|$|R

25|$|Serious local errors {{can arise}} in {{homology}} models where an insertion or deletion mutation or {{a gap in}} a solved structure result in a region of target sequence {{for which there is}} no corresponding template. This problem can be minimized by the use of multiple templates, but the method is complicated by the templates' differing local structures around the gap and by the likelihood that a missing region in one experimental structure is also missing in other structures of the same protein family. Missing regions are most common in loops where high local flexibility increases the difficulty of resolving the region by structure-determination methods. Although some guidance is provided even with a single template by the positioning of the ends of the missing region, the longer the gap, the more <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> model. Loops of up to about 9 residues can be modeled with moderate accuracy in some cases if the local alignment is correct. Larger regions are often modeled individually using ab initio structure prediction techniques, although this approach has met with only isolated success.|$|E
25|$|Using these variables, {{the optimal}} diet model can predict how predators choose between two prey types: big prey1 with energy value E1 and {{handling}} time h1, and small prey2 with energy value E2 and handling time h2. In order to maximize its overall rate of energy gain, a predator {{must consider the}} profitability of the two prey types. If {{it is assumed that}} big prey1 is more profitable than small prey2, then E1/h1 > E2/h2. Thus, if the predator encounters prey1, it should always choose to eat it, because of its higher profitability. It should never bother to go searching for prey2. However, if the animal encounters prey2, it should reject it to look for a more profitable prey1, unless the time it would take to find prey1 is too long and costly for it to be worth it. Thus, the animal should only eat prey2 if E2/h2 > E1/(h1+S1), where S1 is the search time for prey1. Since it is always favorable to choose to eat prey1, the choice to eat prey1 is not dependent on the abundance of prey2. But since the length of S1 (i.e. how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find prey1) is logically dependent on the density of prey1, the choice to eat prey2 is dependent on the abundance of prey1.|$|E
500|$|Critics near universally {{took issue}} with the game's controls. Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go, and {{multiple}} reviewers described navigation as [...] "trial and error". Reviewers also found {{that they could not}} always jump when they wanted to, and one reviewer found that power-ups failed to activate when she wanted them to. Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again. Because points are subtracted each time Spidy dies, the problems with the control scheme exacerbate how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get enough stars to progress.|$|E

Urb mentioned that he learned the video game Leon's mannerisms from watching clips posted on YouTube, commenting that [...] "he doesn't have a high-pitched voice.

[...] Speaking about the relationship between Leon and Ada, Urb said: [...] "It's kind of like Mulder and Scully and an X-Files type of deal, where you're waiting for it to happen, but it never does. Maybe in the next one, I'm hoping." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{player is}} able to speak to demons instead of {{fighting}} them, and can try to form an alliance with them; these negotiations involve the player trying to increase the demon's mood, and start with the player picking an attitude – friendly or intimidating – after which they get to choose {{how to respond to}} what the demon says or does, and whether to give the demon items or money it asks for. Demons act differently depending on their personality, as well as the in-game phase of the moon; it is impossible to converse with demons during full moon, forcing the player to fight or flee. Depending on choices the player makes throughout the game, their moral alignment changes; the different alignments are [...] "law", [...] "chaos", and [...] "neutrality". These affect how the plot progresses, and how easy or <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> form alliances with certain demon types, depending on how compatible the player's and the demon's alignments are.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey's {{next major}} leading role was as Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Collins in Paul Abbott's BBC serial State of Play (2003). Morrissey {{received}} the scripts {{for the first}} three episodes and was keen to read the last three. They had not been completed when he originally requested them but Abbott told him how Collins' story concludes. Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life.

500|$|On {{multiple}} occasions, numerous gaming magazines {{have chosen}} Sephiroth {{as one of}} the best villains from both the Final Fantasy series in specific and in all of video games in general. GameSpy placed him eighth in their 2014 list of top villains in games, commenting on how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> defeat him in Final Fantasy VII. In 2005, Sephiroth was the winner in a GameFAQs character battle involving only villains. IGN listed him at number two in its 2006 list of most memorable villains, as well as the fourth top video game villain. He has been named the number one villain in an episode of G4's Filter. PC World placed him second in their 2008 list of most diabolical video game villains of all time. That same year, Sephiroth was listed at the top of IGN's list of Final Fantasy VII top characters, with Dave Smith calling him the [...] "heavyweight champion of Final Fantasy villains," [...] and praising his appearance and backstory. He would take the same spot in the list of top 25 Final Fantasy characters by the same site. In IGN's Final Fantasy reader's choice, also written by Smith, Sephiroth was placed fourth, with commentary focusing on his activities in the game's plot. In a retrospective on Final Fantasy antagonists, GamesRadar listed Sephiroth as their top pick, citing his developed motives and acts of evil. GamesRadar also put Sephiroth in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number six.|$|E
