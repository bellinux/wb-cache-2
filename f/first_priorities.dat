5|$|One of Booker's <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> was {{to reduce}} the city's crime rate. In {{furtherance}} of this, he appointed Garry McCarthy, former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department, {{as director of the}} Newark Police Department. Crime reduction was such a central concern to the Booker administration that Booker, along with his security team, was known to personally patrol the streets of Newark until as late as 4a.m.|$|E

One of the <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> of the {{regeneration}} was {{the restoration}} of the dock system, which had deteriorated rapidly since the Brunswick Dock gates had been left open. Contaminated silt was removed from the dock basin, dock gates were replaced & bridges restored, whilst the dock walls were repaired. The Albert Dock company appointed Tarmac to renovate the dock's vast warehouses and repair war time bomb damage. Structural surveys carried out by the MDC found the brickwork and foundations to be in very good condition and it was considered a testament to the strict build quality of Hartley's design that a building almost 150 years old was still in such good condition.|$|E

5|$|In Diane's {{immediate}} aftermath, {{one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> {{in response}} was to distribute adequate inoculations for typhoid amongst the widespread areas left without clean drinking water. The United States Army assisted in search and rescue operations using helicopters. After the floods of Hurricane Diane, more than 100,000people fled to shelter or away from their houses. The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the {{two weeks after the}} storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. The countries of Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies. Additional flooding affected New England in September and October 1955, although neither was as major as those caused by Hurricane Diane. Following Diane, hundreds of companies affected by the flooding installed waterproof doors and windows to preempt similar disasters in the future.|$|E

25|$|The Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiés, or CORF, was {{established}} on 30 September 1927 {{to oversee the}} design, financing and construction of the Maginot Line. Its <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> were the Metz and Lauter regions. CORF built 14 gros ouvrages (large artillery positions) and 24 petit ouvrages (more lightly armed infantry works), {{as well as more}} than one hundred casemates and infantry shelters in the RF Metz. In 1929 an initial appropriation of 1,498,000,000 francs was allotted to the RF Metz, the most expensive region in the Maginot system. The highest-priority positions in the RF Metz were ouvrages Rochonvillers and Hackenberg, with work beginning in 1929. A continuation of the construction campaign starting in 1930 resulted in the construction of three more large positions, six lesser artillery ouvrages, and seven infantry positions. Four interval casemates were built in 1930. At the same time, a program to provide the Line with long-range artillery was gradually dropped as costs mounted. By November 1930 the RF Metz had been allocated 2,298,000,000 francs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the troops on Kiska, Japan had an Aleutian garrison on Attu; a U.S. Navy force of cruisers and destroyers bombarded Attu in late April 1943, but Kawase missed a chance to attack that force when a false report of an enemy ship off Shumushu in the Kurile Islands caused him instead to divert forces to deal with it, {{only to find that}} it was a neutral Soviet ship laying mines in Soviet waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula. By early May 1943, Japan had alerted the troops on Attu that an American invasion of the island was imminent. One of Kawases <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> as the new fleet commander was to send reinforcements to Attu to aid in defense of the island. However, heavy losses in the Guadalcanal campaign and the ongoing Solomon Islands campaign had forced Japan to divert forces to the defense of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and Kawase was forced to inform the island commander, Imperial Japanese Army Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki, that no reinforcements could arrive until late May, when increased fog in the Aleutians would help a reinforcement convoy avoid detection by American forces and by which time Japanese merchant ships earmarked for the reinforcement operation would have radar installed. Meanwhile, Kawase ordered Yamasaki to hold Attu with the forces he already had.|$|E

He held a series of assemblies with the Macedonian people, and [...] "exhorting them with eloquent speeches to be men, he built up their morale". He exhaustively re-trained his men with new tactics and equipment. In particular, he instigated the use of the phalanx formation by the Macedonian foot-soldiery, and equipped the troops with 6 metre long pikes (the sarissa), in contrast to the 2–3 metre spear (doru) used by Greek hoplites.|$|E

With {{the exception of}} Thunderbird 5, each vehicle was built {{in three or four}} scales. Meddings' swing-wing concept for Thunderbird 1 was inspired by his wish to create something [...] "more dynamic" [...] than a fixed-wing aircraft. He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of Thunderbird 2 until he inverted the wings, later commenting, [...] "...at the time, all aircraft had swept-back wings. I only did it to be different." [...] This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings' part. He described the Thunderbird 2 launch as [...] "probably the most memorable" [...] sequence that his team devised for an APF production.|$|E
500|$|The prince {{then found}} himself in a {{political}} dilemma. To maintain the balance against the rising tide of the conservatives, he named the leaders of the very group he had been oppressing as members of a [...] "counter-government" [...] that was meant to monitor and criticize Lon Nol's administration. One of Lon Nol's <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> was to fix the ailing economy by halting the illegal sale of rice to the communists. Soldiers were dispatched to the rice-growing areas to forcibly collect the harvests at gunpoint, and they paid only the low government price. There was widespread unrest, especially in rice-rich Battambang Province, an area long-noted for the presence of large landowners, great disparity in wealth, and where the communists still had some influence.|$|E
500|$|The {{feeling of}} urgency spread {{throughout}} Greenwich Village, even {{to people who}} had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing {{an opportunity to take}} action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, [...] "None of that! None of that!" [...] Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, [...] "It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered." [...] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.|$|E

500|$|In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) {{federation}} {{was approved}} and Fred Gardiner was named {{as its first}} chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that {{would be needed to}} put the highway through. [...] "We'll move the railway over a piece. We'll tear down the hill. We'll shift the river over a piece, then we can have the highway through there." [...] Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city's expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic Grand Central Parkway, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them. The first Metro staff survey and feasibility study of the parkway's route was approved in late 1953, before the Metro government itself came into being in 1954.|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{considered}} housing, uniforms, and recruit {{training to}} be her <b>first</b> <b>priorities</b> after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No.1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was [...] "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942, {{which was to be}} the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, [...] "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." [...] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson [...] "did the most pertinent pioneering work" [...] in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director [...] "a difficult job and often a lonely one".|$|E
