A common Ashkenazi custom is to save the etrog until Tu Bishvat and eat it in candied form or as succade, accompanied by prayers that the worshiper will merit a beautiful etrog next Sukkot. Some families make jam or liqueur out of it, or stick cloves in the skin for use as besamim at the havdalah ceremony after Shabbat.|$|E
25|$|Whitman was re-elected in 1997, {{narrowly}} defeating Jim McGreevey, {{the mayor}} of Woodbridge Township, who criticized Whitman's record on property taxes and automobile insurance rates. McGreevey also criticized Whitman for allowing a private sector company to administer the vehicle inspection program. In the 1997 election, the early prediction was that Whitman, as an incumbent, would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> win. The result, however, was that Whitman duplicated her 1993 election with only a one-point victory and a plurality of the votes. Murray Sabrin, a college professor who ran as a Libertarian candidate, and finished third with {{five percent of the}} vote, received votes mostly from conservative Republicans who might otherwise have voted for Whitman.|$|E

25|$|The island fit the {{criteria}} {{as it had}} excellent visibility {{up and down the}} James River, and it was far enough inland to minimize the potential of contact and conflict with enemy ships. The water immediately adjacent to the land was deep enough to permit the colonists to anchor their ships, yet <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> and quick departure if necessary. An additional benefit of the site was that the land was not occupied by the Virginia Indians, most of whom were affiliated with the Powhatan Confederacy. Largely cut off from the mainland, the shallow harbor afforded the earliest settlers docking of their ships. This was its greatest attraction, but it also created a number of challenging problems for the settlers.|$|E
25|$|Roy Heffernan was {{a native}} Australian, born in Lithgow NSW, and was an avid {{weightlifter}} and bodybuilder in his teens. He was trained by his father, {{who was also a}} bodybuilder, and won the Mr. Australia title before making his wrestling debut at the age of twenty. Heffernan did not <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> time moving up the ranks in Australian pro wrestling, as the belief at the time was that a wrestler really had to go overseas to North America and learn to be a pro before the bookers would even consider moving them up the rankings of the promotion. After working on the lower cards in Australia, Heffernan left his home country in 1953 to come to America in the hopes of attaining more success there.|$|E
25|$|Some Roman units {{began the}} battle without orders to do so, believing they would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> victory, and perhaps over-eager to exact revenge on the Goths {{after two years}} of {{unchecked}} devastation throughout the Balkans. The imperial scholae of shield-archers under the command of the Iberian prince Bacurius attacked, but lacking support they were easily pushed back. Then the Roman left-wing reached the circle of wagons, but it was too late. At that moment, the Gothic cavalry, returning from a foraging expedition, arrived to support the infantry. The cavalry surrounded the Roman troops, who were already in disarray after the failure of the first assault. The Romans retreated {{to the base of the}} hill where they were unable to maneuver, encumbered by their heavy armor and long shields. The casualties, exhaustion, and psychological pressure led to a rout of the Roman army. The cavalry continued their attack, and the killing continued until nightfall.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Substation Curaçao {{purchased}} Chapman {{to refurbish}} her and modify her {{for use as}} a seagoing mothership for the deep-diving scientific and tourist submarine Curasub. Modifications involved the installation of amenities for embarked scientists and tourists and of a 110-ton knuckle boom crane on Chapmans after deck to launch and retrieve both the submarine and its floating dock, both of which can be carried on Chapmans after deck. During submarine operations, the floating dock is lowered over the side and secured to Chapman so that Curasubs passengers <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> and convenient way to embark on and disembark from the submarine without the danger of launching Curasub into the water with them already aboard; Curasub also is lowered over the side and operates from the floating dock, which includes a docking cradle for the submarine. Chapmans redesign also made provision for the temporary installation of two 20-foot (6.1-meter) intermodal containers, one configured {{for use as a}} wet laboratory and the other for use as a dry laboratiory, which can be carried on her deck when needed for the support of embarked scientists and stored ashore during tourist use of Curasub.|$|E
25|$|Evidence in debates is {{organized}} into units called cards (because such evidence was originally printed on note cards, though the practice {{has long been}} out of favor). Cards are designed to condense an author's argument so that debaters <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> way to access the information. A card is composed of three parts: the tag, the cite, and the body. The tag is the debater's summary of the argument presented in the body. A tag is usually {{only one or two}} sentences. The cite contains all relevant citation information (that is, the author, date of publication, journal, title, etc.). Although every card should contain a complete citation, only the author's name and date of publication are typically spoken aloud in a speech. Some teams will also read the author's qualifications if they wish to emphasize this information. The body is a fragment of the author's original text. The length of a body can vary greatly—cards can be as short as a few sentences and as long as two or more pages. Most cards are between one and five paragraphs in length. The body of a card is often underlined or highlighted in order to eliminate unnecessary or redundant sentences when the card is read in a round. In a round, the tag is read first, followed by the cite and the body.|$|E

[...] Fortunately, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849–1918).|$|E
500|$|Two days later, on 26 August, the Beatles {{travelled}} {{by train}} {{to the college}} campus in Bangor, Wales. It was perhaps {{the first time the}} band had travelled without their tour managers and they had not even thought to bring money. The station was mobbed because of a bank holiday and Cynthia Lennon, mistaken for a fan, was held back. She ran after the train but missed it and arrived later by car. The group, along with Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Cilla Black, Harrison's sister-in-law Jenny Boyd, and around 300 others, learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation, and were given their mantras. The group [...] "hesitated only slightly" [...] when asked to donate the customary week's wages, a large sum for a Beatle, to learn. While there, they announced at a press conference that they were giving up drugs (apparently referring to psychedelics, but not marijuana). This was a choice [...] "in keeping with the Maharishi's teachings" [...] but one made prior to meeting the Maharishi. The Maharishi did advise them privately to avoid involvement with the [...] "Ban the Bomb" [...] movement and to support the elected government of the day. Their intention was to attend the entire ten-day seminar but their stay was cut short by the death of their manager, Epstein, in London on 27 August. The Maharishi consoled them by saying that Epstein's spirit was still with them and their good thoughts would help him [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> passage" [...] and journey to his [...] "next evolution". According to McCartney, the Maharishi [...] "was great to us when Brian died" [...] and Cynthia Lennon wrote [...] "it was as though, with Brian gone, the four needed someone new to give them direction and the Maharishi was {{in the right place at}} the right time." ...|$|E

Holm's final appearance as a character was in the short stories [...] "Iris", [...] "Lida," [...] and [...] "Luella," [...] contained within the 1948 collection Saint Errant; the next direct reference to her does not appear in print until the 1983 novel Salvage for the Saint.|$|E
2500|$|The {{games in}} the Madeline series have a point and click interface, which players use to {{navigate}} {{through a series of}} static screens, interact with characters, and manipulate objects to complete tasks and to overcome obstacles at a comfortable speed. The gameplay was compared to other edutainment games, such as Big Thinkers, [...] Fisher-Price video games, [...] JumpStart, and [...] Reader Rabbit.

The games are thorough and informative, yet <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> to use, straight-forward design. The interface varies {{over the course of the}} series. While Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show and Madeline's European Adventures were designed to look and play like interactive storybook adventure games, others such as Madeline Thinking Games were designed as a series of activities within the game.

They built castles at Nicastro, Maida, Feroleto, Lamezia Terme and one also at Amato. Some of these Norman castles still exist today.
