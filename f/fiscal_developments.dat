40|$|We use a new {{approach}} to assess long-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>developments.</b> By analyzing the time varying behaviour of the two components of government spending and revenue – responsiveness and persistence – we are able to infer about the sources of fiscal behaviour. Drawing on quarterly data we estimate recursively these components within a system of government revenue and spending equations using a Three-Stage Least Square method. In this way we track <b>fiscal</b> <b>developments,</b> i. e. possible fiscal deteriorations and/or improvements for eight European Union countries plus the US. Results suggest that positions have not significantly changed for Finland, France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the US, whilst they have improved for Belgium, Italy, and the Netherland...|$|E
40|$|Real {{interest}} rates {{appear to have}} risen in virtually all industrialized countries relative to levels that prevailed in the 1960 s and 1970 s. There is increasing concern that this may reflect higher public debt, which is crowding out private sector activity. Over the last two decades, {{there has also been}} increasing international capital market integration. This suggests that {{interest rates}} in any country may be sensitive to global <b>fiscal</b> <b>developments.</b> This paper estimates the effects of aggregate <b>fiscal</b> <b>developments</b> in the industrialized world on real interest rates in nine industrial countries. The results imply that the increase in OECD-wide government debt since the late 1970 s was a major factor explaining the rise in real interest rates. ...|$|E

It finds {{that while the}} overall fiscal balance improved in most of them, the composition of this improvement differed. In countries without IMF-supported programmes, revenues increased modestly and expenditure declined sharply, while in programme countries both post-programme revenue and expenditure declined. However, in countries with programmes that included fiscal structural conditions, the adjustment was effected primarily through sharp expenditure compression. No evidence of a statistically significant impact of IMF conditionality was found. Moreover, <b>fiscal</b> <b>developments</b> were influenced by cyclical factors and by the general stance of macroeconomic policies.

50|$|In {{the reign}} of King John (1199-1216), the loss of Normandy and his {{concessions}} {{to the demands of}} the feudal barons set out in Magna Carta rendered financial re-adjustment inevitable. During the long reign of King Henry III(1216-1272), the enforcement by the barons of their privileges granted by Magna Carta acted on the fiscal system by checking the king's arbitrary use of tallages and, as a consequence, encouraged regular assessments of a tax on movables, which became more prevalent over time. The developing concept of necessity to obtain consent of tax-payers before imposition operated to encourage the establishment of bodies representing the various social classes.

Furthermore, the cyclical impact on the general government budget balance seems most often to be relatively modest compared to that of discretionary fiscalpolicy changes. However, calculations on the cyclical budget volatility also seem to suggest that the cyclically adjusted budget balance has to be in surplus in periods with strong economic growth if the automatic stabilisers should be allowed to work freely during a cyclical downturn without violating a 3 -per-cent budget criteria (the reference value in the Maastricht Treaty) ...|$|R
