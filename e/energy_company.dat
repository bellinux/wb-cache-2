40|$|The Swedish {{energy market}} {{consists}} of several different <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> that possess different ownership structures. The strategical directions {{of the different}} <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> are highly dependent on these ownership structures, {{due to the fact}} that the different owners decides the overall aim of the ownership which then is considered when creating a strategy. There are three dominant ownership structures for the <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> within the Swedish energy market today which are; privately owned, governmentally owned and lastly <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> owned by a municipality, often called regional <b>energy</b> <b>companies.</b> The strategical direction for the privately and governmentally owned <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> are somewhat similar, where highprofitability often is prioritized combined with a sufficient sustainability. However, the strategical direction of the different regional <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> differs greatly, depending on several different factors. The aim of this study is therefore to identify the strategical direction for 6 investigated regional <b>energy</b> <b>companies,</b> by examining different internal and external factors affecting this strategical direction. The study was based on 6 interviews with company representatives from each of the studied companies, where 5 of these representatives possessed the role as CEO and one possessed the role as senior advisor. These interviews was conducted in order to get a good understanding of the strategical direction of each company, and to identify the different internal and external factors affecting these. The results of this study identified several different external factors affecting the regional <b>energy</b> <b>companies,</b> which was then divided into 6 different categories; Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and lastly Legal. Different internal factors were also identified and categorized into five different areas, which were Politicians as owners, Aim of ownership, State of municipality, Risk management and Interpretation of municipal law. These factors was then used in order to identify the strategical directions of the studied regional <b>energy</b> <b>companies,</b> which differed substantially. However, there were areas within the different strategical directions that was similar to all investigatedcompanies. For example, all 6 investigated companies expressed the importance of aligning the <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> and their offering with the changing customer demand that is highly connected to the increasing digitalization of the Swedish energy market...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is important – but an {{energy saving potential}} has yet to reach its full range. Energy services are means to reach that potential and <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> are stressed as important actors into creating an established market for energy services. Energy services are tools that include providing in-direct services such as energy statistics, audits, declarations, consultations and analysis. It also includes a number of more complex and direct services, for example energy efficiency measurements or service contracts. This report {{is a result of}} a study on Danish and Swedish <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> offering <b>energy</b> services, based on the market they act upon. It aims to find their driving forces for providing energy services. It also looks closer into whether publically and privately owned <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> differ and if there exist contradictions to both supply energy and energy services at the same time. It also looks into how <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> are affected and feel about national regulatory instruments. <b>Energy</b> <b>companies</b> in both countries offering energy services are reaching a wide spectrum of client segments and energy services. They often have the possibility to combine and package energy supply with energy services and they can reduce many of the theoretical barriers to energy efficiency by offering energy services. They are driven by a client demand and a closer client relationship, both leading to a decreased supply client fluctuation. A new business opportunity and a green profile strategy are also driving factors. Energy services also help <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> to decrease heavy investment on existing equipment by having more control over their clients’ energy use and reducing energy utilization tops. Danish <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> are tied to an energy saving obligation scheme, providing them with conditions, which their market is based, whilst Swedish <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> offering <b>energy</b> services act on a market that is created by them and their competitors derive from different business backgrounds. There exist an assertive regulatory instrument in Denmark affecting driving factors for public and private <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> and clients. In Sweden regulatory instruments, such as energy efficiency programmes, subsidises for energy audits and voluntary agreements for industries affect <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> in a less way than in Denmark, mostly increasing a client demand for energy services. The regulatory instruments in Denmark increase a trust for <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> as <b>energy</b> service providers as in Sweden they are trusted upon their existing substantial role on the energy market, a reputation of knowledge and experience and a strategy aiming towards visualisation, motivation and education for the clients. Public <b>energy</b> <b>companies</b> feel a responsibility towards their public owners to offer an efficient energy supply and by having a local connection to the municipality they are able to increase competiveness in the region by offering <b>energy</b> services. Private <b>companies</b> are substantially larger than public companies and have a great potential to reach out to a larger number of clients through their existing supply client stock. This is of substantial higher relevance in Sweden than Denmark. ...|$|R

Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs.
