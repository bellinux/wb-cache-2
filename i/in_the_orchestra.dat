5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra.</b>|$|E
5|$|The chamber version {{replaces the}} brass mostly by the organ and uses only one each of flute, oboe, {{clarinet}} and horn. Timpani, percussion and harp {{are the same}} as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> version, and for the strings, a minimum of two first violins, two second violins, two violas, one cello and one double bass required.|$|E
5|$|After a demo of {{the song}} was {{approved}} by the film's producers, both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London. Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums. The recordings were finished by the time Casino Royale finished its principal photography on July 21, 2006, and Arnold played it at the wrap party. Afterwards he mixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> parts.|$|E

5|$|One of the boys, Hugh Masekela at St Peter's School, told Father Huddleston of his {{discovery}} of the music of Louis Armstrong. Huddleston found a trumpet for him and as the interest in making music caught on among the other boys, the Huddleston Jazz Band was formed. Hugh Masekela did not stay very long in Sophiatown.

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is {{manipulating}} the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Battista Barbirolli {{was born}} in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British {{national}} from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1928), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo {{and his father had}} played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square.|$|E

50|$|When <b>in</b> 1998 <b>the</b> Royal Danish <b>Orchestra</b> {{celebrated its}} 550th anniversary, Borge was {{appointed}} an honorary member — {{at that time}} one of only ten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra's</b> history.|$|R
5|$|In 1943 Barbirolli {{made another}} Atlantic crossing, {{avoiding}} {{death by a}} fluke: he changed flights with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; Howard's was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage {{the management of the}} orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé's former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the leading}} {{members of the}} LPO {{organisation}} were Jurowski, Andrés Orozco-Estrada (principal guest conductor), Pieter Schoeman (leader), Magnus Lindberg (composer in residence) and Timothy Walker (chief executive and artistic director). Seventeen of the orchestra's principal players held professorships at British conservatoires, including the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. In addition to its regular concerts at the Festival Hall, and its annual season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> pit at Glyndebourne, the LPO has residencies at the Congress Theatre, Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome, and tours in Britain and overseas remain {{an important part of}} the orchestra's schedule.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was nine}} years old Monteux was {{admitted}} to the Conservatoire de Paris. He studied the violin with Jules Garcin and Henri Berthelier, composition with Charles Lenepveu, and harmony and theory with Albert Lavignac. His fellow violin students included George Enescu, Carl Flesch, Fritz Kreisler and Jacques Thibaud. Among the piano students at the Conservatoire was Alfred Cortot, with whom he developed a lifelong friendship. At the age of twelve, Monteux organised and conducted a small orchestra of Conservatoire students to accompany Cortot in performances of concertos in and around Paris. He attended the world premiere of César Franck's Symphony in February 1889. From 1889 to 1892, while still a student, he played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> of the Folies Bergère; he later said to George Gershwin that his rhythmic sense was formed during the experience of playing popular dance music there.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1999, <b>the</b> <b>orchestra's</b> artistic {{management}} was reformed, with authority vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of three artistic leaders, {{rather than one}} conductor. <b>In</b> 2002, <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> renamed itself again, to the Koninklijke Filharmonie van Vlaanderen, or deFilharmonie.|$|R

5|$|At the Conservatoire Massenet studied solfège with Augustin Savard and {{the piano}} with François Laurent. He pursued his studies, with modest distinction, until the {{beginning}} of 1855, when family concerns disrupted his education. Alexis Massenet's health was poor, and on medical advice he moved from Paris to Chambéry in the south of France; the family, including Massenet, moved with him. Again, Massenet's own memoirs and the researches of his biographers are at variance: the composer recalled his exile in Chambéry as lasting for two years; Henry Finck and Irvine record that the young man returned to Paris and the Conservatoire in October 1855. On his return he lodged with relations in Montmartre and resumed his studies; by 1859 he had progressed so far as to win the Conservatoire's top prize for pianists. The family's finances were no longer comfortable, and to support himself Massenet took private piano students and played as a percussionist in theatre orchestras. His work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra</b> pit gave him a good working knowledge of the operas of Gounod and other composers, classic and contemporary. Traditionally, many students at the Conservatoire went on to substantial careers as church organists; with that in mind Massenet enrolled for organ classes, but they were not a success and he quickly abandoned the instrument. He gained some work as a piano accompanist, in the course of which he met Wagner who, along with Berlioz, was one of his two musical heroes.|$|E
5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>orchestra,</b> and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
25|$|Alemán was a tailor's cutter in Santiago de Las Vegas and a {{composer}} of dance and religious music.
