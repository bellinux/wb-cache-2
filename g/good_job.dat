5|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Writer Gordon stated that director Bowman {{did a great}} job in mining his script for chills. In their book, X-Treme Possibilities, authors Keith Topping and Paul Cornell praised the episode, including Benzali's performance and the sequence in the graveyard {{at the end of the}} episode. Series creator Chris Carter called the episode one of the ones he was most proud of from the second season, stating that Gordon did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> with the script and Bowman {{did a great job}} with the directing.|$|E

As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the Socialist German Student Union, he was a good friend of Rudi Dutschke before marrying, getting a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> and abandoning his ideals.|$|E

40|$|We analyze how {{changes in}} location-specific trade {{exposure}} a¤ect employment growth in US local labor markets between 1990 and 2010. In particular, {{our focus is}} investigating heterogeneous effects on local employment growth of <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> versus bad jobs. We have three main findings. First, rising local exposure to import competition, via falling local tariffs or rising Chinese import penetration, destroys bad <b>jobs</b> but creates <b>good</b> <b>jobs.</b> Conversely, greater local access to foreign markets creates bad <b>jobs</b> but destroys <b>good</b> <b>jobs.</b> Third, falling local tariff protection is substantially more important, economically and statistically, than rising local exposure to Chinese import penetration...|$|R

5|$|Boise State {{came into}} the game {{averaging}} 42.75points and 475.67yards per game, the fourth and twelfth highest totals in college football. Senior quarterback Taylor Tharp led the offense by more than 3,000yards and 28 touchdowns, headed into the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. On the ground, the Broncos were led by junior running back Ian Johnson, who had 17touchdowns and 1,030yards in the regular season. Wide receiver Jeremy Childs also was a potent threat on offense, averaging 87.08receiving yards per game, and backup running back D.J. Harper rushed for 41.44yards per game on average. Johnson and Childs both earned First Team All-WAC honors, and Tharp was named to Second Team All-WAC. Offensive tackle Ryan Clady was the team's only All-American, and promised to do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> protecting Taylor Tharp on the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E

5|$|At universities, {{appointments}} to top posts were {{the subject of}} power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards and the National Socialist German Students' League. In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period. This was especially true of universities located in predominately Catholic regions. Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors {{had been forced to}} leave the profession, so medical graduates had <b>good</b> <b>job</b> prospects. From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA. First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service); an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.|$|E
5|$|Hollis raised {{mortgages}} {{to pay for}} improvements, but receipts {{were down}} to £1,821 in 1839, the last full year of operation before the London and Southampton Railway opened. The receipts were obtained from tolls, as all freight was moved by independent carriers. At this point, Hollis gave control of the navigation to members of his family. His son managed it until 1841, when a banker called W. W. Bulpett, who was a mortgagee, took over. In 1847 he was given notice to quit by the Hollis family, despite having done a <b>good</b> <b>job,</b> but he refused. F. W. Hollis eventually obtained most of the shares from the other family members, and started legal action to remove Bulpett. Railway competition had caused {{a sharp drop in}} receipts, from £1,012 in 1843 to £430 in 1861, and payments to shareholders and mortgagees ceased in 1850 and 1857. In 1863, Bulpett was replaced by Mr Clarke, formerly the manager of the Andover Canal, but Bulpett returned when he won the action brought by Hollis.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen.
