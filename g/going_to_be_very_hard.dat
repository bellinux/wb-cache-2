500|$|The Silver Samurai, {{rendered}} by Weta Digital, {{was based}} on a model that had been 3D printed and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome. We were worried {{that he was going to}} look incredibly digital and that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to make him look solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr Dinos {{began his}} third {{campaign}} in the Group Two Henry II Stakes over two miles at Sandown Park Racecourse on 26 May {{in which he was}} ridden by Frankie Dettori. He started 6/1 second favourite behind the Doncaster Cup winner Boreas with the other runners including Persian Punch, Bangalore and Hugs Dancer (Ebor Handicap). After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Pole Star and Kasthari. Dettori, who was contracted to ride Mamool in the season's major staying events said of the winner [...] "I like him a lot. That was a tremendous performance first time out. He's done well over the winter. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to get by. We will give him a big race but he must be a big danger in the Gold Cup." ...|$|E

5000|$|Native American {{activist and}} actor Russell Means was less kind about {{some aspects of}} the film's {{technical}} accuracy. In 2009, he said [...] "Remember Lawrence of Arabia? That was Lawrence of the Plains. The odd thing about making that movie is that they had a woman teaching the actors the Lakota language, but Lakota has a male-gendered language and a female-gendered language. Some of the Indians and Kevin Costner were speaking in the feminine way. When I went to see it with a bunch of Lakota guys, we were laughing." [...] Other Native Americans like Michael Smith (Sioux), Director of San Francisco's long-running annual American Indian Film Festival, said, [...] "There's a lot of good feeling about the film in the Indian community, especially among the tribes.

50|$|Qubad Kamran's Grand Vizier Alqash {{heard the}} fame of Khawaja Bakht Jamal so he visited him and tested {{him for his}} {{knowledge}} of astrology. He was surprised when Khawaja Bakht Jamal told him some issues only Alqash knew himself. He was deeply impressed by Khawaja's knowledge and became his pupil. Khawaja Bakht Jamal taught Alqash all aspects of astrology. During this period they got {{close to each other}} and became good friends.

5000|$|The list of {{nominees for}} Ireland's Greatest was criticised by historians Diarmuid Ferriter, Tim Pat Coogan, and Maurice Manning, and Irish Times {{columnist}} Noel Whelan They {{said that the}} list was skewed towards recent times, and that many nominees were celebrities from popular culture or sport rather than people who had made a lasting contribution to society; Ferriter said [...] "It is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to take this seriously for historians". Ryan Tubridy, who presents [...] The Late Late Show, commented, [...] "There are some really silly names in there. It's contentious to say the least". Liam Dolan in the Sunday Independent called it [...] "a shambolic litany of well-intentioned do-gooders and talented non-entities". People whose inclusion attracted criticism included Stephen Gately, Louis Walsh and Daniel O'Donnell. The Belfast Telegraph noted the absence of Van Morrison and George Best; other absentees noted were Michael Davitt, John McCormack, [...] William Rowan Hamilton, Lady Gregory, and Samuel Beckett. Ken Sweeney in the Irish Independent criticised the ranking of Stephen Gately ahead of Éamon de Valera. The dearth of women —3 out of 40— was also noted.

40|$|Interviews from an ethnographic {{study of}} {{elementary}} school teachers and students are cited to support the conclusion that an ethic of caring {{is essential to the}} definition of effective teaching. A process for restructuring teacher education programs on the basis of an ethic of caring is described. Seven characteristics of a teacher education program designed to promote the development of an ethic of caring are described: curriculum construction, modeling, dialogue, reflection, confirmation, practice, and continuity. It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to leave you! I have had a great time with you. Thanks for all you’ve done to help me. I’m really going to miss you. You taught me the two most valuable lessons of all: to be myself, and to give my all to all I do, to try my hardest, and to do my best. You have been my best teacher and my best friend. You have kept me at the top because you care for me. I want to tell you thanks for everything you’ve given me, for caring for me, and for being yourself. No one can ever take the place of you.
