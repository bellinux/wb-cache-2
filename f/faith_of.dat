5|$|Vithoba is {{the focus}} of the monotheistic, non-Brahamanical Varkari <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> Maharashtra and the Haridasa <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> Karnataka. Vitthal Temple, Pandharpur is his main temple. Vithoba legends revolve around his devotee Pundalik, who is {{credited}} with bringing the deity to Pandharpur, and around Vithoba's role as a saviour to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. The Varkari poet-saints are known for their unique genre of devotional lyric, the abhang, dedicated to Vithoba and composed in Marathi. Other devotional literature dedicated to Vithoba includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa and Marathi versions of the generic aarti songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on Shayani Ekadashi in the month of Ashadha, and Prabodhini Ekadashi in the month of Kartik.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in {{defiance}} of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest.

5|$|In 1517, the Wittenberg monk Martin Luther publicised The Ninety-Five Theses, {{challenging}} the Roman Catholic Church and initiating the Protestant Reformation. In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg established Lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> the prince {{was to be}} the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> his subjects, a principle called Cuius regio, eius religio. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the Reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in Electorate of Cologne in 1583. From the Cologne War {{until the end of the}} Thirty Years' Wars (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands. The latter reduced the overall population of the German states by about 30 per cent, and in some places, up to 80 per cent. The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the German states. German rulers were able to choose either Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism or the Reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.|$|E

5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> both services in ASDIC proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E
5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

5|$|The Gospels portray Jesus {{teaching}} in well-defined sessions, such as Matthew's Sermon on the Mount or Luke's parallel Sermon on the Plain. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which {{had originally been}} recorded without context. While Jesus' miracles fit within {{the social context of}} antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.|$|E

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned the catechism perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic <b>faith</b> <b>of</b> his French {{allies and}} {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
