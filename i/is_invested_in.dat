25|$|One {{hypothesis}} for {{vulnerability to}} pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal {{conflict between the}} maternal organism and fetus. After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients. Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries. It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased {{blood flow to the}} impaired placenta. This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus <b>is</b> <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> only its survival and fitness while the mother <b>is</b> <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> this and subsequent pregnancies.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{introduce}} intensified crop production {{with an emphasis}} on rice grown year after year in the same field, have been somewhat successful. Rice cultivation in this historically cold region has been made easier in recent decades due to global warming. This is largely due to the exhaustion of Zafimaniry land for traditional swidden agriculture, which has forced the Zafimaniry {{to find a way to}} adopt rice cultivation despite the unadapted nature of the mountainous terrain where they live. The terrain and climate require highly complex terracing and irrigation systems that the local population lacks the knowledge to build, so they are required to hire Betsileo specialists to construct their paddies. Most cash income the Zafimaniry use <b>is</b> <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> the construction of terraces for rice cultivation.|$|E

500|$|Erin Mullally {{was cast}} in the role and began filming {{immediately}} after Sorensen's departure from the production. In {{a statement from the}} press office at Five, they stated: [...] "As the character of Declan is extremely popular, and with some sensational storylines planned, it was decided that the character would be recast" [...] Sorensen expressed his delight that his character would continue {{as a part of the}} series saying: [...] "I'm really happy the character's going to continue because the producers and writers have given Declan some fantastic storylines. I'm really proud he's become as popular as he has." [...] At the time it was noted that recasts have occurred repeatedly throughout the history of the programme, creator of Neighbours, Reg Watson previously explained why he thought recasts were quintessential in the show saying: [...] "I always believed it was a pity, when actors chose to leave a serial that the character should go as well. A lot of time and money <b>is</b> <b>invested</b> <b>in</b> the character so we decided to recast if the character was important to the future of the storyline and the show itself." [...] It was this explanation that backed up Declan's recast. Sorensen also explained that the hand-over process would be simple adding: [...] "It'll be nothing over the top. I'm Declan one day and the next day it's Erin. Pretty simple. That's how it works, I can't continue, so Erin comes in and picks up the baton. I think it's easier for the viewers to accept when it's a simple change-over." [...] The recast had also upset fans of the character under the portrayal of Sorensen, in response to this he said: [...] "Erin will come in and play his version of Declan, he can't play it exactly as I do and I and the producers would never expect him to do it any other way. All I can say to the Declan supporters is that Erin will be terrific, give him a go, you'll be surprised." ...|$|E
