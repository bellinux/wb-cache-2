Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any other developed countries, and this was highlighted by the <b>Government</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010.

5|$|Operating {{funds for}} the ferry system, reliant on gas taxes raised by the state, were {{left out of the}} 1989 budget because of a dispute in the state <b>government.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the MV Tyee and two {{additional}} passenger-only ferries intended to serve Vashon Island were pulled from service in June 1989. The three ferries were loaned to the San Francisco Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake left the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge closed for repairs.

The Spanish conquest created a system of wealthy European landowners overseeing a labor force composed of slaves and bonded laborers.

At this point, rising global demand for coffee made its export {{a significant source of}} income for the <b>government.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the state supported the coffee growers by passing legislation that took land away from the Indian population, as well as relaxing labor laws so that bonded labor could be used on the plantations.|$|E

Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. <b>government</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex.

5|$|Shortly {{after these}} events, Russia {{experienced}} the February Revolution, which brought to power a liberal Russian Provisional <b>Government.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> consequence of these, the whole transfer project was delayed, but the Russian acceptance of self-determination facilitated renewed political action.
