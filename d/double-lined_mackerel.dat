50|$|The <b>double-lined</b> <b>{{mackerel}}</b> (Grammatorcynus bilineatus), is {{a species}} of Spanish mackerel (tribe Scomberomorini) in the family Scombridae. It is a commercial fish and is distributed from the Red Sea to the Andaman Sea, also from the northern coast of Australia to the Ryukyu Islands, as far as Fiji. It is mostly found in shallow waters.|$|E
40|$|The family Scombridae (under {{the order}} Perciformes of sub-class Actinopterygii) {{comprises}} four 	 subfamilies viz., Gasterochismatinae, Thunninae, Scomberomorinae and Scombrinae. The first subfamily 	 includes just one member, Gasterochisma melampus Richardson, {{popularly known as}} the butterfly mackerel 	 which has a southern and disjunct distribution, occurring on coast of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia 	 and Argentina. Thunninae includes a large assemblage of species, called tunnies coming under the genera 	 Auxis Cuvier, Cybiosarda Whitley, Sarda Cuvier, Gymnosarda Gill, Thunnus South, Allothunnus 	 Serventy, Orcynopsis Gill, Katsuwonus Kishinouye and Euthynnus Jordan and Gilbert. The genus 	 Thunnus comprises several subgenera, viz., Thunnus S. Str., Parathunnus Kishinouye, Kishinoella 	 Jordan and Hubbs and Neothunnus Kishinouye. Scomberomorinae has the seer fishes under the genus 	 Scomberomorus Lacepede and the Wahoo under Acanthocybium Gill. The subfamilyScombrinae includes 	 the chub mackerels or the true mackerels and the <b>double-lined</b> <b>mackerel</b> under the genera Scomber 	 Linnaeus, Rastrelliger Jordan and Starks and Grammatorcynus Gill. Most members of these four 	 subfamilies are well distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. Some, however, are restricted in their distribution 	 to temperate regions only as Scomber scombrus, Orcynopsis unicolor and Allothunnus fallai Serventy. 	 The genus Rastrelliger has two valid species i. e. R. kanagurta (Cuvier) and R. brachysoma (Bleeker) 	 occurring in the seas aound India, the former being by far the commonest and most abundant mackerel 	 species in this region...|$|E
