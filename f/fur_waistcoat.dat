6000|$|A year's absence {{had made}} no small {{difference}} in that gentleman. A youth who had been deservedly whipped a few months previously, and who spent his pocket-money on tarts and hardbake, now appeared before Pen {{in one of those}} costumes to which the public consent, that I take to be quite as influential in this respect as 'Johnson's Dictionary,' has awarded the title of [...] "Swell.' He had a bull-dog between his legs, and in his scarlet shawl neckcloth was a pin representing another bull-dog in gold: he wore a <b>fur</b> <b>waistcoat</b> laced over with gold chains; a green cutaway coat with basket-buttons, and a white upper-coat ornamented with cheese-plate buttons, on each of which was engraved some stirring incident of the road or the chase; all which ornaments set off this young fellow's figure to such advantage, that you would hesitate to say which character in life he most resembled, and whether he was a boxer en goguette, or a coachman in his gala suit.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{an evening}} the Wimblehurst blade, shiny-faced from a wash {{and with some}} loud finery, a {{coloured}} waistcoat or a vivid tie, would betake himself to the Eastry Arms billiard-room, or to the bar parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played. One soon sickened of his slow knowingness, the cunning observation of his deadened eyes, his idea of a [...] "good story," [...] always, always told in undertones, poor dirty worm! his shrewd, elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage, a drink to the good or such-like deal. There rises before my eyes as I write, young Hopley Dodd, {{the son of the}} Wimblehurst auctioneer, the pride of Wimblehurst, its finest flower, with his <b>fur</b> <b>waistcoat</b> and his bulldog pipe, his riding breeches--he had no horse--and his gaiters, as he used to sit, leaning forward and watching the billiard-table from under the brim of his artfully tilted hat. A half-dozen phrases constituted his conversation: [...] "hard lines!" [...] he used to say, and [...] "Good baazness," [...] in a bass bleat. Moreover, he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment. Night after night he was there.|$|E
50|$|The basic female {{clothing}} for all classes {{over the period}} was a simple sleeved tunic dress, with a vertical slit, usually laced, at the bodice, at least for women of an age to breast-feed. The borders and hems might be decorated with embroidery, very richly so for the upper classes. Hose were apparently often worn underneath, their length presumably depending on the weather, as the dress came near to the ankle throughout the period. An under-tunic might also be worn, and cloaks and mantles for winter or outside wear. With the coming of Christianity, married women were expected to cover their hair, at least in public, with a loose shoulder cape, mantle or kerchief. It appears that fur was mostly worn out of sight, as a lining, or perhaps like the <b>fur</b> <b>waistcoats</b> (probably worn lining outermost) known from the later Middle Ages.|$|R
5000|$|Late In 1784, Crosbie {{exhibited}} his [...] "Aeronautic Chariot" [...] at {{an exhibition}} at Ranelagh Gardens in Dublin. Made of wood covered with cloth, {{designed and built}} by himself, the Chariot resembled a boat, with rudder and sails, intended to enable navigation in the air, reducing reliance on wind direction. His first flight took place on 19 January 1785 at Ranelagh, witnessed by more than 35,000 people. The balloon and chariot were beautifully painted with the arms of Ireland supported by Minerva and Mercury, and with emblematic figures of the wind. Crosbie's aerial dress [...] "consisted of a robe of oiled silk, lined with white <b>fur,</b> his <b>waistcoat</b> and breeches in one, of white satin quilted, and morocco boots, and a montero cap of leopard skin".|$|R
