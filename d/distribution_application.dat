40|$|Content {{distribution}} {{has become}} a major function of the Internet. However, the current Internet content distribution infrastructure is largely closed to end-to-end applications, making it challenging for the application community to utilize in-network storage resources. In this paper, we investigate a simple paradigm named SAILOR that introduces application-definable, shared in-networkdatalockers to effectively facilitate the construction of highly efficient, cooperative content <b>distribution</b> <b>applications.</b> We design and implement a prototype of SAILOR and integrate it with two popular content <b>distribution</b> <b>applications</b> for file and live streaming respectively. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that SAILOR can significantly improve both network efficiency and application performance, thereby benefiting both network providers and application providers...|$|R
40|$|Problem: Since {{there is}} not much inside {{information}} available, the problem that will be handled by this thesis is the coordination of warehousing activities within the logistics centers put to use by the Olympic Summer Games from 2000 to 2008. A special attention is given to certain requirements such as layout, capacity management, ownership and <b>distribution</b> <b>applications.</b> Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is based on warehouse requirementsand their specific adjustment to the Olympic Summer Games, further emphasizing on <b>distribution</b> <b>applications</b> influencing the capacityand ownership. Theory: The theoretical section touches upon event logistics, the Olympic Games and more importantly, logistics centers as a generic termfor distribution facilities and warehouses. Further, types of warehouses, capacity management, ownership and <b>distribution</b> <b>applications</b> are examined {{in order to be able}} to compare the various Games. Method: The method for this research is based on a case study conducted by semi-structured interviews with several people involved in the logistics organization of the Games. All interviews are conducted over the telephone and analyzed accordingly. However, secondary data was of high importance due to the limited number of interview respondents. Conclusion: All analyzed features of a warehouse facility had to be more efficiently and effectively performed in order to serve the great approach for the Olympic Summer Games. The implementation of <b>distribution</b> <b>applications</b> was not sophisticated enough to benefit capacity savings. The leased ownership situation and outsourcing to third party logistics providers were advantageous, but did not further influence the planning and utilization phase of the Olympic Games...|$|R

40|$|Content <b>distribution</b> <b>applications,</b> such {{as those}} {{employing}} peer-to-peer (P 2 P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and make up {{a large portion of}} the traffic in many networks. Often, however, content <b>distribution</b> <b>applications</b> use network resources inefficiently. One way to improve efficiency is to introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable cooperation between end-host and in-network content distribution mechanisms. This is the capability provided by a DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system, which is introduced in this document. DECADE enables applications to take advantage of in-network storage when distributing data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end resources. This document presents the underlying principles and key functionalities of such a system and illustrates operation through a set of examples. Alimi, et al. Informational [Page 1...|$|R
