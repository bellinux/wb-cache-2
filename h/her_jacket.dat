5|$|The visual {{opens with}} Stan moving out <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> while wearing a blonde wig. Subsequently, a {{mountain}} is presented, following which the singer is portrayed with a husky dog {{in front of}} a snowy landscape, sporting a white hoodie. Following this, footage with two horses running free is shown, with her tossing her hair in a similar way to the animals' shakes. Over the rest of the music video, Stan further performs to the song, while band Havana make a cameo appearance and are seen in several scenes interspersed through the clip.|$|E
5|$|Borgsen {{contacts}} Black again, confessing {{that his}} latest killing has not satisfied him. Black warns that his urges will only grow, {{and will never}} be satisfied again. When Borgsen hangs up, Black deduces that Vaughan {{is to be the}} next victim. Black, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) and Sheriff Falkner (John Dennis Johnston) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse. Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still-living Vaughan, who has been hung by <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> from a meat hook. Black is then confronted by Borgsen, who knocks him down with the cattle prod. Borgsen is about to kill Black with a captive bolt pistol, but is trampled to death by several escaped horses.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It {{was the first}} song of the second act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button exposed, {{and a number of}} crucifixes in different sizes, hanging from different parts of her body. As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E

60|$|It was {{afternoon}} when he awoke. He sprang up and rushed around the stack. Istra was still asleep, curled in a pathetically small childish heap, her tired face in repose against the brown-yellow of <b>her</b> khaki <b>jacket.</b> <b>Her</b> red hair {{had come down}} and shone about her shoulders.|$|R
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
25|$|Thérèse {{was sitting}} in a low chair, {{to the right of the}} fireplace. Chin in hand, she was staring fixedly at the dancing flames, and did not turn her head when Laurent entered the room. Wearing a lace-edged {{petticoat}} and bed-jacket, she looked particularly pale in the bright firelight. <b>Her</b> <b>jacket</b> had slipped from one shoulder which showed pink through the locks of her black hair.|$|E
60|$|She glanced round {{into the}} mirror by their side, looked at her wan face, the shabby little hat, the none too tidily {{arranged}} hair which drooped over her ears; down at <b>her</b> shapeless <b>jacket,</b> <b>her</b> patched skirt, the shoes which were in open rebellion. Then she laughed, curiously enough without any note of bitterness.|$|R

50|$|Enjoying his new lifestyle, Clyde becomes {{infatuated}} with Hortense Briggs, who inveigles Clyde into buying <b>her</b> an expensive <b>jacket.</b> When Clyde learns Hortense desires his colleague Sparser, not him, as a lover, he becomes jealous. Hortense repeatedly tells Clyde that she loves him while {{getting him to}} buy <b>her</b> the <b>jacket</b> (for which they are overcharged by a stereotypically greedy Jewish shopkeeper).|$|R
25|$|The actions moves {{ahead to}} 1989, where Selena y Los Dinos {{are playing a}} concert at a fair. Abraham is shocked when Selena peels off <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> and {{performs}} in a beaded bra. He confronts Selena on the band's bus, but {{she points out that}} her mother helped her make it, and that other fashionable female musicians such as Madonna and Janet Jackson are wearing bustiers too. Abraham relents, and Selena begins to design more and more of her band's attire.|$|E
25|$|Night falls, and {{she exits}} {{the car in}} Chinatown, London, pursued by an unknown man. She runs through an alley, and kisses a man, {{dragging}} him into a nearby building. She removes <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> revealing the black mini-dress, and dances seductively next to a motorcycle. They then both leave the building, with the man driving the motorcycle, and stop in a crowded street. Minogue dances {{on the back of}} the motorcycle, and in the middle of the street, while the man circles her, performing a wheelie. The video ends with the crowd looking on, as the pair perform a burnout, and leave the alley.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the journey}} to Russia happens, Gautham reaches Moscow, and completes his {{immigration}} procedures. Incidentally, Gautham meets Anna (Maria Kozhevnikova), and unknowingly, the lady drops <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> which is seen by Gautham. He has no time to return the jacket and exits from the Moscow airport accompanied by his medical team. Gautham is flabbergasted by the roads and buildings {{of the city and}} is surprised to see the city of Moscow from his hotel view. Gautham learns that the only hiccup with Russians is that the people are ignorant about the English language and the whole conversation with them must be made in Russian national language.|$|E

500|$|Because of her position, Wintour's {{wardrobe}} {{is often}} closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with designer jeans. When she started at Vogue as creative director she switched to Chanel suits with miniskirts. She continued {{to wear them}} during both pregnancies, opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> on to cover up. Wintour was listed as [...] "one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s" [...] by the Guardian in March 2013.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Hilson as she comes {{home to her}} {{apartment}} and starts playing [...] "Make Love" [...] on a rough cut CD of In a Perfect World...

Hilson leaves for the kitchen where she puts out champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries. She then gets ready in the bathroom while West waits in the bedroom. When Hilson is finished, she joins him in bed and they start cuddling and kissing. The video ends with Hilson looking into the camera over West's shoulder.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in April 1985, Madonna {{embarked}} {{on her first}} concert tour in North America, The Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act. She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas. The tour saw the peak of Madonna wannabe phenomenon, with lots of female attendance dressing like the singer. At that time, she released two more hits, [...] "Angel" [...] and [...] "Dress You Up", making all four singles from the album peak inside the top five on the Hot 100 chart. In July, Penthouse and Playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken in New York in 1978. She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session. The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained [...] "unapologetic and defiant". The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000. She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert, saying {{that she would not}} take <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> off because [...] " [...] might hold it against me ten years from now." ...|$|E

500|$|The video opens, {{looking down}} on Martin who is singing, as he lies on his back on a {{mattress}}. As the camera shot pulls back, the mattress is revealed to be outside. A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|E
500|$|For the costumes, Madonna {{collaborated with}} {{designer}} Marlene Stewart. She expanded {{on the idea}} of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage, reworking scenes from [...] "True Blue", [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita". For [...] "Open Your Heart", Madonna reused the Stewart designed black bustier worn by her in the video, complete with tassels, golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg. Stewart's other designs included a Flamenco style dress for [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and a gold lamé jacket for the [...] "White Heat" [...] sequence. On the medley sequence, Madonna used a dress that was visually amusing and, according to Madonna, was for [...] "anyone that takes me too seriously, or imagined and I take myself too seriously." [...] Inspired by Dame Edna Everage, the dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits, flowers and feathers, jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy, black frames, a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets. The knickers were inscribed with the word [...] "Kiss". Continuing her tradition of message clothes, she spelt out the phrase [...] "You Can Dance" [...] on <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> using the letter U, a can of soup and the word [...] "dance" [...] at the back.|$|E
500|$|In 2013 a Channel 4 {{documentary}} used forensic examiners who digitised {{the original}} nitrate film {{from the three}} cameras present. The film was digitally cleaned and examined. Their examination suggests that Davison intended to throw a suffragette flag {{around the neck of}} a horse or attach it to the horse's bridle. A flag was gathered from the course; this was put up for auction and, as at 2017, it hangs in the Houses of Parliament. Michael Tanner, the horse-racing historian and author of a history of the 1913 Derby, doubts the authenticity of the item. Sotheby's, the auction house who sold it, describe it as a sash that was [...] "reputed" [...] to have been worn by Davison. The seller stated that her father, Richard Pittway Burton, was the Clerk of the Course at Epsom; Tanner's search of records shows Burton was listed as a dock labourer two weeks prior to the Derby. The official Clerk of the Course {{on the day of the}} Derby was Henry Dorling. When the police listed Davison's possessions, they itemised the two flags provided by the WSPU, both folded up and pinned to the inside of <b>her</b> <b>jacket.</b> They measured 44.5 by 27 inches (113 x 69cm); the sash displayed at the Houses of Parliament measures 82 by 12 inches (210 x 30cm).|$|E

2500|$|A lifelong vegetarian, McCartney {{does not}} use any leather or fur in her designs. The Guardian {{described}} her in 2015 as a [...] "consistent and vocal" [...] supporter of animal rights. She supports PETA. Some of McCartney's designs have text that elaborates on her [...] "no animal" [...] policy; for example, one of <b>her</b> <b>jackets</b> for Adidas says, [...] "suitable for sporty vegetarians" [...] on the sleeve. A pair of her vinyl and ultrasuede boots were marketed specifically as being vegan-friendly, although her use of oil-based synthetics still raised ecological concerns. However, she does use wool, silk, and other animal-derived fabrics in her designs.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} the Obama family, {{in attendance}} at the event was NASA astronaut Sally Ride, the first female American to travel to space in 1983. Ride wore <b>her</b> flight <b>jacket</b> and answered questions from children about the Solar System.|$|R
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair blowing in the wind, and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged {{at the top of}} the {{staircase}} in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of [...] "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". When she returned to the stage, she performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again". Spears addressed the audience again before the [...] "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" [...] interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage. Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] to the boy. She took off <b>her</b> <b>jacket</b> to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed [...] "The Beat Goes On". After two interludes that presented her dancers and band, Spears appeared onstage to perform [...] "Sometimes". The encore consisted of a dance-oriented performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time".|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down <b>her</b> <b>jacket,</b> guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
