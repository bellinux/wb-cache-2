25|$|Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have {{recovered}} from polio lose remaining healthy neurons {{at a faster}} rate than normal. However, little evidence exists to support this idea. Finally, it has been proposed that the initial polio infection causes an autoimmune reaction, in which the body's immune system attacks normal cells as if they were foreign substances. Again, compared to neural fatigue, the evidence supporting this theory is quite limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient may}} want to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|One {{hypothesis}} {{to explain}} this relationship is that the phosphoric acid contained in some soft drinks (colas) displaces calcium from the bones, lowering bone density of the skeleton and leading to weakened bones, or osteoporosis. However, 2001 calcium metabolism studies by Dr. Robert Heaney suggested that {{the net effect of}} carbonated soft drinks, (including colas, which use phosphoric acid as the acidulant) on calcium excretion in urine was negligible. Heaney concluded that carbonated soft drinks, which do not contain the nutrients needed for bone health, may displace other foods which do, and that the real issue <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> drink a lot of soft drinks also tend to have an overall diet that is low in calcium.|$|E
25|$|Other {{arguments}} for starting therapy earlier <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> start therapy later {{have been shown}} to have less recovery of their immune systems, and higher CD4 counts are associated with less cancer.|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, complex issue, critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like George Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers {{are supposed to do}} – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
500|$|The {{first wave}} of punk rock was aggressively modern, {{distancing}} itself from the bombast and sentimentality of early 1970s rock. According to Ramones drummer Tommy Ramone, [...] "In its initial form, a lot of [...] stuff was innovative and exciting. Unfortunately, what happens <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could not hold a candle {{to the likes of}} Hendrix started noodling away. Soon you had endless solos that went nowhere. By 1973, I knew that what was needed was some pure, stripped down, no bullshit rock 'n' roll." [...] John Holmstrom, founding editor of Punk magazine, recalls feeling [...] "punk rock had to come along because the rock scene had become so tame that [...] like Billy Joel and Simon and Garfunkel were being called rock and roll, when to me and other fans, rock and roll meant this wild and rebellious music."

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that soft drinks could play a special role in weight gain. One four-week experiment compared a 450 calorie/day supplement of sugar-sweetened soft drinks to a 450 calorie/day supplement of jelly beans. The jelly bean supplement {{did not lead to}} weight gain, but the soft drink supplement did. The likely reason for the difference in weight gain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> consumed the jelly beans lowered their caloric intake at subsequent meals, while people who consumed soft drinks did not. Thus, the low levels of satiety provided by sugar-sweetened soft drinks may explain their association with obesity. That is, people who consume calories in sugar-sweetened beverages may fail to adequately reduce their intake of calories from other sources. Indeed, people consume more total calories in meals and on days when they are given sugar-sweetened beverages than when they are given artificially sweetened beverages or water. However, these results are contradicted by a study by Adam Drewnowski published in 2004, in which [...] "32 subjects consumed a 300-calorie snack of fat-free raspberry cookies or regular cola on two occasions each – either two hours ("early") or 20 minutes ("late") before lunch." [...] It found that [...] "...the calories eaten at lunch were not affected by whether the snack was cookies or cola." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1968 Knox and Inkster, in what {{is perhaps}} the classic sunk cost experiment, {{approached}} 141 horse bettors: 72 of the people had just finished placing a $2.00 bet within the past 30 seconds, and 69 people were about to place a $2.00 bet in the next 30 seconds. Their hypothesis <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had just committed themselves to {{a course of action}} (betting $2.00) would reduce post-decision dissonance by believing more strongly than ever that they had picked a winner. Knox and Inkster asked the bettors to rate their horse's chances of winning on a 7-point scale. What they found <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> about to place a bet rated the chance that their horse would win at an average of 3.48 which corresponded to a [...] "fair chance of winning" [...] whereas <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had just finished betting gave an average rating of 4.81 which corresponded to a [...] "good chance of winning". Their hypothesis was confirmed: after making a $2.00 commitment, people became more confident their bet would pay off. Knox and Inkster performed an ancillary test on the patrons of the horses themselves and managed (after normalization) to repeat their finding almost identically.|$|R
