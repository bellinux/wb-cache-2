500|$|The period since World War II {{has seen}} more {{scholarship}} on Austen using {{a diversity of}} critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After {{the founding of the}} People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too [...] "frivolous" [...] for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the [...] "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" [...] in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a [...] "British bourgeois imperialist" [...] author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were [...] "Tories of the deepest dye" [...] , a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and [...] Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.|$|E

Diamond posits that the most of these diseases were only developed and sustained in large dense populations in villages and cities; he also states most epidemic diseases evolve from similar diseases of domestic animals. The combined effect of the increased population densities supported by agriculture, and of close human proximity to domesticated animals leading to animal diseases infecting humans, resulted in European societies acquiring a much richer collection of dangerous pathogens to which European people had acquired immunity through natural selection (see the Black Death and other epidemics) during a longer time than {{was the case for}} Native American hunter-gatherers and farmers.|$|E

2500|$|Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, {{an event}} which {{signaled}} {{the start of}} relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as [...] "writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism". At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu [...] "played along", transforming himself from a [...] "not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue" [...] into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was [...] "joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always knew, just like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant he was (or appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines". During a 2004 interview, reflecting {{on the value of}} literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: [...] "Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> possible that you wrote so badly in the years of dogmatism?'.

2500|$|While at Harvard Lake labored {{to bring}} forth the monumental five volume work The Beginnings of Christianity. [...] Beginnings was a project that had been {{conceived}} during conversations with F. J. Foakes-Jackson while Lake was still at the Leiden University, sometime before 1912 (vol. v, p. vii). [...] It sought to investigate the view [...] "that Christianity {{in the first century}} achieved a synthesis between the Greco-Oriental and the Jewish religions in the Roman Empire. [...] The preaching of repentance, and of the Kingdom of God begun by Jesus passed into the sacramental cult of the Lord Jesus Christ. [...] But the details are complex and obscure. [...] What were the exact elements in this synthesis? [...] <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> effected?" [...] (vol. i, p. vii). [...] The undertaking began at Cambridge University {{in the form of a}} seminar, presided over by F. C. Burkitt. [...] It [...] "was largely attended by scholars of the most varied interests in the University, not only theological, but historical, classical, mathematical, and Oriental ... Lake paid frequent visits from Leiden" [...] and [...] "the United States and Canada were not unrepresented" [...] (vol. v, p. vii). [...] The project was to be a grand endeavor. [...] The five volumes that were ultimately published only comprise [...] "Part I". [...] As they explain: [...] "Before, however, attempting to reconstruct this history we believed it necessary to study Acts in the light of the results of modern criticism. ... Later on we hope to return to the subject and reconsider the narrative of the life of Jesus, and the influence on the Church of his own teaching and of the teaching of others about him" [...] (vol. ii, p. v). [...] As it turned out they were never able to [...] "return to the subject" [...] and complete the project. [...] "In sum," [...] writes Baird, [...] "The Beginnings of Christianity is a monumental work—the most extensive investigation of a NT book by English-speaking scholarship" [...] (cf. vol. v, p. ix).|$|E
