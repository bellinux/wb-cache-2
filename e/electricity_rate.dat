500|$|According to Consumer Reports in December 2011, the Chevrolet Volt {{fuel cost}} in {{electric}} mode was 3.8¢/mile, while the Nissan Leaf had {{a cost of}} 3.5¢/mi. The Volt's higher cost per mile was attributed to its heavier weight. Their estimates used the U.S. national average <b>electricity</b> <b>rate</b> of 11¢/ (...) and energy consumption rates as measured on their own, unofficial tests. When comparing the Volt in range-extended mode with the four most fuel efficient gasoline-powered cars as tested by the magazine, the plug-in hybrid had a cost of 12.5¢/mi (using premium gasoline) while the Toyota Prius had a cost of 8.6¢/mi., the Honda Civic Hybrid 9.5¢/mi., the Toyota Corolla 11.9¢/mi., and the Hyundai Elantra 13.1¢/mi. The analysis also found that, on trips up to , the Volt was cheaper to drive than the other four cars because the Volt was able to drive [...] using less expensive electric power. Consumer Reports found that, using their proprietary testing, the Volt overall fuel efficiency was [...] equivalent (MPG-e), and using only range-extended mode the overall fuel economy was [...] and equivalent to the Toyota Corolla.

2500|$|The {{permitting}} {{process for}} the project has been highly controversial, with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) initially rejecting the agreement price with National Grid as being excessive to Rhode Island's <b>electricity</b> <b>rate</b> payers.

[...] After continuing controversy and appeals, the Rhode Island Supreme Court ruled in July 2011 to uphold the RIPUC decision. [...] Opponents of the project raised issue about the contract pricing with the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in August 2012, but FERC in October {{of the same year}} issued a decision that they would not act on the complaint. A total of nine reviews and permits from state federal agencies were acquired, the last in early May 2015.
