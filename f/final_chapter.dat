5|$|Tom Savini {{agreed to}} return to make-up duties for The <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter</b> because he felt he {{should be the one}} to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the {{original}} Friday the 13th, with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in A New Beginning, it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites A New Beginning as almost a direct sequel to The <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter,</b> did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for The <b>Final</b> <b>Chapter.</b>|$|E
