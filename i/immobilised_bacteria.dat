40|$|The binding of Streptococcus gordonii HG 222 {{to other}} streptococci was tested by coaggregation and by binding to <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria</b> in an ELISA assay. Out of 17 streptococcal strains, HG 222 coaggregated only with Streptococcus sanguis HG 1470 and Streptococcus oralis Ny 586. Binding of HG 222 to <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria</b> also {{occurred}} only with HG 1470 and NY 586. Binding of HG 222 to S. oralis Ny 586 was further investigated. Preincubation of Ny 586 coated microtitreplates with whole saliva, parotid, submandibular and sublingual saliva enhanced binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. Several salivary substances bound to both HG 222 and Ny 586, namely {{low molecular weight}} mucins, salivary agglutinin, and IgA. There were indications that binding of HG 222 to Ny 586 was especially enhanced by IgA. Binding of IgA to both bacteria could be demonstrated with all the types of glandular saliva. In addition, purified colostral IgA enhanced binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. Saliva preincubation of Ny 586 coated microtitreplates {{in the presence of}} antiserum against the IgA a-chain inhibited saliva mediated binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. In this case, binding of salivary agglutinin to Ny 586 was also inhibited, suggesting complexation between IgA and agglutinin. In conclusion, these results indicate that colonisation of dental surfaces by S. gordonii may be accomplished by binding to strains of S. oralis or S. sanguis. This process may be enhanced by IgA in saliva. KEY WORDS: oral streptococci; saliva; coaggregation; interbacterial binding...|$|E
40|$|Acetate, ethanol, and {{hydrolysed}} rice {{were used}} as external carbon sources in an ammonium removal process employing <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The influence of the carbon source on the occurrence of free cells and total nitrogen removal efficiency was examined at C/N ratios of 1. 5 (low), 2. 5 (medium), and 3. 5 (high). At the low C/N ratio, no free cells {{were found in the}} reactors and the use of acetate as the carbon source resulted in the highest total nitrogen removal efficiency, followed by ethanol and hydrolysed rice. The occurrence of free cells in reactors fed with acetate and ethanol led to a negligible increase in the total nitrogen removal efficiency with increasing C/N ratio. The results suggest that acetate is the most appropriate carbon source for nitrogen removal and that the number of free cells should be minimized to achieve the highest efficiency during long-term operation...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) holds {{great potential}} for studying the nanoscale surface structures of living cells, and to measure their interactions with abiotic surfaces, other cells, or specific biomolecules. However, the application of AFM in microbiology is challenging due {{to the difficulty of}} immobilising bacterial cells to a flat surface without changing the cell surface properties or cell viability. We have performed an extensive and thorough study of how to functionalise surfaces in order to <b>immobilise</b> living <b>bacteria</b> for AFM studies in liquid environments. Our aim was to develop a scheme which allows bacterial cells to be immobilised to a flat surface with sufficient strength to avoid detachment during the AFM scanning, and without affecting cell surface chemistry, structure, and viability. We compare and evaluate published methods, and present a new, reproducible, and generally applicable scheme for <b>immobilising</b> <b>bacteria</b> cells for an AFM imaging. Bacterial cells were immobilised to modified glass surfaces by physical confinement of cells in microwells, physisorption to positively charged surfaces, covalent binding to amine- or carboxyl-terminated surfaces, and adsorption to surfaces coated with highly adhesive polyphenolic proteins originating from the mussel Mytilus edulis. Living cells could be immobilised with all of these approaches, but many cells detached when immobilised by electrostatic interactions and imaged in buffers like PBS or MOPS. Cells were more firmly attached when immobilised by covalent binding, although some cells still detached during AFM imaging. The most successful method revealed was immobilisation by polyphenolic proteins, which facilitated firm immobilisation of the cells. Furthermore, the cell viability was not affected by this immobilisation scheme, and adhesive proteins thus provide a fast, reproducible, and generally applicable scheme for <b>immobilising</b> living <b>bacteria</b> for an AFM imaging...|$|R
40|$|Nano-textured {{surfaces}} (NTS) {{are critical}} to organisms as self-adaptation and survival tools. These NTS have been actively mimicked {{in the process of}} developing bactericidal surfaces for diverse biomedical and hygiene applications. To design and fabricate bactericidal topographies effectively for various applications, understanding the bactericidal mechanism of NTS in nature is essential. The current mechanistic explanations on natural bactericidal activity of nanopillars have not utilized recent advances in microscopy to study the natural interaction. This research reveals the natural bactericidal interaction between E. coli and a dragonfly wing's NTS using advanced microscopy techniques and propose a model. Contrary to the existing mechanistic models, this experimental approach demonstrated that the NTS of dragonfly wings has two prominent nanopillar populations and the resolved interface shows membrane damage occurred without direct contact of the bacterial cell membrane with the nanopillars. We propose that the bacterial membrane damage is initiated by a combination of strong adhesion between nanopillars and bacterium EPS layer as well as shear force when <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacterium</b> attempt to move on the NTS. These findings could help guide the design of novel bio-mimetic nanomaterials by maximising the synergies between both biochemical and mechanical bactericidal effects.

40|$|Great {{attention}} is focused on the microbial treatment of metal contaminated environments. Three bacterial strains, 1 C 2, 1 ZP 4 and EC 30, belonging to genera Cupriavidus, Sphingobacterium and Alcaligenes, respectively, showing high tolerance to Zn and Cd, up to concentrations of 1000 ppm, were isolated from a contaminated area in Northern Portugal. Their contribution to Zn and Cd removal from aqueous streams using immobilised alginate, pectate and a synthetic cross-linked polymer was assessed. In most cases, matrices with <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria</b> showed better metal removal than the non-inoculated material alone. For the immobilisation with all the polymers, 1 C 2 was the strain that increased the removal of Zn the most, whereas EC 30 was the most promising for Cd removal, especially when combined with the synthetic polymer with up to a ca. 11 -fold increase in metal removal when compared to the polymer alone. Removal of individual metals from binary mixtures showed that there was differential immobilisation. There was greater removal of Cd than Zn (removals up to 40 % higher than those showed for Zn). The results show that metal contaminated environments constitute a reservoir of microorganisms resistant/tolerant to heavy metals that have the capacity to be exploited in bioremediation strategies. Capsule immobilisation of bacteria in the naturally occurring alginate and pectate and in a synthetic cross-linked polymer increased the Zn and Cd removal abilities from single and binary contaminated waters; the applications with the synthetic polymer were the most promising for Cd and Zn removal in single and binary mixtures...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to determine the bacterial diversity in a heavily contaminated metal region of Portugal. Both traditional and molecular based methods were used to identify tolerant strains and species. The most tolerant species were subsequently identified and utilized for examining the potential for using them to immobilize specific metals from contaminated waste streams by comparing different support materials. Heterotrophic bacterial populations were isolated and characterized from a contaminated industrial area in Northern Portugal. In a first sampling, 278 strains were isolated in different solid media. To assess the diversity of this ecological site and to select representative strains, the isolates were screened by using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR profiles. Phenotypic characterization, phylogenetic analysis by sequencing the 16 S rRNA genes and metal tolerance tests with zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) were performed with the selected strains. Recovered gram-positive isolates were related to class Actinobacteria and Bacilli. The majority of the isolates were related to genera Microbacterium and Bacillus. Strains from the genus Arthrobacter were also well represented. 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity of the gram-negative isolates showed that they were related to classes γ-Proteobacteria, ß-Proteobacteria, a-Proteobacteria and Flavobacteria. The most frequently isolated taxa were γ-Proteobacteria, related with the genus Pseudomonas, where {{a large number of}} isolates were clustered. These genera are common in metal contaminated environments. Many of the strains (approx. 17) had a high level of tolerance to the heavy metals tested. A total of 13 isolates were not able to grow when metals were present. In a second sampling the soil rhizosphere was screened for bacterial populations, using metal-based selective media for isolation. About 42 strains were recovered when metal supplemented media was used. The gram-positive population were predominantly Bacilli and Actinobacteria members. Bacillus, Microbacterium and Arthrobacter were the most common gram-positive genera. Gram-negative genera were from the same classes as in the first sampling however Sphingobacteria was present. γ-Proteobacteria and ß-Proteobacteria were the most common taxa. The isolates were shown to be very resistant to Zn and As, with about half of the isolates able to grow with Cd present. Interestingly, no strains could grow in the presence of metal mixtures. Despite the number of strains recovered in both samplings the majority of the isolates were clustered within {{a very small number of}} genera. During the sampling periods two strains showing low similarity to other bacteria were isolated. These strains were characterized and studied in detail justifying their classification as representing two novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium. The names proposed for these organisms are Chryseobacterium palustre sp. nov. (type strain 3 A 10 [type strain)) and Chryseobacterium humi sp. nov. (type strain ECP 37 [type strain]). Three isolates 1 C 2, 1 ZP 4 and EC 30 belonging to genera Cupriavidus, Sphingobacterium and Alcaligenes respectively, showing high tolerance to heavy metals, were selected for further study in immobilised systems for Zn and Cd removal. In most cases, matrices (alginate, pectate and a synthetic cross-linked polymer) with <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria</b> showed better metal removal. 1 C 2, a strain belonging to the Cupriavidus genera, was able to increased the removal of Zn; EC 30, a bacteria related to Alcaligenes, was the most promising candidate for Cd removal, especially when combined with the synthetic polymer. Removal of metals as single or in binary mixtures was also assessed. Cd removal was most effective when single metal solutions were tested using <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria</b> and examining metal matrixes. Based on the strains used and the matrices tested, best results were obtained for removal of Zn from binary mixtures with Cd. Potential exists for further studies to exploit these bacterial strain to develop effective bioremediation approaches for the removal of heavy metals from waste water streams...|$|E
40|$|Bloodstream {{infection}} {{caused by}} bacteria can develop into serious life threatening disease such as sepsis and infective endocarditis (IE). Platelet activation {{is characteristic of}} these sequelae, manifesting as thrombocytopenia in sepsis {{and the formation of}} platelet rich vegetations on cardiac valves in IE. The oral cavity and respiratory tract are a reservoir for bloodstream infections, being colonised by mitis group streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae and its close relative Streptococcus oralis. In this thesis, we describe platelet interactions with these bacteria and the molecular mechanisms leading to platelet activation. Previous studies demonstrate that S. pneumoniae induces serotonin release from platelets and, aidied by fibrin and thrombospondin, forms pneumococcal-platelet complexes. However, research into platelet activation by serotypes associated with invasive pneumococcal disease is lacking. In this thesis, we demonstrate strain specific platelet aggregation induced by S. pneumoniae. Using platelet aggregometry coupled with platelet receptor specific antibodies, pharmacological inhibitors and cultured human embryonic kidney cells transfected with Toll like receptors (TLRs), we demonstrate that S. pneumoniae binds directly to TLR 2 stimulating FcyRIIA dependent platelet aggregation. TLR 2 stimulation leads to dense granule secretion and P 2 Yi 2 dependent platelet aggregation, independent of thromboxane production. Additionally, S. pneumoniae can activate the small GTPase Rap 1 upstream of allb| 33. We conclude that S. pneumoniae induces platelet activation via a TLR 2 /PI 3 K/Rap 1 pathway - with contributions from FcyRIIA. Furthermore this study highlights TLR 2 as a potential target to prevent inappropriate platelet activation leading to thrombocytopenia in sepsis. S. oralis is an important pathogen in IE and can cause sepsis in immunocompromised persons. Previous studies, performed under static conditions, suggest S. oralis does not interact directly with platelets. Using a physiological approach of whole blood perfusion over <b>immobilised</b> <b>bacteria,</b> coupled with real-time epi-fluorescent microscopy, this study demonstrates that S. oralis can support platelet recruitment and adhesion from blood flowing at venous (50 - 200 s 2 ̆ 71) and arterial (800 s 2 ̆ 71) shear rates. By removing plasma proteins and using monoclonal antibodies and blood from a Bernard Soulier syndrome patient, we show that immobilised S. oralis can sequester platelets from flowing blood via a direct interaction with the platelet GPIb-IX-V complex, specifically GPIba. In doing so, S. oralis, infecting the cardiac valves, can trigger platelet adhesion: an important step {{in the development of a}} septic thrombus or vegetation in IE. We found that platelet adhesion to S. oralis under physiological shear conditions stimulated microaggregate formation signifying platelet activation. Prior to this study, human platelet activation by S. oralis had not been demonstrated. Using platelet aggregometry, we showed that S. oralis induces strain-dependent platelet aggregation requiring IgG. Consequently, co-immunoprecipitation of the low affinity IgG receptor, FcyRIIA, with Syk, showed tyrosine phosphorylation of FcyRIIA. Ligation of FcyRIIA - by immunecomplexed S. oralis - leads to IgG-FcyRIIA dependent dense granule secretion and ADP dependent platelet aggregation. Total protein pull-down of Rap 1 -GTP showed P 2 YI 2 dependent activation by IgG-bound S. oralis. We conclude that, following GPIba dependent platelet adhesion to S. oralis, S. oralis immune complexes stimulate an FcyRIIA/P 2 Y 12 /Rap 1 pathway leading to platelet activation and platelet aggregation. This may facilitate growth of a septic thrombus in IE and contribute to disseminated intravascular coagulation in neutropenic septic patients. This thesis proposes models of platelet activation for both S. pneumoniae and S. oralis and reveals targets for the development of therapies to prevent pathological platelet activation in bloodstream infection. Significantly, it adds to mounting evidence that signalling through FcyRIIA is a conserved mechanism of human platelet activation by streptococcal species and that FcyRIIA may be a universal actor in the general mechanism of bacterial induced platelet activatio...|$|E
