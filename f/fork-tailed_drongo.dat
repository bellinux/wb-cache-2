5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate {{the call of the}} Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo.</b> There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E
500|$|The [...] black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus) {{is a small}} Asian {{passerine}} bird of the drongo family Dicruridae. It is {{a common}} resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia from southwest Iran through India and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia. It is a wholly black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures [...] in length. It feeds on insects, and is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range, perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines. The species {{is known for its}} aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds, such as crows, never hesitating to dive-bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory. This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow. Smaller birds often nest in the well-guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo.

50|$|The {{southern}} black flycatcher is a mainly insectivorous bird. Its diet includes beetles, termites, locusts, worms, spiders and centipedes.

It is also known to sip nectar from the flowers of mountain aloe (Aloe marlothii) and to eat the berries of the black nightshade (Solanum nigrum).

40|$|Animals {{commonly}} steal {{food from}} other species, termed interspecific kleptoparasitism, but why animals engage in kleptoparasitism compared with alternate foraging tactics, {{and under what}} circumstances they do so, is not fully understood. Determining what specific benefits animals gain from kleptoparasitism could provide valuable insight into its evolution. Here, we investigate the benefits of kleptoparasitism for a population of individually recognizable and free-living <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongos</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis) in the southern Kalahari Desert. Drongos engaged in two foraging behaviours: self-foraging for small insects or following other species which they kleptoparasitized for larger terrestrial prey that they could not capture themselves. Kleptoparasitism consequently enabled drongos to exploit a new foraging niche. Kleptoparasitism benefitted drongos most in the morning and on colder days because at these times pay-offs from kleptoparasitism remained stable, while those from self-foraging declined. However, drongos engaged in kleptoparasitism less than expected given the overall high (but more variable) pay-offs from this behaviour, suggesting that kleptoparasitism is a risky foraging tactic and may incur additional foraging costs compared with self-foraging. This is the first study to comprehensively investigate the benefits of facultatively engaging in kleptoparasitism, demonstrating that animals may switch to kleptoparasitism to exploit a new foraging niche when pay-offs exceed those from alternate foraging behaviours. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of vocal mimicry in animals, few functions for this behaviour have been shown. I propose a novel hypothesis that false mimicked alarm calls could be used deceptively to scare other species and steal their food. Studies have previously suggested that animals use their own species-specific alarm calls to steal food. However none have shown conclusively that these false alarms are deceptive, or that mimicked alarm calls are used in this manner. Here, I show that wild <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongos</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis) make both drongo-specific and mimicked false alarm calls when watching target species handling food, in response to which targets flee to cover abandoning their food. The drongo-specific and mimicked calls made in false alarms were structurally indistinguishable from calls made during true alarms at predators by drongos and other species. Furthermore, I demonstrate by playback experiments that two of these species, meerkats (Suricata suricatta) and pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor), are deceived by both drongo-specific and mimicked false alarm calls. These results provide the first conclusive evidence that false alarm calls are deceptive and demonstrate a novel function for vocal mimicry. This work also provides valuable insight into the benefits of deploying variable mimetic signals in deceptive communication...|$|R

40|$|Mutualisms, where organisms {{benefit from}} cooperation, {{are common in}} nature, but payoffs are dynamic and mutualists can incur costs as well as {{benefits}} from their association. Nevertheless, selection can favour the coevolution of behaviour that increases benefits. Such coevolution can potentially result in new mutualistic behaviours. Our study considered associations between <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Drongos</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis), birds which use both false alarms and aggression to steal food from other species (kleptoparasitism), and their most frequent host, the Sociable Weaver (Philetairus socius). While drongos apparently gain and weavers lose from this association, we investigated whether weavers derive foraging and predator protection benefits, and whether drongos increase foraging opportunities through sentry call behaviour. When with drongos, weavers increased their foraging time and reduced vigilance. Experimental playbacks further demonstrated that drongo sentry calls attract sociable weavers, as well as increasing their foraging time and decreasing their vigilance. Weavers also resumed foraging after an alarm more quickly when sentry calls were made, but sentry calls {{do not appear to}} improve drongo false alarm success since sentry calls did not increase the likelihood weavers fled to subsequent drongo false alarms. Consequently sentry calls benefit weavers via foraging payoffs and drongos via weaver attraction and potentially by increasing opportunities for kleptoparasitism. Results demonstrate that despite costly deception between mutualists, individuals nevertheless derive benefits which may be enhanced by the coevolution of a mutually beneficial vocal signal, specific to interspecific communication...|$|R
50|$|The {{kori bustard}} is {{often found in}} areas with a large {{quantity}} of antelope and other game. In Tanzania, kori bustards regularly attend blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) herds and feed on the small mammals and insects disturbed by them. Sometimes kori bustards are found with southern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicoides) and northern carmine bee-eaters (Merops nubicus) riding on their backs as they stride through the grass. The bee-eaters {{make the most of}} their walking perch by hawking insects from the bustard's back that are disturbed by the bustard's wandering. This is regularly seen in Chobe National Park, Botswana but has only been reported once elsewhere. There is also one record of <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongos</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis) perching on their backs in a similar manner. Kori bustards have been observed to behave aggressively to non-threatening animals at watering holes, as they may raise their crests, open their wings and peck aggressively. They have been seen acting aggressively towards red-crested korhaans (Eupodotis ruficrista), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and gemsbok (Oryx gazella). When kept in captivity, kori bustards have been kept together with numerous other (typically African) species in close quarters. Fifteen other bird species and 12 mammals have successfully co-habitated with them (including rhinoceros). However, the bustards sometimes injure or kill the young of everything from waterfowl to dik-diks and may be killed by larger species from ostriches (Struthio camelus) to zebras (Equus spp.).|$|R

40|$|Global average {{temperatures}} are predicted {{to increase by}} as much as 5 ᵒC by 2100. Therefore, it is imperative to identify how species are affected by temperature increase to ensure that proper conservation and management of wildlife can be implemented. Species which already live in warmer climates, such as deserts, may provide the first clues to the impacts of increasing temperatures. Birds represent an ideal indicator because research has shown that rising temperatures affect their behaviour, including foraging and provisioning of young, thereby reducing reproductive success. However, it remains unclear whether this results from physiological constraints on behaviour, from declining food availability and or access to prey items at high temperatures. In this study, I aimed to identify how temperature affects the foraging and provisioning behaviour of wild <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Drongos,</b> Dicrurus adsimilis, when supplemental food is provided. Additionally, I aimed to identify how nestling growth rates change with temperature. The results of two supplemental feeding experiments indicated that as temperatures increased, adults significantly reduced their willingness to forage, reduced provisioning to offspring and exhibited increased rates of heat dissipation behaviour. Furthermore, when provisioning nestlings, adult drongos consumed a larger proportion of supplementary food at higher air temperatures, and provisioned less. This suggests that they suffer greater provisioning costs at such times. Surprisingly, despite finding several negative effects of temperatures on adults' willingness to forage and provisioning, there was only a weak and non-significant effect of temperature on nestling growth rates. This suggests that adults may be able to compensate for reduced foraging at high temperatures. My study shows that the increased thermoregulatory costs of activity at high temperatures can constrain foraging and provisioning, even when food remains abundant. However, whether this impacts the fitness of current offspring or parents future reproductive success remains unclear...|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} animals and birds respond to drongos' alarm calls, which often warn of the {{presence}} of a predator. <b>Fork-tailed</b> or common <b>drongos</b> in the Kalahari desert are known to use alarm calls {{in the absence of a}} predator to cause animals to flee and abandon food, which they eat, getting up to 23% of their food this way. They not only use their own alarm calls, but imitate those of many species, either their victim's or that of another species that the victim responds to. If the call of one species is not effective, perhaps because of habituation, the drongo will try another; 51 different calls are known to be imitated. In one test on pied babblers, the babbler ignored an alarm call repeated three times when there was no danger, but continued to respond to different calls. Researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess theory of mind, not fully shown in any animal other than humans, but doubt this capability.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo,</b> {{also called}} the common drongo, African drongo, or savanna drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), is a species of drongo in the family Dicruridae, which are {{medium-sized}} passerine birds of the Old World.

Its range was formerly considered to include Asia, but the Asian species is now called the black drongo (Dicrurus macrocercus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> is 25 cm {{long and}} has short legs. Males are mainly glossy black, {{although}} their wings are duller. Females are similar but less glossy.

50|$|Observations {{show that}} the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> in Africa are capable of using {{deceptive}} mimicked alarm calls to steal food from birds like pied babblers and animals such as meerkats. Tom Flower observed that fork-tailed drongos spend a quarter of their time following other animals. Drongos sometimes act as sentries when a predator is approaching, warning their neighbours with genuine alarm calls. But drongos also earn a quarter of their daily calories by sounding a false alarm when another animal finds food. When the meerkats and babblers flee from the non-existent predator, the drongo steals their food. Though in doubt, researchers have considered the possibility that these drongos possess theory of mind, not fully shown in any animal other than humans.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} cuckoos, the African cuckoo is a brood parasite, the female laying her {{eggs in the}} nests of birds of other species, {{removing}} an egg already present in the nest. Target hosts vary across the range, and the cuckoo's eggs usually closely match in colour and size the eggs of the host species; the yellow-billed shrike (Corvinella corvina) and <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis) are often targeted. Incubation lasts between twelve and seventeen days, but usually twelve days, with the eggs hatching before those of the host. The cuckoo chick ejects from the nest any other eggs and nestlings it encounters. Its eyes open after eight days and it fledges in three weeks, remaining dependent on its foster parents for several more weeks. Breeding success rate in South Africa is up to 38 percent, and one yellow-billed shrike nest was abandoned by the foster-parents before the cuckoo chick fledged, with a new nest being built elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Pied {{babblers}} have {{a complex}} interspecific {{interaction with the}} kleptoparasitic <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo,</b> Dicrurus adsimilis. Drongos perch above and follow babbler groups between foraging sites and give alarm calls each time a predator is seen. When drongos are present, babblers invest less time in sentinel behaviour. However, drongos occasionally give false alarm calls and then swoop down to steal the food items that the foraging babblers have dropped upon hearing an alarm call. To avoid the cost of kleptoparasitism, large babbler groups, which have enough group members to participate in sentinel behaviour, do not tolerate drongos and aggressively chase {{them away from the}} group. Consequently, they suffer very few losses to kleptoparasitic attack. However, small groups do not have enough group members to provide sentinel behaviour without affecting time invested in other behaviours such as foraging or provisioning young. These groups therefore tolerate occasional kleptoparasitic attacks in return for the sentinel duties that drongos provide.|$|E

We examine whether the presence of an avian co-forager, the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis), affects rates of vigilance (including sentinel behaviour) in wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). We simulate the presence of drongos—using playbacks of their non-alarm vocalizations—to show that dwarf mongooses significantly reduce their rate of vigilance when foraging with this species.

40|$|Audience {{effects are}} {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important aspect of intraspecific communication. Yet despite the common occurrence of interspecific interactions and considerable evidence that individuals respond to the calls of heterospecifics, empirical evidence for interspecific audience effects on signalling behaviour is lacking. Here we present evidence of an interspecific audience effect on the alarm-calling behaviour of the kleptoparasitic <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis). When foraging solitarily, drongos regularly alarm at aerial predators, but rarely alarm at terrestrial predators. In contrast, when drongos are following terrestrially foraging pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor) for kleptoparasitic opportunities, they consistently give alarm calls to both aerial and terrestrial predators. This change occurs despite no difference in {{the amount of time that}} drongos spend foraging terrestrially. Babblers respond to drongo alarm calls by fleeing to cover, providing drongos with opportunities to steal babbler food items by occasionally giving false alarm calls. This provides an example of an interspecific audience effect on alarm-calling behaviour that may be explained by the benefits received from audience response. 3 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Parasitism {{generally}} imposes {{costs on}} victims, yet many victims appear to tolerate their parasites. We {{suggest that in}} some cases this may be because parasites provide victims with mitigating benefits, paradoxically giving rise to selection for advertisement rather than concealment by parasites. We investigate this possibility using the interaction between an avian kleptoparasite, the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis), and one of its victims, the pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor). Combining field observations and a playback experiment, we demonstrate that a conspicuous vocal signal broadcast by drongos perched waiting to steal food from foraging babblers allows the latter to improve their own foraging efficiency, although not to the same extent as that experienced in response to conspecific sentinel calling. We argue that "sentinel" calling by drongos may originally have arisen as a means of manipulating babblers: because babblers find more food items and venture into the open more in response to these vocalizations, drongos are presented with more kleptoparasitism opportunities. However, the resulting benefit to babblers could be sufficient to reduce selection for the evolution of defenses against drongos, and the current situation may represent a rare example of an interspecific relationship in transition from a parasitism to a mutualism. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Kleptoparasitism is {{a tactic}} used to acquire food opportunistically {{and has been}} shown to provide several benefits, {{including}} greater food intake rate and the acquisition of items not normally available during selfforaging. Host individuals may differ in their ability to defend themselves against kleptoparasitic attacks and therefore identifying those host individuals that are particularly vulnerable to attack could both provide energetic benefits and increase the efficiency of kleptoparasitism as a foraging strategy. Here, we show that the kleptoparasitic <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis) specifically targets juveniles when following groups of cooperatively breeding pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor). Drongos give alarm calls upon sighting a predator, thus providing extra predator vigilance to foraging pied babblers. However, drongos also use alarm calls to steal food items. During kleptoparasitic attacks, drongos give false alarm calls and then swoop down to steal food items dropped by alarmed babblers. Juvenile pied babblers are particularly vulnerable to attack because they (a) spend a longer period handling prey items prior to consumption and (b) respond to alarm calls primarily by immediately moving to cover, in contrast to adults who respond by looking up and visually scanning the surrounding area. Drongos attack juvenile babblers significantly more often than adults, with attacks on juveniles more likely to result in the successful procurement of a food item. This patterns of attack suggests that drongos are able to differentiate between individuals of different age when targeting pied babblers, thus increasing the efficiency of kleptoparasitism as a foraging strategy. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Fork-tailed drongos, Dicrurus adsimilis, are facultative kleptoparasites of many {{bird and}} mammal species. They use complex alarm call strategies, a {{combination}} of both true and false alarm calls, to procure food items from their hosts. The evolution of this interspecific interaction may have been catalysed by a selective benefit for drongos that were able to procure a wider diversity of food resources through kleptoparasitism. We tested the hypothesis that drongos, which principally hawk their prey from a perch, employ kleptoparasitism to exploit a terrestrial foraging niche for which they do not possess the appropriate morphological adaptations, as indicated by bill morphology. We analysed the bill characteristics of the terrestrially foraging pied babbler, Turdoides bicolor, a primary host for the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>drongo,</b> and both drongo and pied babbler museum specimens to establish potential links between differences in functional morphology and foraging ecology. We also observed the foraging behaviour of babblers and drongos in the Kalahari Desert. Drongo bills were significantly shorter, thicker and less curved than those of pied babblers, and large energy-rich subterranean prey items, such as insect larvae, were not procured by drongos while self-foraging. Furthermore, drongos preferentially attempted to kleptoparasitize prey types that they did not capture while self-foraging. We suggest that the calorific and nutrient content of a larger and more diverse set of prey, particularly buried larvae, which drongos did not excavate on their own, establishes a selection pressure for kleptoparasitism and {{may have contributed to the}} complex behavioural interactions between drongos and their hosts. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks (MSFFs) {{of birds}} {{can be defined}} as aggregations of more than two species that actively initiate and continue their association while foraging, without being drawn to a single resource. MSFFs have been well documented for terrestrial habitats globally, but rarely in southern Africa. This study describes the composition of MSFFs in two habitat types (Acacia and Combretum) within the southern Kruger National Park, South Africa during the late dry season. Thirty-one MSFFs were recorded in each of the two habitat types, with 1251 individuals of 74 different species being observed. We found that compared to Combretum, (mean: 10. 7 ± 5. 2 s. d.) Acacia had significantly more individuals per MSFFs (mean: 21. 5 ± 12. 6 s. d.) and more species per MSFF (Acacia mean: 8. 7 ± 3. 5 s. d.; Combretum mean: 5. 9 ± 1. 7 s. d.). The mean number of individuals per species per 31 MSFFs was 9. 3 (± 4. 5 s. d.) and 7. 6 (± 5. 6 s. d.) in the Acacia and Combretum habitat types respectively. The most frequently occurring species in both habitat types was the <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis). There was a significant association between certain species pairs in both habitats. Future studies in this area could be done to investigate the reasons behind the differences in MSFF sizes and species numbers between habitats. The season during which this study was performed excluded all summer migrants and a similar investigation in the wet season may reveal a different MSFF composition. Conservation implications: Understanding the dynamics and compositions of MSFFs, could form a valuable component of avian biodiversity monitoring both in and outside of protected areas. Within a given area, changes in the composition and behaviour of MSFFs over time could potentially be used as early indicator of threats to biodiversity.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Vocal mimicry is a {{fascinating}} phenomenon in the animal kingdom, noted in scientific research {{as early as the}} 18 th century. Approximately 20 % of bird species use vocal mimicry, yet very little is understood regarding why species use vocal mimicry, whether it provides functional benefits and in which contexts vocal mimicry is produced. I propose that some of these species produce alarm mimicry in the appropriate alarm contexts, matching the context of call production by the model species whose calls are mimicked. Previous research suggests that alarm mimicry in the appropriate context could provide heterospecifics with information regarding predators that are in the area. Aerial alarm call mimicry could indicate that an aerial predator is present and may cause individuals to flee, while terrestrial mob call mimicry could indicate the presence of a terrestrial predator and could prompt heterospecifics to aid in the mobbing of the predator. I investigate this possibility in the <b>Fork-Tailed</b> <b>Drongo</b> (Dicrurus adsimilis), a species renowned for its use of mimicry of other species alarm calls. Natural alarm responses to predators show that drongos produce alarm mimicry in alarms and never in non-alarm contexts. Overall drongos were more likely to mimic alarms in response to terrestrial predators. I then explored whether drongos use mimicked aerial and terrestrial ‘mobbing’ alarm calls in appropriate aerial or terrestrial predator alarm contexts using recordings of responses by drongos both to natural predators, and to experimental presentations of aerial and terrestrial predator and control models. Drongos were more likely to mimic aerial than ‘mob’ terrestrial alarm calls in response to natural and experimentally presented aerial predators. Conversely, {{they were more likely to}} mimic ‘mob’ terrestrial than aerial alarm calls in response to natural and experimentally presented terrestrial predators. Comparison of aerial and mob alarm call mimicry with the drongos production of their own equivalent aerial and terrestrial ‘drongo-specific’ alarm calls, revealed that mimicked and drongo-specific alarm calls were produced in similar contexts. These results support research showing that some bird species produce context-dependent alarm mimicry and the implications for the possible function of alarm call mimicry are discussed...|$|E
