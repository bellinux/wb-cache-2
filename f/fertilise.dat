5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they <b>fertilise.</b> Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and <b>fertilise</b> the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help <b>fertilise</b> the surface of the ocean by {{consuming}} nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants {{on the surface of the}} ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm {{is stored}} in the spermathecae, organs of the female {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to <b>fertilise</b> several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E

40|$|When {{females are}} inseminated {{by more than}} one male (polyandry) sexual {{selection}} continues after insemination in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. The sexually-selected sperm hypothesis proposes that, under the risk of sperm competition, additive variation in male traits determining <b>fertilising</b> efficiency will select for female propensity to be polyandrous in order to increase the probability of producing sons with superior <b>fertilising</b> efficiency. Two factors complicate this prediction: sex-biased transmission of male <b>fertilising</b> efficiency traits and sexual antagonism of sex-limited traits, fostered by sex-biased inheritance. Here, we (i) review the evidence that male traits contributing towards <b>fertilising</b> efficiency are heritable through sex-biased mechanisms, and (ii) explore the evolutionary implications for male and female reproductive strategies caused by both sex-biased transmission and sexual antagonism of <b>fertilising</b> efficiency traits. Many male <b>fertilising</b> efficiency traits are heritable through sex-biased mechanisms and may not necessarily increase female fitness. The predictions of the sexually-selected sperm hypothesis change dramatically under these different mechanisms of inheritance of <b>fertilising</b> efficiency traits, and different fitness pay-offs derived by females from the expression of such traits. Both sex-biased control of <b>fertilising</b> efficiency and sexual antagonism may also be important in explaining the maintenance of the genetic variance and selection potential of <b>fertilising</b> efficiency. We propose that a useful approach to test the sexually-selected sperm hypothesis is to combine studies which identify behavioural and physiological mechanisms explaining variation in reproductive success with artificial selection experiments to infer the underlying evolutionary patterns...|$|R
60|$|The {{results from}} <b>fertilising</b> the flower-heads {{in the above}} {{imperfect}} manner cannot be fully trusted; but I may state that the four legitimately <b>fertilised</b> flower-heads yielded on an average 7.50 seeds per head; whereas the seven illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> heads yielded {{less than half the}} number, or on an average only 3.28 seeds. The legitimately crossed seeds from the long-styled flowers were finer than those from the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers on the same plants, in the ratio of 100 to 82, as shown by the weights of an equal number.|$|R
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to <b>fertilise</b> themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively <b>fertilise</b> future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers to hatch are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and <b>fertilise</b> them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
60|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{point in this}} table is the small average number of seeds from the short-styled flowers when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> and the unusually large average number of seeds yielded by the illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> long- styled flowers, relatively in both cases to {{the product of the}} legitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers. (1/18. H. Muller says 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 352, that the long-styled flowers, when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> yield as many seeds as when legitimately fertilised; but by adding up the number of seeds from all the capsules produced by the two methods of fertilisation, as given by him, I arrive at the results shown in Table 1.13. The average number in the long-styled capsules, when legitimately <b>fertilised,</b> is 91.4, and when illegitimately <b>fertilised,</b> 77.5; or as 100 to 85. H. Muller agrees with me that this is the proper manner of viewing the case.) The two legitimate unions compared with the two illegitimate together yield seeds in the ratio of 100 to 61.|$|R
60|$|The long-styled oxlip {{was more}} fertile than the three short-styled oxlips, {{and about half}} its pollen-grains {{appeared}} sound. It bore no seed when legitimately <b>fertilised</b> by the short-styled oxlips; but this no doubt {{was due to the}} badness of the pollen of the latter; for when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> (Table 2.14) by its own pollen it produced some good seeds, though much fewer than self- <b>fertilised</b> cowslips or primroses would have produced. The long-styled oxlip likewise yielded a very low average of seed, as may be seen in the third compartment of Tables 2.15 to 2.18, when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> by, and when illegitimately <b>fertilising,</b> pure cowslips and primroses. The four corresponding legitimate unions, however, were moderately fertile, and one (namely that between a short-styled cowslip and the long-styled oxlip in Table 2.17) was nearly as fertile as if both parents had been pure. A short-styled primrose legitimately <b>fertilised</b> by the long-styled oxlip (Table 2.18) also yielded a moderately good average, namely 48.7 seeds; but if this short-styled primrose had been <b>fertilised</b> by a long-styled primrose it would have yielded an average of 65 seeds. If we take the ten legitimate unions together, and the ten illegitimate unions together, we shall find that 29 per cent of the flowers <b>fertilised</b> in a legitimate manner yielded capsules, these containing on an average 27.4 good and bad seeds; whilst only 15 per cent of the flowers <b>fertilised</b> in an illegitimate manner yielded capsules, these containing on an average only 11.0 good and bad seeds.|$|R
60|$|Flowers legitimately <b>fertilised</b> set seeds under {{conditions}} which cause the almost complete failure of illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> flowers. Thus {{in the spring}} of 1862 forty flowers were <b>fertilised</b> {{at the same time in}} both ways. The plants were accidentally exposed in the greenhouse to too hot a sun, and a large number of umbels perished. Some, however, remained in moderately good health, and on these there were twelve flowers which had been <b>fertilised</b> legitimately, and eleven which had been <b>fertilised</b> illegitimately. The twelve legitimate unions yielded seven fine capsules, containing on an average each 57.3 good seeds; whilst the eleven illegitimate unions yielded only two capsules, of which one contained 39 seeds, but so poor, that I do not suppose one would have germinated, and the other contained 17 fairly good seeds.|$|R
5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to <b>fertilise</b> the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot <b>fertilise</b> {{itself and}} {{requires}} cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, striated, buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E
5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to <b>fertilise</b> the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to {{accelerate}} fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black at one end and white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

40|$|A {{quarter of}} the {{agricultural}} land in the Czech Republic is covered by permanent grasslands, whose area is still slowly growing. Grasslands, {{in addition to the}} production functions, perform many non-productive ones. Grasslands are an essential part of our landscape. This thesis describes the importance of <b>fertilising</b> for grasslands and response of grasses, clovers and herbs on the application of mineral and organic fertilisers. Furthermore evaluates the influence of intensity of <b>fertilising</b> on species composition and yields of permanent grassland. The issue was solved through an experiment at Kameničky stand, which is located at Bohemian-Moravian Highlands at an altitude of 650 m. In the experiment were evaluated variants of fertilising: non-fertilised, <b>fertilised</b> P 30 +K 60, <b>fertilised</b> N 90 +P 30 +K 60 and <b>fertilised</b> N 180 +P 30 +K 60 with a two-felling and three-felling usage variants in 2014. The results show, that with increasing dose of delivered nutrients increase fodder yields at the expense of decreasing species diversity. Nitrogen <b>fertilising</b> promotes the development of grasses and reduces the proportion of clovers and herbs in the stand. Phosphorus and potassium <b>fertilising</b> increase species diversity and supports the numbers of clovers and herbs in the stand. Two-felled stands had higher yields of fodder dry matter (t. ha- 1) than three-felled, which are richer on species...|$|R
60|$|We have {{hitherto}} treated of {{the fertility}} {{of the flowers}} of heterostyled plants, when legitimately and illegitimately <b>fertilised.</b> The present chapter will be devoted {{to the character of}} their offspring or seedlings. Those raised from legitimately <b>fertilised</b> seeds will be here called LEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS or PLANTS, and those from illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> seeds, ILLEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS or PLANTS. They differ chiefly in their degree of fertility, and in their powers of growth or vigour. I will begin with trimorphic plants, and I must remind the reader that each of the three forms can be <b>fertilised</b> in six different ways; so that all three together can be <b>fertilised</b> in eighteen different ways. For instance, a long-styled form can be <b>fertilised</b> legitimately by the longest stamens of the mid-styled and short-styled forms, and illegitimately by its own- form and mid-length and shortest stamens, also by the mid-length stamens of the mid-styled and by the shortest stamens of the short-styled form; so that the long-styled can be <b>fertilised</b> legitimately in two ways and illegitimately in four ways. The same holds good with respect to the mid-styled and short-styled forms. Therefore with trimorphic species six of the eighteen unions yield legitimate offspring, and twelve yield illegitimate offspring.|$|R

The soil is often waterlogged, which favours {{the production of}} toxic ions such as ammonium, and its pH is an acidic 4 to 5.

60|$|Thirty long-styled flowers <b>fertilised</b> illegitimately {{by their}} own-form {{two sets of}} stamens yielded only eight very poor capsules; but long-styled flowers <b>fertilised</b> by bees with pollen from their own stamens {{produced}} numerous capsules containing on an average 21.5 seeds.|$|R

25|$|For {{the process}} of {{pollination}} to be successful, a pollen grain produced by the anther, the male part of a flower, must be transferred to a stigma, the female part of the flower, of a plant of the same species. The process is rather different in angiosperms (flowering plants) from what it is in gymnosperms (other seed plants). In angiosperms, after the pollen grain has landed on the stigma, it creates a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches the ovary. Sperm cells from the pollen grain then move along the pollen tube, enter the egg cell through the micropyle and <b>fertilise</b> it, resulting {{in the production of}} a seed.|$|E
25|$|Shallow-water {{species of}} the {{continental}} shelf and epipelagic/mesopelagic zones are characterised {{by the presence of}} hectocotyli, specially modified arms used to <b>fertilise</b> the female's eggs. Most deep-sea squid lack hectocotyli and have longer penises; Ancistrocheiridae and Cranchiinae are exceptions. Giant squid of the genus Architeuthis are unusual in that they possess both a large penis and modified arm tips, although whether the latter are used for spermatophore transfer is uncertain. Penis elongation has been observed in the deep-water species Onykia ingens; when erect, the penis may be as long as the mantle, head, and arms combined. As such, deep-water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile barnacles.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the female}} is {{carrying}} a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an egg deposition site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued {{by one or more}} males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to <b>fertilise</b> the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to assess}} the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs) from one kilogram of live weight cattle production from annual pastures, nitrogen (N) <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures and non-N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures in Western Australia for different farming practices. Using streamlined life cycle assessment (SLCA) methodology, it was estimated that approximately 14. 30 kg, 12. 09 kg and 11. 0 kg of CO 2 -e of GHG emissions will be emitted from the production of one kilogram of live weight cattle from annual, non-N <b>fertilised</b> and N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures respectively. Enteric emissions account for a significant portion of GHG emissions (85 % from annual pasture and around 95 % from perennial pastures). Live weight yields from annual pasture emit more GHG emissions than do N <b>fertilised</b> and non-N <b>fertilised</b> perennial pastures. Although the inclusion of liming produces additional GHG emissions, the increase in productivity associated with these activities can actually offset GHG emissions when considered on a per kilogram basis. life cycle assessment; greenhouse gases; GHG emissions; pastures; live weight; streamlined LCA; Australia; cattle production; nitrogen fertilisation; farming practices; CO 2; carbon dioxide; carbon emissions; productivity...|$|R
60|$|We see in Tables 2/14 to 2/18 {{the number}} of {{capsules}} and of seeds produced, by crossing both forms of the oxlip in a legitimate and illegitimate manner with one another, and with the two forms of the primrose and cowslip. I may premise that the pollen {{of two of the}} short-styled oxlips consisted of nothing but minute aborted whitish cells; but in the third short-styled plant about one- fifth of the grains appeared in a sound condition. Hence {{it is not surprising that}} neither the short-styled nor the long-styled oxlip produced a single seed when <b>fertilised</b> with this pollen. Nor did the pure cowslips or primroses when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> with it; but when thus legitimately <b>fertilised</b> they yielded a few good seeds. The female organs of the short-styled oxlips, though greatly deteriorated in power, were in a rather better condition than the male organs; for though the short-styled oxlips yielded no seed when <b>fertilised</b> by the long-styled oxlips, and hardly any when illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> by pure cowslips or primroses, yet when legitimately <b>fertilised</b> by these latter species, especially by the long-styled primrose, they yielded a moderate supply of good seed.|$|R
60|$|Under these circumstances, {{it seemed}} {{advisable}} to ascertain {{what would be}} the effect of legitimately crossing long-styled plants of the fourth illegitimate generation with pollen taken from non-related short-styled plants, growing under different conditions. Accordingly several flowers on plants of the fourth illegitimate generation (i.e., great-great-grandchildren of plants which had been legitimately <b>fertilised),</b> growing vigorously in pots in the greenhouse, were legitimately <b>fertilised</b> with pollen from an almost wild short-styled cowslip, and these flowers yielded some fine capsules. Thirty other flowers on the same illegitimate plants were <b>fertilised</b> with their own pollen, and these yielded seventeen capsules, containing on an average thirty-two seeds. This is a high degree of fertility; higher, I believe, than that which generally obtains with illegitimately <b>fertilised</b> long-styled plants growing out of doors, and higher than that of the previous illegitimate generations, although their flowers were <b>fertilised</b> with pollen taken from a distinct plant of the same form.|$|R
25|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{are typically}} dioecious, with separate {{male and female}} individuals. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles. Many species <b>fertilise</b> their eggs internally. The fertilised egg develops in a pouch on the adult's body and eventually hatches as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus. The remaining species develop their eggs into a free-swimming larva, usually after about three days of development. This larva swims {{by means of a}} long band of cilia wrapped around its body. As the larva grows it transforms into a barrel-shaped body with three to five separate rings of cilia. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.|$|E
