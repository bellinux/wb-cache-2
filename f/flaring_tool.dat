50|$|Flared {{connectors}} {{should not}} be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a tapered conical shaped connection instead. A specialized <b>flaring</b> <b>tool</b> is used to enlarge tubing into a 45ยบ tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting. The flare nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|E
50|$|Flare {{connections}} {{require that}} the end of a tubing section be spread outward in a bell shape using a <b>flare</b> <b>tool.</b> A <b>flare</b> nut then compresses this bell-shaped end onto a male fitting. Flare connections are a labor-intensive method of making connections, but are quite reliable over the course of many years.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To explore severe flare and {{constant}} disease pattern (no periods of remission) in AS {{as predictors of}} poor outcomes [impaired function, unemployment/early retirement, work impairment, anti-TNF, surgery, frequent general practitioner (GP) visits, depression and anxiety]. Methods. Three hundred and forty-eight AS patients completed questionnaires about their experience with disease flares. Questionnaire data were linked to electronic medical records to examine visits to GPs and hospital admission data. Outcomes were stratified in two ways: self-reported experience of severe flare {{and constant}} disease pattern using the <b>flare</b> illustration <b>tool.</b> Results. The majority of patients (72...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the game, one acquires many tools. Each {{character}} can unlock three tools. Ashley's tools are the Hurl Knife, Booty Call (secret - telepath tower), and <b>Flare</b> Gun. Brad's <b>tools</b> are the Kick Boots, Bombs, and Earthquake. Lilka utilizes three rods: Fire, Freeze, and Change, which turns large gems into traversable blocks. Tim uses [...] "Pooka", a guide which can unlock secret [...] "medium" [...] powers, {{as well as}} Air Ballet and Mist Cloak. Kanon uses the Wire Hook, Rad Blades, and Jump Shoes. Marivel, the secret character, comes with the Electel, and can unlock the Windup Key and My Mike, which summons secret enemies.|$|R
40|$|We use Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) {{measurements}} {{from the}} VIRGO (Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations) instrument on board SOHO to obtain preliminary {{estimates of the}} mean total radiative energy emitted by X-class solar <b>flares.</b> The basic <b>tool</b> is that of summed-epoch analysis, which has also enabled us to detect and partially characterize systematic errors present in the basic data. We describe these errors, which significantly degrade the photometry at high frequencies. We find the ratio of GOES 1 - 8 {AA luminosity to total bolometric luminosity to be of order 0. 01.
