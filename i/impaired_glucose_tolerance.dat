Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies.

40|$|Summary. During an oral <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> test (OGTT) <b>glucose</b> and insulin {{levels were}} {{measured}} in 26 patients with prolactin-producing pituitary tumours without growth hormone excess. Basal glu-cose and insulin levels {{did not differ}} from the values of an age-matched control group. After glucose load the hyperprolactinaemic patients showed a decrease in <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> and a hyperinsulinaemia. Bromo-criptine (CB 154), which suppressed PRL, improved <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> and decreased insulin towards nor-mal in a second OGTT. - Human PRL or CB 154 had no significant influence on insulin release due to glu-cose in the perfused rat pancreas. - These findings suggest a diabetogenic effect of PRL.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as {{a critical factor in}} the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype was one of the principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and <b>impaired</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance.</b> As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and <b>impaired</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance,</b> familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

We {{recently}} identified {{adipose tissue}} inflammation and resulting dysfunctional adipose tissue-liver cross-talk {{as an early}} event {{in the development of}} HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance. In particular, reducing white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation by adipocyte-specific depletion of Fas/CD 95 protected mice from developing hepatic insulin resistance but not hepatic steatosis. Herein, we expanded our previous work and determined the impact of four days of HFD on lipolytic activity of isolated adipocytes. Compared with chow-fed mice, the degree of basal and isoproterenol-stimulated free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol release was similar in HFD-fed animals. Moreover, insulin's ability to suppress lipolysis remained intact, suggesting retained insulin sensitivity. Despite unaltered lipolysis, circulating FFA concentrations were greatly increased in non-fasted HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, a short-term HFD challenge does not affect lipolytic function of adipocytes. The observed increase of circulating FFA levels in randomly fed animals may rather be the result of increased dietary fat supply...|$|R

Hepatic overexpression of renin resulted in constitutively elevated plasma angiotensin II (four-to six-fold increase vs. wild-type, WT). Surprisingly, RenTgMK mice developed glucose intolerance despite low levels of adiposity and insulinemia. The transgenics also had lower plasma triglyceride levels. Glucose intolerance in transgenic mice fed a low-fat diet was comparable to that observed in high-fat fed WT mice.

Nerve growth factor (NGF), a classical trophic factor for nerve cells, is expressed in pancreatic vasculature while its TrkA receptor is localized to islet β cells. High glucose rapidly enhances NGF secretion and increases TrkA phosphorylation in mouse and human islets. Tissue-specific deletion of NGF or TrkA, or acute disruption of TrkA signaling, <b>impairs</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> and insulin secretion in mice.
