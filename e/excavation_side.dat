An advanced elasto-plastic constitutive law is adopted to model the soil behavior. Multi-stage construction of both the cut-and-cover box and NATM excavation are modeled. Ground surface settlements behind diaphragm walls induced by the cut-and-cover excavation are in good agreement with those calculated from the simplified method. Deflection of diaphragm wall on the NATM <b>excavation</b> <b>side</b> was smaller than that of the opposite side due to stress release from the tunnel excavation.

40|$|The {{overturning}} {{failure of}} a 13 storey residential building in Shanghai, China, has been investigated by plane strain finite element analysis (FEA). The results of the FEA indicate that ultimate failure of the building was probably initiated by the formation of tensile cracking in the reinforced concrete piles located under {{the side of the}} building adjacent to an excavation. This eventually led to complete structural failure of the piles located along the <b>excavation</b> <b>side,</b> which probably caused further settlement of the building, leading eventually to a toppling failure resulting in overturning of the entire building. Excessive tensile stress in the piles was probably caused by the combination of excavation of soil at one side of the building and the temporary dumping of the excavated soil on the opposite side of the building. It is likely that the effect of temporary dumping of the excavated soil adjacent to the building was either not considered or not properly taken into account in the foundation design nor the construction operations. A simple but important lesson to be draw from this failure is the need for engineers who design foundations in soft soil regions to consider not only the final loading conditions, but also any temporary and transient loading conditions during the construction process...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{improvement}} {{methods are}} commonly adopted in deep excavation to minimize wall deflection, wall bending moment and strut force. In this thesis {{a different approach}} to the application of ground improvement techniques is analyzed {{in the form of a}} parametric study developed with the use of a commercial finite element code. A new remedial ground improvement solution applied to an existing deep excavation located in Singapore and part of the Circle Line Project (CCL) for the construction of a new subway line is considered and computationally modeled. The soil profile in the site mainly consists of deep marine soft clay dated for the most part in the Holocene period, principally characterized by a normally to very low overconsolidation ratio, in some location even underconsolidated. The parametric analysis aims to evaluate short-term effects of the application of cementing agents to the lower portion of the marine clay externally to the <b>excavation</b> <b>side.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed ground improvement is examined using a finite element model corresponding to a key cross-section of CCL 1 project. (cont.) Parametric analyses are used to assess how the dimensions of the treatment zone and strength of soilcrete columns affect the computed wall deflections, bending moments and strut loads. The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in controlling the structural behavior of the excavation support system. The same method is then used to simulate the retrofit of the partially excavated section. The results show it is possible for an external ground treatment to control wall deflections and bending moments and reduce strut loads. The thesis finally discuss the practical advantages of the solution and its limitations. by Alessia Alexandra Ferrari. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic <b>excavations,</b> on its <b>sides.</b> The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets.

The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section.

The church apparently had different architectural traits from other churches in Serbia, even though it belongs to the Raška style chronologically.

The altar itself is separated from the nave with two columns. There is no iconostasis. The nave was covered with a dome, but nothing of the dome remains today. The narthex, rebuilt in the 14th century, was the same width as the nave, with two rectangular rooms on the north and south <b>sides.</b> <b>Excavations</b> in 1951 showed that on the western side of the church were two towers without doors.

Part of the thesis deals with description of construction sequence of diaphragm walls, excavation of the shaft, excavation of the adjacent metro station and following construction of metro tubes and backfilling of the shaft. Inseparable part of the thesis is assessment of geological conditions and geotechnical parameters. Furthermore, a study on temperature loads on struts was carried out and the results of the study were used for design of the struts. To fulfil the requirements of the assignment several models of the shaft structure and adjacent metro station were built in program Plaxis and one model of the diaphragm wall of the shaft was created in program Geo 5. The model outputs were subsequently compared to each other. Furthermore a model of lateral support frame was created in program Scia Engineer. Outputs from programs Plaxis and Scia Engineer were used as a basis for design checks of the structure. The design checks were done according to Eurocodes. The diaphragm wall and the lateral support frame were designed to support the loads considered in this thesis. In order to simplify the calculation variable loads from construction machines were not considered and the only variable load considered was the temperature load on struts.

Work began at the damsite in 1961 with foundation drilling. In 1962 the power plant exploratory tunnel was excavated. The construction contract for the dam was awarded to a joint venture between the Al Johnson Construction Company and Morrison-Knudsen, with notice to proceed given on June 13, 1963. Access roads and a diversion tunnel were begun that year, with the diversion tunnel complete by May 1964. Keyway <b>excavation</b> on either <b>side</b> of the dam continued through 1964.

Final concrete placement on the dam took place on September 14, 1967. The diversion tunnel was closed on January 24, 1968, with releases through the outlet structures the next day.
