50|$|Dangerous Minds is a 1995 American drama film {{directed}} by John N. Smith, and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It {{is based on}} the autobiography My Posse Don't <b>Do</b> <b>Homework</b> <b>by</b> retired U.S. Marine LouAnne Johnson, who took up a teaching position at Carlmont High School in Belmont, California, in 1989, where most of her students were African-American and Latino teenagers from East Palo Alto, a poverty-stricken, racially segregated, economically deprived city. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Johnson, the film was released to a mixed to mostly negative critical reception, but became a surprise box office success in the summer of 1995, leading {{to the creation of a}} short-lived television series.|$|R

Her father Avdija Hadžikarić did not {{hesitate}} to educate his female children, an unusual act among Muslims in the 19th century. His five daughters were educated in Sarajevo to become teachers, albeit under unfavorable circumstances; <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> <b>by</b> the light of tallow candles and walking great lengths daily to school. After allowing his daughters to be educated, her father could not enter the Baščaršija for months without being confronted about it or having rocks thrown at him.

5000|$|Sherrod's basic {{math skills}} {{prove to be}} {{extremely}} poor, and Bubbles insists that he return to school. Bubbles visits Edward Tilghman middle school with Sherrod and convinces the Assistant Principal, Marcia Donnelly, to take him in, {{even though he has}} been missing from the school system for years. Sherrod only attends class once, when Bubbles forces him to, cutting class instead to go on the corner and deal drugs for [...] "Jojo". He tries to fake <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> <b>by</b> bringing books from school back to the squat he shares with Bubbles. It is thus revealed that Sherrod is illiterate as well as innumerate, as he does not know that the two books he is trying to pass off to Bubbles as a textbook and its associated workbook are actually an algebra textbook and a dictionary; Sherrod is completely unaware of his blunder, as he cannot read the titles on the covers. Bubbles, who can read, immediately notices Sherrod's lie and shows disappointment. When Bubbles finds Sherrod dealing on a school day, he tries to talk to him and is attacked by an addict who needs money. Bubbles then tells Sherrod that he cannot stay with him any more unless he returns to school.|$|R
40|$|Like the African proverb, “It takes {{a village}} to raise a child, ” many {{educational}} re-searchers charge {{that it takes a}} comprehensive school reform to raise student achievement. With the passing of the No Child Left Behind legislation in 2002, na-tional officials authorized the Comprehensive School Reform program to support low performing schools as they struggled to improve student achievement. As a re-sult of this national effort, an increase in implementation of comprehensive school reforms is occurring in schools serving predominantly diverse student populations in urban areas.

By means of multi-level analysis of data of 6, 545 students in 46 Flemish secondary schools with self-reported student measures and teachers’ evaluations of students, this study examines if teachers’ evaluations of secondary school students’ cognitive capacity, effort in class and diligence in <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> vary <b>by</b> track, and whether teachers’ perceptions are informed (1) by the typical students’ background features; (2) by the students’ resistance to school; or (3) by labeling of students attending certain tracks. Teachers perceive lower track students as less able and less diligent in <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> because of students’ social and cognitive characteristics and anti-school behavior. Accounting for the latter, teachers even evaluate lower track students as paying slightly more effort. The implications for future research and social policy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The study {{sought to}} find out the factors {{affecting}} academic performance of orphaned children in Bindura District primary schools in Zimbabwe. The descriptive survey design was used in this study. The population was 300 teachers and 50 orphaned children. A sample of 80 teachers and 10 children randomly selected participated in this research study. Data were collected using questionnaires and interviews. The SPSS programme was used to analyse the data. The study found out that orphaned children did not perform well academically during class work.

40|$|There {{seems to}} be a general {{consensus}} in the literature that <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> is beneficial for students. Thus, the current challenge is to examine the process of <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> to find which variables may help students to complete the homework assigned. To address this goal, a path analysis model was fit. The model hypothesized that the way students engage in <b>homework</b> is explained <b>by</b> the type of academic goals set, and it explains the amount of time spend on homework, the homework time management, and the amount of <b>homework</b> <b>done.</b> Lastly, the amount of <b>homework</b> <b>done</b> is positively related to academic achievement. The model was fit using a sample of 535 Spanish students from the last three courses of elementary school (aged 9 to 13). Findings show that: (a) academic achievement was positively associated with the amount of homework completed, (b) the amount of homework completed was related to the homework time management, (c) homework time management was associated with the approach to homework; (d) and the approach to homework, {{like the rest of the}} variables of the model (except for the time spent on homework), was related to the student's academic motivation (i. e., academic goals) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{investigates the}} effect that the delivery of XO laptops in Peru has had on teachers' pedagogical practices and students' use of time in the home based on information from a randomized control trial. The results show that the delivery of XO laptops reduces the probability that teachers will use a student-centered method with cooperative characteristics between 6 and 13 pp while this type of pedagogical practice has a positive impact on student performance in the area of language (between 1. 5 and 2 sd). We found two contrary effects in the home. XO laptops reduce the probability that a student will <b>do</b> <b>homework</b> at home <b>by</b> 4 pp despite the fact that doing so increases language performance 4 standard deviations. Additionally, XO laptops increase the probability of watching television by 8 pp although said activity reduces performance 2 sd. XO laptops also reduce the probability that students will perform household chores between 9 and 40 pp while said activity increases language performance between 0. 2 and 1. 6 standard deviations for language. We did not find effects on language and the majority of results refer to students in fourth grade of primary. The variety and overlapping of effects may explain the null effect of the program for the sample of 2 nd to 6 th grade of primary and the negative effect for fourth of primary...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we measure}} {{the effect of}} {{perceived}} stereotypes on self-efficacy and academic performance specific to the Native American/Alaska Native population at Fort Lewis College. Stereotype threat is common within minorities and we seek the origin of stereotype threat in an academic setting. A survey was used to see how Native American student participants rated the following population’s perception of themselves: Non-Native American professors, Native American professors, Non-Native American students, and Native American students, along the measures of intelligence, motivation, and by preparedness (perceived stereotypes). We also measured self-efficacy on common academic success scales (e. g., {{how well do you}} concentrate on school subjects, how well <b>do</b> you complete <b>homework</b> <b>by</b> deadlines). Results suggested that stereotype threat does not exist from an out-group at Fort Lewis College, but from an in-group. Native American participants were not concerned with how Non-Native American professors and Non-Native American students perceived them on the perceived stereotype axis, but were more concerned with how Native American professors and Native American students perceived them on the perceived stereotype axis. Motivation was one of the key perceived stereotypes seen from Native American/Alaska Native participants that correlated with the participants’ self-efficacy. Despite the lack of perception from Native American participants’ perceived stereotypes and its effect on self-efficacy and academic performance, they still thought that Non-Native American professors and students thought of them as less intelligent, motivated, and prepared...|$|R
