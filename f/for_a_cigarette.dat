5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a {{follower}} of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

5|$|Howard (Melissa Leo) quits smoking, and {{her partner}} Felton (Daniel Baldwin) fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to quit smoking, but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his smoking partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can smoke in the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E

500|$|On {{leaving the}} École Niedermeyer, Fauré was {{appointed}} organist at the Church of Saint-Sauveur, at Rennes in Brittany. He {{took up the}} post in January 1866. During his four years at Rennes he supplemented his income by taking private pupils, giving [...] "countless piano lessons". At Saint-Saëns's regular prompting he continued to compose, but none of his works from this period survive. He was bored at Rennes and had an uneasy relationship with the parish priest, who correctly doubted Fauré's religious conviction. Fauré was regularly seen stealing out during the sermon <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> and in early 1870, when he turned up to play at Mass one Sunday still in his evening clothes, having been out all night at a ball, {{he was asked to}} resign. Almost immediately, with the discreet aid of Saint-Saëns, he secured the post of assistant organist at the church of Notre-Dame de Clignancourt, in the north of Paris. He remained there for only a few months. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he volunteered for military service. He took part in the action to raise the Siege of Paris, and saw action at Le Bourget, Champigny and Créteil. He was awarded a Croix de Guerre.|$|E
