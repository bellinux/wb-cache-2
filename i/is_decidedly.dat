5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Enolate {{trapping}} {{with various}} electrophiles <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> less common. In one study, the Nazarov cyclization is {{paired with a}} Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to β-nitrostyrene. In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions: it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization {{and in the next}} step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R-group.|$|E
5|$|Teeth of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Belobaka, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Brachytarsomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Brachytarsomys are large rats that live in trees and eat fruits at middle to high altitudes. The modern, dry environment in northwestern Madagascar <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> inhospitable to these animals, and they no longer occur there; the former presence of B.mahajambaensis could indicate that the region was more humid in the past.|$|E

25|$|The area’s economy <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> a rural one; {{however the}} overall {{municipality}} {{is not considered}} to be economically marginalized. One community is ranked as extremely poor and eleven ranked as poor, accounting for just under 2,200 of the municipality's total population.|$|E
25|$|While the {{depiction}} of inanimate objects and still lifes is seen to be very realistic in Qajar painting, {{the depiction}} of human beings <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> idealised. This is especially evident in the portrayal of Qajar royalty, where the subjects of the paintings are very formulaically placed and situated to achieve a desired effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} {{generally}} divided into Northern and Southern California, although {{the boundary between}} the two is not well defined. San Francisco <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> a Northern California city and Los Angeles likewise a Southern California one, but areas in between do not often share their confidence in geographic identity. The US Geological Survey defines the geographic center of the state at a point near North Fork, California.|$|E

25|$|Though {{representing}} a general return to certain notions of music-making {{that are often}} considered to be classical or romantic, not all postmodern composers have eschewed the experimentalist or academic tenets of modernism. The works of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen, for example, exhibit experimentalist preoccupation that <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> anti-romantic. Eclecticism and freedom of expression, {{in reaction to the}} rigidity and aesthetic limitations of modernism, are the hallmarks of the postmodern influence in musical composition.|$|E
25|$|The tenor Michael Kelly, {{who had a}} long {{professional}} association with Braham, remarked in 1826 that 'he <b>is,</b> <b>decidedly,</b> the greatest vocalist of his day.' John Braham became seen (retrospectively) as the founder of a dynasty of leading British tenors of the concert and oratorio stage. His immediate successor was the Englishman John Sims Reeves who sang into the 1880s. Reeves was succeeded by Edward Lloyd, who between 1874 and his retirement in 1900 took part in every Handel Triennial Festival at the Crystal Palace. Braham's 'Death of Nelson' remained in Lloyd's repertoire during the 1900s: in Lloyd's declamatory style, ringing but without much vibrato, {{there may be an}} echo of the stentorian style of Braham himself. In the early twentieth century the declamatory delivery in Handel's music was maintained by Walter Widdop and Joseph Hislop among others.|$|E
500|$|He later denied Scott's {{claim in}} The Voyage of the Discovery, {{that he had}} been carried on the sledge. He was in a seriously {{weakened}} condition; Wilson's diary entry for 14 January reads: [...] "Shackleton has been anything but up to the mark, and today he <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> worse, very short winded and coughing constantly, with more serious symptoms that need not be detailed here but which are of no small consequence one hundred and sixty miles from the ship".|$|E

500|$|Stephenson <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> not a prodigy; but his babe-in-the-woods routine {{has proved}} irresistible for some, who are hailing his {{seemingly}} innate ability to meld {{the products of}} exhaustive historical research with {{what they see as}} a brilliant, idiosyncratic sense of humor and adventure. Time's critic has declared that Stephenson has a [...] "once-in-a-generation gift", and that Quicksilver [...] "will defy any category, genre, precedent or label—except for genius". This is promotional copy disguised as literary criticism. There is nothing category-defying about this ridiculous book.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, Potter privately {{published}} The Tale of Peter Rabbit, and, in 1902, Frederick Warne & Co. {{published a}} trade {{edition of the}} book, which was hugely successful. In 1904, she followed Peter Rabbit with its sequel, The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, and continued the rabbit saga in 1909 with The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and in 1912 with The Tale of Mr. Tod. All the tales were in part inspired by Joel Chandler Harris's Uncle Remus stories, which Potter illustrated as early as 1893 {{in an attempt to}} find a career direction. Potter was unable to successfully translate Harris's characters to the English country garden, but she transformed the American author's [...] "lippity-clippity, clippity-lippity" [...] to [...] "lippity-lippity" [...] in Peter Rabbit, and used his [...] "rabbit tobacco" [...] (lavender) in Benjamin Bunny and Mr. Tod. None of her rabbit characters were based on Br'er Rabbit; Harris's rabbit wins by cunning, but Potter's Benjamin and Peter win by pure luck. [...] The rabbit universe in Potter <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> a more pleasant place than that found in Harris's stories.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 3, 1911. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters include those in Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. The Billboard reviewed the film and offered praise for the production, [...] "This picture presents a story that <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> original and away from beaten paths. The settings in Turkey are elaborate and faithful to Turkish customs. All the players portray their respective parts in an excellent manner. The photography is very good." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror provided {{a summary of the}} film and concluded that the film [...] "was well enacted and the sets were fully adequate, creating a fair illusion of the Oriental land depicted." [...] The Moving Picture World was also provided a positive review, stating [...] "The scenic effects are interesting and the story is lively enough to keep the audience wondering what the end will be." [...] One advertisement for the film erroneously claimed that the film was shot in the Orient, unaware that the film was shot in Thanhouser's studio.|$|E

500|$|Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "In {{addition}} to raising the Madonna/whore ante with songs like the title cut, Virgin cradled {{the kind of}} '80s hits ("Dress You Up") built to transcend the Dynasty era." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine remembered {{the first time that}} he heard the songs from the album and commented, [...] "Lots of critics think something similar occurred when Madonna followed her eponymous debut with Like a Virgin, helmed by Nile Rodgers with all the fixin's—too calculated next to the 'raw passion' of the debut. This is nonsense; it misses how Madonna conflated notions of spontaneity and calculation. Rodgers is the ideal collaborator." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times said: [...] "With a tough-cookie voice that's both coy and streetwise, Madonna's singing harks back to the rock-and-roll girl-group tradition that preceded the Beatles. But where girl groups, from the Shirelles to the Ronettes, worshipfully extolled their boyfriends' cars, haircuts and rebel poses, Madonna's point of view <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> more self-interested. In matters of love, she is a comparison shopper with a shrewd sense of her own market value. The words 'shiny and new' describe not only the way the love-smitten singer feels in the title song but the sound of the album." ...|$|E

[...] It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Corman's 1962 {{anthology}} film Tales of Terror {{combines the}} story with another Poe story, The Black Cat This loosely adapted version <b>is</b> <b>decidedly</b> comic in tone, and stars Peter Lorre as Montresor (given the name Montresor Herringbone) and Vincent Price as Fortunato Luchresi. The amalgamation of the two stories provides a motive for the murderer: Fortunato has an affair with Montresor's wife.|$|E
