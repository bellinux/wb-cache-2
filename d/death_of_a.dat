5|$|Divorcing {{a spouse}} was {{permissible}} {{if there was}} mutual consent, while remarriage after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spouse was common during the Song period.

Widows remarrying another after the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E
