5|$|The {{history of}} the New York Giants from 1925 to 1978 covers the American {{football}} franchise from the team's inception until the conclusion of their tumultuous 1978 season. Currently members of the NFL's National Football Conference, the Giants were founded in 1925 by original owner Tim Mara in the then five-year-old NFL. Mara gave control of the team over to his two sons—Wellington and Jack—early in their lives. During this period in their history the Giants acquired four NFL championships, but also suffered some <b>down</b> <b>times,</b> including consecutive non-playoff seasons from 1964 to 1978.|$|E

The Virginia football team also competes in {{what is called the}} South's Oldest Rivalry against North Carolina, a historic rivalry game which a sitting President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, once attended in Charlottesville. UVA currently trails in both these series, a lasting vestige of the period when Colgate Darden de-emphasized football in 1952 at a time when Art Guepe was regularly beating both of these rivals by scores such as 34–7 and 44–0. Darden turned down a bid to the 1952 Orange Bowl, and Guepe left. (After building back a winning program forty years later, UVA football was briefly ranked AP No. 1 for several weeks in October 1990 and won at least seven games each year for thirteen consecutive years between 1987 and 1999; however even with the arrival of Bronco Mendenhall in 2016, UVA has again seen <b>down</b> <b>times.)</b> ...|$|E

Prior to the 1990s, theme parks were reliant on magnetic tape or synchronized laserdiscs for multitrack playback. This entailed a high cost of preventative maintenance, with multitrack tape machines needing nightly lubrication, and laserdiscs requiring frequent dusting.

5000|$|To explain sticky wages, Hall {{emphasizes}} the importance of costs borne by the employer. Firms benefit when times are good but are penalized when times are slim (because wages are usually fixed) and they pay for searching for a good employee/employer match. Thus, employers are more risk averse in hiring and have less incentive to engage in search. Hence employers simply do not hire in <b>down</b> <b>times.</b> This idea is reinforced because workers cannot collectively signal that they would work for less in <b>down</b> <b>times,</b> wages have a tendency to stick upwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of resistance exercise strengthening the hip flexor and extensor muscles on functional gait of stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty patients were randomized into two groups. Both groups performed conventional physical therapy for six weeks. The experi-mental group also performed isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for the hip flexor and extensor muscles. The hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time(timed up and go test), and 10 m gait velocity were mea-sured at the baseline, and after 3 weeks, and 6 weeks of treatment. [Results] The experimental showed significant improvements compared to the baseline in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. After 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, there were gains in hip muscle strength and 10 m gait velocity. The control group showed no significant increase in hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time or 10 m gait velocity. [Conclusion] We consider that conventional physical therapy contributes to the improvement of functional gait of stroke patients. However, it is more desirable to perform isokinetic eccentric resistance exercises for hip flexor and extensor muscles combined with conventional physical therapy for the im-provement of hip muscle strength, stair up and <b>down</b> <b>time,</b> TUG time and 10 m gait velocity...|$|R
