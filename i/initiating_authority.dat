The main objectives {{of the study were}} to determine to what extent energy conservation is the source of economical and environmental improvements, and how the use of financial support and technical expertise influence the results. The main conclusions are; (i) that energy conservation may contribute significantly to the results; (ii) that energy advisors positively influence the results with regard to energy savings, economical and environmental improvements; and (ii) hence that energy naturally should be integrated in cleaner production assessments in most sectors due to the significant potentials for energy savings and related profitability and environmental benefits, especially in energy-intensive sectors...|$|R

In this article, I first review research conducted with Scottish Muslims, which found that the experience of being routinely stopped, treated with disrespect, having valued identities such as Britishness and respectability denied or (in the case of Muslim identity) devalued, and feeling publicly humiliated, is having a negative impact on relations with authorities (and potentially the wider community). I will then present a case study conducted with staff at a Scottish airport, focusing on the structural and organizational factors that may warrant Muslims’ concerns about being misrecognized as ‘other’ and dangerous, and constrained in how they may behave in the airport space. This research highlights areas for further investigation and intervention...|$|R
