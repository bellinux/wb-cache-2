Horsetails also exhibit <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> Intercalary meristems are capable of cell division, and they allow for rapid growth and regrowth of many monocots. Intercalary meristems at the nodes of bamboo allow for rapid stem elongation, while those {{at the base of}} most grass leaf blades allow damaged leaves to rapidly regrow. This leaf regrowth in grasses evolved in response to damage by grazing herbivores, but is more familiar to us in response to lawnmowers.|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} skull is {{a complex}} ossified structure of multiple embryological tissue origins. It is formed from two distinct forms of ossification: intramembranous ossification that produces the flat dermal bones of the calvaria craniofacial region and the mandible, and endochondral ossification that forms the cranial base. I investigated the patterns of mineralisation in both bone types, in the dermally ossifying frontal bone and the endochondrally ossifying cranial base. I also investigated the cell behaviour within the frontal bone and expansion of chondrocytes clones in the cranial base synchondroses. I find that the intramembranously ossified frontal bone displays complex and novel forms of biomineralisation, including a system of <b>intercalary</b> biomineral thickness <b>growth</b> that cannot {{be explained by the}} current accepted model of dermal ossification. I discover that the cells associated with the specialised biomineralised architecture of the dermal bone, contribute to its growth via a novel mechanism of bi-directional cellular invasion from the outer layers of the bone to the intervening mineralising layer. Cell behaviour is found to depend upon the direction of invasion for preosteoblasts, which also show a distinct invasive pattern compared to other cell types. I discover a number of previously unknown cell types that possess invasive behaviour, including a double positive RUNX 2 +HAND+ population and neural crest derived endothelial cells in the dermal bone, which co-express the endothelial growth factor VEGFA. Ablation of VEGFA and of HAND 2 in the neural crest lineage prevents invasion of the frontal bone and a loss of thickness growth of biomineral respectively. My analysis of the cranial base reveals a cryptic modularity of growth of its separate bones and cartilages that varies with time. I also find the synchondroses of the cranial base not to be the origin of biomineral growth as expected but discover a system of radial and longitudinal <b>intercalary</b> biomineral <b>growth</b> similar to that observed in the frontal bone. My findings suggest that the timing of growth and ossification of bone is crucial for proper development, and this may inform the pathophysiology of cranial base syndromes than have complex timing of the onset symptoms. It suggests hints that the ancient mechanisms of biomineral growth in dermal bone are co-opted for use by tissues that ossify in an endochondral fashion...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} basic types of plant cell growth: isodiametric, {{unidirectional}} diffuse, and tip growth. During plant cell growth, microtubules {{are present in}} the cell cortex, appressed against the plasma membrane. It is well documented that these cortical microtubules determine the orientation of cell <b>growth</b> in unidirectional <b>intercalary,</b> growing cells, in which the microtubules are always found perpendicular to the axis of cell elongation. There are indications that bast fiber cells of flax have two types of cell growth within one single cell: unidirectional <b>intercalary</b> and tip <b>growth.</b> Since the ultimate length of fiber cells determines the quality of the flax fiber for industry, we study the growth of these cells. In order to determine whether tip growth occurs or not, we use the following tip growth indicators: the type of cell wall at the cell tip, vesicle accumulation at the cell tip, calcium gradient at the cell tip, configuration of the actin cytoskeleton, and configuration of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Here we report on the microtubule cytoskeleton. We started to study the microtubules in fixed flax fiber cells using immunocytochemistry. Both, sections, as well as enzymatically isolated fibers, were analyzed at increasing distances from the shoot apex. Young fibers from the subapical region exhibit microtubules that are positioned approximately perpendicular to the cell's long axis. After prolonged elongation they are found in a helical orientation. In the two tapering regions of the elongating fiber, the microtubules are more often in a perpendicular orientation than in the middle zone of the cell indicating that within a single fiber more than one growth rate might occur. After elongation ceased, all cortical MTs are positioned approximately parallel to the long axis of the fiber. Based on the changes of the configurations of MTs in growing fibers, it is concluded that flax fibers exhibit coordinated growth first, and then also begin to exhibit intrusive growth at both ends as well. Until now, no observations support tip growth...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{kinds of}} fusion have been distinguished: postgenital fusion {{that can be}} {{observed}} during the development of flowers, and congenital fusion that cannot be observed i.e., fusions that occurred during phylogeny. But {{it is very difficult}} to distinguish fusion and non-fusion processes in the evolution of flowering plants. Some processes that have been considered congenital (phylogenetic) fusions appear to be non-fusion processes such as, for example, the de novo formation of <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> in a ring zone at or below the base of primordia. Therefore, [...] "it is now increasingly acknowledged that the term 'fusion,' as applied to phylogeny (as in 'congenital fusion') is ill-advised." ...|$|E
5000|$|Referring to [...] "fusion," [...] {{as it is}} {{commonly}} done, appears questionable because {{at least some of}} the processes involved may be non-fusion processes. For example, the addition of <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> at or below the base of the primordia of floral appendages such as sepals, petals, stamens and carpels may lead to a common base that is not the result of fusion.Many flowers have a symmetry. When the perianth is bisected through the central axis from any point, symmetrical halves are produced, forming a radial symmetry. These flowers are also known to be actinomorphic or regular, e.g. rose or trillium. When flowers are bisected and produce only one line that produces symmetrical halves the flower is said to be irregular or zygomorphic, e.g. snapdragon or most orchids.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} of the other flower parts to the gynoecium {{can be an important}} systematic and taxonomic character. In some flowers, the stamens, petals, and sepals are often said to be [...] "fused" [...] into a [...] "floral tube" [...] or hypanthium. However, as Leins & Erbar (2010) pointed out, [...] "the classical view that the wall of the inferior ovary results from the [...] "congenital" [...] fusion of dorsal carpel flanks and the floral axis does not correspond to the ontogenetic processes that can actually be observed. All that can be seen is an <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> in a broad circular zone that changes the shape of the floral axis (receptacle)." [...] And what happened during evolution is not a phylogenetic fusion but the formation of a unitary intercalary meristem. Evolutionary developmental biology investigates such developmental processes that arise or change during evolution.|$|E
5000|$|The tribe Swartzieae is an early-branching {{monophyletic}} clade of {{the flowering}} plant subfamily Faboideae or Papilionaceae. Traditionally this tribe {{has been used}} as a wastebasket taxon to accommodate genera of Faboideae which exhibit actinomorphic, rather than zygomorphic floral symmetry and/or incompletely differentiated petals and free stamens. It was recently revised and most of its genera were redistributed to other tribes (Amburaneae, Baphieae, and Exostyleae). Under its new circumscription, this clade is consistently resolved in molecular phylogenies. Members of this tribe possess [...] "non-papilionate swartzioid flowers…largely characterized by a tendency to lack petals combined with a profusion and elaboration of free stamens" [...] and a [...] "lack of unidirectional order in the initiation of the stamens". They also have [...] "complete or near complete fusion of sepals resulting from <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> early in development, relatively numerous stamens, and a single or no petal, with other petals not at all apparent in development."

50|$|The goblet or pod-shaped fruit {{bodies of}} Caripia montagnei {{are up to}} 25 mm tall with a cap {{diameter}} up to 6 mm. The cap margin of young fruit bodies curves slightly inward, but the caps enlarge by <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> between {{the top of the}} stipe and the margin, so older specimens develop an obconic (reversed cone) or roughly cylindrical shape with a flattened, and then concave top. The color is whitish to cream, and the surface texture is initially smooth, although the fruit body can develop wrinkles in age. The thin, smooth stipe is brown to purplish brown. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue) is on the outside surface of the cap, rather than the inside, as is usual for cup-shaped fungi. It grows to about 300 µm thick, and develops irregular surface lumps. The thin-walled spores are narrowly pip-shaped, inamyloid, and measure 5-6 by 2.5-3.3 µm.Another stalked cup fungus, Dumontinia tuberosa (formerly Sclerotinia tuberosa), is vaguely similar in appearance to Caripia montagnei, but it is larger, with cups up to 3 cm across and stipes up to 10 cm, and the cups are brown.|$|E
40|$|Epichloë festucae is an agronomically {{important}} seed-transmitted endophytic fungus {{that grows}} symbiotically within the intercellular spaces of temperate grass species. This fungus {{has previously been}} shown to undergo hyphal <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> during host leaf colonization, a highly unusual mechanism of division and extension in non-apical compartments in vegetative hyphae, as an adaptation to colonise rapidly elongating host cells in the developing leaf. However the exact mechanism that triggers <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> was not known. In this study I aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> is stimulated by mechanical stretch imposed by attachment of hyphae to elongating host cells, and that this stress is sensed by mechano-sensors located on hyphal membranes. To test this hypothesis a novel technique was designed and optimised to stretch fungal hyphae under in vitro conditions. Investigation of un-stretched hyphae showed that de novo compartmentalization occurs in sub-apical compartments of E. festucae hyphae according to a compartment length-dependent hierarchy. Subjecting these sub-apical compartments to mechanical stretching showed that hyphal compartment lengths can be increased while maintaining viability, provided that the stretch is within tolerable limits. It further showed that the stretched compartments undergo de novo compartmentalization (nuclear division and septation) similar to un-stretched hyphae but at a significantly higher rate, fulfilling the basic requirements for <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> E. festucae WscA and MidA, which are orthologues of a yeast cell wall stress and a stretch-activated calcium channel protein respectively, were functionally characterized in order to test the possible involvement of these mechano-sensors in intercalary ii growth. Their roles in general hyphal apical growth, cell wall construction and integrity maintenance during growth in culture were confirmed. The limited ability of ΔmidA mutants to colonise developing leaves indicated a possible role in <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth,</b> while ΔwscA mutants showed wild-type levels of host colonization. In future, the ΔmidA and ΔwscA mutants will be subjected to mechanical stretch in vitro to further understand their roles in mechano-sensing and <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> Given the possible involvement of the stretch-activated calcium channel MidA in <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth,</b> a successful technique was developed to study calcium signalling and distribution in E. festucae using the genetically-encoded calcium sensor GCaMP 5. Investigations revealed the presence of MidA-driven Ca 2 + pulses confined to the hyphal tips with unique signatures of temporal and spatial dynamics generated by influx of Ca 2 +. The presence of active sub-apical Ca 2 + uptake systems were confirmed, manifested as occasional Ca 2 + pulses in sub-apical compartments that seemed to increase in frequency with mechanical perturbation, indicating a potential crucial role in mechanical stress-driven <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> In conclusion a prospective model for <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> in the leaf expansion zone is proposed. Mechanical stretching of hyphae results in increased compartment lengths, accompanied by compartmentalization in sub-apical compartments that allows hyphae to extend along their length. Membrane distortion due to stretching activates MidA, triggering a calcium signalling cascade to stimulate cell wall synthesis and other cellular processes...|$|E
40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) phloem fibers {{elongate}} considerably {{during their}} development and intrude between existing cells. We questioned whether fiber elongation {{is caused by}} cell tip growth or <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> Cells with tip growth are characterized by having two specific zones of cytoplasm in the cell tip, one with vesicles and no large organelles at the very tip and one with various organelles amongst others longitudinally arranged cortical microtubules in the subapex. Such zones were not observed in elongating flax fibers. Instead, organelles moved into the very tip region, and cortical microtubules showed transversal and helical configurations as known for cells growing in intercalary way. In addition, pulse-chase experiments with Calcofluor White resulted in a spotted fluorescence in the cell wall all over {{the length of the}} fiber. Therefore, it is concluded that fiber elongation is not achieved by tip growth but by <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> The intrusively growing fiber is a coenocytic cell that has no plasmodesmata, making the fibers a symplastically isolated domain within the stem...|$|E
40|$|The author {{found the}} fact in 1965 that a {{remarkable}} acceleration in elongation was brought {{about in the}} internodes of the paddy rice plants, in which the ninth foliage leaf was just emerging, if they were horizontally kept with their main axes for a six-days period. This fact was repeatedly observed in the plants treated similarly in 1967, in which the eighth foliage leaf was emerging about a half-length. The phenomenon of acceleration in <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> of the horizontal stem was seen on the upper side {{as well as the}} lower side of the internode concerned, and was most conspicuous in the eighth internode, i. e. the one between the seventh node and the eighth, sofar as both experimentswere concerned, with the result that the length of the internode measured along its center line extended from 4. 2 to 6. 2 times as longas that of the control. Besides, the geotropic bending was occurred {{at the base of the}} eighth internode. From microscopical observation on the longitudinal sections of the eighth internode, it was clearly demonstrated that pith cells in a layer showed little difference in number on both upper and lower sides in the plants horizontally kept, and amounted to nearly three times as many as those in the control. The mean length of the pith cells was twice in the former as long as that in the latter. 3 -Indoleacetic acid (IAA) given to the leaf sheath right bellow the apical one in the rice plants in a normal position, which were already in the stage of <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth,</b> showing the length of 19 mm or more in some of their internodes, influences so as to accelerate the <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> In the plants in a horizontal position, nevertheless, IAA exercised an inhibiting effect rather than a stimulating on the <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> Putting these evidences together with those obtained from the horizontal treatment, it may be safe to say that unilateral stimulation of gravitational pull to rice plants brings about not only an asymmetrical distribution of natural auxins existing, but also a renewed formation of them...|$|E
40|$|The {{homeobox}} gene Cdx 2, a homologue of the Drosophila gene caudal, has {{been implicated in}} the control of cell differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. Recently, we showed that mice in which one allele of the Cdx 2 gene had been inactivated by homologous recombination developed multiple intestinal polyp-like lesions that did not express Cdx 2 and that contained areas of squamous metaplasia {{in the form of}} keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, similar to that occurring in the mouse esophagus and forestomach. We have now examined colonic lesions from 98 Cdx 2 +/− mice and report that the lesions are composed of heterotopic stomach and small intestinal mucosa. We conclude that Cdx 2 directs endodermal differentiation toward a caudal phenotype and that haploinsufficient levels of expression in the developing distal intestine lead to homeotic transformation to a more rostral endodermal phenotype, such as forestomach epithelium that does not express Cdx 2 during normal development. <b>Intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> (epimorphic regeneration), which previously has never been described in mammals, then occurs, resulting in the ordered “filling in” of tissue types at the discontinuity between the gastric and colonic epithelia.

40|$|Evidence {{presented}} here {{indicates that there}} is a complex interaction between kinetin, gibberellin, and sucrose in the regulation of turnover of invertase in vivo. The synthesis of invertase is maintained in the presence of GA 3 and sucrose over relatively long periods of time. Kinetin, on the other hand, inhibits the full development of invertase activity seen in the sucrose and gibberellin control treatments. Moreover, the peak in invertase activity occurs earlier with kinetin treatment. During invertase turnover, once the peak is reached, kinetin enhances the rate of decay of enzyme activity relative to synthesis. The regulatory significance of invertase in <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> and possible modes of kinetin action in this process are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Polarized tip {{growth is}} a {{fundamental}} cellular process in many eukaryotic organisms, mediating growth of neuronal axons and dendrites or fungal hyphae. In plants, pollen and root hairs are cellular model systems for analysing tip growth. Cell growth depends on membrane traffic. The regulation of this membrane traffic is largely unknown for tip-growing cells, in contrast to cells exhibiting <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth.</b> Here we show that in Arabidopsis, GBF 1 -related exchange factors for the ARF GTPases (ARF GEFs) GNOM and GNL 2 play essential roles in polar tip growth of root hairs and pollen, respectively. When expressed from the same promoter, GNL 2 (in contrast to the early-secretory ARF GEF GNL 1) is able to replace GNOM in polar recycling of the auxin efflux regulator PIN 1 from endosomes to the basal plasma membrane in non-tip growing cells. Thus, polar recycling facilitates polar tip growth, and GNL 2 seems to have evolved to meet the specific requirement of fast-growing pollen in higher plants...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA biomechanical {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{for the growth of}} the brown alga Ecto-carpus siliculosus. Featuring ramified uniseriate filaments, this alga has two modes of growth: apical growth and <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> with branching. Apical growth occurs upon the mitosis of a young cell at one extremity and leads to a new tip cell followed by a cylindrical cell, whereas branching mainly occurs when a cylindrical cell becomes rounded and swells, forming a spherical cell. Given the continuous interplay between cell growth and swelling, a poroelastic model combining osmotic pressure and volumetric growth is considered for the whole cell, cytoplasm and cell wall. The model recovers the morphogenetic transformations of mature cells: transformation of a cylindrical shape into spherical shape with a volumetric increase, and then lateral branching. Our simulations show that the poro-elastic model, including the Mooney –Rivlin approach for hyper-elastic materials, can correctly reproduce the observations. In particular, branching appears to be a plasticity effect due to the high level of tension created after the increase in volume of mature cells...|$|E
40|$|An {{electron}} microprobe (EMP) {{analysis of}} silica (SiO 2) deposition in the epidermis of developing internodes of the perennial scouring rush (Equisetum hyemale var. affine) indicates that SiO 2 is first {{detected in the}} stomatal apparatus beginning with internode 3, then the epidermal papillae (internode 8), and finally in radial cell walls of the long epidermal cells (internode 10). This process is initiated in the <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> regions at the bases of the elongating internodes. The deposition of SiO 2 in long epidermal cell walls occurs after internodal extension has ceased and should therefore be considered {{as one of the}} final stages in internodal differentiation that involves strengthening the cellulosic framework of the cell wall. EMP measurements indicate that SiO 2 in stomata is equivalent to 30 % of a pure SiO 2 standard and that SiO 2 in the radial walls of long epidermal cells averages twice that measured on the tangential walls of these same cells. This study supports the view that silicification {{plays a major role in}} strengthening the developing perennial scouring rush internodal system and that regulation of this process in this and other species of Equisetum, whose SiO 2 deposition patterns are markedly different, deserves further study...|$|E
30|$|The {{twisting}} and rotating movements of rapidly elongating plant organs (hypocotyl, tendril, shoot or root) have long became a fascination to biologists and have spawned {{a variety of}} studies on terrestrial plants. In the present investigation, the occurrence of circumnutation has been demonstrated in the aquatic plant A. ulvaceus using the novel software CT. The mechanisms and functional importance underlying circumnutation has long been debated since Darwin’s time. At present, it is presumed that circumnutation is dependent upon the internal oscillatory movement and gravity sensing. In the hydrophyte Vallisneria, however, female flowers are capable of circumnutating {{in the absence of}} gravitropism. The paper by Kosuge et al. (2013) indicated that the helical <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> of the peduncle, the internal oscillator, is the driving force of circumnutation. As buoyancy minimizes the gravity effect, which renders it difficult to study circumnutation in land plants due to the innate nature of gravitropic response, shoot movements underwater are interesting. Then again, mutant analyses on agravitropic mutants of morning glory that lack starch-filled amyloplasts in endodermal cells were defective in shoot circumnutation, indicating the importance of gravitropic response (Kitazawa et al. 2005). Additionally, there is increasing evidence that circumnutations possess distinct ecological functions and are not simply a way of growth. In Oryza sativa, circumnutating roots have a significant role in seedling establishment on waterlogged and soft soil (Inoue et al. 1999). Likewise, circumnutation in Vallisneria is crucial for hydrophilous pollination on the water surface (Kosuge et al. 2013). In this regard, circumnutation proves to be a complex phenomenon and dependent on plant species, the organs involved and the developmental stage (Kitazawa et al. 2005; Stolarz 2009). Clearly, further analysis is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of circumnutation in A. ulvaceus as well as the implicated ecological functions of shoot movements.|$|E
40|$|Filamentous {{macroscopic}} algae {{were observed}} in slightly acidic to circumneutral (pH 5. 9 – 6. 5), metal-rich stream water that leaked out from a former uranium mining district (Ronneburg, Germany). These algae differed in color and morphology and were encrusted with Fe-deposits. To elucidate their potential interaction with Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), we collected algal samples at three time points during summer 2013 and studied the algae-bacteria-mineral compositions via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and a 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene-based bacterial and algae community analysis. Surprisingly, sequencing analysis of 18 S rRNA gene regions of green and brown algae revealed high homologies with the freshwater algae Tribonema (99. 9 – 100 %). CLSM imaging indicated a loss of active chloroplasts in the algae cells, which {{may be responsible for}} the change in color in. Fe(III) -precipitates on algal cells identified as ferrihydrite and schwertmannite by FTIR were associated with microbes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) -like glycoconjugates. SEM imaging revealed that while the green algae were fully encrusted with Fe-precipitates, the brown algae often exhibited discontinuous series of precipitates. This pattern was likely due to the <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> of algal filaments which allowed them to avoid detrimental encrustation. 16 S rRNA gene-targeted studies revealed that Gallionella -related FeOB dominated the bacterial RNA and DNA communities (70 – 97 and 63 – 96 %, respectively), suggesting their capacity to compete with the abiotic Fe-oxidation under the putative oxygen-saturated conditions that occur in association with photosynthetic algae. Quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) revealed even higher Gallionella -related 16 S rRNA gene copy numbers on the surface of green algae compared to the brown algae. The latter harbored a higher microbial diversity, including some putative predators of algae. A loss of chloroplasts in the brown algae could have led to lower photosynthetic activities and reduced EPS production, which is known to affect predator colonization. Collectively, our results suggest the coexistence of oxygen-generating algae Tribonema sp. and strictly microaerophilic neutrophilic FeOB in a heavy metal-rich environment...|$|E
40|$|The tegmic pachychalaza is {{considered}} {{along with the}} problem of abortive seeds. The recent note by Van Heel (1982), who kindly sent me a copy, shows that there is still uncertainty about the construction of the tegmen. I have re-examined some rather poor slides that I have and it seems that he may be right. He finds the con-struction to be that as originally described in 1885; the free part of the tegmen forms merely a microscopic cone round the micropyle {{while the rest of the}} tegmenis an el-lipsoidal jacket, developed by <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth,</b> round the endosperm. Thus the tegmen is a tegmic pachychalaza (Corner, 1976), as occurs in some Euphorbiaceous seeds, and it is from this structure that the ruminations develop. When studying these seeds, I was more intent on deciding whether they were pachychalazal or not; in tracing the tegmen to the chalazal base, I may have overlooked the vestigial free part. Yet, I have some doubt. The illustrations on which Van Heel relies (his figures 7 and 12) show abortive seeds of squat form, evidently unfertilised, with compressed embryo-sac and dilated chalaza. Such parthenocarpic fruits with abortive seeds occur frequently in the fami-ly, as I noted for Horsfieldia sylvestris. There was a female tree of this introduced species in the Singapore Botanical Garden and no male was known to exist in the Malay Peninsula; its seeds, of course, never germinated. In other families I had found that such seeds failed variously to develop a typical structure and that the chalaza often dilated abnormally. Hence I used to discard such seeds though they certainly have great interest in showing the number and complexity of the factors which have had to be arrested in the perfection of the flower as a separate entity from the fruit. In this way Myristicaceae appear, perhaps, as the most primitively imperfect of angiosperms; pericarp, aril, and testa may develop fully and continuously from their unpollinated flowers, e. g. Virola sebifera with even tegmic details (Corner, 1976). 1 think that it still needs to be shown that the fertilised Myristicaceous seed has, in all genera, a tegmic pachychalaza...|$|E
40|$|The nectaries of Pelargonium are {{unusual in}} the Geraniaceae in that the flowers only have one deep dorsal tube as opposed to five shallow canals. The genus is also known for having great length {{variation}} in nectar tubes, variation that has been suggested {{to play an important}} role in the diversification of this genus. Interpretations of Pelargonium nectaries contradict each other as some describe the nectar tube as an adnate sepal spur while others describe it as an hypanthial tube as a result of an elongate receptacle. In addition, the developmental basis of differing nectar tube lengths is unknown. SEM analysis of P. ionidiflorum and P. odoratissimum dissections revealed that displacement of the dorsal antesepalous stamen by the flanking antepetalous stamens anticipates the space where the nectar tube will develop before the tube begins to form. Soon after all floral organ primordia have been initiated, the concavity of the nectar tube of Pelargonium initiates and then elongates through <b>intercalary</b> <b>growth</b> of the receptacle. Early stages of development up to a bud length of 4. 0 mm are similar in both species. Functional Data Analysis of longitudinal growth of buds 0. 25 mm to maturity showed that the tubes of P. ionidiflorum become longer through both higher rates of elongation and a longer duration of elongation than those of P. odoratissimum. Nectar tube elongation also continues for nearly a week after anthesis. Evidence suggests that the nectar tube of Pelargonium is not evolutionarily derived from a sepal spur that becomes fused to the pedicel. No involvement of the spur is observed at any stage in the development of the nectar tube in Pelargonium. Furthermore, the development of the spur begins late in floral ontogeny in contrast with the initiation of the nectar tube, which begins early in development of Pelargonium flowers. This contrasts with the pattern in species with free nectary perianth spurs, such as Aquilegia olympica or Impatiens columbaria. Finally, sections along the length of mature P. ionidiflorum tubes revealed a lack of vascular pattern that would support an interpretation of a spur fused to the pedicel. Pelargonium is more accurately classified as having a deep receptacular nectary...|$|E
