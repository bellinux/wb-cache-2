40|$|This report {{attempts}} to summarise findings and conclusions of over 30 studies published within the EURIPIDIS project (European Innovation Policies for the Digital Shift). The objective of EURIPIDIS was {{to better understand}} how <b>digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> work; to assess the EU's <b>digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> performance; and to suggest how policy makers could make <b>digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> in the EU work better. Because digital technologies facilitate the modernization of firms and economies, <b>digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> requires a comprehensive policy response. The current report focuses on 7 issues. (1) <b>Digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> require skills and capabilities ranging from technical, managerial and financial; entrepreneurial culture; failure acceptance; large funding and innovation-friendly regulatory environment. Capacity building and specific policies are needed in all those fields. (2) Resisting digital disruption and protecting {{the status quo is}} likely to be a short-term strategy. Negative social and economic effects need to be mitigated. (3) The ecosystem of <b>digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> consists of a wide range of different players. Policy responses need to address this heterogeneity. (4) <b>Digital</b> innovation and <b>entrepreneurship</b> takes place through collaborative interactions between various players. To facilitate collaboration, knowledge flow and spillovers need to become a more central focus of public policies. (5) In addition to increasing funding for innovation, closer attention needs to be paid to the availability of funding for scaling-up of digital enterprises. (6) To guarantee technological interoperability and create technology-related network effects, coordination between various players to, for example, set technological standards is needed. (7) Technological complexity combined with the cumulativeness of digital innovation requires a balance between two conflicting goals: the provision of incentives to create new products and the stimulation of knowledge dissemination.

30|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> {{ecosystem}} is {{an ecosystem}} where <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> emerges and develops. Because an ecosystem can facilitate {{the integration of}} resources and supportive elements beyond the firm-level, a <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> ecosystem {{is important for the}} success of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> (Spigel, 2015). If we treat <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> as characterized by individualism, we can then see a DEE, in which various resources and elements can be integrated to facilitate the process of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship,</b> as a kind of collectivism. Another related concept is “digital ecosystem”, or “digital business ecosystem”. Per Corallo et al. 2007, a digital ecosystem is defined as the ICT enabling infrastructure that supports the cooperation, the knowledge sharing and the building of a business ecosystem. A digital business ecosystem is based on digital business, while a <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> ecosystem is based on <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship.</b>|$|E
30|$|Innovation and {{entrepreneurship}} {{are often}} intertwined since many digital entrepreneurial ventures {{are based on}} digital innovation (Bessant and Tidd, 2007). <b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> is one stream of entrepreneurship. The unique characteristic of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship,</b> per Davidson et al. (2010), is that <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> consists of three interconnected types of entrepreneurship: business entrepreneurship, knowledge entrepreneurship and institutional entrepreneurship. <b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> is a multi-faceted phenomenon that contains all three types.|$|E
40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> is {{broadly defined}} as {{creating}} new ventures and transforming existing businesses by developing novel digital technologies and/or novel usage of such technologies, (European Commission, 2015). <b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> {{has been viewed}} as a critical pillar for economic growth, job creation and innovation by many countries including the Member States of the European Union. We argue that a nation’s digital entrepreneurial capacity depends largely on digital entrepreneurial behaviour, culture, and strategies {{as well as a}} supportive innovation ecosystem in which governments, industry, business, educational institutions and NGOs (non-government organizations) work together. Therefore, a holistic and integrative approach is needed. This study aims to explore the emerging concept of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> from multiple disciplinary perspectives, namely, information technology and systems, entrepreneurship and management, as well as contextual political/legal and socio-economic factors and their impacts in a systemic and integrative way. For that purpose, the paper develops a conceptual model to study <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> drawing on current literature and three well-established theories – social network theory, social capital theory and institutional theory. The model addresses five fundamental research questions of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship,</b> thus leading {{to a better understanding of}} the concept and practice of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship...</b>|$|E

30|$|However, {{studies on}} <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> at the {{ecosystem}} level are limited. Most studies {{focus on the}} individual and organizational level, in which entrepreneurial processes and context are the main research points (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000; Zahra et al., 2014; Biao and Dong, 2014; Yi et al., 2008). A macro scope is needed to understand the strategy of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> (Spigel, 2015).

40|$|Purpose – Thepurpose of {{this paper}} is to criticallyexplorehow context asan {{antecedent}} to entrepreneurial digital competencies (EDCs) influences <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> in a resource-scarce environment. Design/methodology/approach – The data comprises semi-structured interviews with 16 digital entrepreneurs, as owner-managers of small digital businesses in Cameroon. Findings – The results reveal the ways in which EDCs shape the entry (or start-up) choices and post-entry strategic decisions of digital entrepreneurs in response to context-specific opportunities and challenges associated with <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship.</b> Research limitations/implications – The data comes from one African country and 16 digital businesses thus the research setting limits the generalisability of the results. Practical implications – This paper highlights important implications for encouraging <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> by focussing on institutional, technology and local dimensions of context and measures to develop the entrepreneurial and digital competencies. This includes policy interventions to develop the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, transport and local distribution infrastructure, and training opportunities to develop the EDCs of digital entrepreneurs. Originality/value – Whereas the capabilities to adopt and use ICTs and the internet by small businesses have been examined, this is among the first theoretically sensitised study linking context, EDCs and <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship...</b>|$|E

30|$|Third, our paper also {{contributes}} to the entrepreneurship literature by unveiling the organizing process of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. <b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> ecosystems are not only ecosystems that generate digital innovations, but also ecosystems that support entrepreneurship based on digital innovations.

30|$|Corallo et al. (2007), {{expanding}} on {{the metaphor}} of natural ecosystems, separate the concepts of digital ecosystem and business ecosystem by its core species.

Similarly, a DEE is populated by digital species while an entrepreneurship ecosystem is populated by entrepreneurship species. This can be confirmed by the definition of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> {{and other types of}} entrepreneurship. <b>Digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> pursues opportunities based on the use of digital technologies, while others pursue opportunities based on business, knowledge or institutions (Davidson and Vaast 2010).|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{our study}} aims to analyze a <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> {{ecosystem}} {{to answer the}} question of “how does a <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> ecosystem organize to support digital innovations?” To answer this question, we adopt the forms of organizing, as synthesized by Puranam et al. (2014) based on prior literature related to the forms of organizing, as a theoretical lens. Despite the different forms of organizing, they all address four universal problems: task division, task allocation, reward distribution and information flow. These four organizing problems are synthesized from the prior literature and they commonly exist in many forms of organizing, such as innovation networks, innovation clusters, ecosystems and self-organizing groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the business strategies of a firm seeking to develop and profitably market a mobile smartphone application to understand how small, <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurships</b> may build sustainable business models given substantial market barriers.

The case study describes two distinctly different business models adopted in succession, as well as the various adjustments the firm makes to its target market, distribution and pricing approach that led to their current strategy. This research looks closely at business-to-business-to-consumer distribution arrangement for mobile apps and in doing so challenges the rising positive bias that exists for the app store as the dominant actor in the mobile value chain.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the process and {{competitive}} factors of entrepreneurship in digital space in Iran. Design/methodology/approach – In the last decades, the development and advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the business innovations related to them have defined a new economy which is known as “digital economy”. Establishing and running businesses in this digital space means carrying out a kind of electronic commerce by exploiting the internet and other electronic networks. The new digital economy provides exceptional opportunities for many entrepreneurs to create new ventures in different business areas according to electronic commerce models. Given that researchers in Iran have not studied <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> and there is a great interest in <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship,</b> further research is needed on this subject. According to research in Canada by Carrier et al. on cyber entrepreneurship, the authors used the same method and studied five cases that work in <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> in Iran. In this paper, the authors first review the literature of <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> – <b>digital</b> <b>entrepreneurship</b> framework that include a typology of digital ventures and their characteristics, characteristics of digital entrepreneurs, and the distinctions between digital and traditional entrepreneurship. Then five digital entrepreneurs in Iran were surveyed to explore the process of their entrepreneurship and competitive elements applied by them. Findings – The most notable contribution of this research is the focus on the process of this type of entrepreneurship and the steps which were used by entrepreneurs. Unlike the traditional forms of entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurs in cyber space in Iran did not examine the feasibility of their projects; also, the identification of a business opportunity created business ideas. Another contribution is that the authors found ten factors as the internet‐based entrepreneurs' competitive elements in Iran, and also found interesting results about characteristics of internet‐based entrepreneurs. Originality/value – This paper provides an overview of internet‐based entrepreneurship in Iran. According to collected information, the authors propose the process of internet‐based entrepreneurship and its competitive elements, and establish a basis for future research...|$|E
