40|$|Web {{developers}} often want to repurpose <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> from third-party web pages, but {{struggle to}} locate the specific source code that implements the behavior. This task is chal-lenging because developers must find and connect all of the non-local interactions between event-based JavaScript code, declarative CSS styles, and web page content that combine to express the behavior. The Scry tool embodies {{a new approach to}} locating the code that implements <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> A developer selects a page element; whenever the element changes, Scry cap-tures the rendering engine’s inputs (DOM, CSS) and outputs (screenshot) for the element. For any two captured element states, Scry can compute how the states differ and which lines of JavaScript code were responsible. Using Scry, a developer can locate an <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior’s</b> implementation by picking two output states; Scry indicates the JavaScript code directly responsible for their differences...|$|R

40|$|While a designer’s focus {{used to be}} {{the design}} of non-interactive {{elements}} such as graphics or animations, today’s designers deal with various levels of interactivity such as mouse, keyboard and touch screen interaction. Unfortunately, it is challenging for designers to create these diverse interactions since most implementation tools such as Flash require the use of conventional programming languages and do not support the natural expressions used by designers. To better understand how designers think about <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors,</b> we conducted a lab study where designers and programmers described various primitive and composite <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> using their own language. From this, we learned that there is significant commonality among designers in terms of the verbs, syntax, and structure when describing interactivity. These results can help guide the way to building more natural programming languages and environments for designers to facilitate the development of <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|Other {{experimental}} philosophers {{have approached}} {{the topic of}} consciousness by trying to uncover the cognitive processes that guide everyday attributions of conscious states. Adam Arico, Brian Fiala, Rob Goldberg, and Shaun Nichols, for instance, propose a cognitive model of mental state attribution (the AGENCY model), whereby an entity's displaying certain relatively simple features (e.g., eyes, distinctive motions, <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior)</b> triggers a disposition to attribute conscious states to that entity. Additionally, Bryce Huebner has argued that ascriptions of mental states rely on two divergent strategies: one sensitive to considerations of an entity's behavior being goal-directed; the other sensitive to considerations of personhood.|$|E

40|$|While motor {{interaction}} between a robot and a human, or between humans, {{has important implications}} for society as well as promising applications, little research has been devoted to its investigation. In particular, {{it is important to understand}} the different ways two agents can interact and generate suitable <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Towards this end, this paper introduces a framework for the description and implementation of <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of two agents performing a joint motor task. A taxonomy of <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> is introduced, which can classify tasks and cost functions that represent the way each agent interacts. The role of an agent interacting during a motor task can be directly explained from the cost function this agent is minimizing and the task constraints. The novel framework is used to interpret and classify previous works on human-robot motor interaction. Its implementation power is demonstrated by simulating representative interactions of two humans. It also enables us to interpret and explain the role distribution and switching between roles when performing joint motor tasks...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{designing}} graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the look (appearance) can be easily presented by sketching, but the feel (<b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors)</b> cannot, and often requires an accompanying description of how it works (Myers et al. 2008). We propose to use crowdsourcing to augment early sketches with <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> generated, used, and reused by collective "wizards-of-oz" as opposed to a single wizard as in prior work (Davis et al. 2007). This demo presents an extension of Apparition (Lasecki et al. 2015), a crowd-powered prototyping tool that allows end users to create functional GUIs using speech and sketch. In Apparition, crowd workers collaborate in real-time on a shared canvas to refine the user-requested sketch interactively, and {{with the assistance of the}} end users. Our demo extends this functionality to let crowd workers "demonstrate" the canvas changes that are needed for a behavior and refine their demonstrations to improve the fidelity of <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The system then lets workers "remix" these behaviors to make creating future behaviors more efficient.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether the complementarity principle (mutual <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> are opposite on control and similar on affiliation) applies to teacher-child interactions within the kindergarten classroom. Furthermore, it was examined whether <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> and complementarity depended on children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors, interaction time, and interaction frequency. A total of 48 teachers and 179 selected kindergartners {{with a variety}} of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were observed in a small group task setting in the natural ecology of the classroom. Teachers' and children's <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> were rated by independent observers. Teachers reported about children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. Multilevel analyses indicated that both teachers and children reacted complementarily on the control dimension but not on the affiliation dimension. Teachers showed more control and more affiliation toward children with higher levels of internalizing behavior. In addition, teachers displayed less affiliation toward children with higher levels of externalizing behavior, whereas those children did not show less affiliation themselves. Teachers' and children's complementarity tendencies on control were weaker if children had higher levels of externalizing behavior. © 2012 Society for the Study of School Psychology...|$|R
5000|$|Online {{aggregation}} is {{a technique}} for improving the <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior</b> of database systems processing expensive analytical queries.

For example, if the final answer is 1000, after k seconds, the user gets the estimates in form of a confidence interval like 1020 with 95% probability.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have shown}} promise {{for improving the}} mechanical performance of cement composites through crack-bridging and frictional pull-out. The <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> between CNTs and cement matrix act are crucial in optimizing the reinforcement of CNTs in cement composites. This study investigates the effects of nano-silica (NS) sol-gel on the <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of CNTs and the cement matrix {{through a series of}} experiments and analyses. UV-visible spectrometer results show that CNTs are well-dispersed in suspension and the addition of NS has a negligible effect on the stability of CNT dispersion. Calorimetry tests and dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrate the nucleation and frictional performance of CNTs in cement matrix, respectively. The paper shows that the physical adsorption of NS on the CNT surface could result in the acceleration of cement hydration. Morphology observation confirms that a denser interface between CNTs and cement hydrates is formed. Finally, the improved interaction between CNTs and cement hydrates leads to a substantial increase in friction between CNTs and the cement matrix under periodic loading. NS may act as an ideal admixture for improving both the <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> between CNTs and cement matrix and the damping properties of cement composite...|$|R

40|$|This {{prospective}} study examined {{whether or not}} a mother’s representations of her infant were more often disrupted after premature childbirth. Furthermore, the study examined if different components of maternal <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior</b> mediated the relation between maternal disrupted representations and infant attachment. The participants were mothers of full-term (n = 75), moderately preterm (n = 68) and very preterm infants (n = 67). Maternal representations were assessed by the Working Model of the Child Interview at 6 months post-partum. Maternal <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior</b> was evaluated at 6 and 24 months post-partum, using the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Care Research Network mother–infant observation scales. Infant attachment was observed at 24 months post-partum and was coded by the Attachment Q-Set. The results reveal that a premature childbirth does not necessarily generate disrupted maternal representations of the infant. Furthermore, maternal <b>interactive</b> <b>behavior</b> appears to be an important mechanism through which maternal representations influence the development of infant attachment in full-term and preterm infants.

40|$|<b>Interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in GUIs {{are often}} {{described}} in terms of states, transitions, and constraints, where the constraints only hold in certain states. These constraints maintain relationships among objects, control the graphical layout, and link the user interface to an underlying data model. However, no existing Web implementation technology provides direct support for all of these, so the code for maintaining constraints and tracking state may end up spread across multiple languages and libraries. In this paper we describe ConstraintJS, a system that integrates constraints and finite-state machines (FSMs) with Web languages. A key role for the FSMs is to enable and disable constraints based on the interface’s current mode, making it possible to write constraints that sometimes hold. We illustrate that constraints combined with FSMs can be a clearer way of defining many <b>interactive</b> <b>behaviors</b> with a series of examples...|$|R
