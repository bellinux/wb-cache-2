25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the <b>enhanced</b> <b>keyboard</b> with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E

40|$|To protect users from {{numerous}} password inference attacks, we invent a novel context aware privacy <b>enhancing</b> <b>keyboard</b> (PEK) for Android touch-based devices. Usually PEK would show a QWERTY keyboard when users input text like an email or a message. Nevertheless, whenever users enter a password in the input box {{on his or}} her touch-enabled device, a keyboard will be shown to them with the positions of the characters shuffled at random. PEK has been released on the Google Play since 2014. However, the number of installations has not lived up to our expectation. For the purpose of usable security and privacy, we designed a two-stage usability test and performed two rounds of iterative usability testing in 2016 and 2017 summer with continuous improvements of PEK. The observations from the usability testing are educational: (1) convenience plays a critical role when users select an input method; (2) people think those attacks that PEK prevents are remote from them...|$|R
50|$|The Rainbow 100 and {{the other}} two {{microcomputers}} which DEC announced at the same time (DECmate II and Pro-350) had two quirks that annoyed conservative users. The LK201 keyboard used a new layout that made some Teletype Model 33 and VT100 users unhappy. However, the VT220 style of this keyboard can clearly be seen in the layout of the <b>enhanced</b> 101-key <b>keyboard</b> adopted by IBM in 1985.|$|R

Unicomp still manufactures its version of the Model M (similar to part number 42H1292 but first renamed 42H1292U and subsequently the [...] "Customizer"), as well as other configurations including updated 104- and 105-key layouts; a Unix layout (where the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys and Esc and tilde keys are transposed); models with integrated pointing sticks or trackballs; and POS-specific models such as those with built-in magstripe readers. When Lexmark discontinued keyboard production in March 1996, IBM continued production in Greenock, Scotland and subcontracted production of the Model M13 keyboard (IBM <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Keyboard</b> with TrackPoint II) to Maxi Switch in Mexico. These companies stopped producing Model M's in 1999 and 1998 respectively. Although current Unicomp models may still be purchased, original production models retain their value well among collectors and computer enthusiasts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel computer vision based attack that discloses inputs on a touch enabled device, while the attacker cannot see any text or popups from {{a video of}} the victim tapping on the touch screen. In the attack, we use the optical flow algorithm to identify touching frames where the fin-ger touches the screen surface. We innovatively use intersections of detected edges of the touch screen to derive the homography matrix mapping the touch screen surface in video frames to a reference image of the virtual keyboard. We analyze the shadow formation around the fingertip and use the k-means clustering algorithm to identify touched points. Homography can then map these touched points to keys of the virtual keyboard. Our work is substantially different from existing work. We target password input {{and are able to}} achieve a high success rate. We target scenarios like classrooms, conferences and similar gathering places and use a webcam or smartphone camera. In these scenes, single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras and high-end camcorders used in related work will appear suspicious. To defeat such computer vision based attacks, we design, implement and evaluate the Privacy <b>Enhancing</b> <b>Keyboard</b> (PEK) where a randomized virtual keyboard is used to input sensitive information.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new text entry {{approach}} based on soft keyboards and a study on its expected performances. The basic idea of the approach is to <b>enhance</b> the <b>keyboard</b> with a menu whose items (characters) can be selected more than once through a single pointer (pen, finger, etc.) stroke, in order to enter particularly frequent text patterns. The gesture to enter these patterns {{is similar to that}} used for Cirrin. Furthermore, using well-established methods for measuring the time required for performing simple inter-actions with pointers on touchscreens, we have evaluated the expected performances of our method. The results, ob-tained through a text entry simulation, are encouraging with respect to those measured for previous approaches based on menu-augmented keyboard. 1...|$|R

40|$|From cave to computer, human {{ingenuity}} has adapted {{tools and}} methods {{to improve conditions}} and to access new environments. Simply put, adaptations enable us to access what we need faster and more efficiently. This {{is true for the}} 40 million or more Americans who have the label “disabled ” attached to them. Motorized wheelchairs are faster and require less energy than walking. Ramps and electric doors enable independent access to buildings. Captioning and TDD’s (telephone devices for the deaf) provide access to television and telephones for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Digitized speech enables communication by non-speaking individuals. Adaptations for “special needs populations” often benefit and cross over to the general population, resulting in a better, more accessible world for everyone. Consider push-button door openers and ramps into hotels that enable even the smallest guests to roll their own luggage into the lobby without having to get help from (or pay for) the bellhop. Big stalls in public restrooms are wonderful for parents with small children. In the realm of computer access, there are few of us who do not rely on adapta-WWW. EL EARNINGG UILD. COM tions that were once considered “special accessibility features. ” Probably the most often used are keyboard shortcuts and screen magnification. We also rely on audio cues like the Microsoft harp and “You’ve got mail, ” on optical mouse control, and on digitized speech. As desktops and laptops were being developed and improved, companion technology was developed to improve computer access and to ease use for people with special needs. Federally-funded programs yielded an amazing array of options, including word prediction to <b>enhance</b> <b>keyboard</b> input speed, head-mounted laser-controlled mouse pointers, screen magnifiers, screen readers, text converters and left-handed, right-handed and “no-handed ” keyboards.

40|$|For {{people with}} motion impairments, {{access to and}} {{independent}} control of a computer can be essential.

The three approaches are: (1) {{to increase the number}} of interaction channels, (2) to enhance commonly existing interaction channels, and (3) to make more effective use of all the available information in an existing input channel. Experiments in multimodal input, haptic feedback, user modelling, and cursor control are discussed in the context of the three approaches.

This thesis describes GEKA's design and two related user studies. A formative study with 10 participants explored how our target users currently work with Window, Icon, Menu and Pointer (WIMP) interfaces. The results of the study suggest that advanced computer users prefer to execute commands with the keyboard. However, they are often unable to do so in current applications because shortcuts are not available for all commands or are unknown. This indicates a desire among advanced users for a GEKA-lik...|$|E
