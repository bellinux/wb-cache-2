500|$|McCain {{attacked}} {{what he saw}} as {{pork barrel}} spending within Congress, believing that the practice did not contribute to the greater national interest. [...] Towards this end he was instrumental in pushing through approval of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president the power to veto individual expenditures. Although this was one of McCain's biggest Senate victories, the effect was short-lived as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional in 1998. [...] In a more symbolic attempt to limit congressional privilege, he introduced an amendment in 1994 to remove free VIP parking <b>for</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> at D.C. area airports; his annoyed colleagues rejected the notion and accused McCain of grandstanding.|$|E

500|$|Another {{issue that}} caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 {{re-election}} bid was the so-called [...] "Salary Grab" [...] of 1873, which increased the compensation <b>for</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> by 50 percent, retroactive to 1871. Garfield was responsible, as Appropriations Committee chairman, for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House; {{during the debate}} in February 1873, Massachusetts Representative Benjamin Butler offered the increase as an amendment, and despite Garfield's opposition, it passed the House and eventually became law. The law was very popular in the House, as almost half the members were lame ducks, but the public was outraged, and many of Garfield's constituents blamed him, though he {{refused to accept the}} increase. [...] In what was a bad year for Republicans, who lost control of the House {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, Garfield had his closest congressional election, winning with only 57 percent of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{briefing}} on September 27, 2013, Hale warned that lapse in funding {{caused by the}} federal government shutdown of 2013 would cause a delay in military death-benefit payments for the families of U.S. troops killed in action (such as the $100,000 [...] "death gratuity," [...] the burial benefit, and the survivors' housing allowance). Hale called the situation a [...] "ghoulish" [...] legal consequence of the shutdown.

2500|$|A {{proposal}} {{related to}} retrocession was the [...] "District of Columbia Voting Rights Restoration Act of 2004" [...] (H.R. 3709), {{which would have}} treated {{the residents of the}} District as residents of Maryland for the purposes of congressional representation. Maryland's congressional delegation would then be apportioned accordingly to include the population of the District. Those in favor of such a plan argue that the Congress already has the necessary authority to pass such legislation without the constitutional concerns of other proposed remedies. From the foundation of the District in 1790 until the passage of the Organic Act of 1801, citizens living in D.C. continued to vote <b>for</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> in Maryland or Virginia; legal scholars therefore propose that the Congress has the power to restore those voting rights while maintaining the integrity of the federal district.

2500|$|During the {{campaign}} Krueger charged that Hutchison was a [...] "country club Republican" [...] and {{insensitive to the}} feelings of minorities. In January, the Houston Chronicle reported that both Hutchison and Fields had promised to serve a maximum of two six-year terms in the Senate {{as part of her}} support for term-limit legislation <b>for</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> In April, the Dallas Morning News reported that Hutchison had repeated her pledge to serve only two terms in the U.S. Senate, if elected, and had also said term limits ought to cover all senators, including Senator Phil Gramm (Republican), who had been elected in 1984 and re-elected in 1990. (He would stay in the Senate until 2002.) The term-limits legislation never passed, and Hutchison has said that she would not leave the Senate in the absence of such legislation, because doing so would unilaterally hurt Texas {{at the expense of other}} states in the seniority-driven institution.|$|E
2500|$|When Brown {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for president against President George H. W. Bush, many in the media and his own party dismissed his campaign as having little chance of gaining significant support. Ignoring them, Brown embarked on a grassroots campaign to, in his own words, [...] "take back America from the confederacy of corruption, careerism, and campaign consulting in Washington". In his stump speech, first used while officially announcing his candidacy on the steps of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Brown told listeners that he would only be accepting campaign contributions from individuals and that he would not accept over $100. Continuing with his populist reform theme, he assailed what he dubbed [...] "the bipartisan Incumbent Party in Washington" [...] and called for term limits <b>for</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Citing various recent scandals on Capitol Hill, particularly the recent House banking scandal and the large congressional pay-raises from 1990, he promised {{to put an end to}} Congress being a [...] "Stop-and-Shop for the moneyed special interests".|$|E
