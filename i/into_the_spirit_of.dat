Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
25|$|Hazlitt's {{sketch of}} Crabbe has drawn {{much more serious}} {{interest}} by recent critics than the companion sketch on Campbell. Tim Fulford assents to Hazlitt's observation that Crabbe viewed his poor villagers from a distance ("as an overseer of the poor"; the words are from his lectures on poetry but the idea was brought forward <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Age), rather than showing the reader what they feel about their situation.|$|E
25|$|Clapp's {{decision}} to invest considerable funds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Progress {{was based on}} entirely pragmatic considerations. In an age before interstate air travel was common, politicians and heads of industry rode between Australia's two largest capital cities and the national capital Canberra by train. The upgrade of the service was then a smart investment in promoting the Victorian Railways brand and its reputation to the nation's most powerful and influential people.|$|E

25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Age of Enlightenment. New understandings {{of history and the}} natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s.|$|E

For example, in the episode [...] "Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face," [...] Phineas intentionally gives all the kids at camp a fright when he tricks them into thinking Bigfoot is attacking, though this is mostly getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> spooky story telling.|$|E

500|$|... "Séance Time" [...] draws {{inspiration}} from horror films and [...] "the pretensions of actors"—two themes favoured by the writers. Horror tropes noted by journalists include the Insidious-inspired arrival of [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] and Madam Talbot's demonic voice, {{reminiscent of a}} similar voice in The Exorcist. For one critic, Pete's initial failure to believe the prank results in a memorable sequence that [...] "was a lovely statement about how old-fashioned horror imagery and well-worn tropes can be terrifying in the right hands, and plain ludicrous if you refuse to enter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> things".|$|E

"That is why, {{taking into}} account the strong will of the present Roman {{authorities}} to reduce Tradition to naught, to gather the world to the spirit of Vatican II and the spirit of Assisi, we have preferred to withdraw ourselves and to say that we could not continue.

500|$|In 1929, Wood {{played a}} celebrated {{practical}} joke on musicologists and critics. [...] "I got very {{fed up with}} them, always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, {{the press and the}} BBC [...] "fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare [...] for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and asked for." [...] Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. [...] The press treated the deception as a great joke; The Times entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.|$|E

500|$|Theatre {{historian}} John Bush Jones {{wrote that}} Pinafore has [...] "everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [...] has a score that... {{has plenty of}} tunes for the audience to go away humming". Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that {{the secret of the}} success of the Savoy operas is the way in which [...] "Sullivan entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment." [...] Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on [...] "mirth and silliness". Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like Victory, Goliath, Audacious and Minotaur.|$|E
500|$|In {{the climax}} of the novel, Ayesha takes the two men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruined city of Kôr {{into the heart of the}} ancient volcano. She is {{determined}} that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. Before their eyes, Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, She tells Leo, [...] "Forget me not. I shall come again!" ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again {{in much the same way}} that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E

2500|$|Eartha Kitt was {{the hardest}} person to cast for the film, as she was {{somewhat}} offended by her character's tone in the original script.

Yet that hum of summer, the innumerable voices of tiny lives, gossamer things all as alive as they, and as important to their frail selves; and the white clouds, few and so slow-moving, and the remote strange purity which clings to the chalky downs, all this white and green and blue of land and sea had its peace, which crept <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> those three alone with Nature, this once more, the last time for--who could say how long?

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in England in 1936 but received poor reviews, Picturegoers critic calling it:A burlesque of transpontine melodrama which falls to come off and only succeeds in being tiresomely boring.
