40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} the results of theoretical investigations of the process of rolling reinforcement bars designed for concrete reinforcement. In the investigation. particular consideration was given to the analysis of the effect of pre-finished band shape on the formation of ribs on the finished bar in the <b>finished</b> <b>pass.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Using the numerical modelling to rolling process of the reinforcement bars in a <b>finished</b> <b>pass</b> to define rolling parameters. The simulations of the ribbed bar rolling were carried out using the Forge 2005 ® software. Findings: It has been performed in order to define the specific features of the mode of metal flow in the roll gap and to determine the effect of the shape and dimensions of the feedstock oval on the height of the ribs and on the thickness of surface layer of the finished bar. Research limitations/implications: The use of commercial software applications in the design of process technologies will allow for the development of reinforcement bars rolling technology with a minimum number of laboratory and industrial trials. Practical implications: Reinforcement bars are chiefly used in the building industry at production of reinforced concrete constructions. and as working elements in bridge building. Originality/value: Production of the reinforcement bars is very difficult. One from many problems during production the bars is rolling in the <b>finished</b> <b>pass.</b> In this paper the computer simulation of the rolling reinforcement bar is presented...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: New kind of {{reinforcement}} bars are bimetallic reinforcement bars {{which has a}} higher corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, than the standard bars. The bimetallic bars {{are more and more}} often applied to building of concrete construction. This kind of application decides about high requirements imposed upon their performance characteristics and mechanical properties. Design/methodology/approach: Using the numerical modelling to rolling process of the bimetallic reinforcement bars in a <b>finished</b> <b>pass</b> to define rolling parameters.

40|$|The {{workpiece}} {{produced by}} wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) has the surface variations caused by simultaneous heating and cooling process during machining. The thermally affected layers have great effect on mechanical and metallurgical properties. It is not possible to achieve good surface finish (Ra) with a single pass. After the machining process few <b>finishing</b> <b>passes</b> have to be used to produce a better surface finish. In this paper an attempt is made to achieve maximum surface finish by using multi cutting passes in WEDM. The Metal Matrix Composite (MMC) workpieces were machined at one, two and three cutting passes and the Ra of the workpieces of MMC is measured. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) picture is analyzed to study the white layer or recast layer and heat affected zone (HAZ) in the machined surface of the workpiece. By the experimental results, it is found that Ra value is reduced by increasing the number of cutting passes. In rough cutting pass the white layer is formed which increases the surface cracks and craters. In semi <b>finish</b> cutting <b>passes</b> the thickness of the white layer is reduced and it decreases the surface cracks and craters and in <b>finish</b> cutting <b>pass</b> the white layer is completely removed...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focused primarily}} {{on the effects of}} WEDM on the surface / subsurface integrity of Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 6 Mo titanium alloy and Udimet 720 nickel base superalloy, and encompassed measurement of surface roughness and contamination, workpiece microhardness, recast layer thickness, residual stresses and fatigue performance. Associated productivity and manufacturing costs were also evaluated in respect of blade root slot machining in aerospace turbine / compressor discs. Preliminary tests results showed that machined surfaces with Ra of ~ 0. 5 μm, less than 2 μm of recast layer and almost neutral residual stresses were obtained following a roughing and four <b>finishing</b> <b>passes.</b> In a subsequent phase it was possible {{to reduce the number of}} <b>finishing</b> <b>passes</b> into only 2 while maintaining similar surface integrity figures, where also it was possible to wire machine firtree slots geometrical accuracy of ± 7 μm. This phase also entailed extensive assessment of the impact of pulse shape on surface integrity when using similar pulse energies. Fatigue performance tests proved no statistically significant differences between WEDM and flank milling at 5 % level. The research also investigated the use of coated wires and oil based dielectric compared to standard brass wire and de-ionised water, where significant differences in productivity were recorded...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{parameter}} {{optimization problem}} for multi-pass turning operations is studied. A mathematical model {{based on the}} minimum production cost criterion is developed. The unwanted material is removed by one <b>finishing</b> <b>pass</b> {{and at least one}} roughing passes depending on the total depth of cut. Maximum and minimum allowable cutting speeds, feed rates and depths of cut, as well as tool life, surface roughness, cutting force and cutting power consumption are constraints of the model. Optimal values of machining parameters are found by three methods: integer programming, nonlinear programming, and genetic algorithms. An example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the optimization model and solution methods. The model generates lower unit production costs compared with the results from the literature and machining data handbook...|$|R
