500|$|In October 2014, PewDiePie began {{hinting at}} the {{possibility}} that he might not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014. Reports that covered this information also added that PewDiePie expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney; PewDiePie was quoted saying, [...] "The fact that Disney bought Maker Studios doesn't really change anything for me. If <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> help, they reply, but that's all the contact we have. We'll see what happens." [...] Rather than re-sign with Maker, PewDiePie has mulled the option of launching his own network, although he has declined to provide in-depth details on the subject. However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, PewDiePie tweeted, [...] "I feel like I was misquoted in the WSJ and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me." [...] PewDiePie ultimately continued creating videos under Maker; his relationship with the network has seen Maker establish an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell Bro Army merchandise, while PewDiePie promotes Maker's media interests and gives the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.|$|E

I want the right to segregate my family from these misfits and perverts," [...] Smothers told a social conservative rally held at the Astrodome {{in opposition to the}} feminist convention.|$|E

2500|$|Around 210, Liu Zhang {{was serving}} as the Governor (牧) of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), and he faced the threat of his rival Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. Zhou Yu went to see Sun Quan and proposed, [...] "Cao Cao is still {{recovering}} from his defeats and he faces internal threats, so he will not {{go to war with}} you any time soon. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> you to allow me and Sun Yu to invade Shu (Yi Province) and attack Zhang Lu after that. Sun Yu will then remain behind to defend the captured territories and form an alliance with Ma Chao. I'll join you in attacking Cao Cao at Xiangyang, and we can conquer the north." [...] Sun Quan agreed.|$|E

[...] At that moment, the Prior rushes from the church and {{recognises}} Alaide as Queen Agnes. He announces that he has just learned that the Queen's rival for the throne, Isemberga, has died and now Alaide must return to Paris. Arturo, rendered mad by this news, throws himself on his sword and dies. Finally, La Straniera/Alaide/Agnes is in total despair.

2500|$|Rape is an evil act. I {{used the}} wrong {{words in the}} wrong way and for that I apologize. As {{the father of two}} daughters, I want tough justice for predators. I have a {{compassionate}} heart for the victims of sexual assault, and I pray for them. The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy. The truth is, rape has many victims. The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> your forgiveness. In relation to the resulting furor over his original [...] "legitimate rape" [...] comment, Akin said: [...] "I talk about one word, one sentence, one day out of place, and, all of a sudden, the entire establishment turns on you." ...|$|E

2500|$|At another point, a death-obsessed Gordon {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "Better a bullet to the brain than to flicker out unheeded". In a letter that reached Cairo in December, Gordon wrote: [...] "Farewell. You will never hear from me again. I fear {{that there will be}} treachery in the garrison, and all will be over by Christmas." [...] On 14 December 1884, Gordon wrote the last entry in his diary, which read: [...] "Now MARK THIS, if the Expeditionary Force and <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> no more than two hundred men, does not come in ten days, the town may fall; and I have done my best for the honour of our country. Goodbye, C. G. Gordon".

On November 9, 2008, about two months after her marriage, Ajram won her first World Music Award for her best-selling album Betfakkar Fi Eih.
