40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the electrical properties {{of a series}} of nanocomposites based on high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a matrix and either carbon nanofiber (CNF) or multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) as a nanoadditive. The measurements of the electrical conductivity over a broad-band of frequencies (10 - 2 > F/Hz> 109) allow improvement of the description of the electrical properties of polymer nanocomposites based on either carbon nanofibers or carbon nanotubes. Despite the lack of a continuous conducting network between particles at low concentrations, the nanocomposites exhibit a significant dc electrical conductivity due to tunnel conduction. At low nanoadditive concentrations, the frequency dependence of the electrical conductivity is mainly caused by the influence of large polymeric gaps between conducting clusters. As nanoadditive concentration increases, the size of the <b>finite-size</b> <b>cluster</b> tends to increase and the frequency dependence of the conductivity reflects the features of anomalous diffusion in fractal structures, as expected according to percolation theory. A master curve for the electrical conductivity as a function of frequency can be constructed although, for the investigated nanocomposites, this behavior should be contemplated as a working, rather than as a universal, law. 1...|$|E

This model is widely used for simulation of the band structure of FeAs clusters, which are structure elements of Fe-based high-temperature superconductors. The choice of a special basis set of hyper-sites allowed to take into account four-fermion operator terms and to overcome partly the sign problem. Spectral functions and the density of states for various parameters of the model are obtained in the undoped and low-doped regimes. The correlated distortion of the spectral density with the change of doping is observed, and the applicability of the "hard-band" approximation in the doped regime is demonstrated. Profiles of the momentum distribution are obtained for the first Brillouin zone; they have pronounced jump near the Fermi level, which decreases with the growth of the strength of the interaction. The invariance of the Fermi surface with respect to the strength of the interaction is testified. Nesting is found in the case of electron and hole doping. Fermi-liquid parameters of the model are derived. Z-factor grows sharply with the increasing the level of doping, and monotonously decreases with the growth of the strength of the interaction.

40|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1938, superfluidity {{has been the}} subject of much investigation because it provides a unique example of a macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanics. About 60 years later, scientists successfully observed this phenomenon in the microscopic world though the spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in helium nano-droplets. This reduction of scale suggests that not only helium but also para-H 2 (pH 2) can be a candidate for superfluidity. This expectation is based on the fact that the smaller number of neighbours and surface effects of a <b>finite-size</b> <b>cluster</b> may hinder solidification and promote a liquid-like phase. The first prediction of superfluidity in pH 2 clusters was reported in 1991 based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The possible superfluidity of pH 2 was later indirectly observed in a spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in 2000. Since then, a growing number of studies have appeared, and theoretical simulations have been playing a special role because they help guide and interpret experiments. In this review, we go over the theoretical studies of pH 2 superfluid clusters since the experiment of 2000. We provide a historical perspective and introduce the basic theoretical formalism along with key experimental advances.

We analyze the second-order dipole allowed process that the strong perturbation works through the intermediate {{state in which}} the spin degree of freedom is lost at the core-hole site. Within the approximation neglecting the perturbation on the neighboring sites, we derive the spin-flip final state in the scattering channel with changing the polarization, {{which leads to the}} RIXS spectra expressed as the dynamical structure factor of the transverse spin components. We assume a spherical form of the spin-conserving final state in the channel without changing the polarization, which leads to the RIXS spectra expressed as the 'exchange'-type multi-spin correlation function. Evaluating numerically the transition amplitudes to these final states on a <b>finite-size</b> <b>cluster,</b> we obtain a sizable amount of the transition amplitude to the spin-conserving final state in comparison with that to the spin-flip final state. We treat the itinerant magnetic excitations in the final state by means of the 1 /S-expansion method. Evaluating the higher-order correction with 1 /S, we find that the peak arising from the one-magnon excitation is reduced with its weight, and the continuous spectra arising from the three-magnon excitations come out. The interaction between two magnons is treated by summing up the ladder diagrams. On the basis of these results, we analyze the L_ 3 -edge RIXS spectra in Sr_ 2 CuO_ 2 Cl_ 2 in comparison with the experiment. It is shown that the three-magnon excitations as well as the two-magnon excitations give rise to the intensity in the high energy side of the one-magnon peak, making the spectral shape asymmetric with wide width, in good agreement with the experiment.
