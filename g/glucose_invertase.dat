50|$|Fermentation {{typically}} {{begins when}} viable baker's yeast or a starter culture {{is added to}} flour and water. Enzymes in the flour and yeast create sugars, which are consumed by the yeast, who in turn produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Specifically, the grain enzyme diastase begins to convert starch in the grain to maltose. The baker's yeast enzyme maltase converts maltose into <b>glucose,</b> <b>invertase</b> converts any added sucrose to glucose and fructose, and zymase converts glucose and fructose to carbon dioxide gas which makes the dough rise, and alcohol which gives the baked bread flavor. Sourdough starters also produce lactic and acetic acids, further contributing to flavor. When the yeast cells die, they release high quantities of a protease which snip protein strands, and in large dieoffs result in soft, sticky dough, less baked volume and a coarse crumb, but in smaller dieoffs, increase dough extensibility and baked volume.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Invertases (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) are hydrolases that cleave sucrose {{into the}} monosacccharides, glucose, and fructose. They {{play a central}} role in carbohy-drate {{metabolism}} of plants and animals. Methods presented so far to quantify invertase activity in ants or other animals have been hampered by the variabil-ity in both substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction in animals whose carbohydrate metabolism is highly active. Our method is based on a spectropho-tometric quantification of the kinetics of glucose release. We first obtained an equilibrium state summarizing reactions of any carbohydrates and enzymes that are present in the extract. Sucrose was then added to quantify invertase activ-ity as newly released <b>glucose.</b> <b>Invertase</b> activities differed significantly among species of ants. Variances were lowest among individuals from the same colony and highest among different species. When preparations were made from ants of the same species, invertase activity was linearly related to the number of ants used for extraction. Our method does not require ants to be kept on specific substrates prior to the experiment, or expensive or large equipment. It, thus, appears suitable for dealing with a broad range of physiological, ecological, and evolutionary questions.

In the enzymes investigated, a {{moderate}} increase of thermostability in <b>glucose</b> oxidase and <b>invertase,</b> and prominent increase in lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase and ascorbate oxidase were observed. The increase of thermostability by amidination was suggesting the synergism of {{the enhancement of}} intersubunit salt bridges and the conformational stabilization by intra- and intermolecular cross-linking. The coupling of oxidized dextran with periodate {{on the surface of}} the enzyme molecule (enzyme-dextran-conjugate) and the subsequent cross-linking with hexamethylenediamine were also proposed to enhance the thermostability.

All or several of the strains were characterized in their steady state batch growth with 0. 2 % or 2 % glucose, in aerobic as well as respiration-inhibited conditions, with respect to growth rate, yield, and ethanol formation. Glucose flux values were generally similar for different strains and conditions, provided they contained either hexokinase 1 or hexokinase 2. And their aerobic growth, as known for wild type, was largely fermentative with ca. 1. 5 mol ethanol made per mol glucose used.

40|$|Chemical {{processes}} are harmful to people, animals, {{and the environment}} and are being replaced with more environmentally friendly strategies. Biocatalysts, such as enzymes, are safer for everyday use. Enzymes have multiple benefits that make them extremely attractive. Enzymes are currently used in the antibiotic industry, food industry and textile industry. Additionally, enzymes work effectively and efficiently at breaking down various inorganic and organic materials. This includes paper, human waste and particles regularly found in stains. Enzymes are now commonly found as components in detergents and industrial cleaners as they reduce time, water and energy consumption. The {{most common type of}} enzymes employed in the cleaning industry are hydrolases. The three most common hydrolase enzymes found in cleaning products are lipases, proteases and invertases. Lipases break down triacylglycerols into glycerol and free fatty acids. Lipases are important in the cleaning industry as they break down animal and vegetable fat and oil stains as well as aid in the removal of soil stains. Proteases break down proteins and peptides at their amide bonds. Proteases are imperative in the cleaning industry due to their ability to break down many types of stains. Invertases are the third hydrolase enzyme used in the cleaning process. Invertases break down sucrose into fructose and glucose. Invertases are used in cleaning products since sugars are common in stains. The studies performed in this thesis were designed to determine if/which enzymes were components of a proprietary microbial fermentation product manufactured by a local company. Proteins were detected in the product suggesting the potential for enzymatic activity. Assays were designed to test for lipase, protease, and invertase activity in 2 ̆ 2 fermentation broths 2 ̆ 2 obtained directly from the manufacturer and also 2 ̆ 2 starter cultures 2 ̆ 2 produced from inoculation of fresh proprietary material (organism). Lipase activity was detected in starter culture material via both colorimetric and agar plate methods. Protease activity was found in a colorimetric assay for some fermentation broths but was at the lower limit of detection. Protease activity was also found in starter cultures using an agar plate method. Invertase activity was detected via a colorimetric assay that measures the level of free <b>glucose.</b> <b>Invertase</b> activity was found in both fermentation broth and starter culture materials. Invertase activity was quantifiable and could potentially be used as a measure of quality control during production of the product.

30|$|Three enzymes {{are used}} for {{measurement}} of sucrose while only one, glucose oxidase - for <b>glucose.</b> The enzyme <b>invertase</b> decomposes sucrose into β-D-fructose and α-D-glucose, which is transformed into β-D-glucose by mutarotase. β-D-glucose is decomposed by GOD to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucolactone. In its turn, D-glucolactone is spontaneously hydrolyzed to gluconic acid, which dissociates to the acid residue and a proton. These reactions lead to changes in solution conductivity what can be registered by a conductometric transducer.|$|R
50|$|Invertase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} (breakdown) of sucrose (table sugar).

The resulting mixture of fructose and glucose is called inverted sugar syrup. Related to invertases are sucrases.

Bulbs were stored dry for 12 weeks at 5 [deg]C (precooled) or 17 [deg]C (noncooled). Only the 5 [deg]C treatment led to rapid flower stalk elongation and flowering following planting at higher temperatures. Precooling enhanced mobilization of starch, fructans, and sucrose in the scales. The cold-stimulated starch breakdown was initially accompanied by increased [alpha]-amylase activity per scale. In noncooled bulbs, [alpha]-amylase activity slightly decreased or remained more or less constant. Cold-induced flower stalk elongation was partially accompanied by {{a decrease in the}} sucrose content and an increase in the <b>glucose</b> content and <b>invertase</b> activity per g dry weight. The starch content in internodes initially decreased and subsequently increased; [alpha]-amylase activity per g dry weight of the lowermost internode showed a peak pattern during starch breakdown and increased thereafter. The internodes of noncooled bulbs, on the contrary, accumulated sucrose. Their <b>glucose</b> content and <b>invertase</b> activity per g dry weight remained low. Starch breakdown was not found and [alpha]-amylase activity per g dry weight of the lowermost internode remained at a low level. Precooling of tulip bulbs thus favors reserve mobilization in the scales and flower stalk and glucose accumulation in the elongating internodes...|$|R
40|$|Invertases are a {{widespread}} group of enzymes that catalyse {{the conversion of}} sucrose into fructose and <b>glucose.</b> Plants <b>invertases</b> and their substrates are essential factors that {{play an active role}} in primary metabolism and in cellular differentiation and by these activities they sustain development and growth.

In this work, we report the identification of the invertase RhVI 1 that was found to be highly expressed in rose petals. A characterization of this protein revealed that RhVI 1 is a glycosylated membrane-anchored protein associated with the cytosolic side of the vacuolar membrane which occurs in vivo in a monomeric form. Purification yields have shown that the levels of expression decreased during the passage of petals from buds to mature and pre-senescent flowers. Moreover, the activity assay indicates RhVI 1 to be an acidic vacuolar invertase.

The following parameters were varied: concentration of enzymes, initial concentration of substrates (sucrose and glucose), pH, temperature and feeding rate (for continuous process). The highest yield of conversion (100 %) was attained through the discontinuous (batch) process carried out at pH 4. 5 and 37 ºC by the sequential addition of invertase (14. 3 U), glucose oxidase (10, 000 U) and catalase (59, 000 U) ...|$|R

The consequences for various physiological properties of varying the glucose transport capacity were examined. The control coefficient of glucose transport with respect to growth rate was 0. 54.

40|$|The HXK 2 gene is {{required}} {{for a variety of}} regulatory effects leading to an adaptation for fermentative metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the molecular basis of the specific role of Hxk 2 p in these effects is still unclear. One important feature {{in order to understand the}} physiological function of hexokinase PII is that it is a phosphoprotein, since protein phosphorylation is essential in most metabolic signal transductions in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that Hxk 2 p exists in vivo in a dimeric-monomeric equilibrium which is affected by phosphorylation. Only the monomeric form appears phosphorylated, whereas the dimer does not. The reversible phosphorylation of Hxk 2 p is carbon source dependent, being more extensive on poor carbon sources such as galactose, raffinose, and ethanol. In vivo dephosphorylation of Hxk 2 p is promoted after addition of glucose. This effect is absent in glucose repression mutants cat 80 /grr 1, hex 2 /reg 1, and cid 1 /glc 7. Treatment of a glucose crude extract from cid 1 - 226 (glc 7 -T 152 K) mutant cells with λ-phosphatase drastically reduces the presence of phosphoprotein, suggesting that CID 1 /GLC 7 phosphatase together with its regulatory HEX 2 /REG 1 subunit are involved in the dephosphorylation of the Hxk 2 p monomer. An HXK 2 mutation encoding a serine-to-alanine change at position 15 [HXK 2 (S 15 A) ] was to clarify the in vivo function of the phosphorylation of hexokinase PII. In this mutant, where the Hxk 2 protein is unable to undergo phosphorylation, the cells could not provide <b>glucose</b> repression of <b>invertase.</b> <b>Glucose</b> induction of HXT gene expression is also affected in cells expressing the mutated enzyme. Although we cannot rule out a defect in the metabolic state of the cell as the origin of these phenomena, our results suggest that the phosphorylation of hexokinase is essential in vivo for glucose signal transduction...|$|R

The enzymes (<b>glucose</b> oxidase, <b>invertase,</b> esterase) covalently bound to the silica microparticles performed Boolean logic operations AND/OR processing biochemical information received {{in the form of}} chemical input signals resulting in changes of the solution pH value. Dissociation state of the organic shells on the gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles was controlled by pH changes generated in situ by the enzyme logic systems. The charge variation on the organic shells upon the reversible protonation/dissociation process resulted in the changes of the gold layer localized surface plasmon resonance energy (LSPR), thus producing optical changes in the system. The proton transfer process allowed the functional coupling of the information processing enzyme systems with the signal transducing gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles providing their cooperative performance. Magnetic properties of the gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles allowed separation of the signal-transducing nanoparticles from the enzyme-modified signal processing silica microparticles. The reversible system operation was achieved by the Reset function, returning the pH value and optical properties of the system to the initial state. This process was biocatalyzed by another immobilized enzyme (urease) activated with a biochemical signal.

We used leaf veins from petioles of several herbaceous species including annual fleabane, Erigeron annuus. Those leaf veins were easily isolated from the petioles, and used as the samples for detection of nitrate ions in them with using kits for examination of water. Nitrate ions in soil were also detected with those kits. If these experiments were introduced in “water pathway in plants” of the learning unit in science classes, then realistic understanding by these experiments on function of transportation of inorganic nutrients in plant vessels would be promoted. The sucrose content in the vein samples was compared with that in mesophyll-cell samples. It was measured with a photometer using a glucose detection reagent on the market, after conversion of sucrose into <b>glucose</b> by <b>invertase.</b> The sucrose content in the petiole veins of annual fleabane was higher than that in leaf mesophyll-cells. The detection method of sucrose was simplified for usage in elementary and lower secondary school science classes, and would promote the understanding of the conversion of starch into sugar.

40|$|Abstract Background Invertases are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} irreversibly cleave sucrose into fructose and <b>glucose.</b> Plant <b>invertases</b> play {{important roles in}} carbohydrate metabolism, plant development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. In potato (Solanum tuberosum), invertases are involved in 'cold-induced sweetening' of tubers, an adaptive response to cold stress, which negatively affects the quality of potato chips and French fries. Linkage and association studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tuber sugar content and chip quality that colocalize with three independent potato invertase loci, which together encode five invertase genes. The role of natural allelic variation of these genes in controlling the variation of tuber sugar content in different genotypes is unknown. Results For functional studies on natural variants of five potato invertase genes we cloned and sequenced 193 full-length cDNAs from six heterozygous individuals (three tetraploid and three diploid). Eleven, thirteen, ten, twelve and nine different cDNA alleles were obtained for the genes Pain- 1, InvGE, InvGF, InvCD 141 and InvCD 111, respectively. Allelic cDNA sequences differed from each other by 4 to 9 %, and most were genotype specific. Additional variation was identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in an association-mapping population of 219 tetraploid individuals. Haplotype modeling revealed two to three major haplotypes besides {{a larger number of}} minor frequency haplotypes. cDNA alleles associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield were identified. Conclusions Very high natural allelic variation was uncovered in a set of five potato invertase genes. This variability is a consequence of the cultivated potato's reproductive biology. Some of the structural variation found might underlie functional variation that influences important agronomic traits such as tuber sugar content. The associations found between specific invertase alleles and chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield will facilitate the selection of superior potato genotypes in breeding programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background]: A {{low level}} of glucose is {{required}} for maximal transcription of the SUC 2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although the repressor Rgt 1 binds the SUC 2 promoter in gel-shift assays, {{it has been reported}} that Rgt 1 has only minimal effects on SUC 2 expression. Rgt 1 acts together with Mth 1 to repress the HXT genes encoding glucose transporters, and the release of Rgt 1 from some HXT promoters requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. [Methods]: The genes RGT 1 and MTH 1 have been disrupted and the SUC 2 promoter modified in several S. cerevisiae backgrounds. Yeast cells were grown in different carbon sources in the presence or absence of 0. 1 or 2 % <b>glucose,</b> and <b>invertase</b> was assayed in whole cells. [Results]: Galactose, glycerol or ethanol hindered invertase induction by low glucose, but lactate did not. During growth in lactate, deletion of RGT 1 or MTH 1 caused a marked increase in invertase levels, and elimination of the Rgt 1 -binding site in the SUC 2 promoter caused also invertase induction. PKA activity decreased invertase levels in cells growing in lactate, and increased them during growth in lactate + 0. 1 % glucose. [Conclusions]: The {{low level of}} expression of SUC 2 in the absence of glucose is mainly due to repression by the Rgt 1 -Mth 1 complex. Repression is dependent on PKA activity, but not on any specific Tpk isoenzyme. [General significance]: The results show that previously overlooked regulatory elements, such as Rgt 1 and Tpks, participate in the control of SUC 2 expression in S. cerevisiae.

The reg 1 mutant also showed resistance to the <b>glucose</b> repression of <b>invertase</b> synthesis but not to that of alpha-D-glucosidase. The two other classes were identified as arising from recessive mutations at the GAL 82 locus and the GAL 83 locus, respectively, at which various dominant mutations were isolated previously. When in a constitutive background due to the GAL 81 or gal 80 mutation, the GAL 82 and GAL 83 mutations did not show a mutually additive effect on the resistance to glucose repression of galactokinase synthesis, while the reg 1 and GAL 82 (or GAL 83) mutations did.

40|$|Carob {{waste is}} a useful raw {{material}} for the second-generation ethanol because 50 % of its dry weight is sucrose, glucose, and fructose. To optimize the process, we have studied {{the influence of the}} initial concentration of sugars on the fermentation performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With initial sugar concentrations (S 0) of 20 g/l, the yeasts were derepressed and the ethanol produced during the exponential phase was consumed in a diauxic phase. The rate of ethanol consumption decreased with increasing S 0 and disappeared at 250 g/l when the Crabtree effect was complete and almost all the sugar consumed was transformed into ethanol with a yield factor of 0. 42 g/g. Sucrose hydrolysis was delayed at high S 0 because of <b>glucose</b> repression of <b>invertase</b> synthesis, which was triggered at concentrations above 40 g/l. At S 0 higher than 250 g/l, even when glucose had been exhausted, sucrose was hydrolyzed very slowly, probably due to an inhibition at this low water activity. Although with lower metabolic rates and longer times of fermentation, 250 g/l is considered the optimal initial concentration because it avoids the diauxic consumption of ethanol and maintains enough invertase activity to consume all the sucrose, and also avoids the inhibitions due to lower water activities at higher S 0...|$|R

Stable gene disruptions were constructed inside these genes, and the resulting growth deficiencies were used for selecting epistatic mutations.

Additionally, hexokinase activity was increased. Gluconeogenic enzymes are still normally repressible in cat 4 mutants. The occurrence of recombination of cat 1 ::HIS 3 and cat 3 ::LEU 2 with some cat 4 alleles allowed significant growth in the presence of ethanol, which could be attributed to a partial derepression of gluconeogenic enzymes.

40|$|Plant invertases are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} that have enzymatic function in cleaving sucrose to fructose and <b>glucose.</b> Cell wall <b>invertase,</b> located on {{the exterior of the}} cell wall of plant cells, {{plays a key role in}} the unloading of sucrose from the apoplast to the sink tissues. Cell wall invertase interacts with an inhibitor, cell wall invertase inhibitor, post-transcriptionally to regulate its activity. The inhibitor is constitutively expressed in pollen development, early developing seeds, and senescing leaves: indicative of sucrose allocation being a limiting factor at these stages of development. We introduced algal bicarbonate transporters LCIA/CCP 1 to Camelina sativa for the purpose of increasing photosynthetic capacity. The bicarbonate transporters concentrate CO 2 at RuBisCO by pumping CO 2 in the form of bicarbonate through the membrane, then converting it back to CO 2 at RuBisCO, increasing CO 2 concentration. Results from these plants have shown an increase in seed number, but not seed mass, along with a faster rate of maturity and senescence. This is indicative of acclimation to high CO 2 conditions, resulting from insertion of the bicarbonate transporters. RNA sequencing was performed and a putative invertase inhibitor was recognized as being expressed in the transgenic C. sativa but not in the wild type. Our strategy is to knock out two invertase inhibitors using induced RNA silencing, dramatically altering sucrose allocation into developing seeds and resulting in an increase in seed biomass.
