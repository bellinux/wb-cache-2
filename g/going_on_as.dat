5|$|Released on August 28, 1973, Let's Get It On surpassed Gaye's {{previous}} studio effort, What's <b>Going</b> <b>On,</b> <b>as</b> {{the best-selling}} {{record of his}} tenure with Motown. The album peaked at number two on the US Billboard Top LPs chart, succeeded by The Rolling Stones's Goats Head Soup (1973), while it also managed to reach number one in Cash Box for one week, {{as well as two}} weeks at the top of Record Worlds music charts. Let's Get It On charted for 61 weeks on the Billboard charts, and remained {{at the top of the}} Billboard Soul Albums for 11 weeks, becoming the best-selling soul album of 1973.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation about what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she {{is not the same as}} before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>as</b> he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} news story aired, the Bozeman City Commissioner {{received}} e-mails {{and phone calls}} expressing indignation about the practice from across the nation. Bozeman residents were astonished and alarmed by the request. The local government believed the practice had been <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> part of a background search for about three years. In response to the negative backlash from the news media and local citizens, the city rescinded the policy on June 20, 2009, {{just two days after}} the news broke.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{high degree}} of {{political}} and civil corruption in the region in the 1920s and 1930s. The mainstream newspapers hardly mentioned what was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>as</b> any outlet that published articles critical of the status quo was threatened. Some small tabloid newspapers attempted to report what was going on, but reporters and editors quickly became targets. Howard Guilford of the Twin City Reporter was shot and killed on September 6, 1934. A decade later the paper lost another reporter when Arthur Kasherman was killed on January 22, 1945.|$|E

25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's Get It On repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's <b>Going</b> <b>On,</b> <b>as</b> would Gaye's later albums such as I Want You, Here, My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E
500|$|Drowned in Sound's Joseph Stannard {{has noted}} that [...] "Europa and the Pirate Twins" [...] is written with World WarII as a strong influence, and that the song [...] "emphasises the short {{distance}} between [...] generation and the one which endured the last global conflict". Dolby has described the song, along with {{the tone of the}} album, as reflecting [...] "a sense of [...] relationship that's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> being overwhelmed by something on a grander level", adding that [...] "there's a very strong wartime atmosphere to it". The song was described as [...] "a semi-autobiographical romp" [...] in the liner notes for Dolby's 2009 greatest hits album The Singular Thomas Dolby, the release of which was overseen by the singer. [...] "Europa and the Pirate Twins" [...] received a [...] "sequel" [...] on Dolby's 1992 album Astronauts & Heretics, in the song [...] "Eastern Bloc"; which has been described by Audio magazine as [...] "appealingly faithful" [...] to the original.|$|E
500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about this young man who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E

500|$|David Knight {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Adelaide Review, and wrote of its author, [...] "He {{is one of the}} finest exponents of polemic journalism, and regularly punches the reader in the gut with analogies and metaphors that brutally describe the world around him." [...] Knight observed, [...] "Taibbi’s been called the modern Hunter S. Thompson many times, but unlike the overrated gonzo pioneer, Taibbi is able to brutally assess what’s <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>as</b> well as cover the mood of the public with humour, heart and venom minus the ego." [...] His review concluded, [...] "Here his venom is not aimed at Middle America but the Republican Party, the Democrats and the media. Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, journalist Chris Potter compared the book to Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 by Hunter S. Thompson, commenting, [...] "Nearly a half-century later, another Rolling Stone writer, Matt Taibbi, has assembled a selection of his own 2016 reports. And — spoiler alert! — the outcome is arguably not much different." [...] Potter criticized the work for not devoting more space to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. He lamented, [...] "I wish Mr. Taibbi had delved into the Kremlin's meddling in the 2016 election, which was on display as early as last fall. He's lived in, and written extensively about, contemporary Russia, and might have revealed some interesting correspondences between the political culture there and here." ...|$|E
500|$|Latour's {{inspiration}} {{for creating the}} character came {{when he realized that}} he was not familiar with Gwen Stacy outside of being a [...] "fridged" [...] character who was killed {{for the sake of the}} hero as a plot progression. Latour also felt he grew up in times where white males were dominant in superhero comics, and saw Gwen Stacy as a potential heroine to represent women in a better way, [...] "The fact that it's a woman does change the meaning and subtext of everything that's <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>As</b> a creator, that's really enjoyable and it opens up the story to go in a lot of directions it wouldn't have gone before. In October 2014, Nick Lowe announced at New York Comic Con 2014 that the character would be getting its own ongoing series after much demand. The first issue of Spider-Gwen experienced commercial success and was the third best-selling comic of February 2015 with sales of over 250,000 copies. The first volume ended after the fifth issue, with the character carrying over into the second volume of Spider-Verse as part of the Secret Wars event. After the conclusion of the event, a second volume by the same creative team began with the first issue as a part of Marvel's All-New, All-Different Marvel imprint entitled The Radioactive Spider-Gwen. Spider-Gwen was featured as a major character in a multi-part crossover entitled Spider-Women. It commenced with Spider-Women Alpha #1 and ended with Spider-Women Omega #1, with certain issues of Spider-Woman, Silk and Spider-Gwen partially depicting the storyline in between.|$|E
