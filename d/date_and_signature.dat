Digital imageBorn in 1910 in Floss, Bavaria, David Ludwig Bloch lost his hearing as a child. He began to study porcelain painting in 1925, and was employed at this until 1934. He then began studies at the state school for applied painting in Munich. By this time the artist had already taken part in exhibitions of the "Jewish Culture Federation of Bavaria". Bloch became a commercial artist and decorator with the department store Sallinger in Straubing, but subsequently was fired for being Jewish. He was excluded from studies in Munich for the same reason. During Kristallnacht, Bloch was arrested and imprisoned in Dachau for four weeks, after which he found work with the master painter Heinz Voges in Munich. In 1940, the artist emigrated to Shanghai, where he got married to Lilly Cheng Disiu, who was also deaf. Bloch moved to New York in 1949, and worked there for 26 years as a graphic artist. After a visit to Germany in 1976, the Holocaust became an intense focus of his art. A book published in 1997, titled "David Ludwig Bloch: Woodcuts. Shanghai 1940 - 1949," presents Bloch’s collected woodcuts created in the years of his exile in Shanghai. In 2000, he had a one-man retrospective at the Jewish Museum in Munich, Germany...|$|E

40|$|The article {{attempts}} to present {{and discuss the}} juvenile works of Gustave Flaubert. Though the writer never allowed these juvenile works to be published, being extremely critical of their aesthetic value, the works such as November, Memoirs of a Madman or the diary-form Cahier intime de 1840 – 1841 still make important texts that provide a sizeable amount {{of information on the}} writer’s literary workshop. Interestingly enough, these early works show the writer’s attachment to the manuscript (tantamount to the dislike to the written word) and the author’s tools (pen, ink and paper). These juvenile attempts, in the main autobiographical in nature, are thus penetrated by the metatext element that is a key input in providing an opportunity for a reflection on the way the text itself does exist: this element also informs us on Flaubert’s growing maturity that ultimately defined his role of a fully-fledged author. The paratext elements (epigraphs, dedications, inscriptions, <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>signatures)</b> in his juvenile works seem to be just as important as they allow us to follow, step by step, the way to the birth of a writer-manuscript and thus a writer who gets his fulfillment and the very existence exclusively in a text of a manuscript character. </p...|$|R
