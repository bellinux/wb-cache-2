The {{formulation of the}} problem is based on the inhomogeneous far field condition and its corresponding higher order asymptotic solutions for the second order diffracted potential suggested by Li 9, and follows the finite-infinite element method as used by Lau and Ji 18. The interpolation in the infinite element along the radial direction has a far <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> compatible diffraction by a vertical surface-piercing circular cylinder. Numerical solutions of the second order diffracted potential, satisfying all the governing and boundary conditions as well as the inhomogeneous far field condition, are obtainable with the method.

We find that due to the precence of a gravitational field a finite correction to the transition probability is added which depends inversely on the mass. Moreover the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> is smaller and lifetime of the particles is longer compared to flat space.

Firstly we load a potassium- 39 magneto optical trap (MOT) inside the ring cavity. To achieve this a laser system, rectangular magnetic coils system and vacuum system are designed and constructed. To stabilise the laser system, a detailed study of various potassium spectroscopy techniques is undertaken and the reference laser is suitably locked to the magnetically induced spectroscopy. We load an ensemble of 10 ^ 5 potassium atoms inside the ring cavity mode and study their collective strong coupling with the cavity field. In the collective strong coupling regime, the photons are coherently exchanged between the atomic ensemble and cavity field.

40|$|The ohmic {{decay of}} {{magnetic}} fields confined within the crust of neutron stars {{is considered by}} incorporating both the effect of neutron star cooling {{and the effect of}} space-time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of the star. For this purpose a stationary and static gravitational field has been considered with the standard as well as the accelerated cooling models of neutron stars. It is shown that general relativistic effect reduces the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> substantially. At the late stage of evolution when the field decay is mainly determined by the impurity-electron scattering, the effect of space-time curvature suppresses the role of the impurity content significantly and reduces the decay rate by more than an order of magnitude. Even with a high impurity content the decay rate is too low to be of observational interest if the accelerated cooling model along with the effect of space-time curvature is taken into account. It is, therefore, pointed out that if a decrease in the magnetic field strength by more than two orders of magnitude from its initial value is detected by observation then the existence of quark in the core of the neutron star would possibly be ruled out.

40|$|AbstractThe {{conductivity}} {{and temperature}} of hypervelocity projectiles were studied using a novel magnetic diffusion analysis technique and five color radiometry. A copper shaped charge jet was fired through an electromagnetic coil to saturate the tip with a magnetic field.

A mathematical model was then used to calculate the <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of the magnetic field from the tip and the signals produced by the sensing coils to determine the electrical conductivity. The resulting conductivity indicated that the tip of the shaped charge jet has a bulk temperature on the order of 1200 K. The experimental data were directly compared to temperature distributions generated by hydrocodes using both the Johnson-Cook and Steinberg-Guinan-Lund strength models. Because the magnetic diffusion technique is extremely versatile, various projectiles over a broad dynamic range can be investigated.

40|$|We report our {{independent}} GeV gamma-ray {{study of}} the young shell-type supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 73 which harbors a central magnetar, and CO-line millimeter observations toward the SNR. Using 7. 6 years of Fermi-LAT observation data, we detected an extended gamma-ray source ("source A") with the centroid on {{the west of the}} SNR, with a significance of 21. 6 sigma in 0. 1 - 300 GeV and an error circle of 5. 4 arcminute in angular radius. The gamma-ray spectrum cannot be reproduced by a pure leptonic emission or a pure emission from the magnetar, and thus a hadronic emission component is needed. The CO-line observations reveal a molecular cloud (MC) at V_LSR~ 90 km/s, which demonstrates morphological correspondence with the western boundary of the SNR brightened in multiwavelength. The 12 CO (J= 2 - 1) / 12 CO (J= 1 - 0) ratio in the left (blue) wing 85 - 88 km/s is prominently elevated to ~ 1. 1 along the northwestern boundary, providing kinematic evidence of the SNR-MC interaction. This SNR-MC association yields a kinematic distance 9 kpc to Kes 73. The MC is shown to be capable of accounting for the hadronic gamma-ray emission component. The gamma-ray spectrum can be interpreted with a pure hadronic emission or a magnetar+hadronic hybrid emission. In the case of pure hadronic emission, the spectral index of the protons is 2. 4, very {{similar to that of the}} radio-emitting electrons, essentially consistent with the diffusive shock acceleration theory.

40|$|In this work, we {{interpreted}} the high braking index of PSR J 1640 - 4631 {{with a combination}} of the magneto-dipole radiation and dipole magnetic field decay models. By introducing a mean rotation energy conversion coefficient ζ, the ratio of the total high-energy photon energy to the total rotation energy loss in the whole life of the pulsar, and combining the pulsar's high-energy and timing observations with reliable nuclear equation of state, we estimate the pulsar's initial spin period, P_ 0 ∼ (17 - 44) ms, corresponding to the moment of inertia I∼ (0. 8 - 2. 1) × 10 ^ 45 g cm^ 2. Assuming that PSR J 1640 - 4631 has experienced a long-term exponential decay of the dipole magnetic field, we calculate the true age t_ age, the effective magnetic field decay timescale τ_D, and the initial surface dipole magnetic field at the pole B_p(0) of the pulsar to be (2900 - 3100) yrs, 1. 07 (2) × 10 ^ 5 yrs, and (1. 84 - 4. 20) × 10 ^ 13 G, respectively.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), operating at 4. 2 K, high magnetic field, and ultra-high vacuum (UHV), and the measurements of Au(111) and NbSe 2 with/without magnetic fields. The STM showed horizontal and vertical scan-ranges of 1. 0 × 1. 0 μm 2 and 270 nm, respectively. As of now, STM measurements have been carried out in a field up to 1 T. The UHV facility for tip/sample preparation in clean environment was integrated into the STM system. The nominal pressure of ~ 10 - 10 mbar in UHV chambers was achieved. However, the data of Au(111) and NbSe 2 were taken before installation of the UHV system. We observed the standing wave of surface state electron of Au(111) by carrying out a conductance map. We found an effective mass of surface state electron of m * = 0. 24 m e, where m e is the mass of a free electron. We also observed the motion of Au steps when the STM continued scanning. As steps moved, the patterns of herringbone reconstruction on the surface also changed in a complex way. This atomic motion probably resulted from the tip-sample interaction in a stressed film. Using pristine NbSe 2, we observed the charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting states simultaneously at 4. 2 K via topographic/spectroscopic measurements. The well-known √ 3 ×√ 3 superstructure of CDW state was revealed in topography. Furthermore, we deliberately introduced two additional phases (√ 13 ×√ 13 and amorphous) by changing a bias voltage from 1 - 100 mV to 5 - 10 V. This in situ surface modification can be used in studying the competition between superconducting and CDW states. Lastly, we show that the study of vortex dynamics on the nano-meter scale was achieved by utilizing an extremely slow decay of the magnetic field in the superconducting magnet as the driving source. The <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of ~ nT/s caused vortices to move at ~ pm/s so that the temporal resolution of our STM was sufficient to image these slowly moving vortices.

40|$|Fast surface {{integral}} equation (SIE) solvers {{seem to be}} ideal approaches for simulating 3 -D nanophotonic devices, as these devices generate fields both in an interior channel and in the infinite exterior domain. However, many devices of interest, such as optical couplers, have channels that cannot be terminated without generating reflections. Generating absorbers for these channels is a new problem for SIE methods, as the methods were initially developed for problems with finite surfaces. In this thesis, we show that the obvious approach for eliminating reflections, making the channel mildly conductive outside the domain of interest, is inaccurate. We propose a new method in which the absorber has gradually increasing surface conductivity; such an absorber can be easily incorporated in fast integral equation solvers. We present two types of PMCHW-based formulations to incorporate the surface conductivity into the SIE method. The accuracy of the two-type formulations are examined and discussed using {{an example of the}} scattering of a Mie sphere with surface conductivities. Moreover, we implement two different FFT-accelerated algorithms for the periodic non-absorbing region and the non-periodic absorbing region. In addition, we use perturbation theory and Poynting's theorem, respectively, to calculate the <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> due to the surface conductivity. We show a saturation phenomenon when the electrical surface conductivity is large. However, we show that the saturation is not a problem for the surface absorber since the absorber typically operates in a small surface conductivity regime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the surface conductive absorber by truncating a rectangular waveguide channel. Numerical results show that this new method is orders of magnitude more effective than a volume absorber. We also show that the transition reflection decreases in a power law with increasing the absorber length. We further apply the surface conductive absorber to terminate a waveguide with period-a sinusoidally corrugated sidewalls. We show that a surface absorber that can perform well when the periodic waveguide system is excited with a large group-velocity mode may fail when excited with a smaller group-velocity mode, and give an asymptotic relation between the surface absorber length, transition reflections and group velocity. Numerical results are given to validate the asymptotic prediction. by Lei Zhang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Inter-laboratory and {{absolute}} calibrations of rock magnetic parameters are fundamental for grounding a rock magnetic database and for semi-quantitative estimates about the magnetic mineral assemblage {{of a natural}} sample. Even a dimensionless ratio, such as anhysteretic susceptibility normalized by magnetic susceptibility (Ka/K) may be biased by improper calibration of {{one or both of}} the two instruments used to measure Ka and K. In addition, the intensity of the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) of a given sample depends on the experimental process by which the remanence is imparted. We report an inter-laboratory calibration of these two key parameters, using two sets of artificial reference samples: a paramagnetic rare earth salt, Gd 2 O 3 and a commercial "pozzolanico" cement containing oxidized magnetite with grain size of less than 0. 1 m according to hysteresis properties. Using Gd 2 O 3 the 10 Kappabridges magnetic susceptibility meters (AGICO KLY- 2 or KLY- 3 models) tested prove to be cross-calibrated to within 1 %. On the other hand, Kappabridges provide a low-field susceptibility value that is ca. 6 % lower than the tabulated value for Gd 2 O 3, while average high-field susceptibility values measured on a range of instruments are indistinguishable from the tabulated value. Therefore, we suggest that Kappabridge values should be multiplied by 1. 06 to achieve absolute calibration. Bartington Instruments magnetic susceptibility meters with MS 2 B sensors produce values that are 2 – 13 % lower than Kappabridge values, with a strong dependence on sample centering within the sensor. The Ka/K ratio of ca. 11, originally obtained on discrete cement samples with a 2 G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer and a KLY- 2, is consistent with reference parameters for magnetites of grain size < 0. 1 m. On the other hand, Ka values from a 2 G Enterprises magnetometer and K values from a Bartington Instruments MS 2 C loop sensor for u-channel and discrete cement samples, will produce average Ka/K values that are unrealistically high if not properly corrected for the nominal volume detected by the sensors for these instruments. Inter-laboratory measurements of K and Ka for standard paleomagnetic plastic cubes filled with cement indicate remarkable differences in the intensity of the newly produced ARMs (with a standard deviation of ca. 21 %), that are significantly larger than the differences observed from the calibration of the different magnetometers employed in each laboratory. Differences in the alternating <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> are likely the major source of these variations, but cannot account for all the observed variability. With such large variations in experimental conditions, classical interpretation of a "King plot" of Ka versus K would imply significant differences in the determination of grain size of magnetite particles on the same material...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of perturbative {{reheating}} on the evolution of the curvature perturbation ζ, in two-field inflation models. We use numerical methods to explore the sensitivity of f_NL, n_s and r to the reheating process, and present simple qualitative arguments to explain our results. In general, if a large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain non zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely decayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity parameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this dependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only have a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both directions, f_NL can also be sensitive to reheating if a mild hierarchy exists between the <b>decay</b> <b>rates</b> of each <b>field.</b> Within the class of models studied, we find that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the <b>field</b> <b>decay</b> <b>rates,</b> indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary observable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL.

40|$|First order {{rotational}} perturbations of {{the flat}} Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric are considered {{in the framework of}} four dimensional Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) string cosmological models coupled with dilaton and axion <b>fields.</b> The <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> of rotation depends mainly upon the dilaton field potential U. The equation for rotation imposes strong limitations upon the functional form of U, restricting the allowed potentials to two: the trivial case U= 0 and a generalized exponential type potential. In these two models the metric rotation function can be obtained in an exact analytic form in both Einstein and string frames. In the potential-free case the decay of rotational perturbations is governed by an arbitrary function of time while {{in the presence of a}} potential the rotation tends rapidly to zero in both Einstein and string frames.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the neutral fermion production in a linear magnetic field through the Pauli interaction. It is found that the production rate is exponentially decreasing {{with respect to the}} field gradient, which shows the non-perturbative characteristics analogous to the Schwinger process. It turns out that the production rate density depends on both the gradient and the strength of the magnetic field. It {{is quite different from the}} result in 2 + 1 dimension, where the production rate depends only on the gradient of the magnetic field, not on the strength of the magnetic <b>field.</b> The <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> density calculated for the linear magnetic field can be applicable to magnetic fields in general provided that it is linear over the scale of the Compton wavelength of the particle...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{a neutron}} star is {{accompanied}} by neutrino emission carring about 10 % of the rest energy of the star. Toroidal field produced by twisting of a dipole field in differentially rotating star is antisymmetric. Its summation with antisymmetric toroidal field results in braking of mirror symmetry of the magnetic field. For large magnetic <b>field</b> the neutron <b>decay</b> <b>rate</b> depends on its strength. Neutrino is emitted more in one direction leading to flux asymmetry and recoil of the neutron star. Estimations show that the neutron star can reach velocities ∼ 1000 km/s for 3 % asymmetry of the neutrino flux...|$|R
