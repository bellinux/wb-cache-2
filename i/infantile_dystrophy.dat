50|$|A few {{individuals}} with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> {{have not been}} found to have mutations in the PLA2G6 gene. The genetic cause of the condition in these cases is unknown; there is evidence that at least one other gene may be involved.|$|R
40|$|<b>Infantile</b> Neuroaxonal <b>Dystrophy</b> (INAD 1, MIM # 256600), {{is a rare}} autossomal {{recessive}} neurodegenerative disorder. The {{clinical picture}} is characterized by psychomotor regression and hypotonia, which progresses to spastic tetraplegia, visual impairment and dementia. Onset is within the first 2 years {{of life and death}} usually happens before the age of 10. In 2006, Morgan et al described that mutations in PLA 2 G 6 gene localized in chromosome 22 (22 q 13), caused INAD 1. Evidence showed that a large proportion of patients with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> have a mutation in the PLA 2 G 6 gene. A 36 -years-old pregnant woman presented for obstetric follow up. It was the second pregnancy of this healthy, nonconsanguineous couple. Their 7 year-old daughter was affected with <b>Infantile</b> Neuroaxonal <b>Dystrophy.</b> Molecular testing was done in the child and, as a causal mutation was detected, it was possible to offer a specific prenatal diagnosis. The molecular study of PLA 2 G 6 gene by amniocentesis showed the presence of a mutation in heterozygoty and the karyotype was normal for a female foetus.

40|$|Changes of {{cerebral}} metabolites {{detected by}} proton MR spectroscopy in two cases of <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> are described. A 6 11 / 12 -year-old {{boy and a}} girl (aged 4 1 / 12 years at the first and 5 2 / 12 years at the second examination) with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy of the basal ganglia. The signal intensity of the cerebellar cortex was increased on T 2 -weighted, proton density, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. The long echo time (135 ms) spectra revealed the presence of lactate in the basal ganglia of both cases in all investigations. The N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio was reduced in Case 1 and in the second investigation of Case 2. The choline/creatine ratio was always increased. As the diagnosis of <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> is made by a synopsis of various clinical, neuropathological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological data, the presence of lactate in the basal ganglia spectra may help to narrow down the diagnosis and can support the decision to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures (such as biopsies of skin, conjunctiva or even of the brain) ...|$|R
40|$|Recently a novel case of {{angiokeratoma}} corporis diffusum with glycoaminoaciduria {{was described}} in a 46 -yr-old Japanese woman. Known causes of the cutaneous manifestation were eliminated by enzyme analyses, and further characterization of the accumulated urinary O-linked sialopeptides revealed identity to those excreted by patients with an <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> due to lysosomal alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. Investigation of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity and protein in the proband revealed less than 2 % of normal activity {{and the absence of}} detectable immunoreactive enzyme protein, findings comparable to those in the patients with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. In addition, the proband's unaffected offspring had half-normal levels of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity, consistent with this enzymatic deficiency being the primary metabolic defect in this autosomal recessive trait. Ultrastructural examination of skin and blood cells from the adult proband revealed the presence of prominent lysosomal inclusions containing diffuse amorphous and filamentous material. In contrast, these morphologic findings were not observed in the nonneural tissues from patients with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency. These studies document the occurrence of two forms of alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency and sialopeptiduria, a severe infantile-onset form of neuroaxonal dystrophy without angiokeratoma or visceral lysosomal inclusions and an adult-onset form characterized by angiokeratoma, extensive lysosomal accumulation of sialoglycopeptides and the absence of detectable neurologic involvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} features of eight children with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> are presented. Diagnosis {{was established by}} brain biopsy (4 cases), conjunctival biopsy (1 case), and the family history (2 cases), while in one case a presumptive diagnosis was made on the combination of clinical and neurophysiological findings without histopathological confirmation. The pleomorphic clinical picture and variable neurophysiological findings make a firm diagnosis difficult without histopathological confirmation. However, in the appropriate clinical context, serial neurophysiological investigations (ERG, VEP, EEG, ENMG) may suggest the diagnosis {{after the age of}} 2 years. Conjunctival biopsy is not invariably helpful, and neuroaxonal spheroids are not always demonstrated in brain biopsies by conventional techniques. However, they were consistently identified using a non-specific esterase stain and by electron microscopy.

50|$|Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene impair the {{function}} of the PLA2 group VI enzyme. This impairment of enzyme function may disrupt cell membrane maintenance and {{contribute to the development of}} spheroid bodies in the nerve axons. Although it is unknown how changes in this enzyme's function lead to the signs and symptoms of <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy,</b> phospholipid metabolism problems have been seen in both this disorder and a related disorder called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. These disorders, as well as the more common Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, also are associated with changes in brain iron metabolism. Researchers are studying the links between phospholipid defects, brain iron, and damage to nerve cells, but have not determined how the iron accumulation that occurs in some individuals with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> may contribute to the features of this disorder.|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} family with two {{siblings}} having features of <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD), with first degree consanguineous parents. Rapid progressive loss of developing milestones (started from 18 months) and early infantile death of both siblings occurred. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed severe rapidly progressive cerebellar atrophy initially reported as early as 18 months, with the younger brother suffered generalized tonic clonic seizures. Next generation sequencing revealed a new mutation in PLA 2 G 6 gene (c. 319 del C, p. Leu 107 Cyst), resulting in a premature stop codon with shift in the reading frame of resulting protein. ConclusionEarly onset loss of developmental milestones with cerebellar atrophy and other described clinical findings ultimately warrant PLA 2 G 6 gene sequencing. Here we report c. 319 del. C of PLA 2 G 6 detected by next generation sequencing {{to be responsible for}} severe early <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> with early <b>infantile</b> death. We conclude that various PLA 2 G 6 gene sites sequencing need further investigation in INAD in line with clinical correlation. Also INAD seems to be an unrecognized disorder that needs more categorization for proper diagnosis and genetic counselling...|$|R
50|$|Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene {{have been}} {{identified}} in most individuals with <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy.</b> The PLA2G6 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called an A2 phospholipase. This enzyme family is involved in metabolizing phospholipids. Phospholipid metabolism is important for many body processes, including helping to keep the cell membrane intact and functioning properly. Specifically, the A2 phospholipase produced from the PLA2G6 gene, sometimes called PLA2 group VI, helps to regulate the levels of a compound called phosphatidylcholine, which is abundant in the cell membrane.|$|R
40|$|Two new {{individuals}} with alpha-NAGA deficiency are presented. The index patient, 3 years old, has congenital cataract, slight motor retardation and secondary demyelinisation. Screening of his sibs revealed an alpha-NAGA deficiency in his 7 -year-old healthy brother {{who had no}} clinical or neurological symptoms. Both sibs are homozygous for the E 325 K mutation, the same genotype that {{was found in the}} most severe form of alpha-NAGA deficiency presenting as <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy.</b> Thus, at the age of 7 years the same genotype of alpha-NAGA may present as a 'non-disease' (present healthy case) and can be associated with the vegetative state (the first two patients described with alpha-NAGA deficiency). The clinical heterogeneity among the 11 known {{individuals with}} alpha-NAGA deficiency is extreme, with a 'non-disease' (two cases) and <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (two cases) at the opposite sides of the clinical spectrum. The broad spectrum is completed by a very heterogeneous group of patients with various degrees of epilepsy/behavioural difficulties/psychomotor retardation (four patients) and a mild phenotype in adults without overt neurological manifestations who have angiokeratoma and clear vacuolisation in various cell types (three cases). These observations are difficult to reconcile with a straightforward genotype-phenotype correlation and suggest that factors or genes other than alpha-NAGA contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of the 11 patients with alpha-NAGA deficienc...|$|R
40|$|Neurodegeneration {{with brain}} iron {{accumulation}} (NBIA) describes {{a group of}} progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterised by high brain iron {{and the presence of}} axonal spheroids, usually limited to the central nervous system.

40|$|A newly {{recognized}} neurologic {{disorder of}} cats is described. It is characterized clinically by an abnormal coat color {{and development of}} progressive ataxia during infancy. Breeding experiments indicate that the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Pathologically, neurologic lesions closely resemble those described in <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> of children. The most prominent microscopic alterations were marked ballooning of nerve cell processes within specific regions of the brain stem and atrophy of the cerebellar vermis. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that dystrophic axons contained electron-dense flocculent material, multilaminated membrane-bound osmiophilic bodies and filaments. Examination of the inner ears revealed depletion of neurons in the spiral ganglia and homogeneous eosinophilic bodies within the spiral ganglia, nerve fiber tracts and organ of Corti. The concept that the disease represents an inborn error of metabolism was supported by finding axonal dystrophy in neonates prior to development of cerebellar atrophy or recognition of clinical symptoms...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the phospholipase A 2 group 6 (Pla 2 G 6) gene.

Gait disturbance, limb spasticity, cerebellar signs, and optic atrophy are other common features associated with INAD. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can sometimes contribute towards the diagnosis, the confirmation of INAD is by Pla 2 G 6 gene analysis.

40|$|<b>Infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents {{within the first}} 2 years of life and culminates in death by age 10 years. Affected individuals from two unrelated Bedouin Israeli kindreds were studied. Brain imaging demonstrated diffuse cerebellar atrophy and abnormal iron deposition in the medial and lateral globus pallidum. Progressive white-matter disease and reduction of the N-acetyl aspartate : chromium ratio were evident on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, suggesting loss of myelination. The clinical and radiological diagnosis of INAD was verified by sural nerve biopsy. The disease gene was mapped to a 1. 17 -Mb locus on chromosome 22 q 13. 1 (LOD score 4. 7 at recombination fraction 0 for SNP rs 139897), and an underlying mutation common to both affected families was identified in PLA 2 G 6, the gene encoding phospholipase A 2 group VI (cytosolic, calcium-independent).

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} intrathecal baclofen {{in a group of}} spastic children using electrophysiological procedures described in adults. Methods: Six children (aged 1 - 14 years) with severe spasticity of various aetiologies underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation, H reflex and flexor reflex studies before and after intrathecal injection of baclofen. Ashworth scale was used for clinical evaluation of spasticity. Results: Motor evoked potentials, present in two patients before baclofen, were preserved after injection. Before baclofen, H reflex was present in 5 patients (Hmax/Mmax from 0. 23 to 0. 84) and absent in one who had <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy.</b> After baclofen, it was absent in 4 patients and markedly reduced in one. Surface of flexor reflex significantly decreased after baclofen (P = 0. 01), while threshold significantly increased (P = 0. 003). Conclusions: In spastic children, the action of baclofen on spinal pathways may be quantified by the same electrophysiological procedures as in adults.

40|$|Objective: Mutations in {{the gene}} {{encoding}} phospholipase A 2 group VI (PLA 2 G 6) {{are associated with}} two childhood neurologic disorders: <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD) and idiopathic neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). INAD is a severe progressive psychomo-tor disorder in which axonal spheroids are found in brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. High globus pallidus iron is an inconsistent feature of INAD; however, it is a diagnostic criterion of NBIA, which describes a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that share this hallmark feature. We sought to delineate the clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and genetic features of disease resulting from defective phospholipase A 2. Methods: We identified 56 patients clinically diagnosed with INAD and 23 with idiopathic NBIA and screened their DNA for PLA 2 G 6 mutations. Results: Eighty percent of patients with INAD had mutations in PLA 2 G 6, whereas mutations were found in only 20 % of those with idiopathic NBIA. All patients with two null mutations had a more severe phenotype. On MRI, nearly all mutation-positive patients had cerebellar atrophy, and half showed brain iron accumulation.

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{disorders}} {{with brain}} iron accumulation (NBIA) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of {{conditions in which}} there is neurodegeneration accompanied by elevated levels of brain iron. NBIA is frequently of genetic etiology, but may be secondary to an acquired systemic or neurological disease. Mutations in the ferritin light chain cause an adult-onset autosomal-dominant choreiform movement disorder termed neuroferritinopathy. Homozygous mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene cause aceruloplasminemia, which is characterized by the triad of diabetes, retinopathy, and a neurological disorder in mid adulthood. Mutations in pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK 2) and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 G 6) cause recessive, childhood-onset extrapyramidal disorders termed pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and <b>infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD), respectively. There is considerable phenotypic overlap between these conditions. The most useful investigation in suspected NBIA is brain magnetic resonance imaging, which can identify pathological iron deposition and distinguish between genotypes. Iron depletion therapy has been demonstrated to be successful in aceruloplasminemia, but not neuroferritinopathy, PKAN, or INAD. The presentation of NBIA overlaps with the more common adult movement disorders and pediatric neurometabolic conditions, and a high index of suspicion is required to make a correct diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{channels}} are crucial components of cellular excitability and {{are involved in}} many neurological diseases. This review focuses on the sodium leak, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) -activated NALCN channel that is predominantly expressed in neurons where it regulates the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. NALCN {{is part of a}} complex that includes not only GPCRs, but also UNC- 79, UNC- 80, NLF- 1 and src family of Tyrosine kinases (SFKs). There is growing evidence that the NALCN channelosome critically regulates its ion conduction. Both in mammals and invertebrates, animal models revealed an involvement in many processes such as locomotor behaviors, sensitivity to volatile anesthetics, and respiratory rhythms. There is also evidence that alteration in this NALCN channelosome can cause a wide variety of diseases. Indeed, mutations in the NALCN gene were identified in <b>Infantile</b> Neuroaxonal <b>Dystrophy</b> (INAD) patients, as well as in patients with an Autosomal Recessive Syndrome with severe hypotonia, speech impairment, and cognitive delay. Deletions in NALCN gene were also reported in diseases such as 13 q syndrome.

40|$|<b>Infantile</b> neuroaxonal <b>dystrophy</b> (INAD) is a progressive, {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disease characterized by axonal dystrophy, abnormal iron deposition and cerebellar atrophy. This disease was recently mapped to PLA 2 G 6, which encodes group VI Ca 2 +-independent phospholipase A 2 (iPLA 2 or iPLA 2 b). Here {{we show that}} genetic ablation of PLA 2 G 6 in mice (iPLA 2 b-/-) leads {{to the development of}} cerebellar atrophy by the age of 13 months. Atrophied cerebella exhibited significant loss of Purkinje cells, as well as reactive astrogliosis, the activation of microglial cells, and the pronounced upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b). Moreover, glial cell activation and the elevation in TNF-a and IL- 1 b expression occurred before apparent cerebellar atrophy. Our findings indicate that the absence of PLA 2 G 6 causes neuroinflammation and Purkinje cell loss and ultimately leads to cerebellar atrophy. Our study suggests that iPLA 2 b-/- mice are a valuable model for cerebellar atrophy in INAD and that early antiinflammatory therapy may help slow the progression of cerebellar atrophy in this deadly neurodegenerative disease...|$|R
