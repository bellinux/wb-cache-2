An efficient recursive algorithm has been developed for calculating the flow level performance of elastic traffic under a bandwidth sharing scheme called balanced fairness (BF). The notion of BF has been extended and applied to the flow throughput estimation in ad hoc networks; also other applications of BF are being explored. Scheduling mechanisms, in general, and adaptive scheduling mechanism with delay bounds, in particular, were studied. A simple adaptive and distributed load balancing mechanism has been suggested and analyzed. In this system, traffic is gradually redistributed based on measured link loads, leading to a nearly optimal performance. Analytical results have been obtained on the performance of MAC protocols in ring networks employing optical burst switching. For traffic matrix estimation, the Gravey-Vaton method has been analyzed in detail in the case of Gaussian traffic variations.

The project developed three case studies to investigate the Considerate Design concept and model new production processes incorporating advanced technologies. The ‘Knit to Fit’ comparative case study combined the expertise of knitwear design and technology (Sandy Black) and stretch pattern profiling (Penelope Watkins) and utilised body scan data interpreted within an industrial knitting context. Considerate Design makes new relationships between a) sustainability, b) personalisation of fashion and c) costs of design and production of personalised items.

In this study, we investigate the relative performance of various machine learning methods such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Logistic Model Tree and Random Forests for predicting incident diabetes using medical records of cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, we apply different techniques to uncover potential predictors of diabetes. This <b>FIT</b> <b>project</b> study used data of 32, 555 patients who are free of any known coronary artery disease or heart failure who underwent clinician-referred exercise treadmill stress testing at Henry Ford Health Systems between 1991 and 2009 and had a complete 5 -year follow-up. At the completion of the fifth year, 5, 099 of those patients have developed diabetes. The dataset contained 62 attributes classified into four categories: demographic characteristics, disease history, medication use history, and stress test vital signs. We developed an Ensembling-based predictive model using 13 attributes that were selected based on their clinical importance, Multiple Linear Regression, and Information Gain Ranking methods. The negative effect of the imbalance class of the constructed model was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The overall performance of the predictive model classifier was improved by the Ensemble machine learning approach using the Vote method with three Decision Trees (Naïve Bayes Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Model Tree) and achieved high accuracy of prediction (AUC = 0. 92).

40|$|Construction of the LEeds Freight Transport Model (LEFT) {{series was}} begun {{as part of}} the ITeLS project, {{although}} other funding has helped and will take forward its development. The initial version, now referred to by us as LEFT 1, was a simple mode split model intended to give a rough idea of the magnitudes of the effects of various scenarios, possibly as a way of filtering which scenarios might be investigated using more detailed models. Besides being limited to mode split, LEFT 1 suffered from a range of minor defects and deficiencies which led to its abandonment in favour of its successor, LEFT 2. LEFT 2 was constructed in 2004 {{as part of the}} Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council LINK <b>FIT</b> <b>project,</b> ITeLS, funded by the Department for Transport (DfT). We acknowledge here the help and useful comments from many persons associated with that project. Besides mode split effects, LEFT 2 allows scenarios to alter the total size of the (road plus rail) market. Its purpose is to provide instantaneous ballpark estimates of road and rail freight tonne kilometres under various ‘scenarios’. At its base is a desire that the scenarios should not affect the sum of tonnes moved by both road and rail modes. This was because we felt that our scenarios should be viewed as having a neutral macroeconomic effect. For example, if taxes on lorry usage were increased, we would expect other taxes to be lower than otherwise (or government spending to increase) so that total demand in the economy would not change. Consumers might buy their goods from closer sources than hitherto, but they would not be expected to consume less in total. For example, if prices of some goods rose slightly due to higher road user charges, the consumer would have more to spend due to offsetting reduced income tax (or whatever) and much the same total quantity would be bought. Similarly, industrialists as a whole might find input prices increasing slightly, but will find they can charge slightly more for their outputs. In summary, LEFT 2 provides an instantaneous estimate of the effect of macroeconomically neutral scenarios on mode split (road, trainload and wagonload), average length of haul and total market size. LEFT 2 does not load the traffic onto vehicles, and so does not produce magnitudes of HGV vehicle kilometres, for instance. Consequently it does not produce estimates of emissions or other nuisances. It is hoped that a future version of LEFT can incorporate these elements and revisit the other matters that have had to be ‘parked’ for the present. LEFT 2 gives a quick idea of the magnitudes of the effects of any policies that might be considered and should help to provide a first sift where many policies are being considered. This report describes the basic LEFT Methodology in Section 2. Emphasis is given to that methodology actually embodied in LEFT 2, but there is also some discussion of rejected 4 methodologies, and some that have had to be held over for later versions of LEFT. Section 3 presents additional data that was needed by the LEFT 2 model. Section 4 describes the scenarios chosen for testing in the ITeLS project, while section 5 gives the first results from using the LEFT 2 model, for those scenarios...|$|E
