500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} to feature battling wizards, {{who would have}} had creatures (originally named Titans) to raise, and be powered by belief. A <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> the ability to turn living beings into Titans. Healey's early visualisation featured the Horned Reaper from Dungeon Keeper representing Titans. The team wanted the player {{to see the world}} from the same perspective as possessing a creature in Dungeon Keeper (it was originally intended for the player {{to be able to take}} control of creatures in the first-person). Molyneux wanted [...] "limitless flexibility" [...] and the ability to zoom out to see the world from the sky. It was decided to make the player a god when it was realised that humans could not wield the powers that were being implemented. The spells that were to be cast became miracles, and the wizards' supporters became worshippers. The mechanic of turning living beings into Titans was dropped because of problems with balance, with certain Titans having advantages over others. After the name Titans was dropped, others were considered, including Sards, Demes, Ikons, Psiphs, and Amalians. None had unanimous support, so they ended up being called 'creatures'. Elements of the Wizard theme, such as Temples resembling a wizard's tower, remain in the final game. Temples were originally named Citadels and some sported a medieval, fairy-tale look.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} Oxford Movement was the defence of the Church of England as a divinely-founded institution, {{of the doctrine of}} apostolic succession and of the Book of Common Prayer as a [...] "rule of faith". The <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> that Anglicanism was not a Protestant denomination but a branch of the historic Catholic Church, along with the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches. It was argued that Anglicanism had preserved the historical apostolic succession of priests and bishops and thus the Catholic sacraments. These ideas were promoted in a series of ninety [...] "Tracts for the Times".|$|E

The Pickwick label agreed to undertake Crawford's idea and the first volume was issued in mid-1968, containing versions of twelve hits including [...] "Young Girl", [...] "Jennifer Eccles", [...] "Do You Know The Way To San Jose" [...] and [...] "I Can't Let Maggie Go".

50|$|Up {{to eight}} stories high, the {{building}} occupies {{an entire city}} block. The massively simplified facade of the bank clearly owes something to classicism. Wagner's <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to celebrate modern materials by developing new forms. The entire facade is covered with square marble plates. These {{are attached to the}} main brick structure with mortar and ornamented with iron bolts with aluminum caps, which themselves form a pattern. The building's harmonious synthesis between form and functionality was highly acclaimed by critics. The metal rivets do not obstruct the facade but resemble decorative elements. The use of marble also makes the maintenance and cleaning of the facade very easy and inexpensive, another important functional element in Wagner's design. The architect kept the design very minimalistic and simple; his aim was to convey the sense of a strong, impenetrable bank in which customers would know their money was safe.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Zubrin (born April 9, 1952) is an American {{aerospace}} engineer and author, {{best known for}} his advocacy of the manned exploration of Mars. He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey. A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their [...] "design reference mission". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Project Apollo-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|Instead {{of meeting}} the Blitzkrieg head-on, Boyd {{suggested}} {{what he called the}} [...] "counter-blitz", where small groups of equally mobile forces would pick away at the lines of thrust and then {{move on to the next}} in a series of hit-and-run attacks. There was no necessity to retain any sort of front line, and the attacks deliberately moved from point to point in order to avoid being bogged down or getting trapped. The idea was not to force the blitz to lose its ability to maneuver, but instead upset its ability to understand where it should be maneuvering to—the attacker would have no idea which of these counteroffensives represented a real threat, and would have to respond to all of them. The <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to [...] "Smash blitz offensive by inconspicuously using fast-tempo/fluidity-of-action and cohesion of counter-blitz combat teams as basis for shifting of forces and quick focus of air and ground effort to throttle momentum, shatter cohesion, and envelop blitz in order to destroy adversary's capacity to resist." [...] The battle was less about the weapons than it was about the ability to command them; it was believed that the US's devolved command structure would be able to react to changes on the battlefield more quickly than their Soviet counterparts, overwhelming the Soviets ability to maintain cohesion as their higher-echelon commanders became overwhelmed with reports from so many small actions.|$|E

30|$|The use of {{a robust}} {{invariant}} set {{in order to develop}} a set-theoretic attack detector was first introduced in [15], where the load frequency control loop of a single control area was studied. The <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to trigger an alarm whenever the state vector exits the invariant set. It was shown that small persistent bias injected signals corrupting the frequency sensor measurements can pass undetected. Explicit boundary values of the bias injected signal that ensure a stealthy attack were derived in [16]. However, these bounds are consistently small and therefore impractical from an adversarial point of view, since realistic attack scenarios involve larger values of the attack signal.|$|E
30|$|To obtain higher thermal conductivity, {{numerous}} {{theoretical and}} {{experimental studies of}} the effective thermal conductivity of solid-particle suspensions have been conducted dated back to the classic work of Maxwell [1]. The <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to exploit the very high thermal conductivity of solid particles, which can be hundreds and even thousands of times {{greater than that of}} the conventional heat transfer fluids such as ethylene glycol and water, but most of these studies were confined to suspensions of millimeter- and micrometer-sized particles [2, 3]. Although such suspensions show higher thermal conductivity, they suffer from stability problems. In particular, particles tend to settle down very quickly and thereby causing severe clogging [4].|$|E
