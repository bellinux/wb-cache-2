Having {{instructed}} Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do, I clambered into the fore-rigging a few feet. The boat was now very close, and I could make out plainly that it was lying head to wind and sea and dragging on its mast and sail, which had been thrown overboard and made to serve as a sea-anchor. The three men were bailing. Each rolling mountain whelmed them from view, and I would wait with sickening anxiety, fearing that they would never appear again. Then, and with black suddenness, the boat would shoot clear through the foaming crest, bow pointed to the sky, and the whole length of her bottom showing, wet and dark, till she seemed on end.

She was described in the Hull Daily Mail of 9 April 1891 as being constructed of iron for the railway company’s continental passenger and cargo traffic, her dimensions being as follow: Length, 240 feet; breadth, 32 feet; depth 16 feet, and she is arranged with poop- for first-class passengers, long bridge, with officers’ quarters under (forming also shelter for light deck cargo), and top-gallant forecastle for crew. The ship is built to Lloyds’ 100 A1 class, with additions to the scantlings in various parts to meet the requirements of the traffic. The first-class accommodation includes staterooms and beds for 36 passengers, with dining-saloon, smokeroom, ladies’-room, and conveniences, worked out in polished and hard woods, and finished in a tasteful manner. Complete fittings are also provided for 100 emigrants in the forward ‘tween decks. The boats and their outfit, with life-belts, &c., will be in accordance with the provisions of the Life-Saving Applicances Act of 1888, which recently came into force. Steam winches and cranes of new and powerful description are fitted, together with all necessary booms and derricks for the rapid working of cargo. Steam steering gear my essrs Amos and Smith is fitted amidships and hand screw gear aft. The cellular bottom of the ship is utilized for water-ballast, and by more complete sub-division than usual this will enable the ship to be trimmed very readily. The vessel will be schooner rigged, with two pole masts and fore and aft canvas.

40|$|Objective: To study {{image quality}} of MRI scanner using the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom. Material and methods: Image quality of 1. 5  T MRI scanner {{was tested using}} ACR phantom. A {{standard}} head coil with standard restraints was used to fix the phantom head position. The phantom included seven modules for measuring MRI scanner image quality. MRI images for each module were analyzed. Results: For the Geometric accuracy test the <b>inside</b> <b>length</b> of the phantom was 146  mm and the inside diameter was 189. 4  mm. For the High-contrast spatial resolution, individual small bright spots on the image were three pairs of hole arrays and were distinguishable. For the slice thickness test, the top signal ramp length was 54. 4  mm and bottom signal ramp length was 54. 8  mm so the slice thickness was 5. 46  mm. For the slice position accuracy, the bar length differences of intensity uniformity a value, called percent integral uniformity (PIU), was 96. 15 %. For the percent-signal ghosting, ghosting ratio was 0. 0002. For the low contrast object detectability, the sum of numbers of complete spokes scored was 30 spokes. Conclusions: Image quality tests were very important in acceptance of any MRI scanner after installation and during maintenance.

The ribs are placed internally on the outermost bend surface. The renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon turbulence model was used to solve the momentum and energy equations inside the bend (turn) part {{as well in the}} supply and return straight parts of the U-duct. For the ribbed surface three different rib configurations were simulated, namely (a) single rib at three different rib positions, i. e., inlet, middle and outlet, (b) two ribs for three different configurations, i. e., at the inlet and middle, at the middle and outlet {{as well as at the}} inlet and outlet, and (c) three ribs.

40|$|Abstract Background Wearing {{shoes of}} {{insufficient}} length during childhood {{has often been}} cited as leading to deformities of the foot, particularly {{to the development of}} hallux valgus disorders. Until now, these assumptions have not been confirmed through scientific research. This study aims to investigate whether this association can be statistically proven, and if children who wear shoes of insufficient length actually do have a higher risk of a more pronounced lateral deviation of the hallux. Methods 858 pre-school children were included in the study. The study sample was stratified by sex, urban/rural areas and Austrian province. The hallux angle and the length of the feet were recorded. The <b>inside</b> <b>length</b> of the children's footwear (indoor shoes worn in pre-school and outdoor shoes) were assessed. Personal data and different anthropometric measurements were taken. The risk of hallux valgus deviation was statistically tested by a stepwise logistic regression analysis and the relative risk (odds ratio) for a hallux angle ≥ 4 degrees was calculated. Results Exact examinations of the hallux angle could be conducted on a total of 1, 579 individual feet. Only 23. 9 % out of 1, 579 feet presented a straight position of the great toe. The others were characterized by lateral deviations (valgus position) at different degrees, equalling 10 degrees or greater in 14. 2 % of the children's feet. 88. 8 % of 808 children examined wore indoor footwear that was of insufficient length, and 69. 4 % of 812 children wore outdoor shoes that were too short. A significant relationship was observed between the lengthwise fit of the shoes and the hallux angle: the shorter the shoe, the higher the value of the hallux angle. The relative risk (odds ratio) of a lateral hallux deviation of ≥ 4 degrees in children wearing shoes of insufficient length was significantly increased. Conclusions There is a significant relationship between the hallux angle in children and footwear that is too short in length. The fact {{that the majority of the}} children examined were wearing shoes of insufficient length makes the issue particularly significant. Our results emphasize the importance of ensuring that children's footwear fits properly. </p...|$|E

Such duct geometries {{can be found in}} many engineering applications where cooling air extracts heat from hot internal walls of the duct, e. g., passage cooling inside gas turbine blades. Both friction factors and convective heat transfer coefficients were measured inside a U-duct for three different cases, namely (a) the smooth straight part, (b) the smooth bend (turn) part, and (c) a rough (ribbed) bend (turn) part. The details of the duct geometry were as follows: the cross section area of the straight part was 50 x 50 mm(2), the <b>inside</b> <b>length</b> of the bend part 240 mm, the cross section area of the rib was 5 x 5 mm(2) and the rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, e/D-h, was 0. 1. The Reynolds number was varied from 8, 000 to 20, 000. The test rig has been built {{in such a way that}} various experimental setups can be handled as the bend (turn) part of the U-duct can easily be removed and the rib configuration can be changed. Both the U-duct and the rib were made from plexiglass material to allow optical access for measuring the surface temperature by using a high-resolution measurement technique based on narrow band thermochromic liquid crystals (TLC R 35 C 5 W) and a CCD camera placed facing the bend (turn) part of the U-duct. The calibration of the TLC is based on the hue-based color decomposition system using an in-house designed calibration box. The rib was placed transversely to the direction of the main flow at the outer wall of the bend (turn) part where the wall was heated by an electrical heater. The friction factor ratio and the heat transfer enhancement ratio for case (c) at a Reynolds number of 20, 000 were 48. 75 and 2. 66, respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} relate the {{measured}} fringe shift of an interferometer to density, the relation between density rho and refractive index n must be known. For gases where the refractive index is close to unity, this relation between density and refractive index is very closely approximated by (n - 1) = K rho where K is the specific refractivity, or the Gladstone-Dale constant. The specific refractivity, which is weakly dependent on wavelength and temperature, is readily available {{for a number of}} common test gases such as N 2 and air. For more unique test gases such as CF 4 and C 2 F 6 for which refractive index data at optical wavelengths is not readily available, the constants can be estimated from the atomic refractivities of carbon and fluorine. In order to verify this estimation, a two-beam interferometer was used to experimentally determine the specific refractivities of CF 4 and C 2 F 6. This data was required for holographic interferometric measurements made at the Langley Hypersonic CF 4 Tunnel. A Twyman-Green interferometer with a He-Ne laser light source of vacuum wavelength lambda equal to 633 nm was used to measure the constants. One beam of the two-beam interferometer passed through an optical cell of known <b>inside</b> <b>length</b> l which could be evacuated and slowly filled with the test gas to a density of 7. 2 kg/cu m for CF 4 or 5. 7 kg/cu m for C 2 F 6. If the refractive index (and hence density) is constant along the optical path through the cell, the fringe shift M and density change Delta rho are related M = 2 Kl Delta rho/lambda for the double pass interferometer. Thus K can be determined by measuring the fringe shift as the density is changed. The output of a photodiode used to detect the fringe shift was recorded on a strip chart recorder. The rate of pressure increase of the test gas in the cell was controlled such that the fringes shifted at a rate of 0. 5 to 1 fringe per sec. The pressure in the test cell was measured with a high accuracy quartz crystal pressure transducer and recorded approximately every 20 fringe peaks. The temperature of the cell was measured with a thermocouple and recorded at the start, midpoint, and end of each test...|$|E
