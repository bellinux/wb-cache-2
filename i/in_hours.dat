5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed.

An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{nonlinear}} approach {{to solve the}} short-term hydro scheduling problem under deregu-lation, considering head-dependency. The actual size of hydro sys-tems, the continuous reservoir dynamics and constraints, the hy-draulic coupling of cascaded hydro systems, and the complexity associated with head-sensitive hydroelectric power generation still pose a real challenge to the modelers. These concerns are all ac-counted for in our approach. Results from a case study based {{on one of the}} main Portuguese cascaded hydro systems are presented, showing that the proposed nonlinear approach is proficient.

5|$|The Republic of Georgia {{declared}} its independence in early 1991 as the Soviet Union {{began to fall}} apart. Amidst this backdrop, a war between Georgia and separatists left parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast under the de facto control of Russian-backed but internationally unrecognised separatists. Following the war, a joint peacekeeping force of Georgian, Russian, and Ossetian troops was stationed in the territory. Meanwhile, a similar stalemate developed {{in the region of}} Abkhazia, where Abkhaz separatists had waged their own war in 1992–1993. Following Vladimir Putin's rise to power in Russia in 2000 and a pro-Western change of power in Georgia in 2003, relations between Russia and Georgia began to deteriorate, reaching a full diplomatic crisis by April 2008. By 1 August 2008, Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages, with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the region. Artillery attacks by pro-Russian separatists broke a 1992 ceasefire agreement. To put an end to these attacks and restore order, the Georgian Army was sent to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August.

25|$|Because the M2 tidal {{constituent}} dominates in most locations, {{the stage}} or {{phase of a}} tide, denoted by the time <b>in</b> <b>hours</b> after high water, is a useful concept. Tidal stage is also measured in degrees, with 360° per tidal cycle. Lines of constant tidal phase are called cotidal lines, which are analogous to contour lines of constant altitude on topographical maps. High water is reached simultaneously along the cotidal lines extending from the coast out into the ocean, and cotidal lines (and hence tidal phases) advance along the coast. Semi-diurnal and long phase constituents are measured from high water, diurnal from maximum flood tide. This and the discussion that follows is precisely true only for a single tidal constituent.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Severe Acute Liver Failure (ALF) is a {{life-threatening}} clinical syndrome characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, loss of hepatic architecture, and impairment of liver functions. One {{of the main}} causes of ALF is hepatotoxicity from chemical agents, which damage hepatocytes and result in increase of reactive oxygen species. The vitamin E isoform is {{the one with the}} strongest biological antioxidant activity. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the antioxidant effect of vitamin E in this ALF model. METHODS We used 56 rats (mean weight of 300 g) divided into eight groups, four groups assessed at 24 hours and 4 assessed at 48 hours after induction: control group (CO); Vitamin E (Vit. E); Thioacetamide (TAA) and Thioacetamide + Vitamina E (TAA+Vit. E). Rats were submitted to injections of thioacetamide (400 mg/kg i. p.) at baseline and 8 hours later. Vitamin E (100 mg/kg ip) was administered 30 minutes after the second dose of thioacetamide. The 48 -hour group rats received two additional doses of vitamin E (24 h and 36 h). At 24 h or 48 hours after the administration of the first dose of TAA, rats were weighed and anesthetized and their blood sampled for evaluation of liver integrity through enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Liver tissue was sampled for assessment of lipid peroxidation (LPO) by the technique TBARS, antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GPx and GST activity, levels of the NO 2 /NO 3 and histology by H&E in two times. The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and statistically analyzed by ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls, with P < 0. 05 considered as significant. RESULTS After treatment with vitamin E, we observed a reduction in liver enzymes AST (U/L) (101. 32 ± 19. 45 <b>in</b> 24 <b>hours</b> and 97. 85 ± 29. 65 <b>in</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> related to the TAA group (469. 56 ± 0. 69 <b>in</b> 24 <b>hours</b> and 598. 23 ± 55. 45 <b>in</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> and ALT (U/L) (76. 59 ± 8. 56 <b>in</b> 24 <b>hours</b> and 68. 47 ± 6. 49 <b>in</b> 48 <b>hours)</b> compared to the TAA group (312. 21 ± 10. 23 <b>in</b> 24 <b>hours</b> and 359. 15 ± 17. 58 <b>in</b> 48 <b>hours).</b> There was a reduction of LPO (nmol/mg Prot) in the TAA+Vit.
