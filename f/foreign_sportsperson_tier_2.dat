40|$|The third {{variable}} (V 3) loop and the CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs) of the HIV- 1 envelope are frequently targeted by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in infected individuals. In chronic infection, HIV- 1 escape mutants repopulate the plasma, and V 3 and CD 4 bs nAbs emerge that can neutralize heterologous tier 1 easy-to-neutralize but not <b>tier</b> <b>2</b> difficult-to-neutralize HIV- 1 isolates. However, neutralization sensitivity of autologous plasma viruses {{to this type}} of nAb response has not been studied. We describe the development and evolution in vivo of antibodies distinguished by their target specificity for V 3 and CD 4 bs epitopes on autologous <b>tier</b> <b>2</b> viruses but not on heterologous <b>tier</b> <b>2</b> viruses. A surprisingly high fraction of autologous circulating viruses was sensitive to these antibodies. These findings demonstrate a role for V 3 and CD 4 bs antibodies in constraining the native envelope trimer in vivo to a neutralization-resistant phenotype, explaining why HIV- 1 transmission generally occurs by <b>tier</b> <b>2</b> neutralization-resistant viruses...|$|R
