5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by {{a change in the}} width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E

25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing.

25|$|International NGOs (INGOs) {{have found}} {{operating}} in Iraq highly dangerous to their staff, as between March 2003 and March 2008 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted. This {{has led to}} INGOs to either completely unwind their operations, or else go undercover {{and try to make}} their activities as low profile as possible. INGOs are not treated as neutral parties by large sections of the population due to their beginning operations alongside the invasion and receiving security and funding from the multinational force and the governments that it consists of. The security situation has also led to much of the management of aid programmes to take place abroad, thus lowering the effectiveness of the programmes and creating a fragmented response. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have discussed the importance of using local organisations and also understanding the violence not a single insurmountable challenge, but understanding various acts of violence more individually, sharing the knowledge between agencies and responding more appropriately - the formation of the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> this direction.|$|E

He stated that though the character <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the right direction, too many women view {{her as a}} [...] "crudely realised male fantasy figure". Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed {{to the lack of}} prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a [...] "breath of fresh air". However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Croft is viewed as [...] "idealized" [...] with an [...] "unattainable body", the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} fair reviews. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist for The Star-Ledger, said [...] "Boys' Club" [...] was funnier that previous episode and included scenes with good physical comedy involving Leslie, particularly when she spilled the beer bottles; he also praised Andy's [...] "naked crutch chase". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode {{gave a little}} more insight into Leslie's [...] "aspirations about {{wanting to be a}} woman who succeeds in government, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the right direction", but Fowler said her constant mistakes and wrong decisions bog down the story. Fowler said {{the best part of the}} episode was Andy's subplot, particularly the scene in which he hops down the street naked on his crutches. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, and said the Amy Poehler character needs to be more fully formed in future episodes. Phipps said most of the show's laughs came from supporting characters Andy, Tom and Ron; he also particularly praised Ron's shutdown of Leslie's hearing and his monologues of the ideal government: [...] "One guy, who sits in a small room at a desk. And the only thing he’s allowed to decide is who to nuke." [...] Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly liked that the episode included a moral crisis of sorts for Leslie, who he described as [...] "a realized character instead of a caricature".|$|E
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is an orthophosphate mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with zinc, zinc/amalgam, electrolysis or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|E
500|$|Another trait {{unique to}} {{domestic}} sheep {{as compared to}} wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even {{among members of the}} same flock, so wool classing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the commercial processing of the fibre.Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding. Ewes typically weigh between , and rams between [...] When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. This means that the dental formula for sheep is either [...] or [...] There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.|$|E

500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars.
