50|$|The {{beginnings}} of modern wood engraving techniques {{developed at the}} end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the works of Englishman Thomas Bewick. Bewick generally engraved harder woods, such as boxwood, rather than the woods used in woodcuts, and he engraved the ends of blocks instead of the side. Finding a woodcutting knife not suitable for working against the grain in harder woods, Bewick used a burin (or graver), an <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> with a V-shaped cutting tip. From the beginning of the nineteenth century Bewick's techniques gradually came into wider use, especially in Britain and the United States.|$|E

50|$|The Bidzar petroglyphs {{are located}} near Bidzar village, on the Maroua-Garoua road toward Guider. An area of marble {{flagstone}} extending around the village circa 2.5 km {{from north to}} south, and 1 km {{from east to west}} displays around 500 engraved figures in total. The marble is of a calcareous type called cipolin; it has an ideal composition for engraving, having low resistance to friction and breaking easily. Figures were engraved into the marble using a hammer and an <b>engraving</b> <b>tool.</b> The figures are mostly geometrical, consisting of groups of circles, some isolated and some in groups. It has been speculated that the engraving represent concepts or stories from myths, or elaborate a cosmogeny.|$|E
5000|$|Former Director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor {{says of the}} {{manufacturing}} process: If you look closely, {{you can see that}} this little sculpture is the result, in fact, of four separate stone technologies. First, the tip of the tusk was severed with a chopping tool; then the contours of the animals were whittled with a stone knife and scraper. Then the whole thing was polished using a powdered iron oxide mixed with water, probably buffed up with a chamois leather. And finally the markings on the bodies and the details of the eyes were carefully incised with a stone <b>engraving</b> <b>tool.</b> In execution as well as in conception, this is a very complex work of art. And {{it seems to me that}} it has all the qualities of precise observation and interpretation that you'd look for in any great artist.|$|E
50|$|Armor etching, using strong mineral acids, was not {{developed}} until the fifteenth century. Etchants mixed from salt, charcoal, and vinegar {{were applied to}} plate armor that had been painted with a maskant of linseed-oil paint. The etchant would bite into the unprotected areas, causing the painted areas to be raised into relief. Etching in this manner allowed armor to be decorated as if with precise engraving, but without the existence of raised burrs; it also prevented the necessity of the armor being softer than an <b>engraving</b> <b>tool.</b> Late in the seventeenth century, etching became used to produce the graduations on measuring instruments; the thinness of lines that etching could produce allowed {{for the production of}} more precise and accurate instruments than were possible before. Not long after, it became used to etch trajectory information plates for cannon and artillery operators; paper would rarely survive the rigors of combat, but an etched plate could be quite durable. Often such information (normally ranging marks) was etched onto equipment such as stiletto daggers or shovels.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in 1955 in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. He had no formal {{training}} as an artist, working as a road-sweeper, rubbish collector, postman, and a factory worker. An interest in landscape painting led him to buy a set of wood <b>engraving</b> <b>tools</b> in 1982, and to teach himself how to use them. His first commercial book, An Alphabet of Animals, published in 1990 won that year's Graphics Prize at the Bologna International Children's Book Fair.

The {{steadiness}} of nerve {{that would be required}} could come only {{as the result of a}} conditioning process stricter than that of the highly trained athlete. Tobacco, coffee and like indulgences were out of the question. Fresh air and exercise were necessary. Complete rest for the eyes had to be assured. When he felt himself 'fit' Lundberg started the next stage, which was the manufacture of a special <b>engraving</b> <b>tool,</b> which had to be of a degree of fineness beyond that attempted by the makers of the most minute instruments. It took six months to perfect the graver. The point had to be of steel and the steel had to be specially tempered so that it would hold an unprecedentedly fine point that would cut and that would not be brittle. The process by which he tempered his steel is one of Lundberg's secrets. When he finished he had a point so fine that it was hardly visible to the naked eye, and yet had sufficient tensile strength to last through the whole long-drawn, nerve-straining process." ...|$|E

Hankins, a lens grinder, had been present during the entire time Lundberg worked on the pin. He told of the grueling conditions Lundberg imposed upon himself to complete the work. Lundberg worked from a barber's chair, strapping his hands to an iron bar to keep them from shaking. He also bound his wrists tightly with leather straps, because the rhythm of his pulse caused the <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> to skip. Lundberg could only work on the pin in the evenings, when the rumbling trolley cars that passed by his shop had stopped running for the day. He destroyed more than two hundred pins in his attempt to create one perfect engraving." ...|$|E
5000|$|Punchcutting: If the glyph design {{includes}} {{enclosed spaces}} (counters) then a counterpunch is made. The counter shapes are transferred in relief (cameo) onto {{the end of}} a rectangular bar of mild steel using a specialized <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> called a graver. The finished counterpunch is hardened by heating and quenching (tempering), or exposure to a cyanide solution (case hardening). The counterpunch is then struck against {{the end of a}} similar rectangular steel bar—the letterpunch—to impress the counter shapes as recessed spaces (intaglio). The outer profile of the glyph is completed by scraping away with a graver the material outside the counter spaces, leaving only the stroke or lines of the glyph. Progress toward the finished design is checked by successive smoke proofs; temporary prints made from a thin coating of carbon deposited on the punch surface by a candle flame. The finished letter punch is finally hardened to withstand the rigors of reproduction by striking. One counterpunch and one letterpunch are produced for every letter or glyph making up a complete font.|$|E

5000|$|Cros {{is perhaps}} most famous {{as the man who}} almost, but not quite, invented the phonograph. As far as is known, no one before him had thought of a {{practical}} way to reproduce sound from a recording of airborne sound waves. He gave the Greek name 'Paleophone' ('voix du passé', tr. 'voice of the past') to his invention. On April 30, 1877 he submitted a sealed envelope containing a letter to the Academy of Sciences in Paris explaining his proposed method. The letter stated in French, [...] "Un index léger est solidaire du centre de figure d'une membrane vibrante il se termine par une pointe ... qui repose sur une surface noircie à la flamme." [...] The English translation is one close to this: [...] "A lightweight armature is fixed {{to the center of the}} face of a vibrating membrane; it ends with a sharp point ... which rests on a lamp-blacked surface." [...] This surface is integral with a disc driven by a double movement of rotation and linear progression. The system is reversible: when the tip follows the furrow the membrane restores the original acoustic signal. The letter was read in public on December 3 following. In his letter, after having shown that his method consisted of detecting an oscillation of a membrane and using the tracing to reproduce the oscillation with respect to its duration and intensity, Cros added that a cylindrical form for the receiving apparatus seemed to him to be the most practical, as it allowed for the graphic inscription of the vibrations by means of a very fine-threaded screw. An article on the Paleophone was published in [...] "la semaine du Clergé" [...] on October 10, 1877, written by l'Abbé Leblanc. Cros proposed metal for both <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> attached to the diaphragm and receiving material for durability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved monitoring {{system for the}} failure detection of <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> steel inserts during the injection molding cycle. This system uses acoustic emission PZT sensors mounted through acoustic waveguides on the engraving insert. We were thus able to clearly distinguish the defect through measured AE signals. Two <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> steel inserts were tested during the production of standard test specimens, each under the same processing conditions. By closely comparing the captured AE signals on both engraving inserts during the filling and packing stages, {{we were able to}} detect the presence of macro-cracks on one engraving insert. Gabor wavelet analysis was used for closer examination of the captured AE signals’ peak amplitudes during the filling and packing stages. The obtained results revealed that such a system could be used successfully as an improved tool for monitoring the integrity of an injection molding process...|$|E
40|$|Others {{have shown}} that the {{voltages}} induced on one uniformly-wound toroidal coil and two sinusoidallywound toroidal coils may be used to determine the current in a single filament and its coordinates. We have extended this technique to show that the voltages measured on a group of sinusoidally-wound toroidal coils may be used to approximate the transverse distribution of the current that passes through their common aperture. This is possible because each measured voltage is proportional to the product of unique functions of the radial and azimuthal coordinates of each increment of the current. We have developed matrix methods to determine the transverse distribution of the current and determined the sensitivity of these calculations to measurement errors. Shielded sinusoidally-wound coils with a precision of 0. 02 cm have been prepared using rapid prototyping, and methods to prepare the next generation of these coils, which will have a precision of 0. 001 cm, by using an <b>engraving</b> <b>tool</b> with the 4 th axis of a vertical milling machine have been defined...|$|E

5|$|The Arctic {{small tool}} {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago).

Scrapers, <b>engraving</b> <b>tools</b> and adze blades were also included in their toolkits.
