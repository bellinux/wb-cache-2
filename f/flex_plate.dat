50|$|A {{flexplate}} (or <b>flex</b> <b>plate)</b> is a metal disk {{that connects}} the output from an engine to the input of a torque converter in a car equipped with an automatic transmission.

The name refers to the ability of the disk to flex across its main axis bending side to side to take up motion in the torque converter as rotational speeds change. Flexplates are generally much thinner and lighter than flywheels due to the smooth coupling action of the torque converter and the elimination of the clutch surface. Like flywheels, flexplates normally handle coupling to the starter motor, via teeth cut along {{the outer edge of the}} plate. These teeth give the flexplate a gear-like appearance, in spite of this being a secondary function.|$|E

The principal mode of fracture is radial cracking at the undersurface of the inner (core) layer, even in the strongest of core ceramics—other damage modes, including radial cracking in the outer (veneer) layer, are less invasive in these all-brittle coating systems.

The transducers consist of a passive metal cap structure, and a thin piezoelectric disc, rigidly bonded to the inside. Extensive finite element (FE) modelling, and experimental 2 D, time-resolved displacement measurements were done to characterise the transducers flexural properties, and to compare them to the analytical solutions of thin vibrating plates.

There was excellent agreement between the experimental results and the FE simulation data.

40|$|Abstract. The ITER CS {{is in an}} {{advanced}} state of design. Detailed analysis continues. In this paper, finite element analyses done by the US PT are presented. These analyses relate to a few issues still requiring some resolution. Finite element analyses by the ITER International Team (IT) and other US PT analyses are cited for comparison with the finite element results. The degree of preload required to offset vertical tensions in the coils are discussed. Parametric analyses of different preloads and friction coefficients have been performed which point to a lower preload than that specified by the project. Lateral loading on the CS due to postulated off center electromagnetic loads are quantified. Lateral seismic loads are applied, and the existing and proposed restraint systems are discussed. Behavior of the upper flex supports is also available from the simulation model and will be compared with previous work. The coil leads are supported by the preload system tie-plates. Radial differential motion between the tie-plates and coils is quantified for the case {{where there is no}} radial coupling between the coils and tie-plates. Support provisions for the leads are discussed in the context of both load capacity and displacement absorbing ability. vertical loads on the CS. Torsional registration between the modules is provided by interlocking the modules with radial grooves and keys. The compliance of the coil stack and the differential loads along the height of the stack cause small but significant rotations at the <b>flex</b> <b>plates,</b> which are designed primarily for purely radial displacements.

40|$|We {{apply the}} {{analytical}} solution for an elastic plate (ASEP), which solves the 4 th order differential equation for the flexure of a thin plate to the Barents Sea {{in order to}} calculate the flexural rigidity. To constrain our analysis we make use of a 3 D density model based on the Barents 50 model [Ritzmann et al. 2006]. The density model provides information about the crustal configuration, e. g. the Moho and the loading in the crust including all internal density variation. The loading {{in combination with the}} ASEP allows us to calculate the flexure Mohos, and by comparison with the reference Moho, the flexural rigidity distribution. The resulting flexural rigidity distributions will be used to validate tectonic concepts, e. g. the location of the proposed Caledonian suture. In the past the effective elastic thickness (EET) has been used synonymously for the flexural rigidity, since it was defined by the material parameters of Young's modulus and Poisson ratio, which were assumed to be constant. The application of the ASEP shows, that it is sufficient to operate with a constant value for the Poisson's ratio, as the variation does not lead to a significant change in the result. However, concerning the vertical and horizontal variation of crustal composition, which corresponds to a change of Young modulus by orders of magnitude - the use of a constant standard value in the calculation process is doubtful. For that reason the EET distribution was recalculated including the Young's modulus variation, which could be estimated by using the p- wave velocities of the Barents 50 model. From the viewpoint of solid-state physics the elastic thickness concept should be reconceived. The EET corresponds theoretically to a thickness of a <b>flexed</b> <b>plate,</b> which consists of a material describable by a constant Young's modulus. Therefore the obtained EET distribution could be related to a Young's modulus variation, if the calculation was done with a constant assumed standard value. If the crust and the upper mantle have a non-uniform Young's modulus, the calculated flexural rigidity distribution is only valid for the crust but not for the lithosphere. These investigations ought to demonstrate the importance of the consideration of the Young's modulus variation in the EET calculation...|$|R

The imposition of this stress field on the northward moving Indian plate appears fundamental to explaining the current distribution of intraplate earthquakes and their mechanisms. The current study highlights an outer trough south of the flexural bulge in central India where surface stresses are double the contiguous compressional stresses to the north and south. The Bhuj, Latur and Koyna earthquakes and numerous other recent reverse faulting events occurred in this compressional setting. The spatial gradient of stress exceeds 2 bars/km near the flexural bulge.

The saphenous vein is exposed to high pressure and pulsatility only after implantation. Statins have been proved to {{reduce the incidence of}} vein graft failure. Thus, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of pulsatile stretch-induced saphenous vein smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and potential beneficial effects of statins. Methods and results: Human saphenous vein SMCs were subjected to cyclic stretch (60 cycles/min) in <b>Flex</b> I <b>plates.</b> Cerivastatin and simvastatin significantly prevented stretch-induced increase in SMC proliferation. Stretch induced the membrane accumulation of Rho A and Rho kinase inhibitors (Y- 27632 and hydroxyfasudil) and dominant negative Rho A mutant significantly prevented stretch-induced SMC proliferation. In addition, stretch increased the levels of both p 44 / 42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Akt phosphorylation. MAP kinase kinase (MEK) 1 / 2 inhibitor U 0126, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 -kinase inhibitors (wortmaninn and LY 294002), and dominant negative Akt mutant significantly prevented stretch-induced SMC proliferation. Cerivastatin significantly prevented stretch-induced membrane accumulation of Rho A. On the other hand, stretch-induced phosphorylation of p 44 / 42 MAP kinase and Akt was not prevented by cerivastatin. Mevalonate restored the preventive effect of cerivasatain on stretch-induced Rho A membrane accumulation. Stretch induced hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which was prevented by cerivastatin and the Rho kinase inhibitors. Conclusion : Statins prevent stretch-induced saphenous vein SMC proliferation via inhibition of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway.

40|$|Starting from Pliocene times, the Apulian {{foreland}} {{in southern}} Italy {{has undergone a}} flexural process underneath the Apennines thrust-fold belt. Mesozoic carbonate beds from the exposed Apulian forebulge are intensely dissected by systematic vertical joints striking parallel to the NW-trending flexure hinge. The sedimentary cover involved in the flexure consists of a 5. 5 km thick succession of Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonate beds strongly interpenetrated along bedding surfaces and overlying Triassic anhydrites and dolomites. On the assumption of {{the applicability of the}} linear elastic theory, the flexural curve of the Apulian foreland is reconstructed by best fitting a set of data derived from logs of oil wells and referring to the height of the base of Pliocene sediments. A set of flexural parameters is obtained from the reconstructed flexural curve. By using these parameters in solving the flexure equations for the fibre stress, we obtained a flexure- related hinge-perpendicular fibre stress in the outer arc of the Apulian forebulge in excess of - 100 MPa. This value is far greater than the tensile strength of the exposed carbonate rocks. This result supports the hypothesis that the flexure-related fibre stress in the Apulian forebulge can have driven the initiation of the observed regional systematic joints. This model may be applied to any <b>flexed</b> foreland <b>plate</b> and constitutes an alternative to the classical model of elastic response of rocks to the variations of lithostatic loads through time that has been often invoked to explain sets of systematic joints over large areas of foreland regions...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} {{subduction}} may be initiated at passive continental margins without shortening the lithosphere. Overcoming the lithosphere's high compressive strength requires special circumstances, and these {{make it difficult}} to explain the nearly complete recycling of old sea-floor. Instead, we present a model that predicts tensile decoupling of the continental and oceanic lithosphere, passive rifting, and foundering of the seafloor beneath material welling up in the rift. This occurs because the lithosphere in a new ocean basin establishes mechanical continuity with the continent at a depth comparable to mid-ocean ridges. Later subsidence at the margin is therefore inhibited by flexure, which implies shear stresses that promote fault slip and tensile stresses necessary to balance the component of the plate's weight directed down the margin slope. We show that this tension can more than offset ridge push. In our model, an important additional tension arises from basal shear tractions resisting the plate's motion away from the mid-ocean ridge, although these tractions cannot be evaluated with confidence. Slip on a high-angle fault decouples the oceanic and continental lithosphere when shear stresses arising from flexure and the applied tension exceed the lithosphere's shear strength under these loads. A passive rift then forms, allowing a mantle column to rise to the height of mid-ocean ridges, over 3 km above the old seafloor, and flow onto the surface in a gravity current. This load <b>flexes</b> the <b>plate</b> downwards, which enhances the flow and lets the old oceanic lithosphere founder. This model is consistent with the presence of oceanic material in continental forearcs and the youth of ophiolites when they are obducted, as both might be explained by rifting a margin and underthrusting the juvenile crust formed there. Boninites in ophiolite complexes and tectonites at their bases show depleted and hydrated geochemistries consistent with the melting of rifted mantle lithosphere that receives volatiles from foundering oceanic crust. ...|$|R

Although geological studies will necessarily complement the historical record, only two earthquakes {{of the dozens of}} known historic events have resulted in surface ruptures, and it is likely that geological data in the form of liquefaction features will be needed to extend the historic record beyond the most recent few centuries. Damage from large Himalayan earthquakes recorded in Tibet and in northern India suggests that earthquakes may attain M= 8. 2. Seismic gaps along two-thirds of the Himalaya that have developed in the past five centuries, when combined with geodetic convergence rates of approximately 1. 8 m/century, suggests that one or more M= 8 earthquakes may be overdue. The mechanisms of recent earthquakes in Peninsular India are consistent with stresses induced in the Indian <b>plate</b> <b>flexed</b> by its collision with Tibet.

Treatment of myometrial cells with progesterone (100 nM, 400 nM, 1 µM) for 1 or 6 hrs before the application of static stretch, did not affect the magnitude of the c-fos response. However, 24 hr of progesterone exposure reduced the magnitude of c-fos and fosB stretch induction at both the 400 nM and 1 µM dose.

These faults constitute the natural extension of a previously recognized fault system in western Puerto Rico and the Mona Passage. Paleostress analysis carried out on the faults and fractures in the Pliocene limestone results in a minimum NE-SW stress axis, changing to SSW in the faults that affect the Pleistocene limestone. In contrast, the inversion of focal mechanisms of deep, intermediate and shallow earthquakes provides a mechanism characteristic of pure thrust, oblique thrust, strike-slip and normal.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the model of}} a system comprised of a cantilever beam bilaterally constrained at the tip where the spacing between the beam and the stop was varied. The purpose of this work was to model the system, simulate it, and validate the numerical results with experimental data. It is important to mention {{that it is not}} the purpose of this work to obtain point-wise correspondence between the two systems, model and physical, but to obtain an algorithm that can be easily modified to study key parameters, such as clearance between beam and stop, impact stiffness and energy dissipation. To verify the piecewise-smooth simulation algorithm, three stop cases are considered. With each kind of stop, different information is obtained about the system. With the first setup, wherein transducers were used as stops, it was possible to measure the exact time of impact and how the impacts evolved over time. In the second arrangement the stops are heavy stainless steel blocks. In this setup the dynamics of the stops are minimized. In the third setup, thin aluminum plates are used as stops. Here, the <b>plates</b> <b>flex</b> during impact, and more complicated dynamics that are not modeled are introduced into the system. The position of the forcing as well as the kind of forcing are studied to try to understand how the system behaves. The best agreement between the model and experiment was obtained with the heavy stainless steel stop setup. In this cas...|$|R
40|$|Research in drug {{development}} meets many challenges including lengthy, complex and costly procedures to identify novel pharmacotherapies. In our lab, {{we developed a}} method for fast screening of small molecules that interact with monoamine transports – dopamine and serotonin (DAT, SERT). These membrane proteins play important roles in brain neurotransmission responsible for cognition, motion and pleasure. Dysfunction in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems result in neurological disorders such as depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia and addiction. DAT and SERT are responsible for uptake of dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5 HT) into the synapse and they limit neurotransmitter signaling. Drugs that mimic or antagonize actions of endogenous neurotransmitters (DA and 5 HT) increase the concentrations of DA and/or 5 HT either by blocking the transporter (blockers) or by competing uptake with neurotransmitter (substrate). The uptake of substrates is associated to an inward current that depolarizes the cell membrane. Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) can respond to small changes in membrane potential. In our method, we combined permanent cell line expressing the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) or the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) (FlpIn TREx expression system) with transient transfection of CaV. This system works as a tightly electrically coupled system. Cells challenged with substrate of the transports produce detectable Ca 2 + signal while monoamine transporter blockers can inhibit these Ca 2 + signals. The novelty of this method relies {{on the ability to}} discriminate between substrate and blockers of monoamine transporters. Preliminary experiments measuring our optimized cell system in a <b>Flex</b> Station 3 <b>plate</b> reader suggest that the co-expression of a voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel, a monoamine transporter and a genetically encoded Ca 2 + sensor constitute a rapid screening biosensor to identify active drugs at monoamine transporters. Our novel methodology can rapidly assess drug-effect profile on monoamine transporters and benefit development of new psychotherapeutics for treatment of mental illnesses. It {{can also be used to}} characterize mechanism of action of emerging drug of abuse, as well as to discover small molecules with novel drug-effect profile useful in basic neuroscience research...|$|R
