It has also become evident that antimicrobial resistance {{is a problem that}} cannot be tackled by single institutions or physicians. Prevention of antimicrobial resistance needs rigorous actions at ward level, institution level, national level and at supra-national levels. Countries can learn from each other and possibly transplant best practices across borders to prevent antimicrobial resistance. The aim {{of this study is to}} highlight some of the success stories of proven cost-effective interventions, and to describe the actions that have been taken, the outcomes that have been found, and the difficulties that have been met. In some cases we came across substantial scope for real-life cost savings. Although the best approach to effectively hinder the spread of antimicrobial resistance remains unclear and may vary significantly among settings, several EU-wide examples demonstrate that cost-effective antimicrobial stewardship is possible. Such examples can encourage others to implement (the most cost-effective) elements in their system...|$|E

40|$|A recent Supplement to Clinical Microbiology and Infection {{entitled}} ‘Infection {{control measures}} {{to limit the}} spread of C. difficile’ {{pointed out that the}} incidence of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) has been increasing worldwide, and stressed the importance of research in the fields of epidemiology and infection control [1]. Since 2003, one of the main causes of the increasing prevalence of CDAD has been claimed to be the emergence of PCR ribotype 027 /NAP 1, which has caused epidemics in North America, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The presence of PCR ribotype 027 in Austria, Japan, Ireland, Germany and Switzerland has also been reported recently [2, 3]. The majority of publications have emphasized that the presence of this strain is usually associated with more severe symptoms and signs than those associated with the other more common toxinpositive strains [4, 5]. Whereas PCR ribotype 027 was present in the population earlier, the majority of the historic strains were fluoroquinolone sensitive [6]. The overuse of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones may lead to the selection and emergence of resistant strains, and may contribute to the spread of PCR ribotype 027, which is usually resistant to erythromycin. Here, the Eastern <b>European</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 is reported...|$|E

No one in the fourteenth century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays. Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer and poet of the 14th century, questioned whether it was sent by God for their correction, or that it came through the influence of the heavenly bodies. Christians accused Jews of poisoning public water supplies in an effort to ruin <b>European</b> civilization.

Western culture continued to develop with the Christianisation of Europe during the Middle Ages and the reform and modernization triggered by the Renaissance. The Church preserved the intellectual developments of classical antiquity, and is the reason {{many of them are}} still known today. Medieval Christianity created the university, the hospital system, scientific economics, [...] natural law (which would later influence the creation of international law), and numerous other innovations across all intellectual fields.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} causes and consequences of second language education policies {{at the global level}} and in a national comparative framework, largely with quantitative data and pooled time series analyses. Languages were selected into school curricula largely {{because of the way the}} European world-system expanded over the past few hundred years, with colonization and the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the nation-state model among the most important factors. Countries that make studying second languages obligatory, by making attendance mandatory in the grades where second languages are taught, tend to be younger and use more widely spoken languages; the effects of IGO memberships is fragile indicating that the isomorphic processes associated with the world polity should not be overemphasized. The consequences of second language policies are first examined in terms of stratification and empirical analyses, with a sample of African countries from 1980 to 2000 show that where colonial languages are used as the medium of instruction inequality (measured as Gini coefficient for household income) is significantly higher, net of robust cross-national predictors. The amount of time devoted to the study of these languages as subjects, however, has no impact on inequality. Consequences are also examined in terms of economic development (measured as GDP per capita), specifically in so far as second language skills can be understood as human capital that facilitates economic development through the diffusion of technology and promotion of trade. Empirical analyses with a large group of non-English-speaking countries show a positive relationship between time spent on English and GDP per capita for the period 1980 to 2005. 	The larger picture that emerges is {{the causes and}} consequences of second language education policies at the national level are part of larger global level processes, like the expansion of the <b>European</b> world-system, the <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> a global level culture and the dynamics of global economic networks...|$|R

The <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> this parasite across the continent is especially facilitated by invasive North American crayfish species that serve as its reservoir. In France, multiple cases of native crayfish mortalities have been suggested to be connected {{with the presence of}} the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, which is highly abundant in the country. It shares similar habitats as the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and, when infected, the signal crayfish might therefore easily transmit the pathogen to the native species. We investigated the prevalence of A. astaci in French signal crayfish populations to evaluate the danger they represent to local populations of native crayfish. Over 500 individuals of Pacifastacus leniusculus from 45 French populations were analysed, plus several additional individuals of other non-indigenous crayfish species Orconectes limosus, O. immunis and Procambarus clarkii. Altogether, 20 % of analysed signal crayfish tested positive for Aphanomyces astaci, and the pathogen was detected in {{more than half of the}} studied populations. Local prevalence varied significantly, ranging from 0 % up to 80 %, but wide confidence intervals suggest that the number of populations infected by A. astaci may be even higher than our results show. Analysis of several individuals of other introduced species revealed infections among two of these, O. immunis and P. clarkii. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of Aphanomyces astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger to native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish. The prevalence in other non-indigenous crayfish should also be investigated as they likely contribute to pathogen transmission in the country...|$|R
