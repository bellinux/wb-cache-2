25|$|The two {{different}} engine models {{compatible with the}} 787 use a standard <b>electrical</b> <b>interface</b> to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx engines. This interchangeability aims to save time and cost when changing engine types; while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required made it rare. In 2006, Boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 engine swap was intended to take 24 hours.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{resonant}} biosensors {{are known}} for their high accuracy, low manufacturing cost and high level of miniaturization. The realization of an integrated sensor device requires the design and fabrication of fluidic and <b>electrical</b> <b>interfaces,</b> satisfying themselves to these requirements. Keeping this aim in mind, we designed fluidic and <b>electrical</b> <b>interfaces</b> easily adjustable to several types of resonant biosensors. Moreover, to characterize our sensor accurately, we developed a testing interface to quantify the influence of external parameters, like temperature and pressure, on the sensor response. The accuracy of measurement would then be strongly improved; real-time corrections on measurements and integration in a portable system would be possible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] As the IEC 61850 {{communication}} protocol becomes more widely accepted and applied in electrical engineering, {{it is important}} that the testing tools keep up with these developments. IEC 61850 presents new challenges to real time simulation and closed-loop testing of protective relays. The <b>electrical</b> <b>interfaces</b> used for binary signaling and the voltage/current amplifiers used in traditional test methods must be replaced by an Ethernet connection and an IEC 61850 protocol stack. The <b>electrical</b> <b>interfaces</b> of a real time simulator are engineered to provide low latency and deterministic performance appropriate for a real time testing. Similar attention must be given to IEC 61850 interfaces. Latency must be minimized so that the IEC 61850 interface does not add unacceptable delays to the operation of the simulator. Also, protocol processing must be deterministic to allow real tim...|$|R
