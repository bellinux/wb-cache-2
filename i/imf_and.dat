5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least {{developed}} countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and {{more than one-third of}} GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In the past, the economy has been dependent on substantial economic aid from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (<b>IMF),</b> <b>and</b> other countries. Malawi was ranked the 119th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the <b>IMF</b> <b>and</b> other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the <b>IMF</b> <b>and</b> other agencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (<b>IMF)</b> <b>and</b> considered the front-runner in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a midtown Manhattan hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, the case against him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying to a grand jury about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian dignitary. Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} method for {{occlusion}} removal using Finite element based Bi-dimensional Empirical Mode Decomposition (FE-BEMD) and Exemplar based image inpainting is discussed. Initially, {{the image is}} decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (<b>IMFs)</b> <b>and</b> a Residue using FE-BEMD. Then the Exemplar based image inpainting algorithm is applied {{to each of the}} <b>IMFs</b> <b>and</b> residue and the results are added together to get the inpainted image. The results obtained shows that the proposed method works well for removing large objects as well as small damages like scratches from images...|$|R
30|$|Because {{only the}} {{high-frequency}} IMF was {{changed from a}} panchromatic to a MS image, the remaining IMFs will not affect the image fusion results. Thus, the decomposition process can be simplified. This study only decomposes the image into two <b>IMFs,</b> high- <b>and</b> low-frequency, for image fusion. The EMD image-fusion process is described as follows: For data preprocessing, the panchromatic and MS images are registered into the same system. Next, the MS image is resampled to match {{the size of the}} panchromatic image. Then, the method proposed by this study uses EMD to decompose the two images into several <b>IMFs</b> <b>and</b> a residual. The first IMF of the panchromatic image replaces the first IMF of the MS image. Finally, the fused image is obtained by reconstructing the mixed IMFs of the MS image. The reconstruction process combines the mixed <b>IMFs</b> <b>and</b> residuals, as shown in Equation 6.|$|R
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the <b>IMF</b> <b>and</b> commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, <b>IMF,</b> <b>and</b> World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the <b>IMF,</b> <b>and</b> often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No currency war resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration.

Using different measures, it is shown that the low frequency and trend components of stock prices are relatively important drivers of the S&P 500 index. These results are also robust across various subsamples identified based on structural break tests. Therefore, US stock prices have been driven mostly by fundamental laws rooted in economic growth and longterm returns on investment. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest incomes, and a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina.

5|$|Greece– November 2011– After intense {{criticism}} from {{within his own}} party, the opposition and other EU governments, for his proposal to hold {{a referendum on the}} austerity and bailout measures, PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national unity government between three parties, of which only two currently remain in the coalition. Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures, which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against, Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups, leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority. The early Greek legislative election, 2012 were {{the first time in the}} history of the country, at which the bipartisanship (consisted of PASOK and New Democracy parties), which ruled the country for over 40 years, collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the country's foreign lenders and the Troika (consisted of the European Commission, the <b>IMF</b> <b>and</b> the European Central Bank). The popularity of PASOK dropped from 42.5% in 2010 to as low as 7% in some polls in 2012.

40|$|Hydrological {{time series}} {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} the most important applications in modern hydrology, especially for effective reservoir management. In this research, the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model coupled with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented for forecasting annual runoff time series. First, the original annual runoff time series is decomposed into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions (<b>IMFs)</b> <b>and</b> one residual series using EEMD technique for a deep insight into the data characteristics. Then each <b>IMF</b> component <b>and</b> residue is forecasted, respectively, through an appropriate ARIMA model. Finally, the forecasted results of the modeled <b>IMFs</b> <b>and</b> residual series are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original annual runoff series. Three annual runoff series from Biuliuhe reservoir, Dahuofang reservoir and Mopanshan reservoir, in China, are investigated using developed model based on the four standard statistical performance evaluation measures (RMSE, MAPE, R and NSEC). The results obtained in this work indicate that EEMD can effectively enhance forecasting accuracy and that the proposed EEMD-ARIMA model can significantly improve ARIMA time series approaches for annual runoff time series forecasting.

5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (<b>IMF)</b> <b>and</b> the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E
