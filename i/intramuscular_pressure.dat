5000|$|Between muscle relaxations <b>intramuscular</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> transiently {{returns to}} a level below the venous blood pressure and blood from the capillary system refills the veins until the next contraction. It is postulated that this change in pressure may be great enough to draw blood from the arterial side to the venous side. It is hypothesized that this pressure drop during rhythmic contraction actually increases blood flow through the muscle and {{may be responsible for}} a portion of the increase in muscle blood flow immediately at the onset of activity. While this explanation is attractive because it would explain the readily observable tight coupling between muscle contraction and a rapid increase in muscle blood flow, recent evidence has emerged that cast doubts on this theory. Experiments have shown that a strong muscle contraction can occur without a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle blood flow. [...] Given the proposed manner of action of the muscle pump to increase arterial blood flow, it would seem impossible for a muscle contraction and skeletal muscle hyperemia to be uncoupled.Another experiment recently was only able to find evidence that vasodilation, not the skeletal muscle pump was responsible for maintaining proper pressure and blood return.However, this might {{have to do with the}} lack of rigorous physiological tests thus far used to be able to prove the pump.|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Brief (30 -second) {{isometric}} trunk extensions at 5 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % of maximal {{voluntary contraction}} (MVC) and 3 minutes of prolonged trunk extension (20 % MVC) in erect position were studied in nine healthy male subjects. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the intercorrelation between <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> and tissue oxygenation of the paravertebral muscles during submaximal isometric contractions and further, to evaluate paravertebral electromyogram and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as indicators of}} force development. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Local physiologic responses to muscle contraction are incompletely understood. METHODS: Relative oxygenation was monitored with noninvasive near-infrared spectroscopy, <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured with a transducer-tipped catheter, and surface electromyogram was monitored at three recording sites. RESULTS: The root mean square amplitudes of the paravertebral electromyogram (L 4, left and right; T 12, right) and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> measured in the lumbar multifidus muscle at L 4 increased with greater force development in a curvilinear manner. A significant decrease in the oxygenation of the lumbar paravertebral muscle in response to muscle contraction was found at an initial contraction level of 20 % MVC. This corresponded to a paravertebral <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> of 30 - 40 mm Hg. However, during prolonged trunk extension, no further decrease in tissue oxygenation was found compared with the tissue oxygenation level {{at the end of}} the brief contractions, indicating that homeostatic adjustments (mean blood pressure and heart rate) over time were sufficient to maintain paravertebral muscle oxygen levels. CONCLUSION: At a threshold <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> of 30 - 40 mm Hg during muscle contraction, oxygenation in the paravertebral muscles is significantly reduced. The effect of further increase in <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> on tissue oxygenation over time may be compensated for by an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Surface electromyogram amplitudes and <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> can be used as indicators of paravertebral muscle force...|$|E

METHODS: To develop a ground-based simulation for spinal adaptation to microgravity, we investigated height increase, neuromuscular function and back pain in 6 subjects {{all of whom}} underwent two forms of bed rest for 3 d. One form consisted of 6 degrees of head-down tilt (HDT) with balanced traction, while the other was horizontal bed rest (HBR). Subjects had a 2 -week recovery period in between the studies. RESULTS: Total body and spinal length increased significantly more and the subjects had significantly more back pain during HDT with balanced traction compared to HBR. The distance between the lower endplate of L 4 and upper endplate of S 1, as measured by ultrasonography, increased significantly in both treatments to the same degree. <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>pressures</b> in the erector spinae muscles and ankle torque measurements during plantarflexion and dorsiflexion did not change significantly during either treatment.

The increased force generation during eccentric muscular activity, compared with other muscular activity, was not accompanied by higher <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure.</b> Thus, this study demonstrated that eccentric muscular activity generated higher torque values for each increment of <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure.</b> Intramuscular pressures during antagonistic co-activation were significantly higher in the tibilis anterior muscle (42 - 46 % of maximal agonistic activity) compared with the soleus muscle (12 - 29 % of maximal agonistic activity) and was largely due to active recruitment of muscle fibers.

40|$|How the {{respiratory}} muscles, the so-called "vital pump", works {{is relevant to}} medicine and nevertheless, poorly understood. The present studies attempt to obtain a better insight in the action and interaction of respiratory muscles by measuring the mechanical outcome of individual respiratory muscle contraction with two different techniques in anesthetized dogs. First, we measured the changes in length undergone by respiratory muscles using sonomicrometry. We observed that the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm frequently behaved differently, supporting the concept that these two parts behave as two different muscles. Moreover, crural diaphragmatic length appeared {{to be linked to}} abdominal dimensions, the classical used estimate of diaphragmatic length, whereas costal diaphragmatic length was not. The parasternal or the interchondral parts of the internal intercostals invariably shortened with inspiration supporting their role as inspiratory agonists. By way of contrast, {{the respiratory}} length changes in the external and interosseus internal intercostal were variable and not consistently in different directions for the two layers. The changes in length, during rotation of the trunk were consistent, larger and systematically in opposite directions for these two layers, suggesting that these muscles predominantly function as rotators of the trunk or at least that a role in rotation of the trunk explains better the need for two layers of intercostal muscles with different fiber orientation than a respiratory role. Second, we measured changes in <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> in the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm, and in the parasternal intercostals, using mini-transducers. In the diaphragm <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> appeared to be a complex variable determined by the tension developed by the muscle as well as the pleural and abdominal pressures applied to the muscle. As a consequence, <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> often decreased during contraction, suggesting that in contrast to other muscles, diaphragmatic contraction may enhance diaphragmatic blood flow. Conversely, in the parasternal intercostals, <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> invariably increased during contraction, and a linear relationship between <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> and contractile force was present. The forces developed by these muscles during quiet breathing and other respiratory maneuvers were found to be significant, supporting the important inspiratory role of the parasternal intercostals. <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> thus appeared to be a perfect estimate of the force developed by these muscles.

Thick, bulging muscles create high IMPs (up to 1000 mmHg) and force transmission to tendons becomes inefficient. High resting or postexercise IMPs are indicative of a compartment syndrome due to muscle swelling within a low-compliance osseofascial boundary. IMP increases linearly with force (torque) independent of the mode or speed of contraction (isometric, eccentric, concentric). IMP is also a much better predictor of muscle force than the EMG signal. During prolonged low-force isometric contractions, cyclic variations in IMP are seen. Since IMP influences muscle blood flow through the muscle pump, autoregulating vascular elements, and compression of the intramuscular vasculature, alterations in IMP have important implications for muscle function...|$|R

Repetitive eccentric muscle contraction often results in damage-related muscle edema (Friden et al. 1988). Fluid accumulation prolongs the T 2 value of an exercised muscle and increases the signal intensity on T 2 -weighted image (Yanagisawa et al. 2003 a).

In addition, a positive correlation was observed between <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> and hardness (Steinberg 2005; Steinberg et al. 2011).

We {{address the problem of}} tracking in vivo muscle fascicle shape and length changes using ultrasound video sequences. Quantifying fascicle behavior is required to improve understanding of the functional significance of a muscle's geometric properties. Ultrasound imaging provides a noninvasive means of capturing information on fascicle behavior during dynamic movements; to date however, computational approaches to assess such images are limited. Our approach to the problem is novel because we permit fascicles to take up nonlinear shape configurations. We achieve this using a Bayesian tracking framework that is: 1) robust, conditioning shape estimates on the entire history of image observations; and 2) flexible, enforcing only a very weak Gaussian Process shape prior that requires fascicles to be locally smooth. The method allows us to track and quantify fascicle behavior in vivo during a range of movements, providing insight into dynamic changes in muscle geometric properties which may be linked to patterns of activation and <b>intramuscular</b> forces and <b>pressures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Monosodium {{glutamate}} (MSG) {{is often}} {{thought to be}} associated with headache and craniofacial pains like temporomandibular disorders. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was performed to investigate how ingestion of MSG affects muscle pain sensitivity before and after experimentally induced muscle pain. Methods: Sixteen healthy adult subjects participated in 2 sessions with at least 1 -week interval between sessions. In each session, two injections of glutamate (Glu, 0. 5 M, 0. 2 ml) and two injections of saline (0. 9 %, 0. 2 ml) into the masseter and temporalis muscles, respectively, were undertaken, with a 15 min interval between each injection. Injections of saline were made contralateral to Glu injections and done in a randomized order. Participants drank 400 mL of soda mixed with either MSG (150 mg/kg) or NaCl (24 mg/kg, placebo) 30 min before the <b>intramuscular</b> injections. <b>Pressure</b> pain thresholds (PPT), autonomic parameters and pain intensity were assessed prior to (baseline) and 30 min after ingestion of soda, as well as 5 min and 10 min after the intramuscular injections {{and at the end of}} the session. Whole saliva samples were collected prior to and 30, 45, 60, and 75 min after the ingestion of soda. Results: MSG administration resulted in a significantly higher Glu level in saliva than administration of NaCl and was associated with a significant increase in systolic blood pressure. Injections of Glu were significantly more painful than injections of NaCl. However, ingestion of MSG did not change the intensity of Glu-evoked pain. Glu injections also significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but without an additional effect of MSG ingestion. Glu injections into the masseter muscle significantly reduced the PPT. However, pre-injection MSG ingestion did not significantly alter this effect. Interestingly, PPT was significantly increased in the trapezius after MSG ingestion and intramuscular injection of Glu in the jaw muscles. Conclusion: The main finding in this study was that systemic intake of a substantial amount of MSG does not influence either pain intensity or pressure pain sensitivity in the masseter and temporalis muscles into which Glu injections were made.

Methods: The infraspinatus tendon in six sheep was released and encased in a silicone tube to prevent spontane-ous healing. The musculotendinous unit was allowed to retract for forty weeks.

The data on tissue oxygenation for each subject then were normalized to a scale of 100 per cent (the baseline value, or the value at rest) to 0 per cent (the physiological minimum, or the level of oxygenation achieved by exercise to exhaustion during arterial occlusion of the lower extremity). With external compression, tissue oxygenation declined at a rate of 1. 4 +/- 0. 3 per cent per minute (mean and standard error) during exercise. After an initial decrease at the onset, tissue oxygenation did not decline during exercise without compression. The recovery of tissue oxygenation after exercise was twice as slow with compression (2. 5 +/- 0. 6 minutes) than it was without the use of compression (1. 3 +/- 0. 2 minutes) ...|$|E
40|$|We review {{historical}} and methodological approaches to measurements of <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> (IMP) in humans. These techniques provide valuable measures of muscle tone and activity {{as well as}} diagnostic criteria for evaluation of exertional compartment syndrome. Although the wick and catheter techniques provide accurate measurements of IMP at rest, their value for exercise studies and diagnosis of exertional compartment syndrome is limited because of low frequency response and hydrostatic (static and inertial) pressure artifacts. Presently, most information on diagnosis of exertional compartment syndromes during dynamic exercise is available using the Myopress catheter. However, future research and clinical diagnosis using IMP can be optimized {{by the use of}} a miniature transducer-tipped catheter such as the Millar Mikro-tip...|$|E
40|$|A {{serious problem}} {{experienced}} by astronauts during long-duration space flight is muscle atrophy. In {{order to develop}} countermeasures for this problem, a simple method for monitoring in vivo function of specific muscles is needed. Previous studies document that both <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> (IMP) and electromyography (EMG) provide quantitative indices of muscle contraction force during isometric exercise. However, at present there are no data available concerning the usefulness of IMP versus EMG during dynamic exercise. Methods: IMP (Myopress catheter) and surface EMG activity were measured continuously and simultaneously in the tibalis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles of 9 normal male volunteers (28 - 54 years). These parameters were recorded during both concentric and eccentric exercises which consisted of plantarflexon and dorsiflexon of the ankle joint. A Lido Active Isokinetic Dynamometer concurrently recorded ankle joint torque and position. Results: <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> correlated linearly with contraction force for both SOL (r exp 2 = 0. 037) and TA (R exp 2 = 0. 716 and r exp 2 = 0. 802, respectively). During eccentric exercises, SOL and TA IMP also correlated linearly with contraction force (r(exp 2) = 0. 883 and r(exp 2) = 0. 904 respectively), but SOL and TA EMG correlated poorly with force (r(exp 2) = 0. 489 and r(exp 2) = 0. 702 respectively). Conclusion: IMP measurement provides a better index of muscle contraction force than EMG during concentric and eccentric exercise. IMP reflects intrinsic mechanical properties of individual muscles, such as length tension relationships. Although invasive, IMP provides a more powerful tool and EMG for developing exercise hardware and protocols for astronauts exposed to long-duration space flight...|$|E
40|$|Seven healthy {{volunteer}} men {{participated in an}} experiment involving lower body positive pressure (LBPP) of 30 Torr and acute volume expansions of 5 - 6 % (VE-I) and 9 - 10 % (VE-II) of their total blood volume (TBV) to differentiate the effect of increased <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> and central venous pressure (CVP) on the maximal gain (Gmax) of the carotid baroreflex. During each experimental condition, the heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP; intraradial artery or Finapres), and CVP (at the 3 rd- 4 th intercostal space) were monitored continuously. Gmax {{was derived from the}} logistic modeling of the HR and MAP responses to ramped changes in carotid sinus transmural pressure using a protocol of pulsatile changes in neck chamber pressure from + 40 to - 65 Torr. The increase in CVP during + 30 -Torr LBPP was 1. 5 mmHg (P 0. 05). The Gmax of the carotid baroreflex of HR and MAP was significantly decreased during LBPP by - 0. 145 +/- 0. 039 beats x min(- 1) x mmHg(- 1) (38 %) and - 0. 071 +/- 0. 013 mmHg/mmHg (25 %), respectively; however, VE-I did not affect Gmax. During VE-II, CVP was significantly greater than that elicited by LBPP, and the Gmax of the carotid baroreflex of the HR and MAP responses was significantly reduced. We conclude that carotid baroreflex responsiveness was selectively inhibited by increasing <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure,</b> possibly resulting in an activation of the intramuscular mechanoreceptors during LBPP. Furthermore, {{it would appear that the}} inhibition of the carotid baroreflex, via cardiopulmonary baroreceptor loading (increased CVP), occurred when a threshold pressure (CVP) was achieved...|$|E
40|$|The chronic exertional {{compartment}} syndrome (CECS) {{consists of a}} disturbance of the muscular function of a compartment related to {{a rise in the}} <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> of the aforementioned compartment, during an exercise. The most frequent location of this pathology is the leg. The 2 parts of this article are treating the subject. The clinical presentation is often not very specific and the realization of complementary investigations is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Among those, the measurement of the intramuscular pressures of all the compartments potentially accused, at rest, during an effort and especially in phase of recovery, represents the determining criteria.

40|$|Astronauts {{experience}} {{total body}} height increases of 4 to 7 cm in microgravity. Thus, stretching of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and muscular and ligamentous tissues {{may be responsible}} for the hyperreflexia, back pain, and muscular atrophy associated with exposure to microgravity. Axial compression of the spine makes 6 deg. head-down tilt (HDT) an unsuitable model for spinal acclimation to microgravity. However, this axial compression may be counteracted by balanced traction consisting of 10 % body weight (sin 6 deg. = 0. 1) applied to the legs. Six healthy male subjects underwent 3 days each of 60 HDT with balanced traction and horizontal bed rest (HBR), with a 2 week recovery period between treatments. Total body and spine length, lumbar disc height, back pain, erector spinae <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure,</b> and ankle joint torque were measured before, during and after each treatment. Total body and spine (processes of L 5 - C 7) lengths increased significantly more during HDT with balanced traction (22 +/- 8 mm and 25 +/- 8 mm, respectively) than during HBR (16 +/- 4 mm and 14 +/- 9 mm, respectively). Back and leg pain were significantly greater during HDT with balanced traction than during HBR. The distance between the lower end plate of L 4 and the upper endplate of S 1, as measured by sonography, increased significantly in both treatments to the same degree (2. 9 +/- 1. 9 mm, HDT with balanced traction; 3. 3 +/- 1. 5 mm, HBR). <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> of the erector spinae muscles and maximal ankle joint torque were unaltered with both models. While neither model increased height to the magnitude observed in microgravity, HDT with balanced traction may be a better model for simulating the body lengthening and back pain experienced in microgravity...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Eight subjects, aged 27. 0 +/- 1. 6 yr, {{performed}} incremental workload cycling {{to investigate}} the contribution of skeletal muscle mechano- and metaboreceptors to ventilatory control during dynamic exercise. METHODS: Each subject performed four bouts of exercise: exercise with no intervention (CON); exercise with bilateral thigh cuffs inflated to 90 mm Hg (CUFF); exercise with application of lower-body positive pressure (LBPP) to 45 torr (PP); and exercise with 90 mm Hg thigh cuff inflation and 45 torr LBPP (CUFF+PP). Ventilatory responses and pulmonary gas exchange variables were collected breath-by-breath with concomitant measurement of leg <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure.</b> RESULTS: Ventilation (VE) was significantly elevated from CON during PP and CUFF+PP at workloads corresponding to > or = 60 % CON peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak) and during CUFF at workloads > or = 80 % CON VO 2 peak, P < 0. 05. The VO 2 at which ventilatory threshold occurred was significantly reduced from CON (2. 17 +/- 0. 28 L x min(- 1)) to 1. 60 +/- 0. 19 L x min(- 1), 1. 45 +/- 0. 15 L x min(- 1), and 1. 15 +/- 0. 11 L x min(- 1) during CUFF, PP, and CUFF+PP, respectively. The slope of the linear regression describing the VE/CO 2 output relationship was increased from CON by approximately 22 % during CUFF, 40 % during PP, and 41 % during CUFF+PP. CONCLUSIONS: As <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> was significantly elevated immediately upon application of LBPP during PP and CUFF+PP without a concomitant increase in VE, {{it seems unlikely that}} LBPP-induced increases in VE can be attributed to activation of the mechanoreflex. These findings suggest that LBPP-induced reductions in perfusion pressure and decreases in venous outflow resulting from inflation of bilateral thigh cuffs may generate a metabolite sensitive intramuscular ventilatory stimulus...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Closed {{soft tissue}} injury induces {{progressive}} microvascular dysfunction and regional inflammation. The authors tested {{the hypothesis that}} adverse trauma-induced effects can be reduced by local cooling. While superficial cooling reduces swelling, pain, and cellular oxygen demand, the effects of cryotherapy on posttraumatic microcirculation are incompletely understood. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: After a standardized closed soft tissue injury to the left tibial compartment, male rats were randomly subjected to percutaneous perfusion for 6 hours with 0. 9 % NaCL (controls; room temperature) or cold NaCL (cryotherapy; 8 degrees C) (n = 7 per group). Uninjured rats served as shams (n = 7). Microcirculatory changes and leukocyte adherence were determined by intravital microscopy. <b>Intramuscular</b> <b>pressure</b> was measured, and invasion of granulocytes and macrophages was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Edema and tissue damage was quantified by gravimetry and decreased desmin staining. RESULTS: Closed soft tissue injury significantly decreased functional capillary density (240 +/- 12 cm(- 1)); increased microvascular permeability (0. 75 +/- 0. 03), endothelial leukocyte adherence (995 +/- 77 /cm(2)), granulocyte (182. 0 +/- 25. 5 /mm(2)) and macrophage infiltration, edema formation, and myonecrosis (ratio: 2. 95 +/- 0. 45) within the left extensor digitorum longus muscle. Cryotherapy for 6 hours significantly restored diminished functional capillary density (393 +/- 35), markedly decreased elevated <b>intramuscular</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{reduced the number of}} adhering (462 +/- 188 /cm(2)) and invading granulocytes (119 +/- 28), and attenuated tissue damage (ratio: 1. 7 +/- 0. 17). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis that prolonged cooling reduces posttraumatic microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and structural impairment was confirmed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results may have therapeutic implications as cryotherapy after closed soft tissue injury is a valuable therapeutic approach to improve nutritive perfusion and attenuate leukocyte-mediated tissue destruction. The risk for evolving compartment syndrome may be reduced, thereby preventing further irreversible aggravation...|$|E
