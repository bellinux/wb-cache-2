Its circuitry is supposedly {{identical to that}} of the XS, but has a 24-bit DAC that can be called from any of five S/PDIF inputs. It has more features, a more well-endowed power supply allowing delivery of 80 watts' music, and can bi-amp suitable speakers by adding a secondary power amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 kit {{came with}} a <b>front</b> <b>panel,</b> a CPU board with the Intel 8080 microprocessor, 256 bytes of RAM, a 4-slot {{backplane}} and an 8-amp power supply for $439. A 1k byte memory board was $176 and the 4k byte was $264. The serial interface board was $124 and the parallel interface was $119. There was a special price for an 8k byte system with BASIC for $995. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was $1500.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

When bootstrap ROMs enabled computers to start themselves without operator intervention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most computers were built without a <b>front</b> switch <b>panel.</b> High-powered calculators, such as the HP 9830 based on ROM, {{were among the first}} computers to do away with <b>front</b> <b>panels,</b> and operators.|$|R

However, it never arrived {{due to a}} strike by the shipping company. Solomon already {{had a number of}} pictures of the machine and the article was based on them. Roberts got to work on building a replacement. The computer on the magazine cover is an empty box with just switches and LEDs on the <b>front</b> <b>panel.</b> The finished Altair computer had a completely different circuit board layout than the prototype shown in the magazine.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The Teletype Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E

25|$|The Rev. 2 LM-1 {{introduced}} {{two rows}} of LEDs to indicate the Shuffle and Auto-Correct settings, several additional buttons on the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> to aid in programming, and a shared filter on the toms and congas, {{as well as the}} kick drum. There were a handful of Rev. 2 LM-1's with both engraved buttons and Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs but these are extremely rare. To cut costs, on later Rev. 2's, the engraved buttons were replaced with unlabeled buttons. In lieu of the engraved names or symbols, the button names were printed on the <b>front</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
25|$|On later Rev. 3's, {{the raised}} buttons were {{replaced}} by sealed buttons (flush with {{the surface of the}} <b>front</b> <b>panel)</b> that were impossible to clean. In fact, the LM-1 service notes indicated these buttons had to be replaced if they went bad.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{designs of}} the car panel need to be studied by digitizing {{the surface of the}} panel of various car models. This research focuses on the static simulation analysis especially to strain, stress and displacement analysis of a <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> {{of the car}}. The main objectives of this research are to study the design of the existing exterior car body part, analyze and proposed the mechanism to improve the design using Finite Element Method software. To achieve that, three different designs of <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> were used, there are Proton Iswara, Honda EG and Proton Saga <b>front</b> fender <b>panel.</b> A 3 D Scanner machine used to scan the actual model of <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> and to convert the model into the simulation analysis format by using POLYWORK software. SOLIDWORKS software was used to create corner radius and surface of the <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> of the car. After that, analysis was carried out by using commercial Finite Elements software (ALGOR) to evaluate and analyze the behavior and surface of a <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> of the car. It is considered the function, design, strength and the rigidity of the stamping parts of the <b>front</b> fender <b>panel.</b> In this research, this <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> analyzed using the static simulation analysis for components with linear materials. For this simulation, two types of load will be applied {{on the surface of the}} <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> which are at all surface area and at selected surface area. The result will be analyzed based on the strain, stress and the displacement of the surface of the <b>front</b> fender <b>panel.</b> The comparison of strain, stress and displacement data of each car front fender model were done using graphs. With this, the process of digitizing the surface of the front fender model can be done easily. After that, a related study was carried out to know the properties of the <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> during the impact of the applied load. At the end of this research, the comparison data of various car <b>front</b> fender <b>panels</b> will be known and could be the basis for the future design. Besides that, the area between the optimum line and the minimum line for each graph analysis can be used as a guideline and a mechanism to improve the design of <b>front</b> fender <b>panel</b> in the future...|$|R

25|$|This simple {{design is}} {{effective}} and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially Energy Star rated ones, use a relay to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, {{so that the}} degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off {{at the end of}} the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.|$|E
