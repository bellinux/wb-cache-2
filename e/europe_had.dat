5|$|By the 16th century, when Japanese and European {{cultures}} met, fortification in <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> {{moved beyond}} castles and relied on innovations {{such as the}} Italian trace italienne and star forts. Forts in India present a similar case; when they were encountered by the British in the 17thcentury, castles in <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> generally fallen out of use militarily. Like shiro, the Indian forts, durga or durg in Sanskrit, shared features with castles in Europe such as acting as a domicile for a lord {{as well as being}} fortifications. They too developed differently from the structures known as castles that had their origins in Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> {{more than}} 40 million refugees, its economy had {{collapsed}} and 70 percent of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Between twelve and fourteen million ethnic Germans fled or were expelled from east-central Europe to Germany. During the Cold War, the West German government estimated a death toll of 2.2 million civilians due to the flight and expulsion of Germans and through forced labour in the Soviet Union. This figure remained unchallenged until the 1990s, when some historians put the death toll at 500,000–600,000 confirmed deaths. In 2006, the German government reaffirmed its position that 2.0–2.5 million deaths occurred.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops than elsewhere in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> adopted ironclads. Britain and France {{each had}} sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E
5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> ended.|$|E

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> of the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|<b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> been {{in turmoil}} {{since the start}} of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.|$|E

The carmaker targeted the Ampera for business fleet market and local government agencies, where Opel has a strong customer base, while the Volt is aimed at retail customers. According to Opel, by June 2011 around 5,000 customers across <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> reserved an Ampera, with fleet or business customers representing 60% of reservations, {{and a total of}} 7,000 orders were received by March 2012, with Benelux, Germany and the United Kingdom as the top markets in terms of orders.|$|E
5|$|Hannah de Rothschild {{was born}} in 1851 {{into a world of}} great wealth and luxury. She was the granddaughter of Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who had founded N M Rothschild & Sons, the English branch of the Rothschilds' banking empire. Niall Ferguson states in his History of the House of Rothschild that by the mid-19th century the Rothschilds {{regarded}} themselves as the nearest thing the Jews of <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> to a royal family, and the equals of royalty. Whether or not this was strictly true, the many Rothschild homes and their art collections, in England, Austria, France and Germany, certainly rivalled those of the crowned heads of Europe.|$|E

Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIgs version of Lemmings, has released the games' source code.|$|E
5|$|In December 1944, the German army, {{under the}} command of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, {{launched}} a last-ditch offensive across Belgium, Luxembourg, and northeastern France. On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during {{the early stages of the}} ensuing Battle of the Bulge, made significant headway towards the Meuse River during the worst winter <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> seen in years. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front to a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his very nature, international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E

5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities. In the West the defeat in Normandy and the Allied advance across Western <b>Europe</b> <b>had</b> significant {{consequences for the}} Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany from British night attacks. The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was {{the inability of the}} Luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel at this stage in the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units. Equally serious was the threat posed by RAF de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders operating over Germany.|$|E
