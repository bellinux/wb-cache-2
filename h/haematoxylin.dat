25|$|Histopathology - the {{microscopic}} examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are <b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin, {{but many others}} exist. The use of <b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology {{is considered to be}} the core skill of anatomic pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Mallory {{described}} the reagent now generally known as PTAH in 1897. PTAH stains tissues either reddish brown or blue {{depending on their}} type. This property of simultaneously staining two different colours is different from other <b>haematoxylin</b> reagents e.g. alum-haematoxylin. The role of phosphotungstic acid and the mechanism of staining is not fully understood. Interestingly the active component of <b>haematoxylin</b> is the oxidised form, haematin, although this rarely acknowledged in the literature which refer to <b>haematoxylin</b> staining. Phosphotungstic acid forms a lake with haematin. The make –up of the reagent is uncertain, examination of a year old sample showed there to be three coloured components, blue, red and yellow. These were not identified. Some investigations of “model” systems, reacting various compounds such as amino acids, purines, pyrimidines and amines with PTAH show that they give rise to different colours.|$|E
25|$|Phosphotungstic acid {{is used in}} {{histology}} for staining specimens, as {{a component}} of phosphotungstic acid <b>haematoxylin,</b> PTAH, and “trichrome” reagents, and as a negative stain for imaging by a transmission electron microscope.|$|E
25|$|Phosphotungstic acid {{is used in}} {{histology}} as {{a component}} for staining of cell specimens, often together with <b>haematoxylin</b> as PTAH. It binds to fibrin, collagen, and fibres of connective tissues, and replaces the anions of dyes from these materials, selectively decoloring them.|$|E
25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: Logwood Haematoxylon campechianum; a large spiny tree that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called <b>haematoxylin</b> is produced from this species. Brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another spiny tree native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the True indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recommended}} histologic grading schema for RCC is the Fuhrman system (1982), {{which is}} an assessment based on the microscopic morphology of a neoplasm with <b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin (H staining). This system categorises renal cell carcinoma with grades 1, 2, 3, 4 based on nuclear characteristics. The details of the Fuhrman grading system for RCC are shown below: ...|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{microscopic}} clumps called Nissl substance (or Nissl bodies) {{are seen}} when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic ("base-loving") dye. These structures consist of {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} and associated ribosomal RNA. Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860–1919), {{they are involved in}} protein synthesis and their prominence {{can be explained by the}} fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) <b>haematoxylin</b> [...] highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA.|$|E
2500|$|The colon crypts {{are shaped}} like {{microscopic}} thick walled test tubes {{with a central}} hole {{down the length of}} the tube (the crypt lumen). Four tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. [...] In these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). [...] The nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with <b>haematoxylin.</b> As seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. [...] Baker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. [...] Thus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2530 cells per colonic crypt. [...] Nooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1500 to 4900 cells per colonic crypt. [...] Cells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. [...] There are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three main}} alum <b>haematoxylin</b> {{solutions}} employed are Ehrlich's <b>haematoxylin,</b> Harris's <b>haematoxylin,</b> and Mayer's <b>haematoxylin.</b> The name haemalum {{is preferable to}} [...] "haematoxylin" [...] for these solutions because haematein, a product of oxidation of <b>haematoxylin,</b> is the compound that combines with aluminium ions to form the active dye-metal complex. Alum <b>haematoxylin</b> solutions impart to the nuclei of cells a light transparent red stain that rapidly turns blue on exposure to any neutral or alkaline liquid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Haematoxylin</b> (hematoxylin in North America) is {{a nuclear}} stain. Used with a mordant, <b>haematoxylin</b> stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.

5000|$|<b>Haematoxylin</b> or {{hematoxylin}} (...) , {{also called}} natural black 1 or C.I. 75290, is a compound {{extracted from the}} heartwood of the logwood tree (Haematoxylum campechianum). <b>Haematoxylin</b> and eosin together make up <b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin stain, {{one of the most}} commonly used stains in histology. This type of stain is a permanent stain as opposed to temporary stains (e.g. iodine solution in KI). Another common stain is phosphotungstic acid <b>haematoxylin,</b> a mix of <b>haematoxylin</b> with phosphotungstic acid. When oxidized, it forms haematein, a compound that forms strongly coloured complexes with certain metal ions, the most notable ones being Fe(III) and Al(III) salts. Metal-haematein complexes are used to stain cell nuclei prior to examination under a microscope. Structures that stain with iron- or aluminium-haematein are often called basophilic, even though the mechanism of the staining is different from that of staining with basic dyes.|$|E

50|$|Eosin is {{most often}} used as a counterstain to {{hematoxylin}} in H&E (<b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin) staining. H&E staining {{is one of the}} most commonly used techniques in histology. Tissue stained with <b>haematoxylin</b> and eosin shows cytoplasm stained pink-orange and nuclei stained darkly, either blue or purple. Eosin also stains red blood cells intensely red.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s and in 2008, there were {{shortages}} of <b>haematoxylin</b> due to interruptions in its extraction from logwood. The {{price of the}} compound increased, affecting the cost of diagnostic histopathology, and prompted a search for alternative nuclear stains. Before {{the use of any}} alternatives became firmly established, <b>haematoxylin</b> returned to the market, though at a higher price, and resumed its place in histopathology. Several synthetic dyes have been recommended as replacements, notably celestine blue (CI 51050), gallocyanine (CI 51030), gallein (CI 45445) and eriochrome cyanine R (also called chromoxane cyanine R and solochrome cyanine (CI 43820). All four have Fe(III) as the mordant. Another alternative is the aluminium complex of oxidized brazilin, which differs from <b>haematoxylin</b> by only one hydroxyl group.|$|E

5000|$|Alum or {{potassium}} {{aluminium sulfate}} {{used as the}} mordant usually dissociates in an alkaline solution, combining with HO− of water to form insoluble aluminium hydroxide. In the presence of excess acid, aluminium hydroxide cannot be formed, thus causing failure of aluminium <b>haematoxylin</b> dye-lake to form, {{due to lack of}} OH− ions. Hence, acid solutions of alum <b>haematoxylin</b> become red. During staining, alum haematoxylin-stained sections are usually passed on to a neutral or alkaline solution (e.g., hard tap water or 1% ammonium hydroxide) in order to neutralize the acid and form an insoluble blue aluminium haematin complex. This procedure is known as blueing.|$|E
