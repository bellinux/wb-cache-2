5000|$|Formerly, tanning was {{considered}} a noxious or [...] "odoriferous trade" [...] and relegated {{to the outskirts of}} town, amongst the poor. Indeed, tanning by ancient methods is so foul smelling, tanneries are still isolated from those towns today where the old methods are used. Skins typically arrived at the tannery dried stiff and dirty with soil and gore. First, the ancient tanners would soak the skins in water to clean and soften them. Then they would pound and scour the skin to remove any remaining flesh and fat. Next, the tanner needed to remove the hair from the skin. This was done by either soaking the skin in urine, painting it with an alkaline lime mixture, or simply allowing the skin to putrefy for several months then dipping it in a salt solution. After the hairs were loosened, the tanners scraped them off with a knife. Once the hair was removed, the tanners would [...] "bate" [...] (soften) the material by pounding dung into the skin, or soaking the skin in a solution of animal brains. Bating was a fermentative process which relied on enzymes produced by bacteria found in the dung. Among the kinds of dung commonly used were those of dogs or pigeons. Sometimes, the dung was mixed with water in a large vat, and the prepared skins were kneaded in the <b>dung</b> <b>water</b> until they became supple from bacterial enzyme action, but not too soft. The ancient tanner might use his bare feet to knead the skins in the <b>dung</b> <b>water,</b> and the kneading could last two or three hours. This combination of urine, animal feces, and decaying flesh made ancient tanneries malodorous. Children employed as dung gatherers were a common sight in ancient cities. Also common were [...] "piss-pots" [...] located on street corners, where human urine could be collected for use in tanneries or by washerwomen.|$|E

This paper presents the findings of a research that was carried out to determine the effect of adding cow <b>dung</b> to <b>water</b> hyacinth on the biogas yield. Two drums, 100 litre capacity each were used as digesters in the laboratory experiment. Digester A was loaded with 8 kg of water hyacinth and 40 kg of water, this gave a ratio of 1 : 5 and the gas yield was measured daily for 9 weeks. Digester B was loaded with <b>water</b> hyacinth, cow <b>dung</b> and <b>water</b> in the ratio 1 : 1 : 10 which gave a ratio of the feedstock to water at 1 : 5. Results from this study showed that addition of cow <b>dung</b> to <b>water</b> hyacinth increased biogas yield as compared to single substrate feedstock. The total volume of gas generated from 8 kg of fresh water hyacinth was 7443 cm 3, and an increase of 35 % in the gas yield was obtained in the digester that contained 50 % cow dung. It can thus be concluded that there is an increase in biogas yield when cow dung is added to water hyacinth in the digester.

Toxicity differences of mixed milking parlor-stable waste water and waste water from {{area of the}} Veterinary University of Brno compared with cattle <b>dung</b> <b>water</b> and silage waste water were determined by both tests. Based on our results bacterial bioluminescence test toxicity should be recommended as a screening tool useful to ecotoxicity monitoring of different agricultural and municipal waste waters. Generally, toxicity and pollution load of municipal waste water were lower in comparison with tested agricultural waste waters. Microbiological investigation was specialized in identification of indicator bacteria groups (coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and enterococci) and salmonella in tested samples. The total counts of indicator bacteria varied from 102 to 103 colonyforming units (CFU) per ml in silage waste water, from 103 to 105 CFU per ml in cattle <b>dung</b> <b>water</b> and mixed milking parlor-stable waste water and from 105 to 106 CFU per ml in municipal waste water.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of organicfertilizers (cow manure + dung water; cattle slurry) applied in {{different}} annual doses of nitrogen (54, 84 and 120 kg/ha) by different intensities of grassland utilization (extensive – two cuts per year, medium intensive – three cuts per year, intensive – four cuts per year) on percentage of plant functional groups, dry matter yield, and forage quality. The study was performed on small-plot trial over 7 years on moderately moist grassland in the Czech Republic. The proportion of legumes was significantly higher in the treatments fertilized with cow manure + dung-water combined with medium intensive utilization and intensive utilization (10. 2 % and 10. 3 %, respectively). Fertilization significantly increased dry matter yields by 51. 9 % (cow manure + <b>dung</b> <b>water)</b> and 56 % (cattle slurry) compared with unfertilized controls (4. 81 t/ha). Grasslands fertilized with cattle slurry showed significantly higher concentration of crude protein (142. 9 g/kg) compared with unfertilized (126. 4 g/kg). Extensive grassland utilization significantly affected the increase of crude fibre concentration (up to 282. 1 g/kg), and decrease of the energy value (up to 4. 68 MJ g/kg of NEL). Organic matter digestibility was also negatively influenced by extensive grassland utilization (61. 0 %, 65. 42 % and 67. 44 % for the extensive, medium intensive and intensive utilization, respectively). Our findings suggested that medium intensive and intensive grassland utilization by the organic fertilization, which corresponded to annual doses of nitrogen of 84 and 120 kg/ha were the most suitable from the viewpoint of animal nutrition...|$|E
40|$|Two similar {{rooms were}} used to keep pigs on deep litter, one room with pigs on sawdust (litter S) {{and the other with}} pigs on a mixture of straw and sawdust with 50 % dry matter (DM) of each {{material}} (litter PS). Three batches of 17 pigs were reared in each room over the 14 -month period of experiment. The deep litters were started with a bedding of about 30 cm. Afterwards the amounts of litters used were adjusted to keep the pigs clean. Each week the litter S was manually aerated and manure incorporated in the litter. This work was not per formed with the litter PS. Both temperatures, relative humidities and ventilation rates were similar in the two rooms. The temperatures in the litters were continuously recorded. Ammonia concentrations were measured once a week using 8 -h diffusion tubes. Electrochemical probes were occasionally used to measure the NH 3 concentrations continuously, at l-h intervals, during 1 -week periods. NO concentrations were measured dul-ing all the experimental period with electrochemical probes. At the end of the experiment the amounts of litter DM used per pig were of 32 kg with the litter S and 40 kg with the litter PS. The litter temperatures measured at 20 cm depth varied between 30 and 37 degrees C. Heat evaporated the <b>dung</b> <b>water</b> and the DM content of the composts produced staid above 50 %. The amounts of compost produced per fattening pig were of 127 kg with the litter S and of 157 kg with the litter PS.

NH 3 emission was lower from litter S than from litter PS but small increases of NH 3 concentration until 50 ppm were observed during the work of aeration. Adding new litter decreased the emissions.
