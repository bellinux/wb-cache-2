Upon completion of the design I will <b>hard</b> <b>bind</b> the book, exploring a process that Hans Kellogg, my advisor has been interested in for some time and I thought would {{be a good way to}} finish the packet. This project will allow me to learn what it is like to fulfill the needs of a customer and delve further into the Adobe products. I will gain more knowledge of the programs that I will be using upon graduation and be able to show possible employers some of the skills that I have. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

50|$|Among the {{experiments}} of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as {{a succession of}} columns. (The Dead Sea Scrolls are a famous example of this format.) This {{made it possible to}} fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the folios, sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the papyrus or vellum recto-verso as with a modern book. Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios a codex to differentiate it from the case, which we now know as <b>hard</b> cover. <b>Binding</b> the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the case.|$|R

Herodicus compelled his patients to have their body rubbed, as he firmly believed in the efficacy of massage. Other advocates of massage application were Plato, Socrates, and Hippocrates. The letter said that [...] "rubbing can bind a joint that is too loose, and loosen a joint that is too rigid. <b>Hard</b> rubbing <b>binds,</b> soft rubbing loosens, much rubbing causes parts to waste, moderate rubbing makes them grow." [...] Hippocrates also suggested the direction in which to apply massage the art of rubbing up, thereby assisting mechanical and physical processes, aiding circulation, relieving stasis and consequently quickening metabolic processes.|$|R

An anticharmed resonance was already predicted, in a recent publication mostly dedicated to the S= 1 resonance Theta+(1540). To confirm these recent predictions, I apply the same standard quark model with a quark-antiquark annihilation constrained by chiral symmetry. I find that repulsion excludes the D*p (3100) as a uuddc̅ s-wave pentaquark. I explore the D*p (3100) as a heptaquark, equivalent to a N-pi-D* linear molecule, with positive parity and total isospin I= 0. I find that the N-D repulsion is cancelled by the attraction existing in the N-pi and pi-D channels. In our framework this state is <b>harder</b> to <b>bind</b> than the Theta+ described by a k-pi-N borromean bound-state, a lower binding energy is expected {{in agreement with the}} H 1 observation. Multiquark molecules N-pi-D, N-pi-B* and N-pi-B are also predicted. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, RevTe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHypoxia {{inducible}} factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) is {{a central}} component of the cellular responses to hypoxia. Hypoxic conditions result in stabilization of HIF- 1 α and formation of the transcriptionally active HIF- 1 complex. It was suggested that mammalian ARD 1 acetylates HIF- 1 α and thereby enhances HIF- 1 α ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, ARD 1 was proposed to be downregulated in hypoxia thus facilitating the stabilization of HIF- 1 α. Here we demonstrate {{that the level of}} human ARD 1 (hARD 1) protein is not decreased in hypoxia. Moreover, hARD 1 does not acetylate and destabilize HIF- 1 α. However, we find that <b>hARD</b> 1 specifically <b>binds</b> HIF- 1 α, suggesting a putative, still unclear, connection between these proteins...|$|R

Aluminum, for example, has been {{recognized}} as rhizotoxic for approximately 100 yr, {{but there is no}} consensus on its mode of action. The authors contend that the primary mechanism of rhizotoxicity of many metal cations is nonspecific and that the magnitude of toxic effects is positively related to the strength with which they <b>bind</b> to <b>hard</b> ligands, especially carboxylate ligands of the cell-wall pectic matrix. Specifically, the authors propose that metal cations have a common toxic mechanism through inhibiting the controlled relaxation of the cell wall as required for elongation. Metal cations such as Al 3 + and Hg 2 +, which <b>bind</b> strongly to <b>hard</b> ligands, are toxic at relatively low concentrations because they bind strongly to the walls of cells in the rhizodermis and outer cortex of the root elongation zone with little movement into the inner tissues. In contrast, metal cations such as Ca 2 +, Na+, Mn 2 +, and Zn 2 +, which <b>bind</b> weakly to <b>hard</b> ligands, <b>bind</b> only weakly to the cell wall and move farther into the root cylinder. Only at high concentrations is their weak binding sufficient to inhibit the relaxation of the cell wall. Finally, different mechanisms would explain why certain metal cations (for example, Tl+, Ag+, Cs+, and Cu 2 +) are sometimes more toxic than expected through binding to hard ligands. The data presented in the present study demonstrate the importance of strength of binding to hard ligands in influencing a range of important physiological processes within roots through nonspecific mechanisms. ...|$|R

In mildly acidic aqueous solution, each cationic pigment undergoes regioselective deprotonation to form a single neutral quinonoid base and water addition appears negligible. Above pH = 4, both PA 1 and PA 2 become prone to aggregation, which is manifested by the slow build-up of broad absorption bands at longer wavelengths (lambda >= 600 nm), followed {{in the case of}} PA 2 by precipitation. Some phenolic copigments are able to inhibit aggregation of pyranoanthocyanins (PAs), although at large copigment/PA molar ratios. Thus, chlorogenic acid can dissociate PA 1 aggregates while catechin is inactive. With PA 2, both chlorogenic acid and catechin are able to prevent precipitation but not self-association. Calculations confirmed that the noncovalent dimerization of PAs is stronger with the neutral base than with the cation and also stronger than pi-pi stacking of PAs to chlorogenic acid (copigmentation). For each type of complex, the most stable conformation could be obtained. Finally, PA 1 can also <b>bind</b> <b>hard</b> metal ions such as Al 3 + and Fe 3 + and the corresponding chelates are less prone to self-association...|$|R
40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{compounds}} that are naturally occurring biodegradable organic chelates (siderophores) that appear to be more effective at oxide dissolution and actinide complexation than EDTA or other organic acids now used in decontamination processes. These chelates <b>bind</b> <b>hard</b> acids [Fe(III) and actinides(IV) ] with extraordinarily high affinities. For example, the binding constant for the siderophore enterobactin with iron is about 1050, and its binding constant for Pu(IV) is estimated to be as high. Hence, this project is investigating the efficacy of using siderophores (or siderophore-like chelates) as decontamination agents of metal surfaces. The specific goals of this project are as follows: 1. develop an understanding of the surface interaction between siderophores (and their functional moieties), iron, and actinide oxides; their surface chemical properties that foster their dissolution; and the conditions that maximize that dissolution 2. develop the computational tools necessary to predict the reactivity of different siderophore functional groups toward oxide dissolution and actinide(IV) solubilization 3. identify likely candidate chelates for use in decontamination processes. To meet these objectives, the project combines molecular spectroscopy and computational chemistry to provide basic information on the structure and bonding of siderophore functional groups to metal (iron and uranium) oxide specimens common to corrosion products and scales on carbon steel and stainless steel encountered in U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The project explores fundamental scientific aspects of oxide mineral surface chemistry and dissolution related to chelate-induced solubilization. The spectroscopic and computational aspects of this project are complemented by macroscopic dissolution and solubilization studies of oxides and associated contaminants. From this combination of molecular, macroscopic, and computational studies, structure-function and structure-reactivity relationships will be developed...|$|R
