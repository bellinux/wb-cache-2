[...] The weeklong effort also involved shots taken in Kauai, Hawaii that are included in Gair's second book, Body Painting.

She was invited to speak to the Mattachine Society in the early 1960s, but her husband's stern disapproval of her activities began to take its toll.

500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"

500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that I was sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

500|$|Breaking {{was created}} in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa {{classified}} it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: [...] "I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [...] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard and all we did was add more flava to something that already existed." [...] Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves. Transitions from toprock to downrock are called [...] "drops." ...|$|E
