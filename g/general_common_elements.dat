40|$|To reduce study {{start-up}} time, increase data sharing, {{and assist}} investigators conducting clinical studies, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke {{embarked on an}} initiative to create <b>common</b> data <b>elements</b> for neuroscience clinical research. The <b>Common</b> Data <b>Element</b> Team developed <b>general</b> <b>common</b> data <b>elements,</b> which are commonly collected in clinical studies regardless of therapeutic area, such as demographics. In the present project, we applied such approaches to data collection in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a neurological disorder that involves multiple organ systems. To develop FRDA <b>common</b> data <b>elements,</b> FRDA experts formed a working group and subgroups to define elements in the following: ataxia and performance measures; biomarkers; cardiac and other clinical outcomes; and demographics, laboratory tests, and medical history. The basic development process included identification of international experts in FRDA clinical research, meeting by teleconference to develop a draft of standardized <b>common</b> data <b>elements</b> recommendations, vetting of recommendations across the subgroups, and dissemination of recommendations to the research community for public comment. The full recommendations were published online in September 2011 at [URL] The subgroups' recommendations are classified as core, supplemental, or exploratory. Template case report forms were created {{for many of the}} core tests. The present set of data elements should ideally lead to decreased initiation time for clinical research studies and greater ability to compare and analyze data across studies. Their incorporation into new, ongoing studies will be assessed in an ongoing fashion to define their utility in FRDA. Journal ArticleResearch Support, N. I. H. ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{introduce}} an iterative {{scheme for}} finding a <b>common</b> <b>element</b> {{of the set}} of fixed points of a nonexpansive mapping and the set of solutions of a generalized equilibrium problem in a real Hilbert space.

40|$|A typical representation, a {{regularity}} and {{an assertion}} of <b>general</b> outlines are <b>common</b> <b>elements</b> in Homer’s poetical devices. They reflect {{the success of}} certain forms which are useful to the poet, having been learnt by him and then repeated as techniques of the craft. All of this has bearing when applied to Greek tragedy within its historical circumstances and also {{taking into account the}} knowledge we have on how culture was transmitted in the Athens of the 5 th century. The situation in Athens, as far as general literary tradition is concerned, is similar in some ways to what is known about the learning of oral techniques of composition. Rhetoric is also a witness on the importance of the method of learning based upon memory; in fact rhetoric did nothing more than become aware of a series of resources which were common in its class, though not so in its particular varieties, to the different literary genres cultivated in Greece at the time. The problem we are faced with is to decide whether a specific training existed or not, to give would-be tragedians the means traditionally used in tragedy, or whether the normal literary education could have sufficed for a young Athenian to begin his experiments in tragedy. In fact the texts of the tragic authors show, apart from those resources common to all poetic literature of the period, special means which imply that a special training was necessary...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{aggressive}} mimicry, {{a predator}} or parasite imitates {{a signal of}} another species in order to exploit {{the recipient of the}} signal. Some of the most remarkable examples of aggressive mimicry involve exploitation of a complex signal-response system by an unrelated predator species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have found that predatory Chlorobalius leucoviridis katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) can attract male cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) by imitating the species-specific wing-flick replies of sexually receptive female cicadas. This aggressive mimicry is accomplished both acoustically, with tegminal clicks, and visually, with synchronized body jerks. Remarkably, the katydids respond effectively to a variety of complex, species-specific Cicadettini songs, including songs of many cicada species that the predator has never encountered. Conclusions/Significance: We propose that the versatility of aggressive mimicry in C. leucoviridis is accomplished by exploiting <b>general</b> design <b>elements</b> <b>common</b> to the songs of many acoustically signaling insects that use duets in pairformation. Consideration of the mechanism of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may illuminate processes driving the evolution of insect acoustic signals, which {{play a central role in}} reproductive isolation of populations and the formation of species...|$|R
