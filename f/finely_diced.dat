5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or <b>finely</b> <b>diced</b> {{and boiled}} in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, {{it seems to}} be detoxified. Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A.muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E

50|$|Banana roll or banana cake is {{a common}} Chinese pastry found in Hong Kong, and may {{occasionally}} be found in some overseas Chinatowns. The pastry is soft and made with glutinous rice. Ingredients may vary depending on location. Each roll or cake is a banana oil flavored circular tube or flat object, slightly bigger than an adult sized index finger, thus resembling banana. Sometimes it may have a cinnamon swirl filling. At other times it may have a filling that consists of a very ripe (but not rotten) banana <b>diced</b> <b>finely.</b> Occasionally the more traditional red bean paste may be used.|$|R
5000|$|Trimming {{the ends}} of the {{vegetable}} and the edges to make four straight sides makes it easier to produce a uniform cut. Trimmings can be used for stocks, soups, purees, etc. The measurement for julienne is 12 mm × 12 mm × 45 cm (0.040.08 in × 0.040.08 in × 1.62 in). Julienne usually applies to vegetables prepared in this way {{but it can also be}} applied to the preparation of meat or fish, especially in stir fry techniques. Once julienned, turning the subject 90 degrees and <b>dicing</b> <b>finely</b> will produce brunoise (3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm).|$|R

50|$|Saumagen {{stuffing}} {{consists of}} potatoes, carrots and pork, usually spiced with onions, marjoram, nutmeg and white pepper, {{in addition to}} which, various recipes also mention cloves, coriander, thyme, garlic, bay leaf, cardamom, basil, caraway, allspice, and parsley. Sometimes beef is used as well; a variant popular in autumn replaces {{some or all of}} the potatoes with chestnuts. The larger ingredients are <b>diced</b> <b>finely.</b> After that, the saumagen is cooked in hot water, slightly below boiling temperature to prevent rupture of the stomach. It is either served directly with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes or stored in the refrigerator for later use. To warm it again, the saumagen is cut into slices approximately 1/2 to 1 inch cm, which are then fried in an open pan. The typical accompanying drink is - in the wine region of the palatinate - usually a dry white wine, in the Palatinate forest to the west preferable a local beer.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} done to {{determine}} whether the Ca 2 +-activated muscle protease (CAF) that removes Z disks from myofibrils in the presence of Ca ~+ is located in a sedimentable subcellular organelle. Porcine skeletal muscle cells were <b>diced</b> <b>finely</b> with a scalpel and were suspended in 0. 25 M sucrose, 4 mM EDTA with a VIRTIS homogenizer. Filtration of the suspended muscle through four layers of cheesecloth removed most of the myofibrils and stromal protein. Nuclear (1, 000 g,vg for 15 min), mitochondrial-microsomal (50, 000 g, vg for 60 min), and supernatant fractions were assayed for succinic dehydrogenase, acid ribonuclease, cathepsin D, and CAF activities. Approximately 96 % of total succinic dehydrogenase activity, 81 % of cathepsin D activity, and 45 % of acid ribonuclease activity, but only 14 % of total CAF activity, were found in the nuclear and mitochondrial-microsomal fractions. Cathepsin D activity in the nuclear and mitochondrial-microsomal fractions was decreased if assays were done without prior treatment to rupture membranous structures; hence, our cell rupture and homogenization procedure...|$|R

In addition to the fish, the two most common toppings are potatoes (either sliced or mashed, often almond potatoes) and <b>finely</b> <b>diced</b> onion.
