It is further argued that the aim of our social and legal treatment of pedophilia should be to minimize harm to children, and that current practice is often counterproductive in this respect.

40|$|Reverse {{engineering}} {{of large}} legacy software systems is widely recognized to {{be a difficult}} problem. <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> By an argument that identifies key underlying sources of the difficulty, reverse engineering of legacy code is shown to be intractable in the usual computational complexity sense. This conclusion implies that we should not be too enthusiastic about the ultimate value of reverse engineering as the centerpiece of a cost-effective approach to constructing new generations of systems. Copyright 1994 by the authors. All rights reserved. THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY BLANK 1 1. Introduction Many large software systems, even if apparently well-engineered on a componentby -component basis, have proved to be incoherent as a whole due to unanticipated long-range "weird interactions" among supposedly independent parts. The best anecdotal evidence for this conclusion comes from experience dealing with "legacy" code, i. e., programs 1 in which too much has been invested just to throw [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Entrepreneurship {{students}} in numerous academic programs face {{a unique and}} arguably difficult assignment: that of creating a business plan. Unfortunately, some students purposely cheat, and others lack sufficient competencies in research and writing, such that they violate academic integrity policies. While plagiarism has been a hot topic in recent media coverage, and in education at large, there is scant research in existence to date that addresses plagiarism specifically {{as it relates to}} business plans and entrepreneurship courses. Numerous researchers have observed an overall increase in various forms of academic dishonesty as well as shifting attitudes among students. This paper discusses business plan plagiarism cases and methods by which they were detected and prosecuted through the Judicial Affairs offices at one institution. The author also provides a possible impetus and suggestions for future research as it pertains to a growing challenge for the academic (and practical community).

40|$|Government in the United States {{has some}} serious problems. At the federal level, {{is the problem}} of gridlock. The United States Congress seems unable or unwilling to do {{anything}} about anything (although it must have done something to run up more than $ 16 trillion in debts). Forget about addressing problems such as global warming, income inequality, failing schools, economic stimulus or you name it. <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> really? Has the United States become ungovernable, and is the Constitution to blame? In my view, it’s a mixed bag. Some aspects of the United States government work very well, others are disastrous and still others muddle along, could be better but function just fine. Further, it is difficult to pin some of government’s difficulties on any particular constitutional provision when the alternatives might be just as problematic. In this essay, I highlight examples in each of these categories and look at factors that might help us understand why things work as they do. Suggestions for change will be offered, often without considering political feasibility...|$|E
40|$|Many of us, at some point, have {{received}} a comment from {{a member of the}} audience, a reviewer, or an advisor who thinks the technique used is bad/biased/evil and who knows of some new fancy method that solves the problem. In those cases, you often want to know two things: 1) How big is the problem? and 2) Does that new fancy method actually work? In this talk, I will demonstrate how to answer these questions using the simulate command in Stata. I will illustrate using the following two examples: First, say we have a dependent variable that is collected not as a continuous variable but as a series of ranges, e. g., wage measured in categories ($ 0 – 5 /hour, $ 6 – 10 /hour, etc.). <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to assign each category its middle value and treat it as a continuous variable? How much better is intreg at dealing with this problem? Second, various approaches are proposed if we have missing data. The default in Stata (and most other packages) is to ignore all observations with missing data. Official Stata also contains the impute command, and there is the user-written ice command by Patrick Royston. This raises the question of which method is the best. ...|$|E

40|$|Motivation {{and problem}} {{definition}} One only {{needs to go}} to the local cinema to see the overwhelming dominance of American film. In most smaller cinemas, non-national European (NNE) theatrical works almost never hit the screen, and in the giant multiplex theatres, you will usually have a hard time finding just one or two foreign films that did not originate in the USA. Whereas nearly everybody knows the names and faces of Julia Roberts, Tom Cruise, Jennifer Lopez and Brad Pitt, few people can actually name any European stars who draw an audience. The same goes for Hollywood studios: even laymen could probably come up with ‘majors’, such as Walt Disney, Columbia TriStar or Warner Brothers – but would they have heard of Tobis, Gaumont or Pathé? And {{when was the last time}} that you, the reader, went to see a non-national European movie? There clearly seems to be a problem with the European feature film industry. Awareness of and interest in its works, like its market share, appear to be low. What is the actual state of the film industry in Europe? In other words: <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> really? Is its condition about to improve, or is it getting worse? Has there been an effort by pan-European organizations in general and the European Union (EU) in particular to set up public-aid mechanisms, and if so, what do they look like? The answers to these questions form the background to this article...|$|E

30|$|The {{cognitive}} debriefing {{resulted in}} the validation-ready Weight Related Sign and Symptom Measure, named the WRSSM (WRSM V 2), which {{is made up of}} 10 items using the same stem and response options. For example, respondents are asked, “During the past 7 days, because of your weight, how often did you experience joint pain (in any part of your body)?” Response options were based on a 5 -point Likert-type scale, which was chosen to ensure that meaningful distinctions could be made among responses for analysis while minimizing the cognitive burden for respondents completing the instrument [42]. Response options included the following: “Never/almost never,” “Rarely,” “Sometimes,” “Often,” and “Always/almost always.” A rating scale, which is frequently used to measure patient-reported health status and symptom severity, was used to measure the severity of respondents’ signs or symptoms [43]. Each item includes a sub-item measuring sign/symptom severity among those who experienced the sign/symptom in the past 7  days using a rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates “not bad at all,” and 10 indicates “worst imaginable.” For instance, for joint pain, respondents are asked, “If you experienced joint pain, <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> at its worst?” Respondents are then instructed to circle a number on the rating scale, which is consistent across sub-items, to indicate the sign/symptom severity they experienced in the past 7  days. The 10 signs or symptoms included in the updated WRSSM measure include shortness of breath, joint pain, low physical stamina, back pain, low energy, sensitivity to heat, trouble sleeping, heavy sweating, low sexual desire, and foot pain.|$|R
