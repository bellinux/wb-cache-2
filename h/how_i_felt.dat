500|$|Roger Ebert {{was among}} those who {{strongly}} supported the film, giving it a 4 out of a possible 4 stars and praising it for [...] "its heedless energy and joy, it reminded me of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's like a film that escaped from the imagination directly onto the screen, without having to pass through reality along the way".|$|E
500|$|After a {{slow start}} to the 2009–10 season, the Hornets fired coach Byron Scott. Paul stirred up {{controversy}} when he announced his displeasure with the move, commenting that team management should have [...] "consulted with me and asked <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> before it happened." [...] In early February, 2010, Paul tore cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for over a month by surgery, forcing him to miss the All-Star Game. In total, he played in only 45 games and his averages dropped to 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. Without Paul, the Hornets struggled, missing the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|... "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{generated}} controversy with label mate Nicki Minaj for the line: [...] "Not even talkin' to Nicki, {{communication is}} breakin' / I {{dropped the ball}} on some personal shit, I need to embrace it / I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it / Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'," [...] Speaking of the line, Drake {{said in an interview}} with MTV News: [...] "That line in 'Tuscan Leather' isn't exactly where I am in my life right now, but like a year ago...eight months, seven months ago, it was <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> I'd done something wrong, and I wasn't speaking to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big when I was writing it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the poem, {{the narrator}} expresses his hope that his child, Hartley Coleridge, will {{experience}} a life connected to nature {{as represented by}} features typical of the Lake District, which Coleridge in common with other Lake Poets revered. This is similar to what Coleridge's friend William Wordsworth does with the narrator of Tintern Abbey, a poem composed later that year. Many of {{the feelings of the}} narrator for his child are connected to Coleridge's sonnet [...] "To a Friend Who Asked, <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>Felt</b> When the Nurse Presented My Infant to Me". The ideas about nature in This Lime-Tree Bower are transformed into the basis for an education, and Hartley is to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. Coleridge's understanding of God is Neoplatonic and emphasizes a need to experience the divine knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about that relationship and how I feel about it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{for the next couple of}} days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E

500|$|Cudi also {{incorporated}} {{quotes from}} his favorite movies into the album, wherever he saw fit. The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So {{there had to be a}} way that I could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies. I put on Billy Madison and just watched that. There were so many lines that I picked that were great. But “I’m the smartest man alive!” resonated with me. And Adam Sandler is like a god to me. He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Lavender {{made his}} MLB debut on April23, 1912 as a relief pitcher in a 5–3 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates. On June28, versus the Pirates, he threw a one-hit shutout in a 3–0win, and {{collected}} three hits as a hitter. On July1, he shutout Pittsburgh once more, this time in a 12-inning, 1–0victory. He threw his third consecutive complete game shutout on July5, a 4–0victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Lavender took a 33-inning consecutive scoreless inning streak into his next start, a home game against the New York Giants and pitcher Rube Marquard. He gave up five hits and defeated the Giants 7–2, ending Marquard's consecutive win streak at 19games, {{which at the time}} tied the record for the longest streak in baseball history. The loss appeared to affect Marquard {{for the remainder of the}} season, though he regained his form in the 1912 World Series. During the 1913season, upon the ending of an 11-game winning streak by Washington Senators pitcher Joe Boehling, Marquard commented, [...] "I know just how Boehling feels. I know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> after Lavender beat me in Chicago last year after I had won nineteen straight, and I can sympathize with the Washington youngster." [...] Lavender would have continued success against the Giants throughout his career.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, you got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at another moment." ...|$|E
