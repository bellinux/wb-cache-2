40|$|International audienceThe {{problem in}} {{biodiversity}} monitoring and conservation is that usually exist vast gaps in available {{information on the}} spatial distribution of biodiversity that poses a major challenge {{for the development of}} biodiversity indicators and regional conservation planning. Within this context, models that establish relationships between environmental variables and species occurrence have been developed to predict species distribution over large areas. We present an example using two indicator bird species, Tengmalm owl (Aegolius funereus) and Pygmy owl (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum).</b> Maximum entropy (Maxent), a presence-only modelling approach, is used to model the distribution of these two species within a large study area in the French Alps. Despite biased sampling design, this method performs very well in predicting spatial distribution of the two owl species and brings useful information to help decision-making concerning the protection of valuable habitats...|$|R

50|$|A {{large number}} of the animals that live in natural spruce forest are suited to the special {{conditions}} {{of life in the}} higher parts of the Harz. Typical residents amongst the bird population include the crested tit (Parus cristatus), goldcrest and firecrest (Regulus regulus and Regulus ignicapillus), siskin (Carduelis spinus), treecreeper (Certhia familiaris), coal tit (Parus ater) and crossbill (Loxia curvirostra). Special mention should be made here of the pygmy owl (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> which is threatened with extinction and which lives in the submontane to subalpine zones within mixed and pine forests interspersed with open areas. They prefer spruce woods for breeding, but feed in more open stands of trees or on open moorland. Like the black stork, the pygmy owl had long since disappeared from the Harz, but returned in the 1980s of its own volition, as its ancestral homeland once again became more natural, so that there was sufficient food to support it (insects, small mammals and small birds) as well as standing dead wood (spruce trees with woodpecker holes).|$|R
40|$|Bird sound {{classification}} {{and recognition}} using wavelets In this paper a new method for automatic classification {{and recognition of}} bird sounds is presented. Our main idea is to study, how inharmonic and transient bird sounds can be recognized efficiently. The data consisted of sounds of eight bird species. Five species, the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the Graylag Goose (Anser anser), the Corncrake (Crex crex), the River Warbler (Locustella fluviatilis), and the Magpie (Pica pica) have inharmonic sounds, whereas the remaining three reference species, the Quail (Coturnix coturnix), the Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana), and the Pygmy Owl (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> have harmonic sounds. The wavelet analysis was selected due to its ability to preserve both frequency and temporal information, {{and its ability to}} analyse signals which contain discontinuities and sharp spikes. The feature vectors calculated with the proposed algorithm from the wavelet coefficients were used as the inputs of two neural networks, the self-organizing map (SOM) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results were encouraging, for the unsupervised SOM network recognized 78 % and the supervised MLP network 96 % of the test sounds correctly...|$|R

Dormice are found in the diet of 2 snakes (Vipera berus and V. uspis). 2 diurnal birds of prey (Buleo buleo and Aquila chrysaetos), 6 owls (Tyto alba, Strix aluco, Asio otus, Athene noctua, Bubo bubo and Glaucidium pusserinum) and 9 mammals (Rattus rattus, Ursus arctos, Cunis lupus, Vulpes vulpes, Martes martes, M. foinu, Meles meles, Felis silveslris and Sus scrofa) in a variable percentage of the prey taken. Only Dryomys nitedula was never encountered as a prey item. The most common prey is Muscardinus avellanarius.

40|$|Voles are {{the most}} {{preferred}} prey of Pygmy Owls (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> in Northern Europe, where the extensive snow cover may decrease the availability of voles. Snow cover may thus cause changes in the diet from what is expected {{on the basis of}} prey abun-dance alone. Food hoarding behaviour of Pygmy Owls was examined in relation to snow cover. Pygmy Owls hoard small birds and mammals in tree holes and nest boxes on their autumn and winter territories. During five winters, we examined hoarded prey items from artificial hoarding boxes provided to Pygmy Owls in central Finland. The most intensive food hoarding periods occurred before the fall of snow, during which 73 % of prey items were hoarded. Presence or absence of snow cover did not affect the number of hoarded birds, but snow cover dramatically lowered the number of hoarded voles. Pygmy Owls began to exploit caches before the beginning of the snowy season and stopped exploita-tion in spring. According to the high utilization degree of the hoarded prey, especially dur-ing the period with permanent snow cover, we suggest that the Pygmy Owl’s food hoard-ing behaviour acts as a buffer for seasonal variation in food supply. 1...|$|R
40|$|Assuming better {{colonization}} {{abilities of}} inferior competitors, the competition–colonization trade-off (CCTO) {{is one of}} the hypotheses that explains spatial variation of species composition in fragmented habitats. Whereas this mechanism may structure some plant and insect communities, ecologists have failed to document its operation in other natural systems, and its generality has been questioned. We combined fieldwork and published data to study the composition of a guild of passerines (Parus cristatus, Parus montanus, Parus ater and Regulus regulus) inhabiting 10 landscapes that differed in the amount of forest habitat. The species were ordered in a stable, well-defined competitive hierarchy, and the dispersal ability of each species was inversely correlated with its position in this hierarchy. In functionally continuous landscapes, superior competitors occupied most fragments and all guild members commonly occurred. The relative incidences of superior and inferior competitors were reversed, and differences amplified, in landscapes where patches were physically (distance) or functionally (matrix hardness) isolated. We found little support for two competing hypotheses, namely reduced habitat quality in isolated patches and lower abundance of a keystone predator (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> in fragmented landscapes. We concluded that the CCTO offered the most probable explanation for variation in the composition of the Parus guild across landscapes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAnimals possess various antipredator {{behaviours}} {{to reduce}} their risk of predation. Whereas most prey make considerable effort to avoid their predators, sometimes individuals approach and mob predators as a group. Among the types of predators that elicit mobbing, raptors such as hawks and owls {{are one of the}} more consistent targets. We conducted playback experiments to investigate the strength of mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk associated with either predator dangerousness or local pre- dation pressure. We ␣rst determined whether mobbing is speci␣c to dangerous predators or more broadly directed at predatory species. We experimentally investigated whether prey can discriminate the level of dangerousness of two owl species. Our results indicate that prey adjusted the strength of their mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk: passerine birds mobbed the Eurasian pygmy owl, <b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum</b> (i. e. a dangerous predator) but not the boreal owl, Aegolius funereus (i. e. a far less dangerous species). Second, we compared mobbing behaviour in similar habitats differing in predation pressure (with or without pygmy owls). Working on identical bird communities, we revealed that mobbing varied in relation to the local presence of the predator. Where the pygmy owl was absent, calls of this dangerous predator failed to elicit mobbing among passerine birds although they responded strongly to a playback of a mobbing chorus. This study provides experimental evidence that intense predation increases the expression of cooperative mobbing in passerine birds...|$|R

Two of the enclosures {{were covered with}} nets to keep out birds of prey, and two were left open to avian predation. A fence of metal sheet and continuous trapping kept out small mustelids during the breeding season. The only avian predators observed in the area throughout the year were the Ural owl (Strix uralensis) and the tawny owl (Strix aluco) and during summer the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). During autumn and winter pygmy owls (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> was present in the study area. No Tengmalm's owls (Aegolius funereus) were observed around the area.

An explanation could be that bank voles are only an alternative prey for avian predators when field voles (Microtus agrestis) have high densities in more open habitats at the same time. The heterogeneity of the habitat and the dominance of the Ural owl in the owl community could also play a role...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} to which extent local presence of large herbivore mammals (Alces alces, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, Dama dama and Sus scrofa) covaries with small rodents (Myodes glaerolus, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus? The hypothesis was that high abundance of wild ungulates would inhibit the density of small forest rodents. The data was collected during field work within FoMA (Environmental Monitoring Assessment) /SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Science). The Ungulate dropping inventory and rodent trappings, which is the base in this report, where performed 2012 – 2014 in Gnesta/Nyköping municipalities (G/N) with a relatively high density of wild ungulates and Vetlanda/Växjö municipalities (V/V) with relatively lower wild ungulate density. The results indicates that in the G/N area, forest rodent populations where less abundant than in the V/V area. It also shows that within some local areas (1 * 1 km) in G/N, with high wild ungulate dropping rate, the rodent catch frequency is lower than in areas with low wild ungulate dropping rate. Therefore, high wild ungulate populations may according to this study, affect local rodent populations. Due to this, wild ungulates also may affect the ecosystem on several other trophic levels. Inhibited rodent populations could on the second hand affect the specialist predators such as Tengmalm´s Owl (Aegolius funereus), pygmy owl (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> and long-Eared Owl (Asio otus). High densities of wild ungulates may also affect plant recruitment of oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) through high predation on seedlings and acorns. Rodents change the spatial pattern of their acorn caches and hence oak recruitment is negatively affected. However, more scientific effort is needed to get a clearer picture on this topic...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of four {{components}} of predation risk, namely predation pressure, spatial variation in woody cover, visibility, and flock size, on the behaviour of four species of the Parus guild (crested tit, P. cristatus, willow tit, P. montanus, coal tit, P. ater, and goldcrest, Regulus regulus) {{at the edge of}} patches of mature boreal forest. Birds used the exposed side of the edge (matrix) mainly during periods with low levels of predation pressure by pygmy owls (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum).</b> Some species avoided edges under low light conditions. Birds in large groups were more prone to cross the edge, whereas group cohesion increased in risky situations, especially in the most vulnerable species (coal tit and goldcrest). The effects of these three components of predation risk were not general in that only some species responded to them, and in that intra-specific responses were not always consistent. In contrast, all behaviours examined in all four bird species (occurrence, matrix cross- ing, edge crossing, and group cohesion) appeared to be strongly affected by habitat- mediated predation risk. Mature boreal forests appeared to be qualitatively superior to any type of matrix in terms of protection against predators. Birds generally avoided open matrix, and seemed to move towards and across more developed stages in forest regeneration according to the ratio between food intake and predation risk attributable to a given matrix type. Open matrix (farmland and clearcuts) and very young plantations strongly restricted the rate of bird movement between old forest patches. Our results contrast with the widespread thought that birds have a great potential to use fragmented landscapes in a fine-grained manner. These limited movements across the landscape during winter might have important repercussions on the occupation of some forest patches by tits, their subsequent reproduction, and in turn their population dynamics.

The body size data were reverse sexual dimorphism (male/female) in wing and the cube root of weight in Europen owl species. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify phylogenetic relatonships among owl species in the context of female biased body size using reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD). In the source article body size samples were selected with the following guidelines: that an adequate sample be obtained, where possible, weights from the breeding season were avoided because of the great changes that occur in the weights of females at this time, and where possible, weights and wing measurements were from the same locality or region because RSD in wing and weight appear to vary geographically. These samples were extracted from Cramp (1985). This article provides further information on female dominance in intra-pair interactions. The species listed in descending order of estimated relative female dominance: (1) Eurasian Pygmy-Ow (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> : If the male is next to the nest without food when the young are hungry, the female will drive him away.

40|$|The {{influence}} of felling {{on the distribution}} of rodents and their predators in a transitional coniferous-deciduous forest in northern Belarus was investigated in relation to stand age, forest type, and soil richness. The study was conducted in two areas differing by top-grounds (clay and sand soils) and, in turn, having different habitat carrying capacities. Three forest parts were investigated: 1) 10 %, 2) 20 - 30 %, and 3) 40 - 60 % covered by recent clearcuts. Three age classes of the clearcuts, namely 1) less than 2 years old, 2) 2 - 5 years old and 3) 6 - 12 years old, were considered. In total, we obtained data on small rodent numbers in 84 clearcuts, and the data on predators – in 67 clearcuts and the woodland parts differed by logging rate. Eventually, we became convinced that felling generally led to an increase in the abundance and species richness of rodents and their predators and that was attributable in the clearcuts aged up to 12 years. First, logging led to higher densities of Apodemus mice, the red fox Vulpes vulpes L., weasel Mustela nivalis L., tawny owl Strix aluco L., common buzzard Buteo buteo L. and adder Vipera berus L. Also, with the increased felling rate Microtus voles and the long-eared owl Asio otus L. penetrated in transitional woodlands. Too intensive forest harvesting (more than 40 % of recent clearcuts) led to the decline in the populations of several predatory species such as the pine marten Martes martes L., Tengmalm’s owl Aegolius funereus L., Ural owl Strix uralensis Pall., and pygmy owl <b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum</b> L. The decline in rodent predators found in the conditions of too intensive logging rate was different in the woodlands on sand and clay top-grounds. In the conditions of clay soil too intensive felling led to the pronounced decline of a marked part of the rodent predatory guild inhabiting woodlands, and the species densities decreased to the level that was lower than the initial one. Conversely, in initially poor habitats in the woodland on sandy deposits, logging of any rate led to the increase in numbers of rodents and their predators compared to undisturbed forest.

Many types of owl are taken and in Europe, the northern goshawk {{is the second}} most prolific predator of owls behind the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). In Bavaria, Germany, the 287 g long-eared owl (Asio otus) was the second most common prey species for nesting goshawks. In the Białowieża Forest of Poland, fairly high numbers of the 475 g tawny owl (Strix alucco) were taken. In all, some 18 species of owl have been recorded in the diet, ranging in size from the Eurasian (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum)</b> and northern pygmy owls (Glaucidium gnoma) at 58.5 g and 61.8 g, respectively, to all the large northern Strix owls including adults and even the 1400 g great horned owl. Whether adults have ever been killed as prey though is unknown but goshawks have been known to kill great horned owls that they’ve found near their nests. In addition, about eight species of falcon have been identified in the foods of goshawks. Adult falcons of small species such as kestrels and merlins (Falco columbarius) can be overpowered quite easily if they can manage to surprise the prey. Larger falcons have turned up in the diet as well, including the 720 g prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus) and the 966 g saker falcon (Falco cherrug), although possible only nestlings of these species. Brief aerial skirmishes between goshawks and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) have been described but neither species is known to have killed one another in the wild. [...] In Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, at least four small passerines species were recorded as nesting close to active goshawk nest, due to the incidental shelter that the fierce goshawks inadvertently provides from smaller raptors which are their main predators. Such raptors, including Eurasian kestrels, Eurasian sparrowhawks and long-eared owls, not only avoid goshawk activity where possible but also were found to have lower nest productivity any time they nested relatively close to goshawks per the study. A similar phenomenon, with goshawks inadvertently providing shelter to small passerines, has been recorded in North America as well.|$|R

The European raptorial birds most likely to attack prey of a relatively large size compared to themselves were the black kite (Milvus migrans), whose average prey was 35.7% of its own weight, and the Eurasian pygmy owl (<b>Glaucidium</b> <b>passerinum),</b> whose average prey was 31.7% of its own weight. On the other hand, when rabbit numbers were at their peak, the average prey mass in Spain may range up to at least 55% of the eagle-owls’ own body mass in that population. A raptorial prey comparison estimated that the mean prey weight for eagle-owls in Europe was 294.7 g as a mean among 5 main regions, the highest of any owl but similar or slightly lighter than the European average for northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) and considerably lower only than two widespread European eagles. Per that study the average prey weight of the great horned owl in 4 North American regions was much lower (averaging only 64 g). In Mediterranean scrub, the average mammalian prey of the Eurasian eagle-owl was nearly five times heavier than those of great horned owls from similar habitats in Chile, California and Colorado, where in combination the horned owl’s mammalian food averaged 230 g. However, a comparison between eagle- and horned owls based upon six comparable biomes in the Americas and Eurasia found the great horned owl’s prey averaged 372 g, improbably slightly higher than the eagle-owl at 327 g. If known Asian studies are mixed with European ones, the average prey weight for the Eurasian eagle-owl overall may also roughly be 372 g. Among sympatric owls in Europe, the mean prey weight of long-eared owls (Asio otus) was found to be 32 g, the tawny owl (Strix aluco) took prey weighing a mean of 34.5 g (though locally can be as high as 130 g) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus) mean prey weigh was 35 g. A study in Finland seeking to distinguish the differences in prey taken by females and smaller male eagle-owls found that the two sexes prey averaged 828 g and 575 g, respectively. The species taken as food by the two sexes there were largely the same but the female simply often caught the larger prey individuals.|$|R
