40|$|This thesis uses {{multiscale}} computational modelling to {{find the}} fundamental principles that govern defects forming during the operation of new electro-optical devices and the processing of spider silk fibers. The generalized approach developed in this thesis bridges engineering devices and biological processes based on liquid crystalline materials. Three types of defects are encountered: inversion walls, lines and points. <b>Inversion</b> <b>wall</b> defects {{are found in the}} electro-optical device when a nematic thin film undergoes a temperature-induced surface anchoring transition. Point defects naturally occur in the tubular extrusion duct of spiders, while line defects present close topological connections with point defects and are widespread in many high-performance industrial fibers. Three models are used in this thesis and their usage is dependent on the characteristics of the defects studied. In the case of <b>inversion</b> <b>wall</b> defects, computational modelling is used to verify, complement and analyze experimental measurements made with fluorescence confocal polarizing microscopy by our collaborator at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The various simulation results agree and explain very well experimental observations and provide a thorough understanding of the wall defects behavior. A computational technique is developed to enable the precise determination of the interaction between the liquid crystal and the device substrate. Understanding the behavior of wall defects and estimating interfacial properties are indispensable to the development and optimization of the electro-optical device as they affect properties like temperature of operation, switching voltages and response time. Computational modelling is also used to investigate the behavior of nematic point defects confined in cylindrical cavities as observed along spiders' spinning apparatus, and to examined textural connections with other well know structures seen in industrial fibers. The various scenarios investigated include: interactions between point defects, topological transformations between point, line and ring defects as well as interactions between ring defects. The simulation results agree and complement previous investigations but also offer a new fundamental understanding on the nature and stability of defects in cylindrical cavities. Understanding the behavior of nematic point and line defects in cylindrical geometries is important as they play a fundamental role in the processing of natural and industrial high-performance fibers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the structure, properties, and processing of various {{liquid crystal polymer}} systems. Morphologies of microphase separated side chain liquid crystal block copolymers are determined, both in the bulk and when confined to thin films. We show {{for the first time}} how these materials could potentially be used as a novel kind of surface stabilized liquid crystal display device. Magnetic field induced structures in a thermotropic main chain liquid crystal homopolymer were also examined. Defects in orienting fields are of interest because liquid crystal displays must be defect free over large areas. A study of the interaction of defects in an applied field yields information towards optimally processing these materials in order to minimize or completely eliminate these defects. The basic building block of the systems investigated is a liquid crystal mesogen. Liquid crystal mesogens are easily oriented by electric, magnetic, and flow fields and interact with polarized light such that they are desirable materials for display devices. Additionally, these systems are all polymeric, lending the complexity of the molecules' long-chain nature to the material properties, and the resulting processing challenges and mechanical advantages inherent to polymers. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) are the tools employed. Two-dimensional Ndel inversion walls formed in a nematic monodomain during magnetic realignment of a highly elastically anisotropic thermotropic liquid crystal polyether are examined via PLM and AFM. (cont.) he elastic anisotropy is defined as [epsilon] [approximately equal to] (kll 1 - k 33) /(kll + k 33), where kll is the Frank elastic constant for splay distortions and k 33 is the Frank elastic constant for bend distortions. For this polymer, [epsilon] [approximately equal to] + 0. 5; kll - 3 k 33. Following PLM examination, the detailed director patterns of these walls are imaged at high-resolution by AFM through a lamellar decoration technique, employed after walls have been fixed by quenching while under field. Walls form as closed loops comprised of a continuous <b>inversion</b> <b>wall</b> with antiparallel director alignment of the interior region with respect to that of the exterior. The energy of N 6 el walls is theoretically evaluated as a function of elastic anisotropy. In our experimental system, the energy of a splay wall is 17 % higher than that of a bend wall. The variation of the characteristic width of walls in this polyether as measured by AFM yields an effective elastic constant of 1. 6 x 10 - 6 dynes at 160 â°C. <b>Inversion</b> <b>wall</b> dynamics may be followed through time-under-field experiments. Loops coalesce, shrink, and smooth their curvature, occasionally splitting into a partial loop terminated by two opposite strength 1 / 2 disclinations. The observed more rapid shrinkage of splay distortion-rich wall segments as compared to that of bend-rich wall segments corresponds to the expected wall energetics based on the elastic anisotropy of the polymer.

40|$|We {{compute the}} texture of the <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> which appear in {{nematics}} in a magnetic field. In the isotropic case, where the 3 curvature elastic constants are equal, the Brochard planar description is correct. In the anisotropic general case, we find an unpredicted director rotation around the field, which minimizes the elastic free energy of the wall, by transferring some curvature distortion toward the lowest elastic constant curvature mode. This rotation is calculated to first order in the elastic anisotropy. By symmetry, the planar model remains valid when there is no twist in the wall. This rotation explains the recently observed twist of neutral axes along the <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> in lyotropic liquid crystals.

40|$|The {{structures}} and dynamics of disclinations and <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> in nematic thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (TLCPs) are studied principally by polarized light optical microscopy and by {{atomic force microscopy}} via a lamellar decoration technique. A schlieren texture composed of only integer strength point disclinations was created by thermal quenching from the isotropic state to the nematic state in a polyester TLCP based on methyl hydroquinone and 1, 10 -decane bisterephthaloyl chloride (MHDT). A first order red plate and quarterwave plate {{were used to determine}} the sign and structure of integer point disclinations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional disclinations {{formed in}} thin films of a {{side-chain}} liquid crystalline polymer are investigated using {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). The detailed director patterns are revealed through nanoscale stripes, which are parallel to the molecular director. One hyperbolic pattern of a negative disclination with a charge s) - 1 and three patterns involving radial, circular, and spiral director fields of a positive disclination with s) + 1 are observed. Positive disclination cores are found to exhibit circular dark centers while the s) - 1 is shown to have a bright central core. The difference in TEM contrast is attributed {{to the nature of}} the packing within the core. From the director texture around a disclination it is possible to determine the elastic anisotropy, which is not higher than 0. 1. Observing the time evolution of the disclination density, it is found that the average number of defects in the plane scales with time as N ∝ t- 3 / 4. It is found that both translation and rotation motions occur for a pair of (+ 1,- 1) disclinations, leading to the formation of a certain special configuration shortly before the pair annihilation. In some cases, not the pairs but the linear clusters of three-disclination dominate the interaction. Theoretical analysis is presented to explain this new phenomenon. In addition, director <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> are observed to form during the late stage of disclination annihilation. It is found that <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> always separate a pair of (+ 1, + 1) disclinations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{computer simulations}} and theoretical analyses of ordering processes in liquid crystals and polymers. One ordering process in liquid crystals occurs during the isotropic to nematic transition in which point and line defects form and annihilate. Monte Carlo simulations support the newly-derived scaling of the defect density, which {{was found to}} scale with time as $-$ 6 / 7 in both two and three dimensions, contrary to the mean-field result of $-$ 1. Frustration {{was determined to be}} a key factor in this difference. ^ Another ordering process in liquid crystals is the evolution of <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> and loops. Analogous to the model of a shrinking elastic loop in a viscous medium which has been theoretically investigated by deGennes and Brochard, our lattice Monte Carlo simulations of <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> and loops show the same scaling behavior with time and the same predicted dependence of shrinkage rate on the orientational diffusion coefficient. ^ Polymer crystallization constitutes the other major topic of this dissertation. The initial stages of crystallization are difficult to study experimentally but by using the united-atom Langevin dynamics method, single and multi-chain crystallization can be simulated. The simulations show that random fluctuations nucleate regions of higher order which in turn can induce further crystallization. Lamellar thicknesses obtained from simulations at various undercoolings showed the same scaling behavior as experimental data from literature. Besides homogeneous nucleation, secondary nucleation was also observed, with the newly-attached chains continuing to undergo conformational changes on the crystal surface. Finally, the phenomenon of lamellar thickening was investigated. Lamellar thickening was observed to occur cooperatively in a stepwise, quantized manner. ...|$|R

Depending on the strength and rotation frequency of the external field, various kinds of pattern formation were observed, e. g. ring systems which can shrink or grow. This contribution provides a theoretical examination of the effect. It {{is based on the}} usual Landau theory [2]. In particular, it is shown that the ring systems observed can be described as <b>inversion</b> <b>walls,</b> which exhibit soliton-like behavior 1. The analytical results are supported by numerical simulations. As a result, a qualitative and, to some extend, also a quantitative understanding of the complex behavior of ferroelectric liquid crystals in the case of inhomogeneously aligned smectic layers has been achieved. ...|$|R

40|$|Patterns {{formed by}} <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> in nematic layers {{exposed to a}} {{rotating}} magnetic field were studied. Dilute solutions of a mesogenic side group polymethacrylate in a low molecular weight liquid crystal (5 CB) were used {{in comparison with the}} pure solvent. As found in a previous work, in this system the intensity of backflow (fluid flow induced by director rotation) can be controlled by the polymer concentration due to a specific increase of shear viscosity coefficients. In the synchronous regime of director rotation no significant effects of backflow on the dynamics of the walls are observed. Dynamic solitons known from the synchronous regime were also found at asynchronous rotation, when soliton lattices are formed by continuous nucleation. Here comparison with theory for given values of the lattice period shows soliton currents significantly reduced by backflow. Two of the three additional pattern forming states exclusively found at asynchronous rotation were completely suppressed in solutions with sufficient polymer concentration. The third of these states is affected by backflow in the growth rate of its patterns. Numerical calculations were performed to explain behavior of the patterns in the asynchronous state.

Both polymers melted {{in the vicinity of}} 300 ”C, giving birefringent fluids. Optical microscopy showed Schlieren textures consisting predominantly of <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> characteristic of the nematic phase. The clearing temperature was in the vicinity of 460 ”C, but was accompanied by charring. DSC experi-ments showed a high glass transition temperature of 130 - 160 °C for both polymers. Crystal-nematic and nematic-isotropic endotherms were observed on heating; however, degradation took place near the isotropization temperature. Thus, on cooling, the sequence was reversible only if the previous heating was beyond the crystal-nematic but below the isotropization temperature. The polymers were stable in terms of gross weight loss until about 450 ”C, though there were indications that crosslinking occurred above about 400 °C over a short period of time. The polymers formed low-viscosity injection-molding compounds, but to use them effectively, it would require mold-gate designs that reduce the “jetting ” tendency for liquid crystal polymer melts, which result in weld lines. 0 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Spatial light {{modulators}} (SLMs) are two-dimensional programmable transparencies for wavefront control; however, {{a significant}} disadvantage of SLM {{technology has been}} {{the lack of an}} SLM that independently and simultaneously modulates a wavefront 2 ̆ 7 s amplitude and phase. To circumvent this limitation, indirect encoding techniques are used to provide amplitude and phase control; however, indirect encoding techniques increase the computational requirements and reduce the SLM 2 ̆ 7 s useable space-bandwidth-product. In this dissertation we use liquid crystal display fabrication technology to produce an SLM with independent control of both the amplitude and phase. This new SLM provides independent phase and amplitude modulation of a 100 x 100 array of pixels with greater than 16 phase modulation levels and a contrast ratio greater than 1200 : 1. Scaling to larger array sizes is feasible. ^ This research combines liquid crystal SLM technology, liquid crystal deformation theory, Fresnel image theory, and Fourier optics theory to solve interesting technical problems uncovered during this research. For example, the phase-only SLM was corrupted by liquid crystal <b>inversion</b> <b>walls</b> that formed near the pixel edges. These wavefront fidelity corrupting walls are experimentally characterized and then modeled. To avoid illumination of the walls, a Fresnel image array illuminator is used. Related Fresnel image investigations yielded new discoveries including a diagnostic technique for measuring the phase versus voltage SLM response, and a closed form relationship to describe Fresnel diffraction from spatially quantized tilt, spherical phase, and periodic grating transparency patterns. The diagnostic technique and the spherical phase modulation are experimentally demonstrated. ^ Application related demonstrations of the SLM include two-dimensional optical phased array beam deflection, two-dimensional programmable lensing using a single phase-only SLM, and high fidelity wavefront reconstruction using the combined amplitude and phase SLM. In these demonstrations, the reduced active area of the pixelized SLMs produces significant higher order diffraction lobes. A simple aperture filling phase plate, fabricated using binary optic techniques, is shown to minimize the higher order diffraction lobes. The wavefront reconstruction fidelity remains high with the phase plate. ...|$|R

A deformation, {{of the order}} of 10 (- 8) m in scale and having the periodicity of the domains, is observed at the surfaces by optical interferometry.

The matching of the crystal structures at the domain walls is studied by combining the hard x-ray Fresnel phase-imaging technique with Bragg diffraction imaging methods ('Bragg-Fresnel imaging') and using synchrotron radiation. Quantitative analysis of the contrast of the Bragg-Fresnel images recorded {{as a function of the}} propagation distance is demonstrated to allow the determination of how the domains are matched at the atomic (unit cell) level, even though the spatial resolution of the images is on the scale of micrometres.

40|$|Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory we {{describe}} 180 -degree domain wall structure, intrinsic energy and carrier accumulation in rhombohedral phase of BaTiO 3 {{as a function}} of the wall orientation and flexoelectric coupling strength. Two types of domain wall structures (phases of the wall) exist depending on the wall orientation. The low-energy 'achiral' phase occurs in the vicinity of the { 110 } wall orientation and has odd polarization profile invariant with respect to <b>inversion</b> about the <b>wall</b> center. The second 'chiral' phase occurs around { 211 } wall orientations and corresponds to mixed parity domain walls that may be of left-handed or right-handed chirality. The transformation between the phases is abrupt, accompanied with 20 - 30 % change of the domain wall thickness and can happen at fixed wall orientation with temperature change. We suggest that the phase transition may be detected through domain wall thickness change or by c-AFM. The structure of the domain wall is correlated to its conductivity through polarization component normal to the domain wall, which causes free carriers accumulation. Depending on the temperature and flexoelectric coupling strength relative conductivity of the wall becomes at least one order of magnitude higher than in the single-domain region, creating c-AFM contrast enhancement pronounced and detectable.

40|$|What we {{perceive}} as a unitary object {{can be the}} result of integrative processes that generate a whole from parts. Although this issue of visual perception has been widely explored, recent experimental findings demonstrate that our knowledge is still incomplete. In particular, the question whether contour binding is affected by the sign of contrast (contrast polarity) across edges requires more in-depth examination. Here we show the effects of edge bindings that origi- nate from the merging of laterally displaced edges with the same contrast polarity. We have studied a particular context in which such effects may emerge: a checkerboard with a series of alternated dark and light shapes superimposed on the corners of the squares. The phenomenal observations and experimental findings support the theories according to which boundary completions are originated by phenomena of edge propagation within a `field of completion' (eg Shipley and Kellman, 2003 Perception 32 985 ^ 999) adjacent to an edge ending. Our findings conform to the Shipley and Kellman theory that boundary completion results from the inter- action of edges as well as from edges and shapes lacking in oriented contours, the latter serving as `receiving units', anchoring the paths of activations generated by oriented edges. We propose to integrate this theory with the hypothesis that interactions sensitive to the contrast sign gener- ate conjunction paths of edges that alter their perceived orientation. Based on this perspective we propose an alternative account for the Cafe¨ Wall illusion that can be extended to other phenomena of orientation misperception and to a Cafe¨ <b>Wall</b> <b>inversion</b> effect that has not been observed previous...|$|R
