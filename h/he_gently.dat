5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. <b>He</b> <b>gently</b> but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E

500|$|Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review, stating, [...] "he utilizes his vocal range here, including the teasing falsetto with which <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> instructs his partner to 'take this pillow right here/If you bite it, they won't hear.' Bertoldi also complimented the song's production, commenting, [...] "'Neighbors' employs a knocking bassline and drip-drop effect {{to provide the}} ideal erotic backdrop for Songz's dirty talk." [...] She {{also pointed out that}} the song was inspired by Songz's [...] "stylistic antecedent", R. Kelly. Mark Edward Nero of About.com also said the song was R. Kelly influenced, calling the song among the album's best material. Nero said, [...] "Trey brags about how the people next door probably know who he is because his woman screams it during sex. 'While I be bangin' on your body, they be bangin' on our wall,' he sings. 'While they be dreamin', you be screamin', now they bangin' on our door.'" [...] Ready album reviews from Allmusic and PopMatters, noted the track as a standout, with Tyler Lewis of the latter stating the [...] "good" [...] songs like [...] "Neighbors" [...] and [...] "I Need A Girl" [...] "thump as they should". Ken Capobianco of the Boston Globe complimented the song's braggadocio along with [...] "I Invented Sex", however commented that the song was [...] "unintentionally humorous". Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said the album's hook-heavy and playful style was evident on the track and on [...] "LOL".|$|E

2500|$|... "Why Did The Fireman...?" [...] (season five, episode 18)– Laverne mourns {{the death}} of her boyfriend, {{firefighter}} Randy Carpenter (played by Ted Danson), who dies {{in the line of duty}} the night before he intended to propose to her. Laverne refuses to accept his death and waits up all night for him to return home from his shift. The father-daughter scene between Laverne (Marshall) and Frank DeFazio (Phil Foster), in which <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> consoles his daughter with the hard truth, is an example of the dramatic acting uncharacteristic of the series.|$|E
2500|$|After Madame Giry and Meg are {{dispatched}} to find help, Christine reveals to Gustave that the Phantom is his real {{father and the}} shocked boy flees ("Look with Your Heart" [...] (Reprise)). Christine tells the Phantom that her love for him will never die, then they share a final kiss and she dies in his arms ("Once Upon Another Time" [...] (Reprise)). Gustave returns with Raoul, who looks on silently and sadly, and Gustave lays his head on his mother's lap. The Phantom surrenders Christine's body to Raoul, then moves {{to the edge of}} the pier and collapses to his knees in grief. Gustave goes to the weeping Phantom, who sings to him, and the boy embraces his real father for the first time ("Love Never Dies" [...] (Reprise)). Gustave then removes the Phantom's mask, but does not react as he did before; instead, <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> touches the Phantom's face in an act of acceptance. Gustave and the Phantom gaze at one another as the curtain falls.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{characteristic of}} Ryelandt was his modesty. Although he enjoyed hearing his works performed, {{he left it}} to others—especially his teacher Tinel and Charles Lamy (pen name of Charles Martens, meaning ‘Charles, the friend ’)—to make his works known. As he put it: “If God wants my work to be known one day, that will happen. If not, what does it matter? The task of the artist is to create, and that’s it. Success is a luxury and a pleasure, it’s not indispensable.” He never bragged about the extra-musical honors that befell him. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> mocked them, like when, on being made Commander {{in the order of}} Leopold, he “complained” no one had told him whom to command. When he was very old, he told his daughter: “You must never call a priest or a doctor for me at night, not before 6 in the morning. Those folk need their sleep.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Bree is delighted, but {{insists on}} concocting {{a reason for}} Andrew's long absence. Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> brushes her off. Andrew has since got a job working at Tom's pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} capture {{this sense of}} innocence, Barton and Hall took what was {{considered}} a huge risk - casting an inexperienced twenty-two-year-old actor as Henry; David Warner. The gamble paid off, and Warner's Henry {{was one of the}} most celebrated performances in the piece, helping to establish both Warner the actor and Henry the character. Harold Hobson wrote in The Sunday Times that Warner [...] "discovers in Henry one of Shakespeare's greatest parts. The discovery is the more exciting for being improbable, since drama gives its principal opportunities to active men. Henry is never active [...] He suffers only, and endures, never resisting, never striking back [...] Yet [...] sad, distressed face, meeting each new misfortune with an absolute absence of protest or indignation, spreads over the darkest waters of the play a quiet and persistent golden glory." [...] Speaking of Henry's death, in which <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> kisses Richard after being mortally stabbed, The Observers Kenneth Tynan wrote [...] "I have seen nothing more Christ-like in modern theatre." [...] Writing in the Signet Classics Shakespeare edition of 1 Henry VI in 1967, Lawrence V. Ryan remarked that [...] "unlike the almost featureless, nearly imbecilic Henry of historical legend and of earlier productions [...] Warner showed the king as growing from youthful naiveté and subservience to the intriguers around him into a man of perception and personal integrity entrapped in and lamenting a world of violence not of his own making." [...] In his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of 3 Henry VI, Randall Martin writes [...] "Warner created a painfully shy, physically awkward, but ultimately saintly figure, who passed through agonies of doubt before reaching a Christ-like serenity. He characterised Henry above all through qualities of deep piety and lost innocence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{practice}} sessions—both on Saturday morning—were held {{before the}} Saturday late afternoon race. The first session ran for 45 minutes {{and the second}} lasted 30 minutes. A 30-minute shakedown session was held on late Friday afternoon without any major incidents but no lap times were officially published by Formula E. Both practice sessions took place in dry weather conditions. In the first practice session, Buemi used the full [...] available to him to record the fastest time of one minute and 1.998 seconds, seven-tenths of a second faster than López in second and Vergne third. Di Grassi was fourth-fastest, ahead of Rosenqvist in fifth and Bird sixth. Conway, Nelson Piquet Jr., Heidfeld and Prost rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Bird's car shut down because of a power failure at the exit of the first turn. He abandoned his vehicle {{at the side of}} the track, and the session was stopped after three minutes. Bird's teammate López caused a brief full course yellow flag period when <b>he</b> <b>gently</b> collided with the turn one barrier. He was able to reverse out the corner and drove to the pit lane. Esteban Gutiérrez went off into one of the track's run-off areas, and both Audi Sport ABT drivers locked their tyres, reversing out of the turn one escape road. Di Grassi recorded the fastest time in second session on a qualifying simulation with a late lap of one minute and 1.359 seconds; he was two-tenths of a second faster than López in second and Buemi was third. Daniel Abt was fourth-fastest; Bird was fifth and Rosenqvist placed sixth. Prost was seventh-quickest, Oliver Turvey eighth, Vergne ninth and Robin Frijns completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. During the session, where multiple drivers went deep into the turn one run-off area, Conway pushed hard, causing him to lose control of his car's back-end at the final corner. He spun but avoided damaging his vehicle.|$|E

60|$|She was too irresistibly beautiful, at that moment, to be reproved. <b>He</b> <b>gently</b> {{raised her}} from the floor--and owned the truth.|$|E
