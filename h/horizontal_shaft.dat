25|$|A Layshaft in a {{watermill}} is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{carrying a}} Wallower {{and one or}} more Spur Wheels. The term can also refer to a minor shaft driving machinery by pulleys and belts.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is turned}} by the wind, {{and through a}} bevel wheel drives a shaft inside the column (if used) or in {{the centre of the}} tower. At the lower end this drives a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> through a gearbox, which {{typically}} drives three throw pump.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} {{shuttle is}} a method to drive a bobbin on a sewing machine so as to create the lockstitch technique. Transverse shuttles carry the bobbin in a boat-shaped shuttle, and reciprocate the shuttle along a straight <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft.</b> As the earliest of bobbin drivers, the transverse shuttle was patented by Elias Howe on September 10, 1846.|$|E
50|$|The mine itself {{consisted}} of several vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts,</b> of which four vertical shafts, five inclined <b>shafts,</b> and ten <b>horizontal</b> adits remain. Tailings piles appear in several places, with quantities of machinery {{scattered about the}} site.|$|R
5000|$|Gold {{found in}} California is often in quartz, which is {{typically}} a hard rock, mined in vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts.</b> This contrasts with placer (loose gold, often nuggets) and fine gold {{that has been}} recovered by hydraulic mining.|$|R
50|$|Steel {{plates are}} used {{primarily}} on <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts,</b> but are used on vertical shafts occasionally. Doors are added if access is needed. Holes are {{cut into the}} plate to allow for drainage {{as well as for}} a bat entrance.|$|R
25|$|Brunel {{worked for}} several years as an {{assistant}} engineer on the project to create a tunnel under London's River Thames between Rotherhithe and Wapping, with tunnellers driving a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> {{from one side of}} the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer, and the project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company.|$|E
2500|$|Impact crushers {{involve the}} use of impact rather than {{pressure}} to crush material. The material is contained within a cage, with openings on the bottom, end, or side of the desired size to allow pulverized material to escape. [...] There {{are two types of}} impact crushers: <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> impactor and vertical shaft impactor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{work was}} carried out by hand, mainly using sledgehammers and crowbars, aided by {{gunpowder}} blasts. The work proceeded slowly at first; it took thirteen men five weeks to dig a tunnel with a width of [...] and a length of [...] The diggers were hindered by fumes and dust from the frequent blasting, so it was decided to blast a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> to improve the tunnels' ventilation. This was done and was found to have had an unexpected side benefit. Colonel John Drinkwater Bethune, who wrote an account of the siege in 1785, described how this came about: ...|$|E
50|$|A saildrive is a {{transmission}} system for a boat whose inboard engine has a <b>horizontal</b> output <b>shaft.</b> The saildrive's input shaft is therefore also <b>horizontal.</b> That input <b>shaft</b> is geared so as to drive a vertical intermediate shaft extending downward through the hull. The intermediate shaft is then geared so as to drive a <b>horizontal</b> propeller <b>shaft</b> mounted on a skeg outside the hull.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical transmission, which connects a motor {{inside the}} ship to the {{outboard}} unit by gearing. The motor may be diesel or diesel-electric. Depending on the shaft arrangement, mechanical azimuth thrusters are divided into L-drive and Z-drive. An L-drive thruster has a vertical input <b>shaft</b> and a <b>horizontal</b> output <b>shaft</b> with one right-angle gear. A Z-drive thruster has a <b>horizontal</b> input <b>shaft,</b> a vertical shaft in the rotating column and a <b>horizontal</b> output <b>shaft,</b> with two right-angle gears.|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} this work is {{operating}} characteristics of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafted</b> centrifugal pump (which has stainless steel wheel) which has been operated for 7 hours on the average. A closed circuit pump system (circulating within itself) which was formed by attaching a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafted</b> centrifugal pump {{which can be used}} in irrigation applications with a drum has been operated for 150 hours at laboratory conditions. To define the operating properties of the pump, its operating characteristics were measured in respect to ISO 2548. Furthermore, observations have been done to determine whether there is a connection between operating characteristics of the pump and the wear and corrosion occured on the wheel or not...|$|R
2500|$|Narborough Mill {{was a large}} three-storey {{building}} {{built in}} 1780. Charles Tyssen added an extension in 1845, but failed to provide adequate foundations, and the addition gradually sank until the roof collapsed in 1980. In 1887, there was an engine house {{on the front of}} the mill, but this then became a house for the miller. After the collapse of the extension, thirteen [...] piles were used to stabilise the rest of the building before restoration began. A [...] water wheel drove a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft,</b> which powered four sets of millstones, later extended to six. Although the mill ceased to operate in the early 1950s, most of the machinery remains intact.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} one of these strange {{openings}} in the earth which has a special interest, for it is the handiwork, not of nature, but of man. I had never heard of Blue John when I came to these parts. It is the name given to a peculiar mineral of a beautiful purple shade, which is only found at one or two places in the world. It is so rare that an ordinary vase of Blue John would be valued at a great price. The Romans, with that extraordinary instinct of theirs, discovered that it was to be found in this valley, and sank a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shaft</b> deep into the mountain side. The opening of their mine has been called Blue John Gap, a clean-cut arch in the rock, the mouth all overgrown with bushes. It is a goodly passage which the Roman miners have cut, and it intersects some of the great water-worn caves, so that if you enter Blue John Gap you would do well to mark your steps and to have a good store of candles, or you may never make your way back to the daylight again. I have not yet gone deeply into it, but this very day I stood {{at the mouth of the}} arched tunnel, and peering down into the black recesses beyond, I vowed that when my health returned I would devote some holiday to exploring those mysterious depths and finding out for myself how far the Roman had penetrated into the Derbyshire hills.|$|E

50|$|Since {{regional}} {{coal mines}} were constructed with <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts,</b> {{they were far}} less dangerous than the vertical shaft mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Still, the regional miners, blackened {{from head to foot}} when they emerged from a mine {{at the end of a}} day, knew that the carbon-filled air, which corroded the lungs overtime, would lead to an early death.|$|R
50|$|A breast-shot waterwheel, 18 ft by 23 ft wide, {{was built}} by Thomas Hewes.

50|$|The early mills had a {{vertical}} shaft {{to take the}} power from the flywheel. On each floor <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts</b> engaged with the main shaft using bevel gearing. American mills used thick leather bands instead of shafts. A new approach was to use thick cotton ropes. A rope drum {{was attached to the}} flywheel with a channel cut for each rope. The profile was such to give maximum adherence.|$|R

50|$|Boilers were of {{the wagon}} type; {{chimneys}} were square or rectangular, attached to the mill, {{and in some cases}} part of the stair column. The steam engines were typically low-pressure single-cylinder condensing beam engines. The average power in 1835 was 48 hp. Power was transmitted by a main vertical shaft with bevel gears to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>shafts.</b> The later mills had gas lighting using gas produced on site.
