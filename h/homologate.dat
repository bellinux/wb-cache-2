2500|$|The trisubstituted (Z)-alkene {{of first}} {{fragment}} was generated {{by using the}} Still-Gennari reagent. Gilbert’s reagent was then used to <b>homologate</b> it to an acetylene. Goekjian and Kishi method was then used to get the desired fragment, iodoacetylene. The same homoallylic alcohol was converted to diol in four steps. After oxidation to keto-aldehyde, it was homololated to dienes by a palladium-catalyzed coupling with vinylzinc bromide to generated the second fragment. [...] The six-membered ring subunit was transformed from an acetal, which was obtained by an intramolecular 1,4-addition of a presumed hemiacetal intermediate.|$|E

[...] Like {{previous}} GT3 models, it {{is a way}} for Porsche to <b>homologate</b> aerodynamic features for racing, as well as a starting model for customer racing. The 997 GT3 was priced at US$106,000. The engine has the same displacement as the Turbo, but without turbocharger and uses a new variable intake system. The engine is rated at [...] and [...] It has an 8400 rpm redline which {{is the same as the}} [...] Carrera GTs. The 3.6L dry-sump engine does not suffer from the rear main seal problems of the earlier 3.6L/3.8L integrated dry-sump engines.|$|E

A total of 2,501 were built to <b>homologate</b> the Donohue-designed rear ducktail spoiler and were emblazoned with his {{signature}} {{on the right}} hand side. Designed for Trans Am racing, the rules required factory production of 2,500 spoiler equipped cars. The original plan was to have all Donohue Javelins built in SST trim with the special spoiler, {{as well as the}} [...] "Go Package" [...] with Ram Air hood, a choice of a four-speed or automatic transmission on the floor, and a [...] engine with thicker webbing that allowed it to have four bolt mains. The cars could be ordered in any color (including [...] "Big Bad" [...] exteriors) and upholstery, as well as with any combination of extra cost options.|$|E

2500|$|The SR block {{also sold}} as a heavy duty racing block, which is speculated {{to be the real}} reason it was {{produced}} in the first place. It appeared in 1970 in time for the 1971 Trans-Am racing season, and was used in the factory Trans-Am backed cars prepared by TRACO for Penske Racing, with Mark Donohue the primary driver. Since it was a standard factory part it {{did not have to be}} homologated under T/A rules, and was not used in the 2501 [...] "Mark Donohue" [...] Javelins built to <b>homologate</b> the [...] "duck tail" [...] spoiler. Those received standard 360 or 390 engines, buyers choice. The only thing special about the Donohue Javelins were the spoiler and [...] "Mark Donohue" [...] signature decals. That makes it an easy model to clone, and makes it difficult for automobile collectors to identify original vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian born Australian {{touring car}} driver Allan Moffat was {{instrumental}} in bringing Mazda into the Australian touring car scene which ran to Group C regulations unique to Australia. Over a four-year span beginning in 1981, Moffat took the Mazda RX-7 to victory in the 1983 Australian Touring Car Championship, {{as well as a}} trio of Bathurst 1000 podiums, in 1981 (3rd with Derek Bell), 1983 (second with Yoshimi Katayama) and 1984 (third with former motorcycle champion Gregg Hansford). Privateer racer Peter McLeod drove his RX-7 to win the 1983 Australian Endurance Championship, while Moffat won the Endurance title in 1982 and 1984. Australia's adoption of international Group A regulations, combined with Mazda's reluctance to <b>homologate</b> a Group A RX-7 (meaning that a base number of 5,000 had to be built, plus another 500 [...] "evolution" [...] models), ended Mazda's active participation in Australian touring car racing {{at the end of the}} 1984 season. Plans had been in place to replace the RX-7 with a Mazda 929, but testing by Allan Moffat in late 1984 had indicated that the car would be uncompetitive and Mazda abandoned plans to race in Group A.|$|E
2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to <b>homologate</b> the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [...] {{there was a great deal}} of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240hp (119, 142, 164, or 179kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension, four speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.|$|E

2500|$|The Skyline GT-R Nismo, {{identified}} by the model code suffix [...] "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of [...] over the standard car. It existed to <b>homologate</b> a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the [...] "Evolution" [...] special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, giving a total production of 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 [...] "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular [...] "Nismo" [...] logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a 260km/h speedo, 3" [...] cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace, sports shock absorbers, 17" [...] alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with built-in tail light.|$|E

6000|$|There {{remained}} a third stumbling-block--the oaths to Government exacted from the established clergymen, {{in which they}} acknowledge an Erastian king and parliament, and <b>homologate</b> the incorporating Union between England and Scotland, through which the latter kingdom had become part and portion of the former, wherein Prelacy, the sister of Popery, had made fast her throne, and elevated the horns of her mitre. These were symptoms of defection which had often made David cry out, [...] "My bowels--my bowels!--I am pained at the very heart!" [...] And he remembered that a godly Bow-head matron had been carried out of the Tolbooth church in a swoon, {{beyond the reach of}} brandy and burnt feathers, merely on hearing these fearful words, [...] "It is enacted by the Lords spiritual and temporal," [...] pronounced from a Scottish pulpit, in the proem to the Porteous Proclamation. These oaths were, therefore, a deep compliance and dire abomination--a sin and a snare, and a danger and a defection. But this shibboleth was not always exacted. Ministers had respect to their own tender consciences, and those of their brethren; and it was not till a later period that the reins of discipline were taken up tight by the General Assemblies and Presbyteries. The peacemaking particle came again to David's assistance. If an incumbent was not called upon to make such compliances, and if he got a right entry into the church without intrusion, and by orderly appointment, why, upon the whole, David Deans came to be of opinion, that the said incumbent might lawfully enjoy the spirituality and temporality of the cure of souls at Knocktarlitie, with stipend, manse, glebe, and all thereunto appertaining.|$|E
