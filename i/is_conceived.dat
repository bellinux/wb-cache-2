5|$|Harmonic {{manipulations}} {{of this kind}} {{create a sense of}} standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of detachment, of entering a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm of dreams and memories (if the preceding material <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> as reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> as home).|$|E
5|$|In Jews' ears {{something}} <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> extraordinary {{from the}} name, {{which is in}} propriety but fungus sambucinus, or an excrescence about the roots of elder, and concerneth not the nation of the Jews, but Judas Iscariot, upon a conceit he hanged on this tree; and is become a famous medicine in quinsies, sore throats, and strangulations, ever since.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} chapter, the {{shortest}} in the Upanishad, {{the students of}} Brahman ask Yajnavalkya to recommend a hymn that guides someone to immortality. Yajnavalkya recommends the Satarudriya, the hymn with the hundred names of the god Rudra. This hymn is found in sections 16.1 to 16.66 of the Vajasaneyi Samhita in Yajurveda, and <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> as many epithets of Atman.|$|E
5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist. He argued that if something can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist, then something greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived.</b> Consequently, a thing than which nothing greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|R

5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then {{goes on to say that}} spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> in the image of a horse.|$|E
5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings in this project, from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and the collection <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E
50|$|Anselm of Canterbury {{composed}} the ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is by definition the being than which no greater can <b>be</b> <b>conceived,</b> and it <b>is</b> more perfect to exist than not to exist, that conceiving God not to exist <b>was</b> not <b>conceiving</b> God at all - it <b>was</b> <b>conceiving</b> a being less than perfect, which would not be God. Therefore, the argument proceeded, God could not <b>be</b> <b>conceived</b> not to exist.|$|R

5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> {{as a pair}} and {{intended}} to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E
5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a myth}} on {{the birth}} of Hatshepsut. In this myth, Amun goes to Queen Ahmose {{in the form of}} the Pharaoh Thutmose I and awakens her with {{pleasant}} odors. At this point Amun places the ankh, a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut <b>is</b> <b>conceived</b> by Ahmose.

5000|$|Before 1516, Luther's {{belief that}} Mary is a mediatrix between God and {{humanity}} {{was driven by}} his fear of Jesus being the implacable judge of all people. [...] "The Virgin Mary remains in the middle between Christ and humankind. For in the very moment he <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> and lived, {{he was full of}} grace. All other human beings are without grace, both in the first and second conception. But the Virgin Mary, though without grace in the first conception, was full of grace in the second ... whereas other human beings <b>are</b> <b>conceived</b> in sin, in soul as well as in body, and Christ <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> without sin in soul as well as in body, the Virgin Mary <b>was</b> <b>conceived</b> in body without grace but in soul full of grace." ...|$|R
