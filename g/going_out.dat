60|$|Now, as I said, it is insinuated {{that the}} <b>goings</b> <b>out</b> are many, {{answerable}} {{to the many}} ways which the children of men have invented to apostatize in from God. Christ is the way into; but sin {{the way out of}} the temple of God. True, I read not of a description of the <b>goings</b> <b>out</b> of this house, as I read of the comings in. Only when they had Athaliah out thence, she is said to go out by the way by which the horses come into the king's stables, and there she was slain, as it were upon the horse dung-hill (2 Kings 11:16; 2 Chron 23:15). When Uzziah also went out of this house for his transgression, he was cast out of all society, and made to dwell in a kind of a pest-house, even to the day of his death (2 Chron 26:21).|$|R

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s.

Madonna confirmed {{the possibility of}} <b>going</b> <b>out</b> on a tour as early as November 2005. Jamie King, Madonna's longtime collaborator, was then hired on to direct. The set list consisted of mainly songs from the supporting studio album and rehearsals started during 2006.

He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of their way to burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{had started}} <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast that she had been given the night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business.|$|E
5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C.

Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E

The match is notable for Mark Burchill's three goals scored {{in the space of}} three minutes, the quickest hat-trick in the history of a UEFA club competition. Celtic went on to eliminate HJK Helsinki in the first round proper, before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> 3–2 on aggregate in the next round to Bordeaux.|$|E
