The donation was later rejected by the group's fiscal agency, Sunset Youth Services, after the directors, Dawn and Ron Stueckle and Delvin Mack learned the nature of the donation source.|$|E
5|$|Using his wealth, Lilly {{engaged in}} {{numerous}} philanthropic pursuits. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> {{the management of}} the company to his son, Josiah K.

Colonel Lilly helped found the Commercial Club, the forerunner to the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce, and became the primary patron of Indiana's branch of the Charity Organization Society. He personally funded a children's hospital in Indianapolis, known as Eleanor Hospital (closed in 1909). Lilly continued his active involvement with many other organizations until his death from cancer in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Another Marcus {{contribution}} to the arts was his own work {{in the area of}} photography. Over the course of his adult life, Marcus took thousands of photographs, both of famous and anonymous subjects, which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> to granddaughter Allison V. Smith, a professional photographer, upon moving out of his Nonesuch Road home into a smaller residence in the late 1990s. Two years after his death, Smith began making digital scans of the photos and posting them to the sharing site Flickr; despite the fact that their authorship was not identified, within a year the photographs had drawn 10,000 views. For the 100th anniversary of Neiman Marcus, Smith and her mother, Jerrie Marcus Smith, decided to assemble a representative selection of the nearly 5,000 images into a book; titled Reflection of a Man, the 192-page book was published by Cairn Press in October, 2007, and accompanied by an exhibit at the Dallas Museum of Art.|$|E

5|$|At age fifty-eight, Baldwin {{desired to}} satisfy his nature {{of being a}} pioneer again by moving to Kansas, which {{was at that time}} a territory. He arrived as the brunt of the {{fighting}} in the territory was ending. Upon his arrival, he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory, which became the foundation for Baker University. He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck. On August 30, 1858, John's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days. Within a couple years, he laid out a town, built a grist mill and a saw mill, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea, although he continued to finance it.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits. He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E
5|$|The storm kept Calliope at sea {{the next}} two days.

Unable to find the anchor amidst the wreckage, and his ship having sustained significant damage, Captain Kane decided to return to Australia. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> Calliopes diving outfit to the US Navy to assist it in salvage, and received in return boats from the wrecked American ships to replace the boats which had been stripped from Calliope by the storm.|$|E

5|$|By 59 BC an {{unofficial}} political alliance {{known as the}} First Triumvirate was formed between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus, and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") to share power and influence. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of Carrhae in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed {{that he was at}} best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> control of his armies to the state, which would have left Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.|$|E
5|$|While {{president}} of Congress, Hancock {{became involved in}} a long-running controversy with Harvard. As treasurer of the college since 1773, he had been entrusted with the school's financial records and about £15,000 in cash and securities. In the rush of events {{at the onset of}} the Revolutionary War, Hancock had been unable to return the money and accounts to Harvard before leaving for Congress. In 1777, a Harvard committee headed by James Bowdoin, Hancock's chief political and social rival in Boston, sent a messenger to Philadelphia to retrieve the money and records. Hancock was offended, but <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> more than £16,000, though not all of the records, to the college. When Harvard replaced Hancock as treasurer, his ego was bruised, and for years he declined to settle the account or pay the interest on the money he had held, despite pressure put on him by Bowdoin and other political opponents. The issue dragged on until after Hancock's death, when his estate finally paid the college more than £1,000 to resolve the matter.|$|E
