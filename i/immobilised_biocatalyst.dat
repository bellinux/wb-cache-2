40|$|Background: The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the structure and function of enzymes immobilised on nanomaterials. This work will allow better understanding of enzyme-nanomaterial interactions, as well as designing functional protein-nanomaterial conjugates. Methodology/Principal Findings: Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were functionalised with amino groups to improve solubility and biocompatibility. The pristine and functionalised forms of MWNTs were characterised with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis was done to examine the degree of the functionalisation process. An <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst</b> was prepared on functionalised nanomaterial by covalent binding. Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase {{was used as a}} model enzyme. The structural change of the immobilised and free lipases were characterised with transmission electron Microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Circular dichroism spectroscopy. Biochemical characterisation of immobilised enzyme showed broader pH and thermal optima compared to soluble form. Reusability of the immobilised enzyme for hydrolysis of long chain esters was demonstrated up to ten cycles. Conclusion/Significance: Lipase immobilised on MWNTs has exhibited significantly improved thermal stability.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{formation}} and conversion {{of the most important}} flavour compounds, the real wort used in alcohol-free beer fermentation was mimicked by a complex model medium containing glucose, yeast extract, and selected aldehydes. The fermentation experiments were carried out in a continuously operating gas-lift reactor with brewing yeast immobilised on spent grains (brewing by-product). During the continuous experiment, parameters such as oxygen supply, residence time (Rt), and temperature (T) were varied to find the optimal conditions for the alcohol-free beer production. The formation of ethanol, higher alcohols (HA), esters (ES), as well as the reduction of aldehydes and consumption of glucose were observed. The results suggest that the process parameters represent a powerful tool in controlling the degree of fermentation and flavour formation brought about by <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst.</b> Subsequently, the optimised process parameters were used to produce real alcohol-free beer during continuous fermentation. The final product was compared with batch fermented alcohol-free beers using the methods of instrumental and sensorial analysis. Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republi...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{immobilisation}} in {{alcoholic fermentation}} {{has been extensively}} studied {{during the past few}} decades because of its technical and economical advantages over those of free cell systems. A biocatalyst was prepared by immobilising a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (baker yeast) on corn stem ground tissue for use in alcoholic fermentation. For this purpose, the yeast cells were submitted to the batch tests 'in situ' adsorption onto pieces of the corn stem ground tissue. Cells immobilisation was analysed by optical microscopy. It was determined that the addition of the corn stem ground tissue led to an increase of the pH value, total dissolved salts content, and sugar content in fermentation medium. The addition of 5 and 10 g of the corn stem ground tissue per liter of medium, increased ethanol yield, decreased amount of residual sugar and the cells immobilisation was effective. Corn stem is one of the abundant, available, inexpensive, stable, reusable, nontoxic celulosic biomaterial with high porosity, which facilitates the transmission of substrates and products between carrier and medium. The prepared <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst</b> showed higher fermentation activity than free cells.

In this study, {{the performance of}} the <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst</b> in the interesterification in solvent-free media of fat blends rich in n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFA) was investigated. The interesterification activity of this biocatalyst at a water activity (aw) of 0. 97 was similar to that of commercial immobilised lipases at aw values lower than 0. 5. Thus, the biocatalyst was further used at an aw of 0. 97. Response surface modelling of interesterification was carried out as a function of medium formulation, reaction temperature (55 – 75 7 C) and time (30 – 120 min). Reaction media were blends of palm stearin (PS), palm kernel oil and triacylglycerols (TAG) rich in n- 3 PUFA (“EPAX 4510 TG”; EPAX AS, Norway). The best results in terms of decrease in solid fat content were observed for longer reaction time (. 80 min), lower temperature (55 – 65 7 C), higher “EPAX 4510 TG” content and lower PS concentration.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of palladised Escherichia coli as a biometallic {{catalyst}} {{with a view to}} its use in deracemisation reactions. Some bacteria can reduce metals by their use as the terminal electron acceptor in the respiratory chain, and recent work using Desulfovibrio spp. has led to the generation of a palladium bionanocatalyst with superior activity to commercially available carbon-supported Pd(0) nanoparticles. This current study has investigated {{the use of}} formate as an electron donor for the reduction of soluble Pd(II) to insoluble Pd(0) nanoparticles by E. coli, and investigates the biological mechanisms responsible for the bioreduction, and for the extracellular location of the nanoparticles. Previous work has been done at the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre with the directed evolution of the monoamine oxidase enzyme of Aspergillus niger (known as MAO-N), which catalyses the oxidative deamination of terminal amines. The result has been to produce an enzyme with enhanced activity in the production of enantiomerically pure chiral amines. The modified enzyme catalyses the oxidation of the (S) -enantiomer to the corresponding imine, which is then reduced using a chemical reductant back to either the (S) - or the (R) -enantiomer, leading to an enantiomeric excess (e. e.) of the latter. After several cycles, enantiomerically pure amines are produced. In this study, E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing the variant mao-N-D 5 gene insert demonstrated good activity in catalysing the oxidation of the (S) -enantiomer of the secondary amine 1 -methyltetrahydroisoquinoline (MTQ) to the imine 1 -methyldihydroisoquinoline (MDQ), as measured by HPLC. The ability of E. coli to reduce Pd(II) to Pd(0) was exploited in order to use the supported nanoparticles in place of the chemical reductant, catalysing the reduction of the imine back to MTQ. Following five cycles of oxidation and reduction, racemic MTQ was converted to (R) -MTQ with an enantiomeric excess of up to 93 %. The activity of the biometallic catalyst immobilised in alginate beads was also assessed, and found to be the same as planktonic cells. The recyclability and long-term storage of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst</b> was also investigated, and it was found that freeze-drying maintained the stability of the beads for up to six weeks, which was the limit of the experiment.

40|$|During {{the last}} few decades, systems {{incorporating}} immobilised enzymes have been used prevalently in many industrial and commercial applications. Normally, enzyme-based applications are expensive and have limited operating times, hence low cost operating systems and reusability of the biocatalyst are valuable factors that need consideration. All biocatalytic coatings are composed of two distinct components, categorised as the catalytic and the non-catalytic component. In {{order to have a}} stable and long lasting biocatalytic system both these components need to withstand varying conditions and to operate synergistically. Two commercially produced lipases, Greasex (LIPHLL) and NS 81042 (LIPCA) were scrutinised for their ability to operate as <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts</b> in household based paint coatings. The two enzymes were first characterised in solution and in paint to determine their ability to withstand conditions that are considered foreign. The capability of these enzymes to withstand thermal denaturation was then analysed both in paint (in-can stability) and after entrapment in paint coatings, demonstrating significantly greater stability in the latter. The first part of the work described in this thesis was aimed at improving the thermostability of both lipases (the catalytic component). Chemical modifications were chosen over more expensive genetic modification techniques. The chemically modified variants showed improved thermostability both in buffer and in paint emulsion. The second part of the thesis addressed the modification and optimisation of the non-catalytic component (the support). Two strategies were successfully implemented to overcome the mass transfer limitations commonly experienced by many <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts,</b> including enzymes. The surfactant and solvent based improvements provided compelling evidence that they were practical approaches to direct the location of enzymes to a desired position in the surface layer of the polymer coating. The third part involved the use of the optimised lipase-based paint coatings to determine their detergency against natural substrates such as oils and ester/fat-based commercial stains. The lipase-based paint coatings indicated increased hydrolysis of oils and increased detergency towards the removal of ester-based stains on polymer surfaces. Overall, self-cleaning paint coatings were developed in this project to target fouling by fat material and these films offer great potential in a variety of applications and surroundings. It is proposed that the initial steps required {{for the development of a}} commercially available household paint with self-cleaning capabilities have been successfully undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Laccase from Pleurotus sajor-caju was immobilised on {{functionalised}} SBA- 15 mesoporous silica. The immobilisation process {{reached the}} equilibrium after about 100 min. In order {{to study the}} effect of loading (L) on activity of the immobilised laccase, the adsorption isotherm was built and {{the activity of the}} corresponding <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts</b> was determined. The activity of the immobilised preparations reached a maximum at L = 217 kU g(SBA- 15) (- 1), whereas higher loadings gave rise to a less-efficient biocatalyst. The immobilized laccase was used for the oxidation of a mixture of four phenolic compounds (protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid and caffeic acid) chosen among those present in olive mill wastewaters (OMWs). These compounds determine the phytotoxicity of OMWs. Different reaction rates were observed for the oxidation of the examined phenolic compounds. The biocatalyst was recycled and a conversion of 84 mol% at the 10 th reuse and of about 60 mol% after the 14 th reuse was obtained. In conclusion, the laccase immobilised on SBA- 15 is a potential biocatalyst for bioremediation of OMWs, which is an important environmental problem in the regions around the Mediterranean Sea.

Cell {{damage from}} {{hydrodynamic}} stress {{is an important}} consideration in biological systems since it can result in the growth and function of the cell becoming impaired (Toma et al. 1991, Lilly et al. 1992). In the extreme case of cell damage, cell disruption occurs. This dissertation {{presents the results of}} an investigation into the disruption of stationary-phase microbial cells in a stirred tank reactor when agitated in the presence of biologically inert solid particles in the absence of aeration.

40|$|Waste-generating {{industrialisation}} {{is intrinsically}} associated with population and economic proliferation. This places considerable emphasis on South Africa's water shortage {{due to the}} integral relationship between population growth rate and infrastructure development. Of {{the various types of}} industry-generated effluents, those containing organic pollutants such as phenols are generally difficult to remediate. Much work has been reported in the literature on the use of enzymes for the removal of phenols from these waste-streams but little application of this bioremediation approach has reached practical fruition. This study focuses on integrating and synergistically combining the advantages of enzyme-mediated dephenolisation of synthetic and industrial effluent with that of membrane teclmology. The ability of the enzyme polyphenol oxidase to convert phenol and a number of its derivatives to chemically reactive o-quinones has been reported extensively in the literature. These o-quinones can then physically be removed from solution using various precipitation or adsorption techniques. The enzyme is, however, plagued by a product-induced phenomenon known as suicide inactivation, which renders it inactive and thus limits its application as a bioremediation tool. Integrating membrane technology with the enzyme's catalytic ability by immobilising polyphenol oxidase onto polysulphone and poly(ether sulphone) capillary membranes enabled the physical removal of these inhibitory products from the micro-environment of the immobilised enzyme which therefore increased the phenol conversion capability of the <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalyst.</b> Under non-immobilised conditions it was found that when exposed to a mixture of various phenols the substrate preference of the enzyme {{is a function of the}} R-group. Under immobilised conditions, however, the substrate preference of the enzyme becomes a function of certain transport constraints imposed by the capillary membrane itself. Furthermore, by integrating a quinone-removal process in the enzyme-immobilised bioreactor configuration, a 21 -fold increase in the amount of substrate converted per Unit enzyme was observed when compared to the conversion capacity of the inunobilised enzyme without the product removal step. Comparisons were also made using different membrane bioreactor configurations (orientating the capillaries transverse as opposed to parallel to the module axis) and different immobilisation matrices (poly(ether sulphone) and polysulphone capillary membranes). Conversion efficiencies as high as 77 % were maintained for several hours using the combination of transverse-flow modules and novel polysulphone capillary membranes. It was therefore concluded that immobilisation of polyphenol oxidase on capillary membranes does indeed show considerable potential for future development...|$|E
40|$|Feruloyl esterases (FAEs, E. C. 3. 1. 1. 73, CAZy family CE 1) are {{enzymes that}} are {{secreted}} {{by a wide}} range of fungi and bacteria as part of the enzymes hydrolysing plant biomass. Under conditions of low water content, FAEs can also carry out (trans) esterification reactions. Thus, their potential use as biocatalysts for the production of antioxidants with applications in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries has been investigated in recent years. We characterised the biosynthetic potential of four new FAE enzymes from a thermophilic fungus. We focused on optimizing reaction conditions for the synthesis of ferulate esters with improved hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties; prenyl ferulate and 5 -O-(trans-feruloyl) -arabinofuranose, respectively. In addition to using free enzymes, we also immobilised them on the mesoporous silica material SBA- 15 with pore sizes ranging from 7 to 10 nm, to improve the esterification-to-hydrolysis ratio of the enzymes. It has been shown previously that immobilisation renders enzymes more resilient to adverse conditions and increases their productive life time [1]. Furthermore, immobilisation may also result in a decrease of unwanted side reactions (hydrolysis of transesterification) [2]. In agreement with that, we achieved a higher product yield with immobilised enzymes compared to free enzymes.

40|$|Bioethanol {{fermentation}} from non-edible lignocellulosic waste material, such as corn cobs, using immobilised yeast cells {{will greatly}} reduce waste, environmental pollution and the world’s reliance on crude {{oil and natural}} gas. Previous {{studies have shown that}} immobilised yeast cells are efficient biocatalysts for repeated batch fermentations and the continuous fermentation of beer and wine. Studies have also shown that immobilisation increased fermentation rates. Corn cob is an attractive feedstock and support for immobilisation because it is cheaply available and in abundance throughout the world. The Ammonia treatment process produced 47. 7 % more sugars than the Concentrated Sulphuric Acid treatment process and was therefore used in free and immobilised yeast cell fermentation systems using alcohol tolerant yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis. Immobilisations on solid delignified and untreated corn cob supports were carried out. Adsorption of yeast cells on delignified corn cob, suspended for 24 hours, in Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD) media resulted in the best immobilisation since it adsorbed approximately 11. 9 × 1010 yeast cells and was used in subsequent batch fermentations. The concentration of bioethanol produced from immobilised cell fermentation was 20 % higher than that produced from free cell fermentation. One ton of corn cob would produce 68. 4 L of ethanol using this method after purification. <b>Immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts</b> used in this study are efficient in the fermentation of bioethanol from corn cob and are worthy of further research in repeated batch and continuous fermentation processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of diffusion limitation on enzymatic kinetically controlled cephalexin synthesis from phenylglycine amide and 7 -aminodeacetoxycephalosporinic acid (7 -ADCA) was investigated systematically. It was found that if diffusion limitation occurred, both the synthesis/hydrolysis ratio (S/H ratio) and the yield decreased, resulting in lower product and higher by-product concentrations. The effect of pH, enzyme loading, and temperature was investigated, their influence on {{the course of the}} reaction was evaluated, and eventually diffusion limitation was minimised. It was found that at pH 7 the effect of diffusion limitation was eminent; the difference in S/H ratio and yield between free and immobilised enzyme was considerable. At lower pH, {{the influence of}} diffusion limitation was minimal. At low temperature, high yields and S/H ratios were found for all enzymes tested because the hydrolysis reactions were suppressed and the synthesis reaction was hardly influenced by temperature. The enzyme loading influenced the S/H ratio and yield, as expected for diffusion-limited particles. For Assemblase 3750 ? (the number refers to the degree of enzyme loading), it was proven that both cephalexin synthesis and hydrolysis were diffusion limited. For Assemblase 7500 ?, which carries double the enzyme load of Assemblase 3750 ?, these reactions were also proven to be diffusion limited, together with the binding-step of the substrate phenylglycine amide to the enzyme. For an actual process, the effects of diffusion limitation should preferably be minimised. This can be achieved at low temperature, low pH, and high substrate concentrations. An optimum in S/H ratio and yield was found at pH 7. 5 and low temperature, where a relatively low reaction pH can be combined with a relatively high solubility of 7 -ADCA. When comparing the different enzymes at these conditions, the free enzyme gave slightly better results than both <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts,</b> but the effect of diffusion limitation was minima...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to find an easy, generic method for protein refolding? The preparation of functionally active protein molecules from the unfolded state can be a difficult task. Although there are many well-established techniques for protein refolding, such as dilution, dialysis, chromatography and others, in many instances these methods can be time consuming and inefficient. A rapid, inexpensive and simple method for protein folding is a much sought after technique. Proteins in the unfolded state (either inclusion bodies or unfolded by chemical or physical means) are generally solubilised in solutions containing urea or guanidine hydrochloride. The removal of these molecules from the protein environment is commonly utilised as a method for triggering refolding. A new method for the refolding of biomolecular species has been developed via the formation of Protein Coated Micro-crystals (PCMC). The formation of PCMC is a recently developed method for the immobilisation protein upon {{the surface of a}} watersoluble excipient (salt, amino acid or sugar) via a co-precipitation reaction in a water miscible organic solvent. These proteins can then be used as <b>immobilised</b> <b>biocatalysts</b> in both the aqueous and organic phase. In the immobilisation of unfolded, solubilised protein, the solubilising agents (e. g. urea or guanidine hydrochloride) are removed from the protein environment as they are soluble in the organic phase. The removal of these molecules initiates protein folding during the coprecipitation process. In the course of this project, a number of proteins were studied in order to observe their behaviour in this immobilisation and simultaneous folding process. Lysozyme was utilised as it is an enzyme which is relatively simple to refold from the chemically unfolded state by conventional methods such as dilution. Upon immobilisation of lysozyme from the chemically unfolded state, up to 92 % of the activity of the native protein was regained. The enzyme lipase, which is notoriously difficult to fold, was also used to determine the efficiency of this method under more challenging conditions. Lipase immobilised from the chemically unfolded state was seen to regain up to 36 % of the activity of the native protein...|$|R

Different carrier materials were compared regarding remaining enzyme activity and storage stability. Immobilisation procedures involving support material activation using glutardialdehyde were found to result in low remaining activities.

40|$|Methods {{currently}} used for manufacturing the commodity chemical ammonium acrylate involve high temperatures {{that increases the}} risk of unwanted polymerisation and, in certain cases, leads to the generation of large amounts of unwanted by-product. The enzyme catalysed hydrolysis of acrylamide through to ammonium acrylate, however, may be carried out at ambient temperatures without by-product generation. Bioreactors operating with <b>immobilised</b> whole cell <b>biocatalysts,</b> have been examined as a means of producing ammonium acrylate. Studies with the amidase active C. nitrilophilus showed that entrapment in cross-linked polyacrylamide gel was the best immobilisation method, resulting in a biocatalyst with good physical stability without a serious loss in amidase activity. Immobilisation scaleup was possible {{through the use of a}} suspension polymerisation technique to produce cells entrapped in cross-linked polyacrylamide beads. The beads exhibited amidase activity after drying and rehydration. The loss in amidase activity was reduced by decreasing the drying time while storage stability was increased when the beads were dried to a low water content. Bioreactor studies were performed using C. nitrilophtlus entrapped in cross-linked polyacrylamide gel cuboids. The changing conductance of reaction solutions, due to ammonium acrylate production, was used as an on-line method of monitoring amidase activity. Interfacing the conductance monitor to the acrylamide feed system, via a computer, allowed a 0. 5 litre continuous stirred tank bioreactor to be operated at constant acrylamide and ammonium acrylate concentrations for several days at a time. It was shown that batch reactors were unsuitable for ammonium acrylate production as amidase activity was progressively and irreversibly deactivated in the presence of acrylamide and, to a lesser extent, ammonium acrylate. Amidase activity was decreased at lower reactor operating temperatures whilst amidase stability was increased. The automated bioreactor system was used to compare the stability of the amidase activity of C. nitrilophilus with that of two cell isolates: R rhodochrous sp. 632 and Rhodococcus sp. l 068. The amidase activity of R rhodochrous sp. 632 was shown to be the most stable. The amidase activity of R rhodochrous sp. 632 was found to be competitively inhibited by ammonium acrylate. Use of a fed-batch reactor for ammonium acrylate production was preferred over a continuous stirred tank reactor as the effects of product inhibition were reduced. Through monitoring of the conductance measurements, the fed-batch system was automated so that acrylamide concentrations were kept at a constant level. Operation of the system at different acrylamide concentrations showed that higher concentrations increased the rate of amidase activity loss. Bioreactor scale-up was performed by designing, constructing and operating a stirred tank reactor system with a 6 litre working volume. The reactor was operated in fedbatch and continuous modes using computer control, and ammonium acrylate was produced on a kilogram scale. Performance of the 6 litre reactor operating with R. rhodochrous sp. 632 immobilised in cross-linked polyacrylamide beads, was comparable to the performance of the 0. 5 litre reactor. Performance tests on polymers prepared from the bio-ammonium acrylate showed them to be indistinguishable from polymers of chemical origin...|$|R
