60|$|By Rome's dim relics there walks a man, Eyes bent; and {{he carries}} a basket and spade; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> impels him to scrape and scan; Yea, his dreams of that Empire long decayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} not this, reverend sir," [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "nor do <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> I can have now said or done, {{to draw down}} on me an admonition which has something a taste of reproof." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Jan {{stared at}} him perplexedly, but I smiled, for <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> was to come.|$|R
6000|$|My heart {{stood still}} within {{me at this}} chance of enlightenment. <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> he meant; so I called over the stairs to her, in a tremor of excitement: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> it all meant. A collision, no doubt. But I lay {{faint and}} ill, and knew {{nothing for the}} moment as to {{what had become of}} my fellow-passengers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, very soon--to-day, or to-morrow perhaps. So I am Rose {{till she}} comes back, and little did <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> I was undertaking! I never was {{properly}} thankful till now that I {{was not born}} a woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The chef paused {{before he}} added, [...] "I should go at Fane. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> he don't know ain't wo'th knowin', and I guess nobody else knows anything. Thea! I don't know but I said mo'n I ought, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay, stay," [...] {{said the}} Jew, laying {{hold of his}} garment; [...] "{{something}} would I do more than this, something for thyself.--God knows the Jew is poor--yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe--but forgive me should <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> thou most lackest at this moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will send}} {{to let her}} know. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> black ouzel 'twas! I mind how thou didst make the like notes for us when we were no bigger than my Giles!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{his action}} was so {{different}} from what I had expected, it amazed me. Just now, when I was with him, <b>I</b> learned, <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> <b>what</b> stayed his hand. I believe you ought to know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] and I {{produced}} writing {{materials with}} alacrity; for <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> {{he was going}} to do. He sat down, wrote a few lines, folded, sealed, and addressed a letter, and held it out to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "The way {{he looked}} at me, I was skeered stiff, an' I never said noth'n' more 'bout his sleepin' nights. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> made him mad was my sayin' he orter hev a doctor, 'cause doctors cost money an' Gran'dad's so poor he hates t' spend money unnecessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fact," [...] {{said his}} lordship, nodding. [...] "Mind you, I don't know for certain. As the girl {{says in the}} song, I don't know, but <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>What</b> I mean to say is, they seemed jolly friendly, and all that; calling each other by their first names, and so on." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} I was called away. As I went I heard Bastin muttering {{something}} about martyrs, but paid no attention. Little did <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> {{was going on}} in his pious but obstinate mind. In effect it was this--that if no one else would remove that idol he was quite ready to do it himself.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> that {{sentence}} meant {{to a man}} of his energies; but he had accepted it gracefully, and I was almost startled when he said: [...] "Do you know that I envied you, Ormesby, even when things looked worst for you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tripp {{pulled the}} bell {{at the door}} of the mouldy red-brick boarding-house. At its faint tinkle he paled, and {{crouched}} as a rabbit makes ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting-dog. <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> a life he had led, terror-haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies.|$|R
60|$|I {{nodded and}} turned cold {{all over my}} body, for <b>I</b> could <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> was coming.|$|R
6000|$|He put {{his hand}} on her head, and, looking down, studied her upturned face. [...] "Ah, my daughter," [...] he said with a smile, [...] "shall <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> has {{inspired}} you to-day? You have been listening to the passage birds. I also heard them this morning passing in flocks. And you have been following them in thought far away into those sun-bright lands where winter never comes." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not know}} for certain that Dian was there; but I surmised as much. Nor could <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> {{obstacles}} might confront me {{in an effort to}} rescue her. For a time I loitered about after I had the canoe at the water's edge, hoping against hope that Raja would return; but he did not, so I shoved the awkward craft through the surf and leaped into it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did I. An' {{until now}} I {{always thought it}} was a lark." [...] He changed his {{position}} on the maddening sand and sighed heavily. [...] "But we'll get used to it in time, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>What</b> other folks can do, we can, an' a mighty lot of 'em has camped out. It's all right. Here we are, free an' independent, no rent to pay, our own bosses--" ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN. Sit down, sit down. [Becoming himself again.] <b>I</b> can <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> {{you have}} come about.|$|R
60|$|Harold bit {{the hair}} that hung over his lip, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} {{found to be}} the truth, that his stepfather was no small trial to him; being, in fact, an unprosperous tutor and hanger-on on some nobleman's family, finally sent out by his patrons in despair, to keep school in Sydney.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Thuvan Dihn," [...] he cried, [...] "that {{this should}} have {{happened}} in the palace of thy best friend! With my own hands would I have wrung the neck of Matai Shang had <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> was in his foul heart. Last night my life-long faith was weakened--this morning it has been shattered; but too late, too late.|$|R
60|$|A {{woman and}} a man are coming through the great archway--and {{instantly}} <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> has happened. She it is arrests my attention first--long ago I knew she was a sweetly beautiful woman. She is fair, with frank blue eyes, that look {{with a sort of}} tender receptivity into her companion's face. For a moment or so they remain, greyish figures in the cool shadow, against the sunlit greenery of the gardens beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... "And all this, if you please, for Mr. Pinkerton's dollars!" [...] {{the captain}} {{suddenly}} exclaimed. [...] "There's many a fine fellow gone under, Mr. Dodd, because of drivers like your friend. What do they {{care for a}} ship or two? Insured, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>What</b> do they care for sailors' lives alongside of a few thousand dollars? What they want is speed between ports, and a damned fool of a captain that'll drive a ship under as I'm doing this one. You can put in the morning, asking why I do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|TROTTER. I {{withdraw}} [...] "I must say." [...] I substitute [...] "Blame my cats!" [...] No: I substitute [...] "Blame my kittens!" [...] Observe, Miss O'Dowda: kittens. I {{say again}} {{in the teeth of}} the whole Cambridge Fabian Society, kittens. Impertinent little kittens. Blame them. Smack them. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> is on your conscience. This play to which you have lured me is one of those in which members of Fabian Societies instruct their grandmothers in the art of milking ducks. And you are afraid it will shock your father. Well, I hope it will. And if he consults me about it I shall recommend him to smack you soundly and pack you off to bed.|$|E
6000|$|What {{else should}} he be set for, with his staff? [...] What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare [...] All {{travellers}} who might find him posted there, [...] 10 [...] And ask the road? <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> skull-like laugh [...] Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph [...] For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't like that," [...] Sadie answered, smiling uncertainly. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> you mean. I'll wait, dear, because I {{know you}} are going to make good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is so,' said Miss McCabe, 'and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> from <b>what</b> the marchioness told me, your reference, {{that you}} can keep a secret.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it shall}} not long {{continue}} thus," [...] thought Roland; [...] "I {{will not be}} all my life the slave of a woman's whistle, to go when she bids, and come when she calls. No, by Saint Andrew! the hand that can hold the lance is above {{the control of the}} distaff. I will leave them the slipp'd collar in their hands on the first opportunity, and let them execute their own devices by their own proper force. It may save them both from peril, for <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> they meditate is not likely to prove either safe or easy--the Earl of Murray and his heresy are too well rooted to be grubbed up by two old women." ...|$|E
60|$|On again, {{along the}} green trace, which rose {{now to a}} ridge, with charming glimpses of wooded hills and glens to right and left; past {{comfortable}} squatters' cottages, with cacao drying on sheets at the doors or under sheds; with hedges of dwarf Erythrina, dotted with red jumby beads, and here and there that pretty climbing vetch, the Overlook. {270} I forgot, by the by, to ask whether it is planted here, as in Jamaica, to keep off the evil eye, or 'overlook'; whence its name. Nor can <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> peculiarity about the plant can have first made the Negro fix on it as a fetish. The genesis of folly is as difficult to analyse as the genesis of most other things.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{knew that}} he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth, or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. Omne ignotum pro magnifico; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so {{important}} as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small. There we find that only one Black Sea bound ship go out with the tide. She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence to other ports and up the Danube. 'So!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office. From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine. He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same. And when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, {{and put it in a}} so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot. These be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>what</b> they mean. But nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jeanne Lange!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{with a world}} of {{bitterness}} {{in the tone of}} her voice, [...] "the girl whom Armand loved, it seems, with a passion greater than his loyalty. Oh! Sir Andrew tried to disguise my brother's folly, but <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> he did not choose to tell me. It was his disobedience, his want of trust, that brought this unspeakable misery on us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, though <b>I</b> little <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> awaited me there,' {{returned}} Kalliope; 'but we {{had better}} make haste, for it is late {{for you to be}} returning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man {{playing at}} see-saw, I {{took up the}} first volume once and looked it over, but I soon found it would not do; indeed <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>what</b> sort of stuff it must be before I saw it: as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant, I was sure I should {{never be able to}} get through it." ...|$|R
