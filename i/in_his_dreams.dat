5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} Softdisk in 1991 for DOS. It is the fourth episode of the Commander Keen series.

The game features Keen running and jumping through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them.|$|E
5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dreams.</b> Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E

5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>dreams,</b> the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E

However, with the Mirror of Ra, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dreams</b> again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E

5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>dreams.</b> Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

25|$|This {{theory can}} also be {{supported}} by neglect in dreams (Figliozzi et al., 2007).

Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E
