5000|$|The peg type {{casement}} stay has {{one or two}} pins or pegs {{inside the}} rebate. The stay is a metal bar with holes that fit onto the peg, and allow the sash window to be held open in various positions. The peg nearest the hinge can then {{be used as a}} fulcrum. Disadvantages of peg type stays are that the stay handle may protrude dangerously into the room. Another issue is the limited opening that can be achieved. They also rattle in the wind. The mounting plate on the bar connects to the bottom <b>rail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sash</b> window. [...] The pegs will be connected to a small plate that can be called a pintie plate.|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis is {{a highly}} {{regulated}} cellular process that functions to remove undesired cells from multicellular organisms. This pathway is often disrupted in cancer, providing tumours with a mechanism to avoid cell death and promote growth and survival. The putative tumour suppressor, SASH 1 (SAM and SH 3 domain containing protein 1), has been previously implicated in the regulation of apoptosis; however, the molecular role <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 in this process is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that SASH 1 is cleaved by caspase- 3 following UVC-induced apoptosis. Proteolysis <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 enables the C-terminal fragment to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it associates with chromatin. The overexpression <b>of</b> wild-type <b>SASH</b> 1 or a cleaved form <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 representing amino acids 231 – 1247 leads {{to an increase in}} apoptosis. Conversely, mutation <b>of</b> the <b>SASH</b> 1 cleavage site inhibits nuclear translocation and prevents the initiation <b>of</b> apoptosis. <b>SASH</b> 1 cleavage is also required for the efficient translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the nucleus. The use of the NF-κB inhibitor DHMEQ demonstrated that the effect <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 on apoptosis was dependent on NF-κB, indicating a codependence between SASH 1 and NF-κB for this process...|$|R

An ectopic expression <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 is associated with decreased cell viability of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the association between SASH 1 expression and the ultrasonographic features in breast cancer. Patients and methods: A total of 186 patients diagnosed with breast cancer were included in this study. The patients received preoperative ultrasound examination, and the expression <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was determined using immunohistochemistry methods. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between SASH 1 -positive expression and the ultrasonographic features. Results: The positive expression <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was observed in 63 (33. 9 %) patients. The positive expression rate <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was significantly decreased in patients with breast cancer (63 / 186, 33. 9 %) compared with controls (P< 0. 001). The positive expression rate <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was significantly decreased in patients with edge burr sign (P= 0. 025), lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 007), and a blood flow grade of III (P= 0. 013) compared with patients without those adverse ultrasonographic features. The expression <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was negatively correlated with edge burr sign (P= 0. 025), lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 007), and blood flow grade (P= 0. 003) of the patients with breast cancer. Conclusion: The expression <b>of</b> <b>SASH</b> 1 was inversely correlated with some critical ultrasonographic features, including edge burr sign, lymph node metastasis, and blood flow grade in breast cancer, and decreased SASH 1 expression appears to be associated with adverse clinical and imaging features in breast cancer.
