50|$|The yacht {{had three}} decks with the Jacobean style dining saloon, the early Tudor style smoking room and some {{accommodations}} {{on the main}} deck. Half of the lower deck was reserved for the owner and guest with six guest staterooms. The owner's apartments were created to resemble those found in a fine home ashore. The ship {{had a number of}} boats, the owner's thirty foot launch and a twenty-four foot crew's launch, two twenty-two foot life boats and an eighteen foot dinghy. She was powered by four Seabury boilers with two oil burners to each and two triple expansion steam engines with cruising speed of about 16 knots and range of 3,000 miles at that speed or 6,000 at 12 knots. Electricity was furnished by a 15 k.w. and a 30 k.w. General <b>Electric</b> <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> She was fully equipped for navigation and had a ship stabilizer as well as gyro compass built by Sperry Gyroscope Company. In 1925 the steam plant was replaced with two diesel engines. The ship had a crew of 39 and Curtis spent considerable time and did much of his business aboard.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to reduce sound {{radiated}} from a portable generator, a sound proof enclosure has been developed to absorb effectively the generator noise. This sound proof enclosure is designed and fabricated with locally available materials from the opinion of an idea which aims at easing the pains and stress of receiving the noise radiating from a portable <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The walls of the enclosure is fabricated by combining panels of foam, composite sawdust and grinded glass and an outer plywood with air trapped in-between the composite and plywood. A reverberation room method is {{used to measure the}} noise absorption efficiency of the enclosure using a 950 watts/ 220 volts rated generator to ascertain the enclosure performance average at 76. 40 % noise absorption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{large number}} of wind farms have been built in recent years, it is growing that the wind {{generating}} sets share of the total. On the other side, as the controllability of wind generating set is far weaker than the thermal generator set or hydro <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It leads to many problems for the power grid, such as voltage fluctuation or flicker generated {{in the process of}} continued operating or switching operation. It will bring a bad influence on power quality of local grid. Combined with practical conditions in Hebei Hongfeng wind farm, in this paper aiming at wind generating set output fluctuation, the reactive power compensation and the grid stability, mainly setting out from several aspects, analyzes the main reasons of grid voltage fluctuation or flicker caused by wind power generation. It is also analyzed that lowering the grid voltage instability...|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} British Magnox power stations, Hinkley Point A had {{numerous}} backup systems {{to maintain an}} excellent safety record throughout its career. Emergency backup systems consisting of 5 x 1,050hp English <b>Electric</b> 8CSV Diesel <b>Generating</b> <b>Sets</b> were installed at the station, which provided power to both reactors gas circulation systems if external power {{was lost in the}} event of a SCRAM.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} a growing concern over the {{increase}} in the use of <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> in Nigeria due to incessant power outages. These sets are either powered by Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or automotive gas oil (AGO) and their combustion usually generate compounds/products which have serious environmental consequences. To this end, these products were combusted in a specially fabricated combustion chamber in order to determine their pollution potentials. The combustion effluents as well as particulate matter were trapped in dichloromethane and the resulting solution filtered to recover the particulate matter which represents the actual quantity of particulate matter librated into the atmosphere, when a given quantity of refined product is combusted. PMS yielded 1. 9 g/l while AGO yielded 2. 7 g/l of particulate matter. The recovered particulates and combustion residues were separately subjected to soxhlet extraction using dichloromethane as solvent. The extracts and effluents were concentrated and analyzed via flame ionization detector chromatography. The chromatograms show evidence of Polyaromatic hydrocarbons of retention times ranging from 8. 800 to 26. 999 mins. These results obtained {{go a long way in}} giving some insights into the extent of pollution generated from the combustion of the selected petroleum products...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} the dynamic performance of a complete hydro <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> under conditions of balanced three phase operation. The hydro generating set, or system, under consideration has been limited to a single synchronous generator, its control devices a shunt load at its terminals and a balanced three phase transmission line terminating at an infinite bus. Fig. 1. 1 is an overall block diagram of this system. The system as shown in fig. 1. 1 is a good representation of an isolated power station supplying power to a large central system via a high voltage transmission line, since the shunt load at the sending end of the line can be used to represent line changing capacitance as well as the local load. In this thesis a general analysis of this system will be produced and a means of reducing this general analysis down to any of the common special cases, such as voltage regulated synchronous machine connected to an infinite bus, will be provided...|$|E

The New York Department of Public Service and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation adopted implementing regulations on July 17, 2012: Chapter X Certification of Major <b>Electric</b> <b>Generating</b> Facilities,16 NYCRR Part 1000 and Analyzing Environmental Justice Issues in Siting of Major <b>Electric</b> <b>Generating</b> Facilities, 6 NYCRR Part 487. After July 17, 2012, all applicants for permits to construct major <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> facilities must follow Article 10. In addition, applicants who had applied for permits or licenses before that date, along with applicants for permits or licenses for certain other types of <b>electric</b> <b>generating</b> facilities excluded from Article 10, may elect to follow Article 10.|$|R
