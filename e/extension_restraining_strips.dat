40|$|AbstractMany {{factors like}} {{nonlinear}} material properties, cracking of concrete, creep and shrinkage of concrete are the parameters which influence the deflections of slab strips. The literature review {{points out that}} analytical methods are required to predict the entire load deflection behaviour of <b>restrained</b> slab <b>strips</b> under short term loading. A method is proposed to predict the same for Traditionally Vibrated Concrete (TVC) and Geopolymer Concrete (GPC) slabs. The results are compared with the prediction of Rankine et al and Eyre and Kemp. The {{results show that the}} proposed method is able to predict the load deflection behaviour satisfactorily of <b>restrained</b> TVC/GPC slab <b>strips...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{uniaxial}} compressive {{tests on the}} frozen PMMA with pre-existing 3 D cracks were performed in laboratory to investigate the mechanisms of crack propagation and coalescence in brittle materials. It is found that for 3 D surface cracks, the interactions of cracks affect crack growth and extension in two aspects, i. e. the interaction either prompting crack <b>extension</b> or <b>restraining</b> it. The mechanism of crack interaction depends mainly on the location of cracks in spatial domain. The propagation and coalescence of 3 D surface cracks are dependent on the crack depth and the crack configuration. The test results are helpful to more understanding of the failure mechanism of brittle materials including PMMA and also {{to the study of}} the failure mechanism of rock under loading.

40|$|This report {{covers a}} series of tests on thin flat elastic <b>strips</b> <b>restrained</b> at two {{parallel}} edges and subjected to shear by conversely directed stresses. Theoretical treatments, particularly those of Lilly, Southwell and Skan, and Timoshenko are briefly outlined. The problem to be solved by these tests was to find out whether, and to what extent the conditions and assumptions upon which the calculations are based are complied with in the tests. Three materials were used: celluloid, duralumin, brass. Owing to the high elastic deformability of celluloid, it was not only possible to observe the beginning but also to ascertain the type of deflection. The test data on celluloid was affirmed by the experiments with duralumin and brass...|$|R
40|$|A {{quasi-static}} {{analysis is}} presented for foil journal bearings {{designed for a}} NASA Brayton Cycle Turboalternator. Included in the analysis are effects of 'slack' (due to flexural rigidity of the foil), of frictionally <b>restrained</b> <b>extension</b> of the foil-length in contact with cylindrical guides, of fluid inertia and compressibility, and of thermal expansion of rotor, foil and supporting structure. Comparisons are made with results of early experiments performed by Licht (1968, 1969) and recent data of Licht and Branger (1973). Variatons of film thickness, foil tension and bearing stiffness are presented graphically as functions of pertinent parameters for the case of operation in zero-gravity environment...|$|R
40|$|The drawbeads in {{stamping}} {{tools are}} usually designed {{based on experience}} from the forming of steel. However, aluminium alloys display different forming behaviour to steels, which is not reflected in the drawbead design for tools used for stamping aluminium. This paper presents experimental results from different semi-circular drawbead geometries commonly encountered in automotive dies and compares them to those obtained from Stoughton's analytical drawbead model and the 2 D plane strain drawbead model set up using LS-DYNA. The study was conducted on lubricated NG 5754 strips. The results presented are in terms of drawbead <b>restraining</b> force versus <b>strip</b> displacement, {{as a function of}} drawbead depth. The FE drawbead model agrees well with the experiments whereas the analytical model overpredicted the drawbead forces. ...|$|R
40|$|Micro-cracks in {{tin oxide}} thin film may cause bad {{stability}} to the micro-hotplate (MHP) gas sensor, especially at high operation temperature or in moisture ambience. In {{order to reduce}} micro-cracks, tin oxide thin films on a 2 x 2 MHP gas sensor array are patterned as narrow strips. It is proved by SEM that micro-cracks induced by thermal stress can be greatly <b>restrained</b> in narrow <b>strip</b> shape films comparing with the traditional rectangle board film. Stability of the MHP sensors with narrow strip films was characterized by testing their resistance in air for 60 h, and their responses respectively to methane and carbon monoxide for 300 h. The {{results show that the}} strip shape SnO 2 films are really helpful to enhance stability of the MHP gas sensors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{reported}} {{on the use of}} experimental procedures dealing with these behavioural skills in the assessment of pesticide effects. The relevance of the following methods are discussed: (1) use of automatic activity counters set at the hive entrance to establish the balance between outgoing and incoming worker bees; (2) observation of the homing flights of bees; (3) the analysis of the information encoded in the dances of returning foragers; and (4) recording of the conditioned proboscis <b>extension</b> response on <b>restrained</b> bees to evaluate individual learning performances involved in foraging behaviour. These behavioural assays could be developed for sublethal toxicity assessment. However, careful validation of the tests is needed before being used in a routine evaluation procedure. At a minimum, they are valuable tools to understand the mechanisms underlying insecticide toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 654 on 27. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) An elastic analysis of <b>restrained</b> slab <b>strips</b> shows that membrane action enhances serviceability behaviour. However, the enhancement {{is not as}} great as for strength and serviceability is critical when membrane action is considered in design. A relatively simple form of non-linear finite element analysis is developed which is able to model bridge deck behaviour allowing for membrane action. This reduces some of the disadvantages of non-linear analysis which have prevented its use in practice. It uses line elements but, because of novel features of the elements and because it considers all {{six degrees of freedom}} at each node, it is still able to model in-plane forces reasonably realistically. It gives acceptable predictions for behaviour. The tension stiffening functions used in non-linear analysis, which are important to the prediction of restraint, are considered. Explanations are proposed for several aspects of the behaviour and a new function is developed. This gives better results than previous expressions, particularly for deflections on unloading and reloading. Tests under full HB load have been performed on two half scale bridges. These, and the analysis, show that conventional design methods for deck slab reinforcement are very conservative. They also show that the restraint required to develop membrane action is not dependent on diaphragms; it comes from under-stressed material surrounding the critical areas. Thus, over much of a bridge's span, there is transverse tension in the slab and membrane action does not significantly enhance the resistance to global moments. Both bridge models failed by a wheel punching through the slab. It is shown that these were primarily brittle bending compression failures which were strongly influenced by global behaviour. This is confirmed both by the analysis and by the higher wheel load at failure in single wheel tests. Recommendations are made for using the results in design and assessment.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Complex odor {{recognition}} in the honeybee was investigated using two behavioral assays: (1) the conditioning of the proboscis <b>extension</b> (CPE) with <b>restrained</b> individuals, and (2) the observation of foragers visiting an artificial feeder in a flight room. Nine compounds, previously identified as oilseed rape flower volatiles, were tested either individually or in mixtures. Different sets of experiments were done to determine: (1) the acquisition rate of the nine compounds in the CPE assay, and (2) the discrimination of the individual compounds after conditioning to a mixture, using the CPE assay and free-flying foragers. After conditioning to a complex mixture, honeybees established a hierarchy among the components, {{with some of them}} accounting for {{a major part of the}} behavioral activity of the mixture. Both behavioral assays led to the same classification of compounds, indicating good agreement between discriminating abilities of restrained individuals and of a population of foragers. The key compounds for recognition of these mixtures were those that were well learned when presented individually. However, the recognition of some compounds was affected by the other components of the mixture, with the activity of some compounds being either enhanced or reduced. Key Wordsâ€”Honeybee, Apis mellifera, Hymenoptera, Apidae, conditioned proboscis extension, free-flying foragers, olfactory discrimination, floral volatiles. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

40|$|Early reports {{indicate}} that trophallaxis, i. e. the exchange of liquid food by mouth, may allow honeybees to assign nectar odours with predictive values to anticipate biological meaningful reward stimuli. Nevertheless, this type of learning has not been addressed directly. In the present study, pairs of animals were isolated to induce trophallaxis under controlled conditions and, afterwards, the honeybee proboscis extension reflex was used to investigate the possible role of trophallaxis in learning olfactory cues. The results demonstrate unambiguously that associative learning actually occurs by means of trophallaxis. Animals associate the odour (as the conditioned stimulus or CS) and the sucrose (as the unconditioned stimulus or US) present in the solution they receive through trophallaxis. Moreover, this particular kind of learning leads to long-term olfactory memories after a single learning trial, even when trophallaxis is brief. In addition, {{we found that the}} strength of association is clearly affected by CS and US intensity as well as the recent previous foraging experiences of the animals. Comparisons are presented among several features of the learning during trophallaxis and the classical conditioning of the proboscis <b>extension</b> reflex with <b>restrained</b> subjects. Finally, the relevance of learning through trophallaxis in the task of successful foraging is discussed. Fil:Gil, M. Universidad de Buenos Aires. Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales; Argentina.
