5000|$|In the Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek, {{he calls the}} album [...] "meditative, inviting, <b>full</b> of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and melodies. It {{contains}} all the icy spaciousness of Manfred Eicher's trademark production, but the effect of Brüninghaus' compositions is warm, accessible even. They are open-ended and contemplative and explore musical questions lyrically. There is a valid argument {{to be made for}} the non-adventurousness of these works, and the fairly safe improvisations within them, but perhaps that's the point".|$|R
50|$|The Shershen' has {{a fabric}} covered flat sided {{fuselage}} with a steel tube frame. Rounded decking is cut away locally {{for the two}} cockpits. Both have windscreens and the rear cockpit has a prominent headrest. The Shershen's tailplane is mounted at mid-fuselage height, with an angle of incidence that can be adjusted for trimming. Additionally, there is a port elevator trim tab. The rudder is broad and rounded, extending down to the keel on all models, though two styles of fin have been used. The prototype and the -14 variant have fins with a <b>full</b> <b>rounded</b> leading <b>edge</b> but those of the -2 and -3 are straight edged and vertical. A fixed, conventional undercarriage with a small tailwheel has mainwheels on faired V struts hinged on the lower fuselage. On all but the -3, half-axles with bungee cord shock absorbers run to a central compression frame. The -3 variant has instead oleo legs attached {{to the outside of}} the V struts and to the mid fuselage sides.|$|R

The triangular fin and its <b>full,</b> <b>rounded</b> unbalanced rudder were also broad, the rudder extending down to the keel and operated in a gap between the elevators.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Balestruccio was hexagonal, with deep, near vertical sides. [...] Its comfortable cockpit {{was immediately}} {{in front of}} the wing leading edge and was originally provided with a wooden canopy with small side openings, similar to that used on the German DFS Fafnir, but this was later replaced with a more conventional open arrangement which provided better all-round visibility. A single, sprung skid and a tail bumper provided an undercarriage. The fuselage tapered aft to a mid mounted horizontal tail consisting almost entirely of the elevator; although this had straight leading edges, a combination of their slight sweep and the <b>full,</b> <b>rounded</b> trailing <b>edges</b> gave the planform an almost elliptical appearance. There were aerodynamic balances and a large cut-out for rudder movement. As first constructed, the vertical tail was rather similar, with a small fin and a full, deep, curved, balanced rudder which extended slightly below the keel. Later, with the fuselage shortened by one frame or about 700 mm, the Balestruccio was given a new, angular fin and rudder with straight taper and square tip. Like the old rudder, this was also balanced and deep, though extending only to the keel. The original horizontal tail was retained.|$|R

50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the snap ring groove when load or force is applied, the flat and square edge of the snap ring will “bite” into the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge</b> of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the <b>rounded</b> <b>edge.</b> This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there is}} rising demand of {{electronic}} systems with functional density for industrial and automotive applications. Those components, which are typically manufactured by overmoulding blanked metal inserts within an assembly injection process, are often exposed to rough operating conditions. Especially penetrating water {{can lead to}} a severe damage of electronic systems which are often crucial to safety. Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry. In addition the effect of <b>rounded</b> <b>edges</b> on stress distribution of overmoulded parts is analysed by combining resulting geometries of the forming simulation with the numerical analysis of stress distribution within the polymer...|$|R
