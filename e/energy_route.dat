Hohmann {{demonstrated that the}} lowest <b>energy</b> <b>route</b> between any two orbits is an elliptical [...] "orbit" [...] which forms a tangent to the starting and destination orbits. Once the spacecraft arrives, a second application of thrust will re-circularize the orbit at the new location. In the case of planetary transfers this means directing the spacecraft, originally in an orbit almost identical to Earth's, so that the aphelion of the transfer orbit is {{on the far side}} of the Sun near the orbit of the other planet. A spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars via this method will arrive near Mars orbit in approximately 8.5 months, but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass (i.e. the Sun) and slower when farther from the center, the spacecraft will be traveling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed to put it into a circular orbit around Mars. If the manoeuver is timed properly, Mars will be [...] "arriving" [...] under the spacecraft when this happens.|$|E

40|$|The constant-NVT Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{is performed}} for model C 60 molecules interacting via the Girifalco potential {{and a full}} free-energy analysis is made to predict the high-temperature phase diagram. The repulsive part of the C 60 potential is very steep and the attractive part is relatively short-ranged. For such a system accurate computations of the virial pressure are difficult in simulations and {{it is argued that}} the discrepancies among the previous results for the phase diagram of C 60 can partly be attributed to the uncertainties of the virial pressure involved in simulations. To avoid this difficulty we take the <b>energy</b> <b>route</b> to calculate equation of state (EOS), in which the absolute (Helmholtz) free energy is obtained by performing isochoric integration of the excess internal energy. A difficulty of the <b>energy</b> <b>route</b> in the high-temperature limit is resolved by the aid of an analytic method. The exact second and third virial coefficients are also used in the analysis of the fluid EOS. The pressure route is taken to calculate the EOS of the solid phase, in which the virial pressure is numerically more stable than in the fluid phase. The resulting high-temperature phase diagram of C 60 is quite systematic and free from uncertainties, and the liquid–vapor critical point is found at Tc = 1980  K and ρc = 0. 44  nm− 3, whereas the triple point at Tt = 1880 and ρt = 0. 74  nm− 3, confirming the existence of a stable liquid phase over the range of ∼ 100 K.

The problem of finding the minimum <b>energy</b> <b>route</b> under this setting is formulated.

For a regular line topology, it is possible to achieve energy savings of 39 %. For a grid 2 topology, it is possible to achieve energy savings of 56 %.

This problem can be avoided by taking an interaction potential that reduces to the HS one in certain limits. In this paper the square-shoulder (SS) potential characterized by a hard-core diameter σ ′, a soft-core diameter σ> σ ′ and a shoulder height ǫ is considered. The energy-route equation of state for the HS fluid is obtained in terms of the radial distribution function for the SS fluid by taking the limits ǫ → 0 and ǫ → ∞. This equation of state is shown to exhibit, in general, an artificial dependence on the diameter ratio σ ′ /σ. If furthermore the limit σ ′ /σ → 1 is taken, the resulting equation of state for HS coincides with that obtained through the virial route. ...|$|E
