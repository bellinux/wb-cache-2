50|$|Pumps operate by some {{mechanism}} (typically reciprocating or rotary), {{and consume}} energy to perform mechanical work {{by moving the}} <b>fluid.</b> <b>Pumps</b> operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines, or wind power, come in many sizes, from microscopic for use in medical applications to large industrial pumps.|$|E
50|$|Fluids (liquid and gas) {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} and/or store energy using pressure and other fluid properties. Hydraulic (liquid) and pneumatic (gas) engines convert fluid pressure into other desirable mechanical or electrical work. <b>Fluid</b> <b>pumps</b> convert mechanical or electrical work into movement or pressure changes of a fluid, or storage in a pressure vessel.|$|E

50|$|In microfluidics, MHD is {{studied as}} a <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> for {{producing}} a continuous, nonpulsating flow {{in a complex}} microchannel design.|$|R
50|$|This {{leaves a}} cloud of {{positively}} charged ions in the medium, which are attracted to the negative smooth electrode by Coulomb's Law, where they are neutralized again. This produces an equally scaled opposing force in the lower electrode. This effect {{can be used for}} propulsion (see EHD thruster), <b>fluid</b> <b>pumps</b> and recently also in EHD cooling systems. The velocity achievable by such setups is limited by the momentum achievable by the ionized air, which is reduced by ion impact with neutral air. A theoretical derivation of this force has been proposed (see the external links below).|$|E
50|$|These {{are also}} {{referred}} to as All <b>fluid</b> <b>pumps.</b> The fluid is pushed outward or inward and move fluid axially. They operate at much lower pressures and higher flow rates than radial-flow (centripetal) pumps. Axial-flow pumps cannot be run up to speed without special precaution. If at a low flow rate, the total head rise and high torque associated with this pipe would mean that the starting torque would have to become a function of acceleration for the whole mass of liquid in the pipe system. If there is a large amount of fluid in the system, accelerate the pump slowly.|$|E
50|$|These can {{be either}} {{hydraulic}} or electric submersible. The hydraulic uses high pressure power fluid to operate down hole fluid engine. The engine in turn drives a piston that moves the fluid to the surface. The power fluid system {{can be either}} open or closed, it depends on whether the power fluid can be mixed with well fluid. This type of system usually has above ground power <b>fluid</b> <b>pumps</b> and a reservoir. The electric submersible is another type of rodless pumping system. This uses an electric pump submerged in the well and connected {{to a series of}} transformers and control equipment that power and control the pumping rate. In this system the electric motor is isolated from the oil by a protector. The fluid intake which is before the pump mechanism has a gas separator, also the junction box on the surface helps to dissipate any gas that may have come up the power lines.|$|E

30|$|A {{variety of}} {{automated}} <b>fluid</b> <b>pumps</b> exist. Some will keep a constant pre-set pressure at the inflow port {{but they will}} continue delivering fluid despite the resistance in the uterine cavity. Other systems will titrate the intrauterine fluid pressure constantly at 70 – 80  mmHg and will reduce the fluid flow (inflow and outflow) accordingly. A device which maintains constant intrauterine pressure is more sensitive and limits excessive intrauterine pressures and subsequent intravasation of the distending medium [15]. These systems can be costly {{to set up and}} run. They are not necessary for short operative or diagnostic procedures but maybe beneficial for prolonged, operative cases such as resection of the endometrium or submucosal fibroids where endometrial and myometrial disruption occur causing bleeding and the formation of intrauterine tissue debris that can compromise visualisation of the operative field.|$|E

This paper reviews some of the recent developments in experimental techniques and modelling methods for non-equilibrium gas flows, examining their advantages and drawbacks. We also present new results from our computational investigations into both hypersonic and microsystem flows using two distinct numerical methodologies: the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and extended hydrodynamics. While the direct simulation approach produces excellent results and is used widely, extended hydrodynamics is not as well developed but is a promising candidate for future more complex simulations. Finally, we discuss some of the other situations where these simulation methods could be usefully applied, and look to the future of numerical tools for non-equilibrium flows...|$|E
