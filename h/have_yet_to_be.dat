5|$|Gamma ray telescopes {{collect and}} measure individual, high energy gamma rays from astrophysical sources.

Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both genera <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{allowed for}} the naming of Makemake and Haumea, and their formal recognition as plutoids and dwarf planets, bringing the number of IAU-accepted plutoids to four. However, the (co)discoverer of Eris, Makemake, and Haumea, Mike Brown, estimates that between 100 and 400 known bodies are plutoids, {{and that there are}} many more that <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered.

5|$|Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings by Aya Yanagi is a two-episode {{special that}} commemorates the 20th {{anniversary of the}} {{original}} publication of Oh My Goddess!.

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to {{her ideas}} about the role of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Del Rey Manga {{published}} the English {{translation of the}} first 16 volumes of School Rumble in physical format. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order to preserve puns based on the characters' names. Kodansha USA {{published the}} English translation in digital format. Funimation published {{the first and second}} anime seasons and the Extra Class OVAs in English. School Rumble has been translated into additional languages, although the final two episodes, the video games, and guidebooks <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discovered.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{refectory}} (dining hall) {{range to}} the south of the cloister and the dorter range to the east, which contained the chapter house and dormitory, <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> excavated. Only the western end of the refectory range has been excavated; it presents a vaulted undercroft, three bays of which survive, above which the refectory was located on the first floor. A service passage survives between the kitchen and the refectory. The western part of the undercroft was used as a buttery in the late Middle Ages but would have had severely restricted headroom due to its raised floor.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} targets chosen by the HOPE study was Callisto. The {{possibility}} of building a surface base on Callisto was proposed, because of the low radiation levels at its distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only Galilean satellite for which human exploration is feasible. The levels of ionizing radiation on Io, Europa, and Ganymede are hostile to human life, and adequate protective measures <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> devised.|$|E
5|$|Pleione {{is known}} to be a speckle binary, {{although}} its orbital parameters <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully established. In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E

5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention {{is the relationship between}} the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
5|$|Renal {{replacement}} therapy {{may be required}} to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performed. As a result, the role of renal {{replacement therapy}} in patients with HRS remains unclear.|$|E
