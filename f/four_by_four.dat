2500|$|In {{engineering}} terms, [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] designates {{a vehicle}} with power delivered to four wheel ends spread over {{at least two}} axles. The term 4×4 (pronounced <b>four</b> <b>by</b> <b>four)</b> was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles {{as early as the}} 1940s, with the first number indicating the number of wheel ends on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first thing}} {{to realize is that}} the pawn may be able to queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to <b>four</b> <b>by</b> <b>four,</b> and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E

Reticence is not accounted a virtue in his country, but the Englishman’s immobility was eloquent, and his comrade was satisfied that if the worst came they would not start out on the unknown trail alone. Then <b>four</b> <b>by</b> <b>four</b> dim figures swung out of the shadows, and the cane seemed to shiver in unison with their trampling as they went by with a forest of sloped rifles wavering above them. Here and there a mounted officer showed above the rest; while even when the leading fours were lost again in the shadows there seemed no end to them, and there was still no slackening in the sonorous beat of feet. At last, however, laden beasts appeared with men who straggled about them, then two or three more sections with rifles trailed; and Appleby drew in a deep breath when once more the gap between the cane was empty.|$|E

6000|$|OUT {{walking in}} the frozen swamp one grey day [...] I paused and said, [...] "I will turn back from here. [...] No, I will go on farther--and we shall see." [...] The hard snow held me, save where now and then [...] One foot went down. The view was all in lines [...] Straight up and down of tall slim trees [...] Too much alike to mark or name a place by [...] So as to say for certain I was here [...] Or somewhere else: I was just far from home. [...] A small bird flew before me. He was careful [...] To put a tree between us when he lighted, [...] And say no word to tell me who he was [...] Who was so foolish as to think what he thought. [...] He thought that I was after him for a feather-- [...] The white one in his tail; like one who takes [...] Everything said as {{personal}} to himself. [...] One flight out sideways would have undeceived him. [...] And {{then there was a}} pile of wood for which [...] I forgot him and let his little fear [...] Carry him off the way I might have gone, [...] Without so much as wishing him good-night. [...] He went behind it to make his last stand. [...] It was a cord of maple, cut and split [...] And piled--and measured, <b>four</b> <b>by</b> <b>four</b> by eight. [...] And not another like it could I see. [...] No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it. [...] And it was older sure than this year's cutting, [...] Or even last year's or the year's before. [...] The wood was grey and the bark warping off it [...] And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis [...] Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle. [...] What held it though on one side was a tree [...] Still growing, and on one a stake and prop, [...] These latter about to fall. I thought that only [...] Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks [...] Could so forget his handiwork on which [...] He spent himself, the labour of his axe, [...] And leave it there far from a useful fireplace [...] To warm the frozen swamp as best it could [...] With the slow smokeless burning of decay.|$|E
