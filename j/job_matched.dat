40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} teacher efficacy at the end of the school year in novice (first through third-year) teachers in agriculture in Ohio related to stage of development, summer activities, classroom variables, and their future plans in teaching. The study was survey research comprised of multiple one-shot case studies. Demographics were collected as part of a previous study, at the beginning of the school year. A mailed questionnaire generated a 74 % response rate (N = 73). First, second, and third-year teachers were similarly efficacious at the end of the school year. Although stage of development is theoretically important (Richardson & Placier, 2001), there was not enough variability in teacher efficacy across the three stages of development to find a significant relationship. Forty-two teacher characteristic variables were correlated with the summed efficacy score and six were found to have significance. Out of these six variables, only twothe teachers agreement with the statement that their student teaching experience was excellent, and the number of class preparations for which the teacher is responsible-were found to have significant relationships to teaching efficacy. When the teacher characteristics and demographics were reviewed, it was found that novice teachers in agriculture were efficacious at the end of the school year. It was also found that teachers in the study who had mentors felt that their mentors were competent and supportive, that teachers had generally chosen teaching as a long-term career goal, felt that their <b>job</b> <b>matched</b> their personal and family needs, and felt confident about teaching in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|We study one {{potential}} source of urban agglomeration economies: better <b>job</b> <b>matching.</b> Focusing on college graduates, we construct two direct measures of <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> based on how well an individual's job corresponds {{to his or her}} college education. Consistent with matching-based theories of urban agglomeration, we find evidence that larger and thicker local labor markets help college graduates find better jobs by increasing both the likelihood and quality of a match. We then assess the extent to which better <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> of college-educated workers increases individual-level wages and thereby contributes to the urban wage premium. While we find that college graduates with better <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> do indeed earn higher wages on average, the contribution of such <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> to aggregate urban productivity appears to be relatively modest...|$|R
40|$|By {{examining}} the destination choice patterns of heterogenous labor, this paper {{tries to explain}} the skill composition of internal <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> flows in Germany. Estimates from a nested logit model of destination choice suggest that spatial <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> patterns by high-skilled individuals are mainly driven by interregional income differentials, while interregional <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> by less-skilled individuals are much more affected by regional differentials in job opportunities. Regional differentials in non-pecuniary assets slightly contribute to spatial sorting processes in Germany. Such differences in destination choices by skill level are partly modified by different spatial patterns of job-to-job <b>matches</b> and <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> after unemployment.

40|$|This study {{examines}} training investments in two-tier labor markets, {{focusing on the}} role of <b>job</b> <b>match</b> quality. Temporary workers are in general more likely than permanent workers to leave their employer and therefore are less likely to receive employer-funded training. However, as firms prefer to continue productive <b>job</b> <b>matches,</b> we hypothesize that the negative effect of holding a temporary contract on the probability to be trained diminishes with the quality of the <b>job</b> <b>match.</b> Using a recent longitudinal survey from the Netherlands, we find that temporary workers indeed participate less frequently in firm-sponsored training. However, this effect is fully driven by mismatches: holding a temporary contract does not significantly decrease the probability to receive training for workers in good <b>job</b> <b>matches.</b> Depending on match quality, a temporary job can either be a stepping stone or a dead-end...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} US economy suggests that <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> created during economic expansions {{turn out to be}} of better quality than <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> created during economic recessions. We discuss different measures of job mismatching for the Spanish labour market: (i) measures based on the degree of adjustment between job requirements and workers’ qualifications; and (ii) measures based on the duration of the <b>job</b> <b>match</b> (Jovanovic, 1979). Given our data limitations and the duality of the Spanish labour market we follow the second approach and define a good <b>job</b> <b>match</b> as a temporary contract that is converted into a permanent one. We find, as expected, that temporary matches created during periods of economic recession {{are less likely to be}} converted into permanent contracts than temporary matches created in periods of economic expansion. However, contrary to other available empirical findings for the US, this cyclical pattern of <b>job</b> <b>match</b> quality in the Spanish labour market appears to be due to a “stop-gap” job phenomenon: during recessions unemployed Spanish workers are more willing to accept jobs that require lower skills while they wait better opportunities when the business cycle recovers. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} returns to {{seniority}}, the returns to experience, {{and the effects}} of seniority and experience at the time of a quit or layoff on changes in the <b>job</b> <b>match</b> specific component of wages. We show that these returns are not identified in widely used regression models that relate the wage changes of stayers, quits, and layoffs to tenure and experience. We deal with the identification of problems in two ways. First, we obtain theoretical bounds on key unidentified parameters using a simple model of wages and mobility. Second, we check the implications of assumptions about the linear tenure slope for the estimates of the returns to tenure, experience, and the effect of tenure on <b>job</b> <b>match</b> gains. We have three main empirical findings. First, there is a large return to general labor market experience that is independent of job shopping. Second, the return to tenure is probably above the Altonji and Shakotko's (1987) estimate but far below OLS estimates. Third, quits results in substantial <b>job</b> <b>match</b> gains for inexperienced workers. Layoffs are associated with the substantial <b>job</b> <b>match</b> losses for workers who have been on the job for over a year. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to bring together the microeconomic-labor and the macroeconomic-equilibrium views of matching in labor markets.

First, learning about match quality and turnover map Gaussian output noise into an ergodic wage distribution of empirically accurate shape: unimodal, skewed, with a Paretian right tail. In this sense, ex post worker self-selection is a plausible alternative to the ex ante sorting emphasized by the dominant Roy model tradition. Second, high idiosyncratic productivity risk hinders learning and sorting and therefore, in contrast to the predictions of standard equilibrium search models with observable match quality, tends to reduce wage inequality.

This paper explores the extent to which horizontal and vertical education-to-job matches of European school leavers from secondary education is associated with the level of stratification, standardization, and the level of vocational orientation and institutional linkages of education systems. We combine notions of signalling theory, human capital theory and <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> theory to formulate hypotheses about how education systems affect horizontal and vertical education-to-job matches. We use micro-data on 30, 805 school leavers in 20 European countries from the 2009 Ad Hoc Module of the European Labour Force Survey and data on system characteristics. Using multi-level logistic regression, we show that the level of stratification of secondary education is associated with better vertical <b>job</b> <b>matches.</b> We also find that the positive relation between being vocationally trained and education-to-job matches is stronger in systems with stronger institutional linkages. The positive relation between being vocationally trained and vertical <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> is less strong in more vocational oriented systems.
