40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this work is to achieve a better {{understanding}} of the relationship between damage, failure and the transport properties of cementitious materials. Many authors have looked for predictive models of porous media permeability. Usually, analyses are restricted to intrinsic permeability of the material and the evolution of the apparent permeability, with respect to the pressure gradient and to the nature of the fluid considered are left aside. This paper aims at presenting a new model capable to provide estimates of the apparent permeability directly from the pore size distribution and from the properties of the fluid to be considered. The intrinsic permeability and the evolution of the apparent permeability with mean pressure are provided by combining Darcy's law which represents the flow in the porous media at the macroscale and a combination of Poiseuille's and Knudsen's laws which represent respectively viscous flow and the diffusion flow at the microscale. In order to achieve a porous network in the material, which is consistent with a mercury <b>intrusion</b> <b>technique,</b> random generation of pores is implemented. The technique yields a hierarchical porous network, which mimics the porous space measured experimentally, without the need for entering neither the tortuosity nor the exact topological information about the pore shapes. Comparisons with experimental data acquired on mortar specimens show that the model is able to reproduce the intrinsic permeability and its evolution when the material is subjected to mechanical damage, provided the pore size distributions are available. For a given pore size distribution, the evolution of the apparent permeability is also provided and test data with several types of gases compare quite well with the model...|$|E

In this study, the tight oil samples obtained from the Yanchang group of Ordos basin (China) are tested using the constant rate mercury <b>intrusion</b> <b>technique</b> to quantitatively determine the size of pore and throat parameters, as well as analyze the key parameters that control the quality of tight oil reservoir. The pore radius of sample analogously distributes in 100 – 200  μm and average pore radius varies from 103.7 to 139.74  μm. When the permeability is less than 1  ×  10 − 3  μm 2, the throat peak radius and the average throat radius will be less than 1  μm; furthermore, the variation of throat distribution is in the range of 0.2 – 0.5 and 0.2 – 1.0  μm. On the contrary, if the permeability is greater than 1  ×  10 − 3  μm 2, the average throat radius will be greater than 1  μm and the distribution range of throat will spread from 0.2 – 3.4 to 0.2 – 8.8  μm. As for the eleven samples, the main flow throat radius lies in the range of 0.41 – 3.71  μm, the throat quantity changes wildly from 1324 to 4271  number/cm 3, the average pore throat ratio varies from 503.59 to 86.11, the pore mercury saturation alters in 17.65 – 55.95  % and the throat mercury saturation distributes in 13.44 – 27.6  %.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{number of}} {{investigators}} have proposed equations {{to predict the}} permeability of porous media. Most of their equations {{are based on the}} distributions of the sizes of the various contributing pores in the medium. Presently the pore size distributions of agricultural soils are most commonly obtained from soil water release curves. The pressure scale is converted into an equivalent pore diameter scale by means of the pressure of displacement equation. This method is time consuming. The study reported in this thesis was initiated to (1) use a mercury intrusion method to obtain pore size distributions of porous materials similar to agricultural soils, (2) use the pore size distributions thus obtained with existing equations to calculate intrinsic permeability and (3) compare the calculated permeability values with measured values for a range of particle size distributions. The permeabilities and the pore size distributions of 54 systematically selected particle size classes of glass beads and crushed quartz sand were measured. The particle size classes ranged from 44 to 246 microns in diameter. The pore size distributions were evaluated and used in Marshall's proposed permeability prediction equation. The measured permeabilities did not agree with the calculated values until a correction factor which {{is a function of the}} pore diameter was used. It is apparent that the pressure of displacement equation measures only an effective pore dimension. Permeability prediction equations require the evaluation of an effective hydraulic dimension. These two dimensions are different and are influenced by the geometry of the pore aperture. A necessary correction factor has been developed which accounts for the difference between the measured and hydraulic dimension when the mercury <b>intrusion</b> <b>technique</b> is used to measure pore size distributions. The results of this study have improved and given a better theoretical basis for permeability predictions equations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} Ph. D. thesis, {{several types of}} {{composite}} nanofiltration (NF) membranes were examined for their ultra thin separation layer integrity by initially applying gas permeability measurements. The examined materials were sol-gel derived α-alumina and silica membranes, supported on macroporous α-alumina tubes. The existence of defects was also confirmed by application of a recently developed mercury <b>intrusion</b> <b>technique,</b> which additionally enabled the accurate definition of the defects size. Furthermore segments of the defect bearing membranes were modified by chemical vapor deposition of SiO 2 under several reaction conditions, to examine the possibility of simultaneously reducing the NF pores size and mending the defects. SEM micrographs of the CVD treated membranes revealed that differential pressure across the reactor sides leads {{to the formation of}} an extra silica deposit on either the thin layer or the support surface of the membrane. This was especially the case in the presence of large pores (defects) and was further verified by the novel mercury intrusion method. Monitoring and controlling structure evolution of nanoporous materials during their synthesis or modification can be achieved by innovative combinations of in-situ and ex-situ techniques applied in consecutive or real-time modes. An in-situ technique was applied to monitor the gradual alteration of pore size during the CVD treatment of mesoporous (4 nm) membranes (Vycor, γ-Alumina) for which Knudsen diffusion is initially the predominant transport mechanism. The in-situ experimental results (Oxygen permeance) are interpreted in combination with ex-situ experimental results (Nitrogen isotherms at 77 K) acquired after the completion of CVD, to give an insight of the effect of different CVD conditions on pore size alteration. The CVD treatments were performed via an in-house developed CVD reactor that additionally permitted the in-situ monitoring of Oxygen permeance during each CVD process and moreover the application of gas pressure pulses up to 3 bars and the measurement of several single gas permeances (298 - 650 K) after the deposition stage, without the need of dismantling the membrane tubes. In the present study, tailoring of the pore size of silica membranes was achieved by applying combinations of in-situ gas permeability with mercury porosimetry, SEM and EDAX, during the membrane modification using two CVD modes: in the normal cyclic mode, a sequential exposure to silica precursor vapors and O 3 was performed whereas in the pressure-pulsed mode, the exposure to silica precursor was accompanied by pressure pulses of the order of 400 kPa. The membranes were treated with tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) in both modes under different CVD durations. The aim was to examine effects in the pore narrowing rate, deposition profiles and membrane performance characteristics that are induced due to the different physicochemical properties of the involved precursors, as well as due to the different CVD conditions.

30|$|With the {{increasing}} demands {{on energy and}} exhausting conventional resources, unconventional tight oil reservoirs are becoming important, and how to effectively develop them becomes a focus (Akanji et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2013). Tight oil reservoirs normally have complicated pore throat parameters, which determine the reservoirs quality and affect the oilfield development. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to quantitatively determine the dominant pore and throat parameters. Mercury injection method is a widely used technique for the evaluation of capillary pressure, pore size and throat size since Purcell introduced the technique to the industry (Brooks and Corey 1981; Katz and Thompson 1981, 1987; Pittman 1992; Purcell 1949). Mercury intrusion is a very useful method to gain quantitative data on the pore throat parameters. The measurement of pore throat size distributions from mercury intrusion has been of great benefit to reservoir evaluation in the oil and gas industry. Other petrophysical characteristics such as porosity, relative permeability and irreducible water saturation can be determined using mercury porosimetry (Vavra et al. 1992). Matthew et al. (1993) used the mercury intrusion to calculate network and absolute permeability in sandstone and other porous media. Lambropoulos et al. (2007) applied an innovative mercury <b>intrusion</b> <b>technique</b> and relative permeability to examine the thin layer pores of sol–gel and CVD post-treated membranes. Yao and Liu (2012) characterized pore size distributions of coals with low-field NMR and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Sasanian and Newson (2013) used mercury intrusion porosimetry for microstructural investigation of reconstituted clays at high water contents. Okolo et al. (2015) compared the porosity and surface areas of different coals as measured with mercury intrusion. Capillary pressure curves normally give information only on throat sizes rather than on the exact volume of the pore space (Yuan and Swanson 1989). In the usual experiment, mercury pressure is raised in increments and the injected mercury volume is measured. This is a pressure-controlled measurement of mercury capillary pressure curve. On account of the inherent ambiguity in capillary pressure curves, attempts to derive relationships between various petrophysical properties through capillary pressures are not always successful. Due to the conventional (pressure-controlled) method nature of measuring capillary pressure curves, it is possible to have different distributions of pore systems that would lead to the same capillary pressure curve. While the rate-controlled measurement can overcome the shortage of conventional mercury intrusion to get the quantity of pores and throats, draw capillary pressure curves of pores and throats, respectively, and obtain more accurate micro-pore structure characteristic parameters (Crawford and Hoover 1966; Morrow 1970; Yuan and Swanson 1989; Gao et al. 2013). The observation of fluctuations in mercury pressure during mercury injection is not new. In 1959, in an unpublished Shell report, Gates observed pressure fluctuations with mercury porosimetry measurement for vuggy carbonates. In 1966, Crawford and Hoover (1966) recorded capillary pressure fluctuations on a chart recorder during injecting the water into synthetic porous media. The infinitesimally slow displacement of a wetting fluid by a non-wetting fluid was discussed in detail by Morrow (1970). He introduced terminology to describe certain features of the pressure fluctuations that we describe in the latter section. In 1971, Gaulier (1971) published similar techniques for depicting vug volume, although the sensitivity was very low. From then on, some studies have been done to analyze the pore and throat parameters of low permeability sandstone (Yu et al. 2006; Hao et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2008; Gao et al. 2013). Nevertheless, up to now, there are only few researches that have applied the constant rate mercury intrusion to tight oil rocks and examined their pore and throat parameters.|$|E
