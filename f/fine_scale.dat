Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E

25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst really did develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a <b>fine</b> <b>scale</b> pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While I think there are masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. You can see where this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.â€” Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E

6000|$|Forgive (and {{while you}} are about it please commiserate) my having to take this {{roundabout}} way of acknowledging your brave letter. I am stricken and helpless still--I can't sit up like a gentleman and drive the difficult pen. I am having an absolutely horrid and endless visitation--being now in the seventh week of the ordeal I had the other day to mention to you. It's a weary, dreary business, perpetual atrocious suffering, and you must pardon my replying to you as I can {{and not at all}} as I would. And I speak here, I have, alas, to say, not of my form of utterance only--for my matter (given that of your own charming appeal) would have in whatever conditions to be absolutely the same. Let me, for some poor comfort's sake, make the immediate rude jump to the one possible truth of my case: it is out of my power to meet your invitation with the least decency or grace. When one declines a beautiful honour, when one simply sits impenetrable to a generous and eloquent appeal, one had best have the horrid act over as soon as possible and not appear to beat about the bush and keep up the fond suspense. For me, frankly, my dear John, there is simply no question of these things: I am a mere stony, ugly monster of Dissociation and Detachment. I have never in all my life gone in for these other things, but have dodged and shirked and successfully evaded them--to the best of my power at least, and so far as they have in fact assaulted me: all my instincts and the very essence of any poor thing that I might, or even still may, trump up for the occasion as my [...] "genius" [...] have been against them, and are more against them at this day than ever, though two or three of them (meaning by [...] "them" [...] the collective and congregated bodies, the splendid organisations, aforesaid) have successfully got their teeth, in spite of all I could do, into my bewildered and badgered antiquity. And this last, you see, {{is just one of the}} reasons--! for my not collapsing further, not exhibiting the last demoralisation, under the elegant pressure of which your charming plea is so all but dazzling a specimen. I can't go into it all much in this sorry condition (a bad and dismal one still, for my ailment is not only, at the end of so many weeks, as [...] "tedious" [...] as you suppose, but quite fiendishly painful into the bargain)--but the rough sense of it is that I believe only in absolutely independent, individual and lonely virtue, and in the serenely unsociable (or if need be at a pinch sulky and sullen) practice of the same; the observation of a lifetime having convinced me that no fruit ripens but under that temporarily graceless rigour, and that the associational process for bringing it on is but a bright and hollow artifice, all vain and delusive. (I speak here of the Arts--or of my own poor attempt at one or two of them; the other matters must speak for themselves.) Let me even while I am about it heap up the measure of my grossness: the mere dim vision of presiding or what is called, I believe, taking the chair, at a speechifying public dinner, fills me, and has filled me all my life, with such aversion and horror that I have in the most odious manner consistently refused for years to be present on such occasions even as a guest pre-assured of protection and effacement, and have not departed from my grim consistency even when cherished and excellent friends were being [...] "offered" [...] the banquet. I have at such times let them know in advance that I was utterly not to be counted on, and have indeed quite gloried in my shame; sitting at home the while and gloating over the fact that I wasn't present. In fine the revolution that my pretending to lend myself to your noble combination would propose to make in my life is unthinkable save as a convulsion that would simply end it. This then must serve as my answer to your kindest of letters--until at some easier hour I am able to make you a less brutal one. I know you would, or even will wrestle with me, or at least feel as if you would like to; and I won't deny that to converse with you on any topic under the sun, and even in a connection in which I may appear at my worst, can never be anything but a delight to me. The idea of such a delight so solicits me, in fact, as I write, that if I were only somewhat less acutely laid up, and free to spend less of my time in bed and in anguish, I would say at once: Do come down to lunch and dine and sleep, so that I may have the pleasure of you in spite of my nasty attitude. As it is, please let me put it thus: that as soon as I get sufficiently better (if I ever do at this rate) to rise to the level of even so modest an hospitality as I am at best reduced to, I will appeal to you to come and partake of it, in your magnanimity, to that extent: not to show you that I am not utterly adamant, but that for private association, for the banquet of two and the fellowship of that <b>fine</b> <b>scale,</b> I have the best will in the world. We shall talk so much (and, I am convinced in spite of everything, so happily) that I won't say more now--except that I venture all the same to commend myself brazenly to Mrs. John, and that I am yours all faithfully, ...|$|E

40|$|A basic {{functionality}} of a vision system concerns {{the ability to}} compute deformation fields between di#erent images of the same physical structure. This article advocates the need for incorporating an explicit mechanism for scale selection in this context, in algorithms for computing descriptors such as optic flow and for performing stereo matching. A basic reason why such a mechanism is essential {{is the fact that}} in a coarse-to-fine propagation of disparity or flow information, it is not necessarily the case that the most accurate estimates are obtained at the <b>finest</b> <b>scales.</b> The existence of interfering structures at <b>fine</b> <b>scales</b> may make it impossible to accurately match the image data at <b>fine</b> <b>scales.</b> A systematic methodology for approaching this problem is proposed, by estimating the uncertainty in the computed flow estimate at each scale, and then selecting deformation estimates from the scales that minimize the (suitably normalized) uncertainty over scales.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{directionality}} and phase {{information provided}} by nonredundant complex wavelet transforms (NCWTs) provide signif-icant potential benefits for image/video processing and compression applications. However, because existing NCWTs are createdby downsampling filtered wavelet coefficients, the <b>finest</b> <b>scale</b> of these transforms has resolution 4 * lower than the real input sig-nal. In this paper, we propose a linear-phase, semi-orthogonal, directional NCWT design using a novel triband filter bank. Atthe <b>finest</b> <b>scale,</b> the resulting transform has resolution 3 * lowerthan the real input signal. We provide a design example to demonstrate three important properties for image/video processing appli-cations: directionality, magnitude coherency, and phase coherency...|$|R
