5000|$|The ADSS {{cable is}} {{suspended}} in the electrical field due to the phase conductors; this varies from a maximum at mid-span to zero at the grounded metal supports of the cable. In dry conditions, no current flows on the jacket of the cable, but moisture reduces the jacket insulation. Uneven distribution of moisture can result in formation of high-resistance [...] "dry bands" [...] which have a relatively high voltage across them. Dry bands tend to form at the supports. Voltage across the dry band can cause carbon tracks to form and erosion of the jacket material. If the voltage across the dry band is high enough, an arc may form which can damage the jacket. <b>Dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> is more likely for cables installed under higher transmission voltage lines (220 kV and above). Even a few incidents of arcing along a dry band can cause severe permanent damage to the jacket, leading to subsequent failure of the cable. Relatively low sustained arc currents of a few milliamperes can cause eventual aging degradation of the cable. The magnitude of current available in an arc (and probability of damage) depends on the geometry of the installation and is not simply correlated with the voltage of the transmission line. Wetting conditions near industrial plants or saltwater will have more severe effect on the jacket resistance than in freshwater rain or fog. While one measure to protect cables from dry-banding damage incorporates a semiconducting layer to equalize potential, a more feasible method uses externally applied protection within 50 metres of each support, since this is the area most susceptible to damage.|$|E
40|$|Silicone rubber {{insulators}} {{have been}} replacing conventional insulators made from toughened glass and porcelain {{in the power}} system, due to the non-wetting properties of silicone rubber insulation housing. However, silicone elastomers will eventually wet-out leading to leakage current and <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> giving rise to erosion of the silicone housing material, and eventually insulation failure. Well-established formulations of insulation housing composites have been developed and validated for erosion performance using the standard inclined plane tracking and erosion test, yet no such formulations have been developed and validated for DC. With the assumption that equivalent performance will be obtained, an adjustment to the creepage distance has been the measure taken in using the AC insulators for DC, without taking into consideration the differing aspects of the DC {{as compared to the}} AC <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing.</b> This practice questions the existing DC insulators as an unknown entity that requires further investigation to ensure the reliability of the power supply. In addition recent demands have been raised to develop housing composites specifically for DC outdoor insulation, particularly with the increased interest in DC. It follows that developing a standard DC inclined plane tracking and erosion test is necessary for the development of more suitable materials for outdoor DC insulation applications. This thesis provides a thorough study of the DC <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> mechanism as opposed to the well understood mechanism of the AC <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> and provides a mechanistic understanding to the <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> leading to erosion as a foundation {{for the development of a}} standard DC inclined plane tracking and erosion test. To this end, the influence of inorganic fillers in silicone rubber on resisting erosion due to <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> is also presented, as an essential step towards obtaining more suitable silicone composite for DC outdoor insulation applications...|$|E
40|$|Developments in the {{electricity}} sector, related to integration of sustainable energy, not only affects the medium voltage {{but also the}} low voltage infrastructure. Condition monitoring of Low Voltage (LV) underground power cables becomes of increasing interest to safeguard reliable power delivery. Since the start of phasing out oil-paper insulated cables, polymeric insulation is most widely applied. As phenomena associated with high electric field stresses are not expected, {{little is known about}} the degradation mechanism of LV cables with polymeric insulation. External damage is known to be a major cause of defects, which directly causes a failure or initiates degradation resulting in a failure later on. To study the degradation mechanisms, short cable sections with artificial damage have been subjected to periodic water exposure in the laboratory. This shows that <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> is a major mode of degradation, with accumulation of pollutants due to chemical decomposition. Several factors such as water conductivity, presence of oxygen, soil type and insulation material have been investigated. Strong dependencies upon these parameters are observed. However, it may be hard to quantify the degradation process in practical situations. The presence of a water film that can sustain <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> will occur only in certain situations and for limited amount of time. However, the accumulation of these events, mainly caused by periods of precipitation, will eventually lead to breakdown at the damaged spot...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{developments}} impose {{increasing pressure}} on Low Voltage (LV) underground power cables, {{leading to an}} increasing interest in condition assessment for LV systems. LV cables have been designed mainly on mechanical considerations taking insulation of low voltage levels for granted. However, concerns on degradation aspects is now growing. To make a comparison of insulation materials, water cycling tests on artificially damaged cable sections have been performed. The {{results show that the}} material has a major role in degradation rate due to local decomposition upon <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing,</b> as can also be expected from chemical point of view. Chemical compounds add pollution to the damaged spot, enhancing degradation. PVC shows fastest degradation rate compared to polyurethane and XLPE respectively. These results can be considered in optimal cable design. In addition, aspects like water tightness should also be considered...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Communication {{companies}} are spending millions of Rands on installing optic fibre cables and links, {{with the purpose}} of increasing network bandwidth, reliability and stability. Several utilities, that combine power supply and telecommunication over the same servitudes, are confronted with quite a serious problem. The cables are being subjected to extreme electromagnetic (EM) force fields, which cause certain phenomena, damaging the fibres. The fibres that cause problems are usually installed in polluted areas or in salt rich air areas (e. g. along the coast). The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine why and where <b>Dry-Band</b> <b>arcing</b> (DBA) occurs, or where it will be most likely to occur. The simulations done showed that DBA is not supposed to happen under normal circumstances, if the cables are correctly installed. There is therefore a certain set of additional phenomena and conditions required before DBA occurs. Master...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{discharge}} at the oil-pressboard interface {{leads to}} the development of a conducting path that is generally accepted as white marks due to localized heating. The visible white marks are believed to be due to partial discharge (PD) energy that is high enough to dry out the pressboard through vaporizing the moisture and breaking oil molecules to generate gases in the pressboard pores. A long period of electrical stress applied to a surface discharge experiment using a needle-bar electrode configuration has led to the formation of full-gap white marks on the pressboard surface that bridged the needle tip and earth bar. During the surface discharge, leakage current may occur intermittently that sometimes is visible in the form of full discharge of arcing at the oil-pressboard interface bridging the needle tip and earth bar. This condition is expected to be similar to that of <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> from inclined-plane tracking experiments for outdoor insulation. This paper explains the surface discharge experiment and details the obtained leakage current characteristics in terms of waveforms and frequency spectra. Correlation between leakage current measurements using a shunt resistor and PD signal detection has been undertaken in order to identify the useful information for condition monitoring of surface discharge in a large transformer. An equivalent circuit to represent the leakage current occurrence at the oil-pressboard interface without considering the superimposed pulses due to individual PD events is also proposed. The effect of moisture on the experimental results is also discusse...|$|E
40|$|Ageing {{of outdoor}} {{insulation}} under low leakage currents are concerns {{for safety and}} reliability in transmission line operations. Overhead line elements such as insulators and ADSS (All Dielectric, Self-Supporting) cables are subject to electric fields, resultant leakage currents, and resulting surface discharges such as coronas and dry-band arcs. Under certain conditions, the normally benign long-term low current ageing effect may transform to more severe ageing forms, having a detrimental impact on the insulation materials and creating high rates of unexpected failures. In this thesis, a series of experimental studies are reported which have created low current discharges under variable electrical and environmental conditions. The electrical properties of resulting arcs are investigated {{and their impact on}} the insulation materials is analyzed. Based on the test results, new modelling approaches have been developed for the simulation of <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> activity. The respective 'Double Sinusoidal Model' and 'PSCAD simulation' are able to simulate the voltage and current traces of low current arcs, while the 'Triple Cylinder Model' is used to analyze the heat flow around the arcing region. Based on both experiment and simulation, the phenomenon of 'dry-band arc compression' is reproduced. Research confirms previous suggestions that such a compression process may lead to more aggressive damage on insulation surfaces, and could possibly accelerate the long-term ageing effect into a short-term hazard. As a result, this thesis supports the argument that processes controlling insulation lifetime may not be continual and gradual, but are determined by extreme events such as the occurrence of dry-band arc compression.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the size of the {{particles}} of ATH filler on the life of room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber coating was studied in a salt-fog chamber. The median particle sizes examined were 1. 0, 4. 5, 13, 17 and 75 μm. The optimum size giving the lowest leakage current and the longest time to failure of the coating was determined. The particle size affected the roughness of the coating. The roughness was enhanced after a prolonged test in salt-fog. The leakage current affected the amount of silicone fluid on the surface. The amount of silicone fluid present on the surface after exposure to <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> in salt-fog was a function of the particle size. Measurements of surface roughness, the amount of silicone fluid on the surface, and the leakage current combined with theoretical analysis of the heat of conduction, lead to identification of the mechanisms by which the size of the ATH particle impart resistance to tracking and erosion. The influences of the coating thickness, different substrates, addition of silicone fluid to the coating system and different carrier solvents on the leakage current, pulse current count rates and the life of the RTV coatings were investigated. It was found that all these parameters affected the electrical performance in salt-fog. The content of low molecular weight (LMW) silicone fluid and the diffusion of LMW from the bulk to the surface were determined. ATH filled RTV coatings having thicknesses from 0. 17 to 0. 99 mm, ATH particle sizes from 1. 0 to 75 μm and different carrier solvents were used. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|Silicone rubber (SiR) {{insulators}} {{are increasingly}} being used mainly because of their superior performance under wet polluted conditions compared to conventional porcelain and glass. However, in polluted environments with high moisture levels, electrical discharges will develop on the insulator surfaces. In the long term, electrical discharges cause degradation of SiR insulator {{in the form of}} tracking and erosion due to <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing</b> that takes place when leakage current (LC) develops, and both are detrimental {{to the life of the}} insulation. This thesis presents an experimental study on the electric performance of aged high voltage outdoor silicone rubber insulators. In addition to the literature reviewed of the performance of silicone rubber insulators subjected to different climatic conditions, which is resulting in loss of their unique property named ‘hydrophobicity’, the research is concentrated in three areas: (i) Study of the effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on the performance of silicone rubber insulation systems: 11 kV non-textured and 4 mm Textured Shank insulators (TS 4) (TS 4 is a new insulator design using intersection of 4 mm square texture pattern on the shank regions of the insulator) were prepared in vacuum casting machine. Irradiated insulators were tested under different conditions. Dry-band formation and electrical discharges on their surfaces are dependent on the UV doses. Degradation of SiR insulators in a form of tracking and erosion is result in loss the surface hydrophobicity by UV irradiation, and decrease of the expected life of the insulators. Silicone rubber insulator electric performance was found to be affected by the experimental conditions. LC on relatively hydrophobic surfaces was found to exist and increase on overall insulators with increasing the exposure doses of UV irradiation, by increase the number of applied UV cycles. (ii) Development a new test set-up to determine the effectiveness of orientation angle on the performance of silicone rubber insulators subjected to different wet and pollution conditions: LC of silicone rubber insulators were increased with changes in the orientation angle from vertical to horizontal, where the TS 4 showed its superior performance under fog conditions in the vertical orientation. (iii) A new test procedure, based on the high voltage ramp test method and standard wet test method, named ‘high voltage rain ramp test’, is proposed to evaluate the flashover performance of the TS 4 silicone rubber insulators under simulated rain conditions at different orientations. Its flashover performance was compared with non-textured insulators. TS 4 silicone rubber insulators are less suitable for wet weather conditions in any orientation, due to the following reasons: (a) in vertical orientation a very low flashover voltage was observed due to the development of high magnitude electric fields in the insulator shank region, and (b) for the inclined and horizontal orientations, non-textured insulators exhibit a better flashover performance than their textured equivalents. Hence, less improvement is achieved, due to use an expensive and intricate insulator design...|$|E
40|$|Polymeric {{insulators}} are now {{a common}} replacement for conventional porcelain and glass string insulators on overhead distribution and transmission lines. The use of this mature technology represents many advantages to the utilities; however, in polluted environments and those with high moisture levels in the environment, electrical discharges will develop {{on the surface of}} the insulation. In the long term, electrical discharges cause degradation of the polymer insulation in the form of electrical tracking and material erosion, and both are detrimental to the life of the insulation. Inorganic fillers are added to polymer materials to make the insulation more resistant to discharges, and at the same time, to lower the cost of the insulation. However, there is a limit to the amount of filler that can be added as the processability of the polymer compound becomes extremely difficult and expensive. Microfillers are extensively used to modify the physical properties of the polymeric matrix, and the properties of these composites are well known. On the other hand, nanofillers are being used in some insulating composites for reinforcement of mechanical properties; their electrical characteristics have shown inconsistency in the literature, and this is attributable to the non-uniformity of the filler dispersion. Most researchers agree that particle dispersion is critical in the development of nanocomposites for electrical insulation applications. If the nanoparticles are well dispersed, the electrical properties of these materials will be significantly improved. The main problem in using nanofillers is that the nanoparticles agglomerate easily because of their high surface energy, such that conventional mixing techniques are unable to break apart the nanoparticle aggregates. A secondary problem is the incompatibility of the hydrophobic polymer with the hydrophilic nanoparticles which results in poor interfacial interactions. In this thesis, the reinforcement of a silicone rubber matrix is successfully accomplished with the combination of microfiller, nanofiller, and a commercial surfactant. To improve particle dispersion, several techniques are available apart from mixing. This includes surface modification of the nanoparticles by chemical and physical methods by using surfactants. While surfactants are commonly applied to liquids, their use to disperse nanoparticles in compositions forming solid dielectric materials has not yet been reported. The findings in this thesis have shown that Triton X- 100, a common surfactant, significantly aids in the dispersion of nanosilica and nanoalumina in silicone rubber. The main advantage of the surfactant is that it lowers the surface energy and the interfacial tension of the nanoparticles. This reduces agglomeration and facilitates the separation of the particles during mixing, thereby allowing improved dispersion of the nanofillers, as observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). However, also shown in the thesis is that Triton X- 100 cannot interact efficiently with all types of nanofillers. A high concentration of surfactant can also compromise the adsorption of the matrix polymer chains on the filler particles, so it is necessary to establish a balance between matrix adsorption and the dispersion of the particles. Mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, elongation at break, and hardness may also suffer from the use of excess surfactant. In addition, excess surfactant can lead to surface wetting properties different from composites containing none. Better wetting due to the migration of excess surfactant to the surface of the silicone may favour arcing in a wet environment. The current investigation shows that for a specific filler and concentration, an optimal concentration of surfactant provides good erosion resistance without adversely affecting the mechanical characteristics of the nanocomposite. Stress–strain and hardness measurements are done to investigate the surfactant’s effect on the mechanical properties of the composites. The effect of the surfactant {{on the surface of the}} composites is analyzed with static contact angle measurements. The heat resistance of nanofilled silicone rubber is explored using an infrared laser simulating the heat developed by <b>dry-band</b> <b>arcing.</b> Also, several industry standard test methods such as salt fog and inclined plane tests are used to evaluate the erosion resistance of the filled composites. The results of all three tests confirm that the combination of microfiller and nanofiller with surfactant results in composites with improved erosion resistance to dry band arcing, with the exception of the case where calcinated filler is used in the formulation. In this thesis, the thermal conductivity is measured using a standard ASTM method and calculated using several theoretical, semi-theoretical, and empirical models. A thermal model developed in COMSOL Multiphysics and solved using a finite element method (FEM) shows a temperature distribution in the modelled nanocomposites which is comparable to the temperature distribution measured with an infrared camera under laser heating. In addition, this investigation aims to define the mechanism by which the nanofillers improve the heat and erosion resistance of the silicone composites. In order to understand this mechanism, nano fumed silica, nano natural silica, and nano alumina are used in a silicone rubber (SiR) matrix in order to study the thermally decomposed silicone and the residual char that is formed during laser ablation tests. The white residue remaining after laser ablation on the surface of composites with fumed silica, natural silica, and alumina is analyzed in a number of ways. Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques are used to analyze the thermally decomposed silicone residue after laser heating indicating that the protective mechanism of the three analyzed nanofillers – fumed silica, natural silica, and alumina – appears to be the same. The formation of a continuous layer on the surface behaves as a thermal insulator protecting the material underneath from further decomposition...|$|E
