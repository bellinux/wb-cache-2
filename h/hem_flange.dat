This process step {{is at the end}} of a long process chain, from the single part to the hemmed assembly that can be installed. Errors in this process chain can directly affect the quality of <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding. Known problems are contaminated components and tools, bonding defects in the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> or bubbles in the fine seam sealing. In this article, the causes of these phenomena are explained on the basis of experimental investigation results and measures to avoid them are derived...|$|E
40|$|Components made of fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} make {{an important}} contribution to reducing vehicle weight in the automotive industry. Recent developments show an increasing industrial interest in integrating fiber-reinforced plastics in existing metal structures. One challenge is the appropriate joining of these hybrid structures. It is important to avoid interrupting or damaging of the fiber flows, to take the forces in the joining area as homogeneous as possible, to ensure sufficient skin quality and to meet corrosion-technical requirements - especially when joining carbon fiber reinforced plastics with metals. This research project examined the joining of an CFRP structural component with a metallic outer skin part by <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding. Such hybrid FRP-metal assembly combines the outstanding properties of both materials in the composite, while the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding ensures optimum connectivity. The embedding of the joining process in the existing process chains and the use of existing plant technology for the production of automobile hang on parts among OEMs and suppliers promise a rapid implementation of the results. The advantages mentioned are facing new challenges resulting from both the manufacturing process chain {{as well as from the}} operating conditions and material-specific properties. Within the project the following issues were examined: Joining process: According to the specified materials and process boundary conditions, suitable adhesives were chosen. These have been studied and characterized both in situ and in the <b>hem</b> <b>flange.</b> The <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding of steel-CFRP and aluminum-CFRP assemblies was studied in different model geometries using tabletop hemming and roller hemming. Here, the hemming result was evaluated and the CFRP inner part was examined for possible damage. The results show that the forces during the hemming process do not lead to any structural damage in the CFRP. Thermal stress: If the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding of the hybrid assembly is implemented in the common process chain, there are heatings up to 200 ° C in the subsequent coating process. This results in the so-called delta-apha-problem because the coefficient of thermal expansion of the outer metal part is significantly higher than the FRP inner part, resulting in relative movements during heating and cooling of the assembly. The expansion of the parts, the relative movements in the composite and the warpage occurring after the adhesive curing were recorded and evaluated. In addition, the description of the processes in the furnace as well as forecasts of war page were carried out by numerical simulation. Then constructive measures were examined in order to reduce the warpage of <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonded hybrid assemblies. Joint properties: The strength of the bonded CFRP-metal hem flanges was determined and evaluated in peel tests and 3 -point bending tests. In 3 -point bending test it was proved that the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> not fails even for large sample deformation. The corrosion of metal-CFRP hybrid assemblies is essentially affected by disbonding of adhesive at metal surface and defects or critical areas in the <b>hem</b> <b>flange.</b> Good corrosion protection performance could be achieved by optimization of hemming parameters and selection of suitable adhesives...|$|E
40|$|Inner {{and outer}} panel of {{automobile}} doors, trunks and hoods are joined via <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding. During the hemming process, air-filled cavities can form within the bonded <b>hem</b> <b>flange,</b> {{which in turn}} can lead to blisters forming in the PVC seam seal. Since the seam seal remains visible, the blisters adversely affect the optical quality of the end product. Besides this, {{there is a risk}} that these defects further develop by mechanical effects during the vehicle lifetime, which would allow direct access of electrolytes into the flange leading to the disruption of the corrosion protection for the bonded <b>hem</b> <b>flange.</b> To avoid the latter, any defect in the seam seal during their manufacture has to be repaired, a step involving time-consuming and cost-intensive finishing work. In order to avoid the costs associated with repairs, more intensive quality control, and potential damage of the manufacturer’s reputation in case severe corrosion issues arise, appropriate measures have to be taken. The research project summarized herein investigates the mechanisms of defect formation; based on the observations it suggests measures to minimize such defects, and ultimately allowing to produce blister-free seam seals. This report describes the results of the FOSTA research project P 909 carried out jointly by Fraunhofer IFAM and Fraunhofer IWU. The objective of this project was to develop the technological basis for the industrial manufacture of blister-free bonded hem flanges. The project involved two complementary approaches: minimization of cavities within the bonded <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> through process optimization (minimization of the damage potential), and substitution of the defect-prone PVC plastisol by a blister-free seam sealant by means of material optimization and enhancement of the damage tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{researches}} {{of automotive}} companies {{have focused on}} reducing weight of vehicles {{in order to meet}} the needs for high fuel efficiency. Therefore, light metals such aluminum alloys have been applied on automotive body structures. Recently, roller hemming process has been introduced for hemming of aluminum automotive closing parts such as doors, roofs, and hoods. During Roller <b>hemming,</b> the <b>flange</b> of outer panels is bent and folded along the edge of inner panel by a roller attached robot. Since the stress caused by roller hemming can affect the quality of <b>hemmed</b> <b>flanges,</b> the research has focused on the stress analysis by simulation and experiment. Residual stress has been measured in the <b>hemmed</b> <b>flanges</b> and compared to the values of finite elemental analysis...|$|R
40|$|In modern-day {{automobile}} industries {{the predominant}} type of corrosion is crevicecorrosion located on door <b>hem</b> <b>flanges</b> and fasteners. Today these areas areprotected by anti-corrosive agents. The appliance of these anti-corrosive agents is acostly process {{and could be}} excluded if a more corrosion resistant surface coatingwere to be used. In this thesis work new surface coatings are tested in an attempt toreduce the use of anti-corrosion agents in the concealed spaces. The coatings usedwere two types of zinc-magnesium alloys and a thin organic coating. Tests wereperformed in an accelerated corrosion testing-chamber with three different types ofcrevice models. The analytical methods used were mainly image analysis, X-raydiffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results show that thethin organic coating gives the best corrosion protection according to this testmethod. It was also discovered that the surfaces with pure zinc coating corrodes lesswhen in contact with a dissimilar material. Furthermore it was seen that the testmethod {{does not apply to}} all materials and environments...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{physics of}} the seam sealing process in vehicle {{construction}} has been worked out. Thereyby, modeling by computer simulation has played an important role. The rheological behavior of the highly viscous PVC and PUR sealing fluids, e. g., shear thinning, influence of temperature, yield stress, and thixotropy has been studied. Important conclusions {{with regard to the}} development of meaningful methods for material testing can be deduced. Another area of investigation was concerned with the heating behavior of the flow in hoses, tubes and in the nozzle. From the VOF simulations important information on the application on substrate steps and <b>hem</b> <b>flanges</b> can be obtained. The model that has been developed will be used for the development and design of improved equipment and materials as well as for a better matching of equipment and materials. This will have a direct impact on the ecological and economical aspects of the seam sealing process...|$|R

40|$|The {{requirements}} for flexibility on joining processes increase with individuality product variation. This trend is mainly {{focused on the}} automobile industry. The development of new hemming technologies is necessary for small series in the automobile industry or metalworking industries. Sole alternative to tabletop hemming is currently roller hemming. A robot controlled pliers hemming technology with servo-electrical drive of the hemming jaws creates a new field for higher flexibility and productivity. The purpose of this research project was the systematic study of the process parameters for robot controlled pliers hemming technology for different tasks. In substantial experimental studies the major parameters were identified and characterized. The identification of appropriate process parameters regarding hemming velocity and hemming quality for different geometries was in focus. As a result, the influence of feed velocity and jaws frequency {{on the quality of}} the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> for steel and aluminum materials was determined on straight and curved component outlines and limitations of the technology were discussed. The studies were supported by analyzes of pliers kinematics at variable hemming parameters. In addition, the influence on adhesive distribution was examined in the <b>hem</b> <b>flange</b> bonding process. One focus was the numerical description of robot controlled pliers in a process model. The simulation results allow an estimation of appropriate hemming parameters with deepened understanding of the process. In the technical comparison, the pliers hemming was compared with roller hemming in terms of fold quality and process times on a curved component outline. With regard to the hem quality of curvature radius and hemming thickness both hemming processes provide comparable results. The folding angle shows slight differences for the processes. Using pliers hemming with high jaws frequency instead of roller hemming a lower roll-in and hence an improved hem quality can be achieved. In cost comparison the technologies tabletop hemming, roller hemming and pliers hemming were compared. Due to consideration of the boundery conditions of the reference scenario, there are significant differences in the cycle times resulting from the respective tool velocity, tool paths and number of process steps. In addition to the comparison of production costs and the suitability of the process was evaluated in terms of technical quality...|$|E
50|$|Few {{commercial}} {{feature recognition}} systems are also available. Though feature recognition {{technology can be}} applied for various applications, commercial software have effectively adopted feature recognition technology for recreating the feature tree from imported models so that even the imported models can be edited {{as if it were}} a native solid model. Major 3D CAD modelers have Feature Recognition to convert imported 3-D models into native feature based models. CAM software and design for manufacturing software are also built using this feature recognition technology. Few CAD/CAM software have used commercially available third-party feature recognition library, which recognizes various features from 3-D B-Rep models. Separate libraries are available for Design, Manufacturing and Sheet metal applications. Design feature recognition library can identify features such as holes of various types, split holes, hole-chains, fillets, chamfers, cut extrudes, boss extrudes, drafted extrudes, revolved cuts, revolved bosses, ribs, drafts, lofts and sweeps are identified. Manufacturing feature recognition library provides recognition of manufacturing features such as simple holes, tapered holes, counter-bore holes, counter-sunk holes, counter-drilled holes, hole-chains, hole patterns such as linear, rectangular and circular patterns, fillets, chamfers, blind pockets, through pockets, drafted pockets, filleted and chamfered pockets, simple slots, drafted slots, filleted and chamfered slots, islands in pockets and slots, machinable volumes, machinable slabs, multiple intersecting features, axi-symmetric features such as external turned profiles, internal turned profiles, turned grooves such as vee and dovetail grooves, and mill-turn features such as slots and pocket in turned profiles. Sheet metal feature recognition library extracts features from a sheet metal perspective. Various features identified through this library include walls, bends, holes, cutouts, flanged holes, flanged cutouts, notches, open hems, closed hems, teardrop hems, rolled <b>hems</b> (curls), jog <b>flanges,</b> edge flanges, contour flanges, stamps such as louver, lance, bridge, dimple, beads, embosses and ribs. Though such commercial systems can identify a variety of features listed above, further research can be driven to identify feature types that are not identified by such commercial systems. Manufacturing features such as 3-axis and 5-axis feature recognition are generally not available in such commercial systems.|$|R
