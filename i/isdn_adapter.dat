A dialer can be downloaded and installed, but dialing in is not possible as there are no regular phone numbers in the DSL network and users will not typically have their dial-up modem, if any, connected to a phone line. However, if an <b>ISDN</b> <b>adapter</b> or additional analog modem is installed, the dialer might {{still be able to}} get a connection.|$|E

40|$|Network {{interconnection}} (internetworking) is {{an important}} issue in the area of computer communication. One of the purposes of internetworking is to allow communication to go beyond a single local area network (LAN). In this thesis, networks interconnection is studied. An internetworking device - (gate-way) is proposed to provide the capability of internetwork data transmission between LANs through an ISDN (Integrated Service Digital Network). This gateway is an application layer program which interfaces with the NetBIOS (Network Input Output System), a widely implemented interface between application programs and LANs in the IBM personal computer world. The NetBIOS interface is provided in both LAN and ISDN environments in a connection-oriented mode. A facility for file transfer and information exchange among LANs through ISDN is developed {{in such a way that}} it neither affects the existing network hardware and software available in both LANs and ISDN nor changes the mechanism of communication within a LAN. In particular, the emphasis is given to the specification, design and implementation of the gateway. In our model, the gateway is specified with a finite state machine. Based on the model, the gateway is designed by considering the issues of naming, name assigning, buffering, session handling, multi-session managing and error processing. A prototype of the gateway is implemented on a PC/XT computer with a LAN adapter, an <b>ISDN</b> <b>adapter</b> and the gateway program coded in "C". Performance benchmarks are conducted in terms of two factors: Message size and background traffic. These factors may affect the performance of internetwork data transmission. Finally, test results on different network conditions are given...|$|E
50|$|N-ISDN {{basic rate}} {{is too low}} so for home as for {{business}} today. N-ISDN may be partly saved, but by an unexpected application: Internet access. Various companies now sell <b>ISDN</b> <b>adapters</b> that combine the 2B + D channels into a single 144 kbit/s digital channel. Many Internet providers also support these adapters. So the people can access the Internet over a 144 kbit/s digital link, instead of a 28.8 kbit/s analog modem link and for affordable price {{that may be a}} niche for N-ISDN for the next few years.|$|R
50|$|Where {{an analog}} {{connection}} requires a modem, an ISDN connection requires a terminal adapter (TA).

5000|$|ISDN digital {{subscriber}} line (IDSL) is a cross between ISDN and xDSL. It is like ISDN in that it uses a single-wire pair to transmit full-duplex data at 128 kbit/s and at distances of up to RRD range. Like ISDN, IDSL uses a 2B1Q line code to enable transparent operation through the ISDN U interface. Finally, the user continues to use existing CPE (<b>ISDN</b> BRI terminal <b>adapters,</b> bridges, and routers) to make the CO connections.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{performed by}} GTE Government Systems and the University of Colorado {{in support of}} the NASA Satellite Communications Applications Research (SCAR) Program is summarized. Two levels of research were undertaken. The first dealt with providing interim services Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) satellite (ISIS) capabilities that accented basic rate ISDN with a ground control {{similar to that of the}} Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). The ISIS Network Model development represents satellite systems like the ACTS orbiting switch. The ultimate aim is to move these ACTS ground control functions on-board the next generation of ISDN communications satellite to provide full-service ISDN satellite (FSIS) capabilities. The technical and operational parameters for the advanced ISDN communications satellite design are obtainable from the simulation of ISIS and FSIS engineering software models of the major subsystems of the ISDN communications satellite architecture. Discrete event simulation experiments would generate data for analysis against NASA SCAR performance measure and the data obtained from the <b>ISDN</b> satellite terminal <b>adapter</b> hardware (ISTA) experiments, also developed in the program. The Basic and Option 1 phases of the program are also described and include the following: literature search, traffic mode, network model, scenario specifications, performance measures definitions, hardware experiment design, hardware experiment development, simulator design, and simulator development...|$|R
40|$|Cable modems offer qualitatively better {{performance}} than either dial-up modems or basic rate <b>ISDN</b> terminal <b>adapters.</b> The cable TV network employs coaxial cable {{in which the}} downstream consumes most of the bandwidth from 54 MHz up to the maximum frequency from 600 to 1000 MHz. The upstream is typically assigned to the range from 5 to 42 MHz. One drawback of cable modems {{is the lack of}} standards permitting any cable modem to work with any headend equipment. Work toward a multimedia cable network system (MCNS) specification was initiated by Cablelabs, a consortium of Time Warner, Comcast, Cox and Continental Cablevision. This specification defines the physical layer, media access control (MAC) layer, and operational support capabilities. In this thesis, MAC protocols are described for the upstream path of the hybrid fiber coax network system. These are Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), and Slotted ALOHA which are standard methods, and Dynamic Reservation without Contention (DRNC), Dynamic Reservation with Contention (DRC), Dynamic Reservation with Limited Contention (DRLC), and Modified Dynamic Reservation with Limited Contention (M-DRLC) which are proposed in this work. Detailed mathematical analysis is done and throughput and performance are compared for all six MAC protocols when the users of the network have a variety of data rates. Simulations are done to corroborate the analysis, and simulation results are presented. The effect of network delay on the performance is also analysed. Other phenomena, such as white noise and impulse noise also affect the performance. Simulations are presented {{to examine the effects of}} noise on the cable system performance. From the analysis and simulation results, it is found that FDMA is a very inefficient protocol and it wastes lots of bandwidth. Slotted ALOHA is a simple way to allocate bandwidth, but it is efficient only at very low channel traffic. DRNC gives higher frame delay because it wastes bandwidth by polling inactive users. DRLC is efficient only at very high channel traffic. DRC is efficient if the number of users is very large and user traffic is bursty. M-DRLC is a combination of the DRC and DRLC protocols and it gives low frame delay even at high channel traffic. Ingress is a big problem in HFC network systems. Even narrowband ingress can make more than 15 % of the upstream spectrum useless. Large round trip delay also degrades the cable system performance. Most of the errors generated by white noise and impulse noise can be controlled by using forward error correcting codes. It was found that system performance does not degrade substantially at 10 - 4 random bit error rate...|$|R
