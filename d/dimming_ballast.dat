50|$|The color {{temperature}} of a metal-halide lamp {{can also be}} affected by the electrical characteristics of the electrical system powering the bulb and manufacturing variances in the bulb itself. If a metal-halide bulb is underpowered, because of the lower operating temperature, its light output will be bluish because of the evaporation of mercury alone. This phenomenon can be seen during warmup, when the arc tube has not yet reached full operating temperature and the halides have not fully vaporized. It is also very apparent with <b>dimming</b> <b>ballasts.</b> The inverse is true for an overpowered bulb, but this condition can be hazardous, leading possibly to arc-tube explosion because of overheating and overpressure.|$|R

40|$|The IRS 2530 D {{is simple}} {{to use with}} any analog and digital control method {{available}} for dimming fluorescent lamps. In addition, it can implement dimming control for LEDs. Fluorescent dimming systems can satisfy visual comfort, and reduce utility costs through daylight harvesting, demand reduction, scheduled dimming, and other strategies. A dimming electronic ballast {{is an essential part}} of this system. To perform dimming functions, the ballast must be configured to understand an input signal from the control device, and act upon the current flowing through the lamp. Typically, this is a challenging task for the ballast designer and is usually achieved using a complex, high-pin-count control IC. The IRS 2530 D is a new <b>dimming</b> <b>ballast</b> control IC in a compact 8 -pin form-factor (Fig. 1). This DIM 8 TM is a 600 -V half-bridge driver IC that includes all the necessary functions for preheat, ignition, and dimming control of the lamp, and protects the circuit against line and lamp fault conditions. With only eight pins to accomplish all <b>dimming</b> <b>ballast</b> functions, the IC can minimize component count and simplify design, and is flexible enough to be used with various dimming control methods. Several reference-design kits have been created to help with the evaluation of the IRS 2530 D. Each of these kits uses a different dimming control method, and they cover various input voltages and lamp types.

2500|$|Most {{theatrical}} {{light bulbs}} (or lamps, the term usually preferred) are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), an improvement {{on the original}} incandescent design that uses a halogen gas instead of an inert gas to increase lamp life and output. [...] Fluorescent lights are infrequently used other than as worklights because, although they are far more efficient, they are expensive to make dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialised <b>dimmer</b> <b>ballasts</b> and only very expensive models will dim to very low levels. They also do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and usually have a warm-up period, during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. [...] However fluorescent lights are being used more and more for special effects lighting in theaters. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps), however, are now common where a very bright light output is required—for example in large follow spots, hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide (HMI) floods, and modern automated fixtures. [...] When dimming is required, it is done by mechanical dousers or shutters, as these types of lamps also cannot be electrically dimmed.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} {{office lighting}} systems can save 40 % in electricity consumption {{in areas that}} receive significant amounts of daylight. Commercial daylighting systems use photosensors and occupancy sensors to dim electric lighting {{in response to the}} amount of sunlight available, and to turn the lights off in the absence of occupants. In spite of the savings they can generate, daylighting systems are not widely used in the commercial office building. Barriers prohibiting adoption include high retrofitting costs, and difficulty estimating and maintaining target worksurface illuminances. Miniaturized, distributed, networked wireless platforms called ‘Smart Dust motes’ enlighten a new way for the acceptance of the daylight-responsive control systems. In this paper, an intelligent control framework that utilizes MEMS-based (micro-electro-mechanical systems) Smart Dust motes is explored. Wireless communications permit mote sensors to be placed directly on the worksurface, rather than on the ceiling, as in traditional systems. As a result, illuminance estimation and maintenance is significantly improved. Furthermore, motes functioning as actuators can be interfaced with <b>dimming</b> <b>ballasts</b> without the need to rewire the building, enabling less expensive, less disruptive retrofitting of commercial buildings that were not built with pre-installed energy efficient lighting controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Feasibility Study was to identify the potential of dimmable lighting for providing regulation capacity and contingency reserves if massively-deployed throughout the State. We found that {{one half of the}} total electric lighting load in the California commercial sector is bottled up in larger buildings that are greater an 50, 000 square feet. Retrofitting large California buildings with dimmable lighting to enable fast DR lighting would require an investment of about $ 1. 8 billion and a "fleet" of about 56 million <b>dimming</b> <b>ballasts.</b> By upgrading the existing installed base of lighting and controls (primarily in large commercial facilities) a substantial amount of ancillary services could be provided. Though not widely deployed, today's state-of-the art lighting systems, control systems and communication networks could be used for this application. The same lighting control equipment that is appropriate for fast DR is also appropriate for achieving energy efficiency with lighting on a daily basis. Thus fast DR can leverage the capabilities that are provided by a conventional dimming lighting control system. If dimmable lighting were massively deployed throughout large California buildings (because mandated by law, for example) dimmable lighting could realistically supply 380 MW of non-spinning reserve, 47 percent of the total non-spinning reserves needed in 2007...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of lighting control technologies with photosensors {{has led to}} an increase in public interest. Although these technologies have been promoted during the last years their successful use in buildings has been accomplished in a small percentage of new projects. One reason is the difficulty in quantifying the energy savings and thus the subsequent payback period. Daylight responsive dimming systems consist of three basic components: photosensor, controller, and dimming unit. Electronic <b>dimming</b> <b>ballast</b> (EDB) is one substantial component of these lighting control systems which can adjust the light output due to the transferred signal from the photosensor and lighting controller. The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify energy savings among different EDBs. Eighteen commercial EDBs were selected and various sets of electrical and illuminance measurements were taken for different dimming levels, in order to develop polynomial functions between light output and consumed power. Using the measured data, a set of simulations were performed for a photosensor with an ideal cosine spatial sensitivity distribution installed in a typical office room using two control algorithms, closed loop and integral reset, trying to quantify the relative differences in energy savings.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this scoping study is: (1) to identify current market drivers and technology trends that can improve the demand responsiveness of commercial building lighting systems and (2) to quantify the energy, demand and environmental benefits of implementing lighting demand response and energy-saving controls strategies Statewide. Lighting systems in California commercial buildings consume 30 GWh. Lighting systems in commercial buildings often waste energy and unnecessarily stress the electrical grid because lighting controls, especially dimming, are not widely used. But dimmable lighting equipment, especially the <b>dimming</b> <b>ballast,</b> costs more than non-dimming lighting and is expensive to retrofit into existing buildings {{because of the cost}} of adding control wiring. Advances in lighting industry capabilities coupled with the pervasiveness of the Internet and wireless technologies have led to new opportunities to realize significant energy saving and reliable demand reduction using intelligent lighting controls. Manufacturers are starting to produce electronic equipment [...] lighting-application specific controllers (LAS controllers) [...] that are wirelessly accessible and can control dimmable or multilevel lighting systems obeying different industry-accepted protocols. Some companies make controllers that are inexpensive to install in existing buildings and allow the power consumed by bi-level lighting circuits to be selectively reduced during demand response curtailments. By intelligently limiting the demand from bi-level lighting in California commercial buildings, the utilities would now have an enormous 1 GW demand shed capability at hand. By adding occupancy and light sensors to the remotely controllable lighting circuits, automatic controls could harvest an additional 1 BkWh/yr savings above and beyond the savings that have already been achieved. The lighting industry's adoption of DALI as the principal wired digital control protocol for dimming ballasts and increased awareness of the need to standardize on emerging wireless technologies are evidence of this transformation. In addition to increased standardization of digital control protocols controller capabilities, the lighting industry has improved the performance of dimming lighting systems over the last two years. The system efficacy of today's current dimming ballasts is approaching that of non-dimming program start ballasts. The study finds that the benefits of applying digital controls technologies to California's unique commercial buildings market are enormous. If California were to embark on an concerted 20 year program to improve the demand responsiveness and energy efficiency of commercial building lighting systems, the State could avoid adding generation capacity, improve the elasticity of the grid, save Californians billion of dollars in avoided energy charges and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E

One of the factors influenced the consumption of energy in UTM is street lighting energy usage which consumes about 1, 238. 24 MWh per year of the total energy consumption in UTM. This is approximately 2. 08 % of the total of energy consumption in UTM. Currently, the conventional street lighting installed in the UTM consists of 956 units of 150 W and 277 units of 250 W High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lamp. This type of street lighting usually integrated with magnetic ballast where it is cheap and robust. However, the operation hours cannot be controlled by using this ballast, meaning the operating hours for the street lighting are 12 hours per day, hence consuming more energy.

40|$|The {{design of}} a day lighted space is both an art and a science. The biggest {{challenge}} facing the lighting designer is to admit only as much light as necessary and distribute it evenly throughout the space without introducing glare or heat. In warm climates such as Florida, it has become common practice in windowed spaces to specify blinds and glazing with high shading coefficients to control glare and minimize heat gain. However, this practice reduces the effectiveness of lighting systems that dim automatically. Improved systems are needed to capture natural daylight and distribute it uniformly throughout a space while controlling heat gain and glare. One such system is the light shelf. Light shelves shade the space from direct sunlight and reflect this sunlight onto the ceiling for a deeper and more uniform distribution. While {{this is not a}} new idea, little unbiased empirical data has been collected, outside the laboratory, that compares the performance (energy savings, uniformity, and level) of an automatic daylighting system. This study measures the effectiveness of light shelves and manually controlled horizontal blinds in an automatic daylighting system. Power consumption and interior work-plane lighting levels were compared in four essentially identical private offices. Two offices were configured with an interior light shelf, one with a white diffuse top surface and the other with a specular surface. The third office had no window treatment and the fourth office had horizontal blinds, which were manually adjusted by the user. All offices had two lamp fluorescent luminaires with <b>dimming</b> <b>ballasts</b> (min. 20 %) controlled by a ceiling mounted photosensor.
