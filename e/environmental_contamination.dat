5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable <b>environmental</b> <b>contamination</b> with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state. Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what they were before statehood.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of <b>environmental</b> <b>contamination</b> include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E

25|$|A {{critical}} review of ancient DNA literature {{through the development}} of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years. A greater appreciation for the risks of <b>environmental</b> <b>contamination</b> and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results. The dinosaur DNA was later revealed to be human Y-chromosome, while the DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination. A 2007 study also suggests that these bacterial DNA samples may not have survived from ancient times, but may instead be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.|$|E

30|$|In Switzerland, the {{confinement}} {{to avoid}} uncontrolled spread and reproduction, and {{to rule out}} the possibility of gene flow to the wild flora, is a legal imperative, independently of the approval status of a GMO [11]. Moreover, the finding of <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminations</b> will raise the question of bearing the financial responsibility of decontamination, potential harm to the environment and the environmental follow-up of the contaminated sites, presently borne by the state. Current contamination thresholds [12, 13] represent a political trade-off and are unable to avoid naturalisation of weedy GE-populations established through seed loss during transportation. Our findings and considerations imply that these politically-crafted thresholds are not of sufficient biological relevance.|$|R

The arbitrator had decided that the statute covering the groundwater pollution was primarily a health law, and so ruled that Mattel did not have to pay Hall Street's costs. Since the arbitration agreement had taken the form of an order from a district judge, Mattel and Hall Street had included a provision that the judge could review the arbitration award, he did and the award was reversed.

25|$|From {{a sample}} of 129 beluga adults from the Saint Lawrence River {{examined}} between 1983 and 1999, a total of 27% had suffered cancer. This is a higher percentage than that documented for other populations of this species and {{is much higher than}} for other cetaceans and for the majority of terrestrial mammals; in fact, the rate is only comparable to the levels found in humans and some domesticated animals. For example, the rate of intestinal cancer in the sample is much higher than for humans. This condition is thought to be directly related to <b>environmental</b> <b>contamination,</b> in this case by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and coincides with the high incidence of this disease in humans residing in the area. The prevalence of tumours suggests the contaminants identified in the animals that inhabit the estuary are having a direct carcinogenic effect or they are at least causing an immunological deterioration that is reducing the inhabitants' resistance to the disease.|$|E

30|$|The fish embryo {{toxicity}} test (FET) is an established method in toxicology research for quantifying the risk potential of <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminations</b> and other substances. The typical {{results of the}} method are the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) or the no observed effect concentration (NOEC). However, from an environmental perspective, it is most important to safely identify the concentration of the substance effect which lies above the effect under control condition (spontaneous effect). The common FET is not optimal to detect ECs for small target effects. This paper shows how to optimize the efficiency and consequently {{the benefit of the}} FET for small effects using an adequate experimental design. The approach presented here can be carried over to all test systems generating binary (yes/no) outcomes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — For proper {{transmission}} {{of power in}} overhead transmission lines temperature control and sag monitoring are the two major parameters {{to be kept in}} mind. Electrical load variation and environmental changes affect the temperature in the transmission lines. For proper safety measurements these monitoring should be done on a continuous basis. Some of the ongoing temperature and sag monitoring methods that can be sited are the usage of stainless steel temperature probes, glass based sensors, thermocouples, RTDs, and Infrared sensors. However, all these methods have a disadvantage of having loosening of contacts. Cross sensitivity may also arise due to <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminations.</b> The disturbances caused by the different parameters can be stated as follows:-High temperature due to climate changes decreases th...|$|R

The precautionary {{principle}} originated in environmental risk management to provide regulatory authority to stop specific <b>environmental</b> <b>contaminations</b> {{without waiting for}} conclusive evidence of {{harm to the environment}} (i. e., while there was still “uncertainty” about the evidence). Attempts to apply this concept to “proof of safety” for new food ingredients or products has led to the impossible demand of establishing the “absence of harm,” with a level of evidence that avoids uncertainty. Any requirement to establish safety with no uncertainty will increase costs unnecessarily, and will prove futile. Such actions would allow arbitrary regulatory decisions to stop new products, ultimately causing actual harm rather than protecting consumers, by denying beneficial products or by substituting a significant harm in place of a small theoretical one...|$|R
