25|$|The Democrats {{gained control}} of the Senate, and had {{complete}} control of Congress, having taken over the House in 1875. Hayes vetoed bills from the <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> outlawed the Republican Enforcement Acts; however, with the military underfunded, Hayes could not adequately enforce these laws. Blacks remained involved in Southern politics, particularly in Virginia, which was run by the biracial Readjuster Party.|$|E

25|$|In the 1952 general election, Republicans won a {{majority}} in both the House and Senate. Among defeated <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> year was McFarland, who lost to upstart Barry Goldwater. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the minority leader; he became the most junior Senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees, while retaining it for chairmanships. In the 1954 election, Johnson was re-elected to the Senate, and since the Democrats won {{the majority in the}} Senate, Johnson then became majority leader. Former majority leader William Knowland became minority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President Dwight D. Eisenhower worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.|$|E
500|$|In a 1995 Wall Street Journal column, Paul Gigot {{described}} Higgins as an [...] "idea broker," [...] {{explaining that}} she {{prefers not to}} be associated with political parties. Gigot included a quotation from her, in which she stated, [...] "I am not really interested in a party.... If the Democrats had really been New <b>Democrats,</b> <b>that</b> would have been great. If these Republicans become Old Republicans, they'll lose me too." [...] William Galston, a senior domestic policy adviser in the Clinton administration, said, [...] "I see Heather as an intellectual and policy entrepreneur with some real moral commitments.... I don't see her as a sharply partisan figure, certainly not in the way she deals with people." ...|$|E

500|$|Hayes {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Republican Reconstruction policies throughout his political career, but the first major act of his presidency was an end to Reconstruction {{and the return of}} the South to [...] "home rule". Even without the conditions of the Wormley's Hotel agreement, Hayes would have been hard-pressed to continue the policies of his predecessors. The House of Representatives in the 45th Congress was controlled by a majority of <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> refused to appropriate enough funds for the army to continue to garrison the South. Even among Republicans, devotion to continued military Reconstruction was fading in the face of persistent Southern insurgency and violence. Only two states were still under Reconstruction's sway when Hayes assumed the Presidency and, without troops to enforce the voting rights laws, these soon fell.|$|E
500|$|Johnson believed, as {{did many}} Southern <b>Democrats,</b> <b>that</b> the Constitution {{protected}} private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited {{the federal and}} state governments from abolishing slavery. He won a second term in 1845 against Wiliam G. Brownlow, presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the Mexican War, seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the Wilmot Proviso, a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant [...] to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it. This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.|$|E
500|$|In 1948 [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry" [...] {{underwent}} a revival when Harry S. Truman selected {{it as his}} campaign song for {{the presidency of the}} United States. Republicans and some <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> year joked, [...] "I'm just mild about Harry." [...] The next year Al Jolson performed it in the film Jolson Sings Again and the song became a jazz standard. This return to popularity briefly reunited Blake and Sissle {{for the first time since}} 1933. In 1955, the song again appeared in the Warner Brothers cartoon short One Froggy Evening as one of the songs sung by Michigan J. Frog during his dance routine. Kathy Linden released a version of the song on her 1958 album, That Certain Boy. Writing about American popular songs in 1972, Wilder and Maher call [...] "I'm Just Wild About Harry" [...] the only enduringly popular song from Shuffle Along.|$|E
5000|$|Darr {{failed to}} officially notify Governor Mike Beebe, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>that</b> he was resigning. Beebe {{was the only}} {{constitutional}} officer who could declare the office vacant. Darr did forward copies to Republican elected state officials. He did not immediately pay the $11,000 Ethics Commission fine but according to The Baxter Bulletin, local officials have said he will [...] "pay soon".|$|R
50|$|The {{newspaper}}'s roots can {{be traced}} back to 1843 and the Livingston Courier. It was the county's first and only newspaper until Howell resident George W. Lee launched the Livingston Republican in 1855.In 1857 the Courier folded, was purchased by a Democrat and renamed the Livingston <b>Democrat.</b> <b>That</b> paper folded in 1890 and was bought by a group of Democrats, who ran it until 1928.|$|R

500|$|On April 11, Sestak held {{a debate}} with Toomey in Philadelphia without Specter present, which media {{observers}} {{described as an}} explicit criticism of Specter for refusing to hold more than one debate with Sestak. During that debate, Sestak strongly attacked Toomey's voting record in what The Morning Call reporter Colby Itkowitz described as [...] "an obvious effort to show <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> he could hold his own {{in a general election}} matchup". At the end of the debate, Toomey voiced respect for Sestak and described him as a more principled man than Specter, who he criticized for not participating in more debates. Later that month, when the Senate candidates publicly released their quarterly campaign finance reports on April 15, it was revealed Toomey raised more {{in the first three months}} of 2010 than either Democratic candidate, adding $2.3 million to his total $4.1 million war chest compared to Specter adding $1.1 million to his total $9.1 million fund. Political analysts attributed this to the national swing in momentum toward Republicans, and said that it could indicate the Republicans would be victorious in many Senate races, including in Pennsylvania. Sestak raised $442,000 in the three-month period, down from his previous quarter, which Specter's campaign said proved Democratic donors had rejected his candidacy. Specter's fundraising advantage was significant because it allowed him to start early in running political campaign commercials.|$|E
500|$|When Hayes {{appeared}} to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat Samuel Tilden, the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship: South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida. If Hayes won all three states, {{he would take the}} election by a single electoral vote. Grant asked Garfield to serve as a [...] "neutral observer" [...] in the recount in Louisiana. The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner—Garfield recommended that the entire vote of West Feliciana Parish, which had given Tilden a sizable majority, be thrown out. The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states, to the outrage of Democrats, who had the state legislatures submit rival returns, and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote—under the Constitution, Congress is the final arbiter of the election. Congress then passed a bill establishing the Electoral Commission, to determine the winner. Although he opposed the Commission, feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious, Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> he was too partisan. Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7, with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court. [...] As part of the deal whereby they recognized Hayes as president, Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction.|$|E
2500|$|Before the debates, Lincoln {{said that}} Douglas was {{encouraging}} his fears of amalgamation {{of the races}} with enough success to drive thousands of people away from the Republican Party. Douglas tried to convince, especially the <b>Democrats,</b> <b>that</b> Lincoln was an abolitionist for saying that the American Declaration of Independence did apply to blacks as well as whites. Lincoln called a self-evident truth [...] "the electric cord ... that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together" [...] of different ethnic backgrounds.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{without the}} {{conditions}} of the disputed 1876 election, Hayes would have been hard-pressed to continue the policies of his predecessors. The House of Representatives in the 45th Congress was controlled by a majority of <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> refused to appropriate enough funds for the army to continue to garrison the South. Some Republicans, such as Blaine, strongly criticized the end of Reconstruction. But even among Republicans, devotion to continued military Reconstruction was fading in the face of persistent Southern insurgency and violence.|$|E
2500|$|Morse was a late {{entry in}} the [...] race for the Democratic {{nomination}} for president in 1960. It began unofficially at a 1959 press conference held {{at the state capitol}} in Salem by local resident Gary Neal and other Morse supporters. They declared they would put Senator Morse on the ballot by petition. As early as April 1959, Morse told a meeting of the state's Young <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> {{he had no intention of}} running. The group still voted to advance Senator Morse, after Congresswoman Edith Green introduced him as a favorite son.|$|E
2500|$|As in the 1970s, the Nationalist {{challenge}} {{then fell}} away, {{due in part}} to the replacement in 2000 of Alun Michael with Rhodri Morgan. [...] Under Morgan's leadership, a coalition was formed with the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>that</b> arguably brought a degree of stability to the administration. [...] By 2003 Labour's share increased to 40% (on a marginally increased turnout) and the party gained 30 seats overall, allowing it to govern alone once more. [...] By the 2005 General Election, the party's share fell back to 43% or 29 seats, with the Conservatives regaining a Parliamentary foothold in Wales.|$|E

50|$|Incumbent Republican Congressman Henry E. Brown, Jr. {{defeated}} Democratic candidate Linda Ketner by {{a surprisingly}} thin margin {{to win a}} fifth term in Congress.
