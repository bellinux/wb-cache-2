Treatment for pest eradication in the stored grain was costly, requiring {{an investment in}} drying and storage facilities <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>farm.</b> Failure to dry the grain to the required 14% of moisture also resulted in mouldy grain which was difficult to sell and added to the poor reputation of the Tablelands crop. Initially farmers stored their maize in barns but rodents and weevils soon encouraged the more affluent farmers to erect 1,200 gallon galvanised tanks for storage. They tried to overcome grain moisture problems by sun drying their maize on canvas tarpaulins before storing it in the tanks. Carbon bisulphate was then added {{to the top of}} the sealed tanks to kill the weevils. These efforts had variable results.|$|E

40|$|In {{agricultural}} societies, adjusting {{land and}} labor according to changes of labor endowment {{that result from}} family life cycle events is premised on {{making full use of}} resources <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>farming</b> household and <b>for</b> the economy as a whole. This paper examines how and how well households in pre-modern Japan reallocated land and labor, using a population register covering 150 years from 1720 – 1870 for a village in the Tohoku region. We find that households reacted to equalize their production factors; land-scarce households tended to acquire or rent-in land and out-migrate their kin members, while land-abundant households tended to release or rent-out land, in-migrate kin members, or employ non-kin members. Estimates suggest that more than 80 % of the surplus or deficit area of land was resolved if the household rented or "sold" land. We discuss a potential underlying mechanism; namely, that the village's collective responsibility for tax payment (murauke) motivated both individual households and the village as a whole to reallocate land and labor for the efficient use of resources...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{considerations}} of farmers in making a decision on the combination of enterprises they will adopt on their farms is the returns to the various factors of production, with more importance given to the more scarce resources. A comparison of the profitability {{of a range of}} farming systems including annual crop-based systems, annual crop-dominated agroforestry systems, perennial crop-dominated agroforestry systems and perennial cropping systems was undertaken to determine which of these systems would be most attractive to farmers. A survey of 300 farming households was conducted in Claveria, Misamis Oriental, Philippines to determine which among the alternative farming systems in the area was most profitable. Considering that these farming systems involved perennial crops, the analysis of profitability of agroforestry and non-agroforestry systems was based on the net present value of the benefits with an assumed annual discount rate of 10 %. <b>For</b> <b>each</b> <b>farming</b> system, revenues from the crop, fruit, timber and livestock components were computed separately. The costs incurred in <b>each</b> of the <b>farming</b> strategies were classified into investment costs, cash operating expenses, and non-cash operating expenses.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} farm-level supply and income effects from {{removing}} milk quotas and reducing producer prices with increasing direct compensatory payments.
