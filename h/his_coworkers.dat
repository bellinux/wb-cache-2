5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Altair {{is one of}} the few {{stars for}} which a direct image has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D.

The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.|$|E

Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house.

5|$|Dungeon Siege was {{the first}} title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded by in May 1998 by Chris Taylor, then known for the 1997 {{real-time}} strategy game Total Annihilation. Joined by several of <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> from Cavedog Entertainment, Taylor {{wanted to create a}} different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and Neal Hallford as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused on the action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.|$|E

Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started; Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and background story to him. The game's music was composed by Jeremy Soule, who had also worked on Total Annihilation. The development team included around thirty people during development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion. The development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two.|$|E

5|$|Hilary was {{probably}} born around 1110, and was likely of low birth, {{but nothing is}} known of his ancestry. His brother was a canon of Salisbury Cathedral, and they both {{may have come from}} around Salisbury. Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and as Dean of the church of Christchurch in Twynham, Hampshire, probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois. Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy, or clergy who were not monks, and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139. He was educated as a canon lawyer, and was an advocate, or lawyer, in Rome in 1144. While in Rome, he also served in the papal chancery, or writing office, in 1146. Some of <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> in the chancery were Robert Pullen, John of Salisbury, and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope, as Adrian IV.|$|E
5|$|The Commander Keen series {{began in}} 1990 when John Carmack, then a game {{programmer}} at Softdisk, {{came up with}} a method to produce scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game on IBM-compatible general-purpose computers. After a demo port of Super Mario Bros. 3 failed to entice Nintendo, he and a group of <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> from Softdisk—including programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack—used the technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success for the market, and led the group to quit their jobs and found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was cancelled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.|$|E

Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) tries to correct one of the {{statement}}s, but when Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) checks the fact online, it turns out Michael's statement was correct. Everyone mocks Oscar for his mistake, as Oscar is usually the smartest one in the office, having built this reputation by often correcting <b>his</b> <b>coworkers.</b> Oscar invites Michael {{for a cup of}} coffee, but the other employees realize that Oscar wants to discuss China in more detail, in order to reestablish himself as the office's intellectual heavyweight. Seeing an opportunity to give Oscar a taste of his own medicine, they start quizzing Michael on different facts about China, but he cannot answer, so he makes note cards to keep track. When Michael and Oscar have their conversation, Ryan, Erin, Jim, Andy, and Kelly also sit in to watch. Michael blanks on one topic, but then changes the subject to conversation itself. The employees toast him, while Oscar is left infuriated.|$|E

5|$|After the event, in {{response}} to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four live events in Canada and one in Illinois. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on VHS or DVD due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the WWE Network. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on Raw is War in St. Louis, which the WWF called Raw is Owen. For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also featured interviews and testimonies from <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's funeral service was held on May 31, 1999, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, children, and parents sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that the harness system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, children, and parents US$18million. The manufacturer of the harness system had also been named as a defendant in the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.|$|E
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of <b>his</b> <b>coworkers</b> after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E
