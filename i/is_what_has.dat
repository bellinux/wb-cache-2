5|$|There {{are still}} intense areas of shadow which throw the Cumaean Sibyl into relief. But {{it is more}} than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see {{in the work of the}} man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the {{restoration}} claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over a secco to achieve this effect and that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{testing has}} come from two streams of thought: the first, from Darwin, Galton, and Cattell on the {{measurement}} of individual differences, and the second, from Herbart, Weber, Fechner, and Wundt and their psychophysical measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their research <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{led to the development}} of experimental psychology, and standardized testing.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{emphasized}} love {{as more of}} {{a spiritual}} rather than sexual connection. There is a possibility that other writings not associated with the Church over courtly love were made {{as a response to the}} Catholic Church’s ideas about love. Many scholars believe Andreas Capellanus’ work, De arte honeste amandi, was a satire poking fun at the Church. In that work, Capellanus is supposedly writing to a young man named Walter, and he spends the first two books telling him how to achieve love and the rules of love. However, in the third book he tells him that the only way to live his life correctly is to shun love in favor of God. This sudden change <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> sparked the interest of many scholars.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{spotting}} {{became more}} {{popular with the}} public during the late 1980s and early 1990s. During this period, a number of NSSL (National Severe Storms Laboratory) projects were carried out, {{some of which were}} documented and broadcast on television in a number of specials. Spotters and their actions were attributed to saving lives as well as aiding university research groups, who would drop sensors such as TOTO in the path of tornadoes and at times fire rocketsondes directly at or very close to tornadoes. At about the same time, early storm chasers were popularized and associated with spotters. It is believed this association <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> led many in the present era to associate storm chasers and storm spotters as carrying out the same actions or having the same goals.|$|E

Attribution of this type <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> angered Shady and her supporters. Shady's position has been hampered by a lack of funding for archeological research in her native Peru, as well as the media advantages of North American researchers in disputes of this type.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} version, {{the performance of}} the mass required four soloists (soprano, contralto, tenor and bass), a mixed choir of ideally twelve singers including the soloists, two pianos and harmonium, which sometimes could be replaced by an accordion, according to the first idea of Rossini, but was considered too [...] "popular" [...] for a religious framework {{at the time of the}} creation. This low number of performers contrasts with the dimension of ensembles used at that time to interpret the great works of sacred music.

2500|$|The Michigan Stadium crowd, sensing a major upset, began {{screaming}} and chanting.

With 29 seconds left, Maciejowski fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by Cecil Pryor. The Buckeyes had committed an unheard-of seven turnovers on the day, six interceptions and a fumble. Moorhead took a knee as the crowd counted down the final seconds, then rushed the field in ecstasy. ABC-TV play-by-play announcer Bill Flemming exclaimed, [...] "There it <b>is!</b> <b>What</b> <b>has</b> to be the upset of the century!"

2500|$|Some {{analysts have}} also blamed {{colonialism}} {{for the amount}} corruption. [...] According to this view, the nation's colonial history may have restricted any early influence in an ethical revolution; [...] "the trappings of flashy cars, houses and success of the colonists may influenced the poor to see the colonist as symbols of success and to emulate the colonists in different political ways". Involvement in the agenda of colonial rule may also inhibit idealism in the early stage of the nascent nation's development. A view commonly held during the colonial days was that the colonists property (cars, houses, farms etc.) is not [...] "our" [...] property. Thus vandalism and looting of public property was not seen as a crime against society. This view <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> degenerated into the more recent disregard for public property and lack of public trust and concern for public goods as a collective national property. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, Nigeria's economy would have a higher worth if its level of corruption were closer to Ghana's.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "reticular formation" [...] {{was coined}} {{in the late}} 19th century by Otto Deiters, coinciding with Ramon y Cajal’s neuron doctrine. Allan Hobson states in his book The Reticular Formation Revisited that the name is an etymological vestige from the fallen era of the {{aggregate}} field theory in the neural sciences. The term [...] "" [...] means [...] "netlike structure," [...] {{which is what the}} reticular formation resembles at first glance. It has been described as being either too complex to study or an undifferentiated part of the brain with no organization at all. Eric Kandel describes the reticular formation as being organized in a similar manner to the intermediate gray matter of the spinal cord. This chaotic, loose, and intricate form of organization <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> turned off many researchers from looking farther into this particular area of the brain. The cells lack clear ganglionic boundaries, but do have clear functional organizations and distinct cell types. [...] The term [...] "reticular formation" [...] is seldom used anymore except to speak in generalities. Modern scientists usually refer to the individual nuclei that comprise the reticular formation.|$|E
