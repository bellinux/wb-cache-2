40|$|We {{present an}} {{integrated}} method <b>for</b> <b>program</b> proving, testing, and debugging. Using {{the concept of}} metamorphic relations, we select necessary properties <b>for</b> target <b>programs.</b> <b>For</b> <b>programs</b> where global symbolic evaluation can be conducted and the constraint expressions involved can be solved, we can either prove that these necessary conditions <b>for</b> <b>program</b> correctness are satisfied or identify all inputs that violate the conditions. <b>For</b> other <b>programs,</b> our method can be converted into a symbolic-testing approach. Our method extrapolates from the correctness of a <b>program</b> <b>for</b> tested inputs to the correctness of the <b>program</b> <b>for</b> related untested inputs. The method supports automatic debugging through the identification of constraint expressions that reveal failures. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} <b>for</b> <b>programming</b> parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
5|$|Development of Wild Guns {{began when}} a small team of Natsume staff was asked to create a game quickly and cheaply while waiting for their next major assignment. The team {{consisted}} of three core members: Shunichi Taniguchi for game design and graphics, Toshiyasu Miyabe <b>for</b> <b>programming,</b> and Hiroyuki Iwatsuki for sound. Two other people helped as support staff. The team chose to develop for the Super NES because the three had worked together previously on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for that system. Development of Wild Guns lasted approximately five months and was led by Taniguchi.|$|E
5|$|During the game's development, Harmonix {{only used}} low-fidelity {{versions}} of the remasters, which were sufficient <b>for</b> <b>programming</b> and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios {{would lead to the}} unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity {{versions of the}} songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking {{to make it easier for}} the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous Rock Band games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to be overwhelming to players.|$|E

5|$|Enix was a Japanese {{video game}} {{publishing}} company founded in September 1975 by Yasuhiro Fukushima. Initially a tabloid publisher named Eidansha Boshu Service Center, it was renamed to Enix in 1982, and shortly thereafter ventured into video game publishing for Japanese home computers {{such as the}} PC-8800 series, the X1 series, and the FM-7. Enix initially found games to release by holding contests <b>for</b> <b>programming</b> hobbyists and publishing the winners, with the first titles appearing in February 1983. Enix continued to hold contests and publish the winners through 1993. When Enix moved into traditional publishing for video game consoles in 1985, it began with ports of two of its more successful games, Door Door (1983) and The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983). From that point onward, Enix served as a publisher for both video games developed independently by other companies {{as well as for}} titles in franchises owned by Enix and created by licensed developers. Enix's flagship franchise was the Dragon Quest series of console games, developed primarily by Chunsoft; some of the games, such as Dragon Quest VII (2000), have sold millions of copies, and the series as a whole has sold over 68 million copies as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons is an American {{animated}} sitcom that debuted on December 17, 1989 on the Fox network. The {{show is the}} longest-running {{prime time}} scripted television series in the United States. It has won many different awards, including 32 Emmy awards, 30 Annie Awards, seven Environmental Media Awards, eleven Writers Guild of America Awards, six Genesis Awards, eight People's Choice Awards, three British Comedy Awards, among other awards. Episodes of the show have won 10 Emmys in the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (<b>For</b> <b>Programming</b> less than One Hour) category. However, The Simpsons has never been nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, although the show was submitted in the category in 1993 and 1994. James L. Brooks, an executive producer on the show, won ten Emmys for The Simpsons as well as ten for other shows and holds the record for most Primetime Emmys won by a single person, with 20. The Simpsons was the first animated series {{to be given a}} Peabody Award, and in 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As of 2016, The Simpsons have received a total of 85 Emmy nominations.|$|E
