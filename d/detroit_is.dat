5|$|The {{original}} pathway {{along the}} Grand River Avenue corridor was an Indian trail, a footpath {{used by the}} native population. This trail was later used by the first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan. In Detroit, Grand River {{is one of five}} major avenues (along with Woodward, Michigan, Gratiot, and Jefferson) planned by Judge Augustus Woodward in 1805 that extended from Downtown Detroit in differing directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the trail was expanded into a plank road that formed the basis for one of the first state trunkline highways as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace M-126 and create M-104. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of M-5, M-11, M-43 or business loops off I-96. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown <b>Detroit</b> <b>is</b> an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96).|$|E
