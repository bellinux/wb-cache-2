2500|$|In 1821, an [...] guest {{cabin was}} built on Mount Holyoke by a local committee—one of the first New England summit houses. The {{property}} changed hands several times between 1821 and 1851 when it was bought and rebuilt as a two-story, eight-room hotel. Local entrepreneurs John and Frances French were the primary owners; between 1851 and 1900, the hotel and property were subject {{to a number of}} upgrades and related construction projects including a covered tramway to the summit of the mountain (first drawn by horse, then mechanized), a railroad {{from the base of the}} mountain to a steamboat dock on the Connecticut River, and the construction of a number of outbuildings and trails. With passenger steamship to the connecting summit railway established, the Mount Holyoke [...] "Prospect House" [...] became a popular tourist destination. The steamship would pick up guests at the Smiths Ferry railroad station across the Connecticut River in what was then Northampton, ferry them to a tramway leading to the <b>Half</b> <b>Way</b> <b>House.</b> From there guests could take a steep (600 feet long, rising 365 feet) covered inclined tram to the summit (shown in drawing at right). The track for this tram was first laid in 1867 and the system electrified in 1926. Competing establishments were soon built on Mount Tom and Mount Nonotuck across the Connecticut River, and on Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Toby to the north. The Prospect House property passed hands again in the early 1900s, to chain hotelier Joseph Allen Skinner, who eventually donated the hotel and property to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a state park in 1939 on the condition that the park be named after him (now the J.A. Skinner State Park).|$|E

This allows less than 1% of the 9,000 prisoners released in New Zealand each year to access supported accommodation undermining the Parole Board's ability to reintegrate prisoners successfully.|$|R

40|$|Background- The <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visit {{occurs when}} a {{university}} staff member visits the student and their practice educator <b>half</b> <b>way</b> through the student’s placement. Despite the many benefits of this visit, there is limited research on them. Objectives- This study investigated practice educator’s perspectives of the <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visits made by university staff in order to gather {{their perceptions of the}} purpose, benefits and limitations of the visit. The study also investigated suggestions for adapting and improving it. Methods- Mixed methods research containing both quantitative and qualitative was used. An existing self-rated web-based questionnaire containing multiple choice and open-ended questions was utilized. It was completed by practice educators in the 2015 / 16 academic year. They were registered with The Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland (AOTI) and had a University of Limerick student for placement. 59 participants responded and data was analysed using Statistical Packages for Social Science using version 22. 0 (IBM SPSS Inc, NY, USA, 2013). Results- From the perspective of practice educators, the visit supports both them and also students. The visit offered a means of communication between the University and the placement. Many of the practice educators have a firm understanding on the purpose of <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visits and their benefits. The study also highlighted potential adaptations and improvements which could enhance the <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visit. Conclusion- This study offers insight into the purpose of <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visits as well as the benefits and limitations of them. It generates suggestions on how the visit can be adapted and improved. Future research regarding <b>half</b> <b>way</b> visits can draw on this study to gather a greater understanding of their existence...|$|R
