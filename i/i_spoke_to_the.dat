500|$|On 26 January 2009, Rehman {{signed a}} loan deal with League Two club Bradford City, {{which was to}} last {{until the end of}} the 2008–09 season. Rehman had turned down a chance to move to Luton Town and team up with Mick Harford, who was {{previously}} the assistant manager at QPR, and said he was only prepared to drop down to League Two if he joined Bradford City. Rehman said of the move, [...] "I was only prepared to drop down the leagues to play for this club. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> manager and chairmen and I know they want to get Bradford back up to where they belong. I've been involved in relegation battles in the past and it's nice to be joining a club pushing for promotion – that's a good pressure to have." [...] He made his debut the following day in a 1–0 defeat to Bury at Gigg Lane, and in doing so became the first British Asian to play in all four divisions of professional football in England. He made his home debut on 31 January, playing at right back, in a 2–0 home win over Grimsby Town at Valley Parade. In March he turned down the chance to play for Pakistan in the Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup qualifiers in order to help Bradford's push for promotion.|$|E

The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it."

[...] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E

30|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fish {{advisories}} {{issued in}} the 1980 s, fishing {{had been a}} central part of the diet, economy, and social culture of Akwesasne for centuries. More than just a means of acquiring a dietary mainstay, fishing was described by community members as a livelihood, a lifestyle, and a culture. Almost everyone <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> in <b>the</b> community had a connection in some way to fish or fishing. The process of catching and cooking fish out of the river was at the root of many of the interviewees’ childhoods and something that connected them to their ancestors. People in their 50 s on up through their 90 s recalled with youthful excitement their childhood experiences of going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fish boxes that each family kept on the shore of <b>the</b> river <b>to</b> pull out <b>the</b> evening’s supper. People fondly reminisced about fishing with their fathers on the river, helping their fathers prepare fishing equipment, or helping their mothers clean and cook the fish. Species such as sturgeon, perch, and bullhead were mentioned most frequently, and they were eaten smoked or fried. Fish was eaten several times a week for an ordinary dinner, and in large quantities at “fish fries” to celebrate special occasions and family gatherings.|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the possible limits of inclusive education of children, pupils and students in České Budějovice who are physically disabled. In the theoretical part I define terms such as inclusion, integration and inclusive education also from the legislative {{point of view and}} I characterise the means of special pedagogical support. Next I dedicate to etiology and classification of a physical handicap. In the practical part I set a goal <b>to</b> specify <b>the</b> advantages or possible disadvantages of inclusive education of children, pupils and students with physical handicap in České Budějovice. I chose qualitative type of research and the technique of controlled dialogues. I adressed three nursery, elementary and high schools where a disabled pupil is individually integrated. In every school <b>I</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head teacher and a teacher and I asked them different questions. In the research I found out that most of the adressed head teachers had enough information about inclusive education, some schools are even joined in the project of inclusive education support. For the head teachers the advantages of inclusive education are seen in integration into everyday classes, cooperation and communication with other classmates. The main disadvantage is lack of financial resources and insufficient conditions for inclusive education. From the teachers´ point of view integration is perceived positively although it is quite hard work for them and assistents. Most teachers do not agree with integration of a pupil with serious handicap. All teachers and head teachers agree that integration is dependent on conditions and possibilities of every school...|$|R
40|$|During {{my time in}} college, I've {{had many}} {{experiences}} with Facebook, both negative and positive. One {{of the most exciting}} moments of getting into Syracuse was getting my email address and making my first Facebook account. However, as time has gone on, Facebook has definitely had some negative effects in my life. I've been hurt by friends, received threatening messages, and overall felt pressures to look a certain way if a photo would be posted. I think there are some very positive attributes associated with this social networking tool, but I wonder about the negatives. I want to see how other students feel, in different capacities at Syracuse University. As I began my research, I found very blatant differences between the way girls and boys use Facebook. Many of the experiences I have had were similar <b>to</b> those of <b>the</b> females <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to,</b> but <b>the</b> males' experiences with the site contrasted greatly. The females were much more emotional about their browsing, while the males used it as a leisure, no-brainer activity. This is where the meat of my research emerged from. I wanted {{to find out what the}} differences between the way boys and girls use Facebook are and why that is. What are gender communication differences that explain this contrast? In what ways are they different? Why? These questions were all answered through my research. Females are, in fact, more emotional beings, as anthropologists have found. Therefore, they translate these emotions through menial tasks, even Facebook browsing. Males, on the other hand, don't take the site as seriously or emotionally and use it as a tool for funny or interesting information, not to spur emotional activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this work has been to get knowledge about teachers working in a mathematical workshop with the students.

In this study I have discovered that the lessons in the mathematical workshop are planned after what the students are working with in the textbook. The teacher opens the lessons with the whole class and then splits it up in groups. In the interview the respondent conveys the importance of discussions among the students where they can explain their thoughts, especially for the weaker students that, thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discussions are able to show their knowledge more. This is something I did not see during my lesson observation, however. The students also seemed to miss this when <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> them in <b>the</b> interview.
