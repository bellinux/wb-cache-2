This study aimed {{to evaluate the}} quality and safety of 18 meat products obtained by traditional receipts, including raw/smoked pork sausages (n= 3), loin (n= 1), bacon (n= 2), kaizer (n= 1), ham (n= 1), spareribs (n= 1), pork pastrami (n= 1), and sausages prepared from <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> of pork (n= 8). All samples were bacteriologically examined (Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and E. coli). Also, moisture, fat, total protein, salt and nitrite contents were quantified. All products were Salmonella and L. monocytogenes free. E. coli was recovered in two samples (11. 1 %), a smoked pork sausage and a sausage prepared from <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> of pork, at levels between 1. 5 log and 3. 25 log cfu/g. Moisture ranged from 17. 21 to 67. 46 %, fat 17. 37 – 62. 18 %, protein 8. 13 – 23. 18 %, sodium chloride 1. 50 – 6. 39 %, and nitrites < 10 – 35 ppm, respectively. In two samples (11. 1 %) of smoked meat products the salt content exceeded the maximum limits allowed by law. These results have shown that meat products obtained by traditional recipes are nutritive and safety. However, some varieties of meat products with high salt concentrations should be avoided by persons with dietary salt restriction...|$|E

40|$|The mean goal of {{the study}} was to map food {{products}} that are constant or regular in Brazilian imports during 1989 - 2012 periods. Analyzing Brazilian agricultural imports face to Brazilian total imports it is possible to observe a decreasing cost of food imports in terms of Brazilian imports. Moreover, the study highlights big share of specific products in Brazilian agricultural imports, that is, at first, edible vegetables and certain roots, cereals, edible fruits and nuts, and animal or vegetable fats and oils; at second, dairy products, beverages, spirits and vinegar, live animals, meat and <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> <b>offal,</b> oil seeds and oleaginous fruits, preparations of vegetables, and miscellaneous edible preparations.

40|$|It {{is renowned}} the {{importance}} of trade balance for maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium. So, {{the objective of the}} study was to identify main products in Brazilian agricultural exports from 1989 to 2012 and, secondly, to describe the identified products and formulate questions for future investigations. There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits and meat and <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> must be cited. At second level in terms of frequency in export items there are animal and vegetable fats and oils, cocoa and cocoa preparations, preparations of vegetables and tobacco and manufactured tobacco. It is also remarkable specific codes of cocoa and cocoa preparations, sugars and sugar confectionery, and fruits, for example. Further studies can investigate potential increasing of consumption of those items in global markets and Brazilian perspectives in such scenario...|$|E
40|$|Twenty healthy West African dwarf goats aged between 18 and 24 {{months old}} {{weighing}} 13 - 15 kg were assigned randomly to four groups (T 1 -T 4). The experiment lasted for 14 weeks and animals were fed on concentrate containing {{varying levels of}} <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> and soybean meal. Group T 1 was fed on 100 % soybean meal, group T 2 was fed on 35 % <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> and 65 % soybean meal, group T 3 was fed on 70 % <b>meat</b> <b>offal</b> and 30 % soybean meal, while group T 4 was fed on 100 % <b>meat</b> <b>offal.</b> Semen samples were collected from the animals with a weekly interval between collections. Morphological characteristics and concentration of the sperm cells were analyzed. Primary, secondary and tertiary abnormalities were present in all four groups. Secondary abnormalities were the highest to occurr in all these three categories. Looped tail was the highest to occur in all the groups, with group T 4 having the highest number and percentage of this abnormality. There {{was no significant difference}} among the groups for looped tail abnormality (P< 0. 05). Also, {{there was no significant difference}} (P< 0. 05) among the four groups for total secondary abnormalities observed during the experiment. Primary abnormality of rudimentary tail in-group T 3 was the highest to occur among the four groups, even though there was no significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the total number of primary abnormalities present. Tertiary abnormalities of stumpy tail were the highest occurring among the groups; there was no significant difference (P< 0. 05) in the total number of tertiary abnormalities. The total percentage of abnormalities i. e. primary, secondary and tertiary for groups T 1 -T 4 were 8. 15 %, 6. 63 %, 11. 47 % and 9. 02 %, respectively. The values obtained in each group are less than the 20 % abnormalities recommended for effective performance.

40|$|Silages may {{represent}} 50 - 80 % {{of the total}} amount of diet for dairy cows during the winter. There is overwhelming evidence of contamination of maize and grass silages with fungi and associated trichothecenes, fumonisins, zearalenone, aflatoxins, ochratoxin A as well as some emerging mycotoxins (agroclavine, andrastin A, beauvericin, enniatins, festuclavine, fusaric acid, mevinolin, mycophenolic acid, roquefortins, T 2 /HT 2 toxins). From year to year, multi contaminations often occurred with seasonal variations. The levels and incidences of deoxynivalenol and zearalenone raise concerns about animal health, as the levels overpassed the EC regulatory limits (2006 / 576 /EC) for deoxynivalenol in 2006 -samples from Poland and for zearalenone in 2000 - 2001 maize silages from Germany. AFB 1 levels exceeded the maximum acceptable level in samples from Argentina. Atypical high occurring mycotoxins such as roquefortine C (up to 36, 000 μg/kg), mevinolin (up to 65, 400 μg/kg) and mycophenolic acid (up to 35, 000 μg/kg) were not covered by routine analysis and legislation. These mycotoxins can diversely affect feed intake, productivity, reproductive performance and animal health but acute intoxications causing death are rare. Monitoring of mycotoxin in silages is extremely necessary. Both European and international legislation concerning the maximum tolerable limits must be strict and should also be adapted to include the interaction impacts between toxins. Further studies are needed to evaluate mycotoxin attributed to carry-over via <b>meat,</b> <b>edible</b> <b>offal</b> and lactation. Reliable multi-detection methods must be developed and should cover the normalized sampling plan to cover the heterogeneous distribution within the silo, the seasonal variation and the requirement to detect low levels of these contaminants. Conjugated (masked) forms of the mycotoxins and the long-term impacts to the exposure to low contamination deserved further assessment challenges...|$|R

Experimental diets supplemented with non-treated Phaffia yeast or cell-wall fractured yeast to provide up to 15, 20, and 30 ppm Ax were fed to 4 - or 5 -wk-old chickens for 14 or 21 d. Diets supplemented with Phaffia yeast did not influence performance of broilers or <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> yields. Concerning color analysis of <b>edible</b> <b>meats,</b> for abdominal adipose tissues and breast skin using Minolta reflectance colorimetry, the lightness (L * value) and yellowness (b* value) of the tissues were not meaningfully influenced by the yeast-supplemented diets. However, the redness (a * value) of all tissues measured was significantly increased by the yeast-supplemented diet. The effect was heightened by supplementing fractured yeasts in the broiler feed in proportion to dietary Ax concentration; Ax was detected in <b>edible</b> <b>meats</b> and liver in the concentration range from 0. 1 to 1. 1 µg/g tissue, and the concentration was mostly dependent on the dietary Ax concentration.

The sample was made up of twenty-eight castrated and twenty male Penedesenca Negra chicks reared under free-range conditions and slaughtered at 28 wk of age; the birds were castrated at four or eight weeks. Caponisation significantly increased (P < 0. 01) the chem-ical fat content in all parts (16. 31 % to 37. 98 % in breast; 21. 98 % to 34. 13 % in wing; 21. 09 % to 49. 57 % in thigh; 14. 33 % to 24. 82 % in drumstick) and led to minor modifications in fat characteristics, par-ticularly in the thigh and the drumstick, where the unsaturated vs. saturated fatty acid ratio increased from 1. 31 to 1. 76 (P < 0. 01) and from 1. 48 to 2. 07 (P < 0. 01), respectively. Delaying the age of castration from 4 to 8 weeks increased this ratio by 0. 35 in the <b>edible</b> <b>meat.</b> Even though the profile of the abdominal fat is less saturated in capons, all changes occurring on fat quality after caponisation indicate that increased fatness after castration does not imply worse fat nutritional properties. chicken / capon / <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> / fatty acids Résumé – Comparaison de la composition lipidique de la viande, des tissus adipeux et de...|$|R

Each combination of CM and protein levels was fed in diets of low and high nutrient density to assess the value of added fat in maintaining constant the true metabolizable energy content of diets con-taining CM. Liveweight gains were not affected by either CM or nutrient density. Feed efficiency was not affected by CM when nutrient density was maintained with fat but decreased in diets of lower nutrient density. Low protein diets reduced liveweights, feed efficiency, carcass fleshing grades and <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> yield, and increased abdominal fat. Carcass fleshing grades increased from 7 to 8 weeks of age with no corresponding increase in <b>edible</b> <b>meat</b> yield.
