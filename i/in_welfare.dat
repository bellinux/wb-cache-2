5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings would make a difference to her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|By 1800, the {{increased}} agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh {{to support a}} sizable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased castor sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, {{relief work}} helped keep the women's {{societies}} in Wales active, though membership numbers began to fall. After the People's act of 1918, {{many of the}} regional branches began to wither. The Llangollen WSS resolved to disband in December 1918, handing their marching banner to the National Council, believing their work was done. While others, such as the Newport branch, revised their aims to form a Women's Citizen Association taking an active interest <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> and social issues. Other branches continued the political vision of equal suffrage, notably Bangor, while the Cardiff WSS busied itself by attempting to secure the election of women to local government posts. The fact that the terms of enfranchisement were not equal to men ensured that the surviving suffragist societies still had a focus, and the first point of order was the bill to admit women as MPs. This was passed in October 1918 and seventeen women stood at the 1918 General Election. There was one female candidacy in Wales, Millicent Mackenzie, a former professor of education from the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, who unsuccessfully contested the newly formed University of Wales seat. It took until 1929 for Wales to return its first female MP, Megan Lloyd George, the youngest daughter of the former Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} birth-control clinic {{was established}} in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major role in}} breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> centres.|$|E
25|$|Weldon also co-authored the Family Medical Leave Act, {{pushed for}} the {{extension}} of unemployment benefits, has consistently supported raising the minimum wage, opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, and voted for across-the-board tax cuts.

30|$|From this proposition, {{the fixed}} {{cost of the}} air–rail mode and non-purchase quality in market 2 play an {{important}} role in determining the effectiveness of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality in market 2 is high, the effect of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market depends on the <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> market 3, because cooperation does not impact the <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> market 2 by Proposition  4.6. Thus, in this case, the fixed cost of the air–rail mode affects the social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality in market 2 is relatively low, we need to consider the balance between the decrease <b>in</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> market 2 and the increase <b>in</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> market 3. Since the amount of social <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> each market depends largely on the number of potential customers, the social welfare will be increased by cooperation if the amount of social <b>welfare</b> <b>in</b> the connecting market is relatively large. We will demonstrate this with numerical examples.|$|R

25|$|The need to {{aggregate}} preferences occurs in many disciplines: <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> economics, where one {{attempts to find}} an economic outcome which would be acceptable and stable; in decision theory, where a person {{has to make a}} rational choice based on several criteria; and most naturally in electoral systems, which are mechanisms for extracting a decision from a multitude of voters' preferences.|$|E
25|$|For (2), the {{standard}} criterion is the (Kaldor-Hicks) compensation principle. According to the compensation principle, {{so long as}} those benefiting from a particular project compensate the losers, {{and there is still}} something left over, then the result is an unambiguous gain <b>in</b> <b>welfare.</b> If there are no mechanisms allowing compensation to be paid, then it is necessary to assign weights to particular individuals.|$|E

In contrast, the changes in inequality observed during this period are on average much smaller than changes in average incomes, are uncorrelated with changes in average incomes, and have contributed relatively little to changes <b>in</b> social <b>welfare...</b>|$|R

That same year, pension insurance was extended to all employees, and a means-tested allowance for the wives of prisoners was introduced.|$|E

25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used <b>in</b> <b>welfare</b> economics, an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007).

If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result {{is that there is a}} much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in rich countries. Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts (both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change) would be consistent with observed spending in rich countries on foreign aid (Hepburn, 2005; Helm, 2008:229).|$|E
