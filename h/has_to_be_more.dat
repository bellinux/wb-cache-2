Phthalocyanine is a natively stable dye (has no need for stabilizers) and CD-Rs based on this are often given a rated lifetime of hundreds of years. Unlike cyanine, phthalocyanine is less resistant to UV rays and CD-Rs based on this dye show signs of degradation only {{after two weeks of}} direct sunlight exposure. However, phthalocyanine is more sensitive than cyanine to writing laser power calibration, meaning that the power level used by the writing laser <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> accurately adjusted for the disc {{in order to get a}} good recording; this may erode the benefits of dye stability, as marginally written discs (with higher correctable error rates) will lose data (i.e. have uncorrectable errors) after less dye degradation than well written discs (with lower correctable error rates).|$|E

As Lisa rants {{about the people who}} believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, [...] "There <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in." [...] In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction. While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the first conference {{prompted}} the announcement of a second ISMB conference {{at the end of}} the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in Seattle. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at Stanford University in August 1994 and was organised by Russ Altman, a research scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. ISCB Board member and Director of the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute Alfonso Valencia has stated that, in 1995, [...] "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, there <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> focus in biology." ...|$|E

Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December.

2500|$|Their main {{advantage}} over other orientation descriptions {{is that they}} are directly measurable from a gimbal mounted in a vehicle. As gyroscopes keep their rotation axis constant, angles measured in a gyro frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame. Therefore, gyros are used to know the actual orientation of moving spacecraft, and Euler angles are directly measurable. Intrinsic rotation angle cannot be read from a single gimbal, so there <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than one gimbal in a spacecraft. Normally {{there are at least three}} for redundancy. There is also a relation to the well-known gimbal lock problem of mechanical engineering [...]|$|E

A review from Outlook India noted that, [...] " [...] the show might well heighten awareness, enable the efforts of those doing real work at the ground level, and get the issue out of the denial closet, [...] But {{it is a little}} {{unrealistic}} to expect a film star and a TV show to change the world." [...] Subhash Jha from The Times of India commented on the show, [...] "...though brave and thought provoking, was disappointing in its lack of genuine connectivity between the host and the victims of social atrocity. At the moment Satyamev Jayate looks like a product of elitist conscientiousness." [...] Sheela Bhatt, from Rediff.com, commented that the format of Satyameva Jayate <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> profound, and the big problem of the show is that it is on predictable lines.
