5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or <b>diving</b> <b>tank</b> is a {{gas cylinder}} used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E

40|$|Zebrafish (Danio rerio) {{associative}} {{responses are}} useful for pharmaceutical and toxicology screening, behavioral genetics, and discovering neural mechanisms involved in behavioral modulation. In novel environments, zebrafish swim to tank bottoms and dark backgrounds, behaviors attributed to anxiety associated with threat of predation. To examine possible genetic effects of inbreeding and segregation on this behavior, we compared Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) AB and WIK lines to zebrafish and GloFish® from a pet store (PETCO) in two qualitatively different novel environments: the <b>dive</b> <b>tank</b> and aquatic light/dark plus maze. Behavior was observed in the <b>dive</b> <b>tank</b> for 5 min, immediately followed by 5 min in the light/dark plus maze. Among strains, WIK spent {{more time in the}} <b>dive</b> <b>tank</b> top than AB (76 + 30 vs. 17 + 11 sec), and AB froze in the plusmaze center for longer than PETCO or GloFish® (162 + 61 vs. 72 + 29 or 27 + 27 sec). Further,behavior of zebrafish exposed for 3 min to 25 mg/L nicotine, desipramine, chlordiazepoxide,yohimbine, 100 mg/L citalopram, 0. 05 % DMSO, or 0. 5 % ethanol was compared to controls. Approximately 0. 1 % of drug is available in brain after such exposures. Desipramine or citalopram exposed fish spent more time in the <b>dive</b> <b>tank</b> top, and both reuptake inhibitors bound to serotonin transporters in zebrafish brain with high affinity (K i = 7 + 5 and 9 + 5 nM). In the plus maze, chlordiazepoxide, ethanol and DMSO-exposed fish crossed more lines and spent more time in white arms. Neither 25 mg/L nicotine nor yohimbine altered zebrafish behavior in novel environments, but nicotine was anxiolytic at higher doses. Overall, the light/dark plus maze and <b>dive</b> <b>tank</b> are distinct behavioral measures that are sensitive to treatment with anxiolytic compounds, but zebrafish line selection and solvents can influence baseline behavior in these tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and recall of subsea markers {{is a common}} task amongst offshore commercial divers. Two experiments explored the accuracy of reproduction of subsea marker panels by commercial divers and correlations with tests of embedded figures, memory-for-designs, spatial relations, dotted outlines, and block design. Trials were conducted in <b>diving</b> <b>tanks</b> and in open water. In the <b>diving</b> <b>tanks</b> 30 % recall errors occurred and performance correlated r= 0 · 75 with the embedded figures test. In the open sea again 30 % recall errors were found and performance was well predicted by the embedded figures test (r= 0 · 69).
