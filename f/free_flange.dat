40|$|SUMMARY: We are {{adopting}} a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Model 737 - 600,- 700, and- 800 series airplanes. This AD requires an {{inspection of the}} <b>free</b> <b>flange,</b> vertical web, and radius between the <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> and vertical web of the lower stringers of the wing center section for drill starts, and applicable related investigative and corrective actions. This AD results from drill starts being found on the <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> of the lower stringers of the wing center section during a quality assurance inspection at the final assembly plant. We are issuing this AD to prevent cracks from propagating from drill starts in the <b>free</b> <b>flange,</b> vertical web, and radius between the <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> and vertical web of the lower stringers of the wing center section lower stringers, which could cause a loss of structural integrity of the wing center section and {{may result in a}} fuel leak. DATES: This AD is effective February 16, 2010. The Director of the Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of a certai...|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of cold-formed steel purlins based on Eurocode 3, the lateral bending moment in the <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> of the purlin, when in tension, {{is assumed to be}} zero due to flange curling and second order effects. To {{investigate}} the validity of this design assumption, non-linear analytical and finite element models for analyzing how the gravity load affects the maximum mid-span stresses in cold-formed steel purlins attached to the roof sheeting are presented in this paper. The second-order effect of tensile stresses induced by the gravity load in the <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> of purlins is investigated by emphasizing on Z and C sections. The results obtained from the two models are compared with Eurocode 3, and they are included in this article. It is observed that for shorter purlin span lengths the design assumption underestimates the maximum midspan stresses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A new genus {{and species}} of congrid eel, Castleichthys auritus, is {{described}} from a single specimen collected from 396 m off northwestern Australia. It belongs to the subfamily Congrinae and {{is characterized by a}} slender and flexible tail, a <b>free</b> <b>flange</b> on the upper lip, no plicae or other ornamentation on skin of head, large eye, uniserial maxillary and mandibular teeth, and conspicuous black pectoral fins. The vertebral formula is 15 – 36 – 128...|$|E
40|$|The elasto-plastic {{behavior}} of plain channel section beams under central point loading is investigated under static and impact loading conditions. Two different loading set-ups are considered, {{the first in}} which the load is applied to cause compression at the <b>flange</b> <b>free</b> edges and the second in which the load is applied to cause tension at the <b>flange</b> <b>free</b> edges. For each of these load set-ups static loading tests, single impact loading tests and multiple impact loading tests are carried out on a total of 86 channel beams. The energy absorption {{behavior of}} the beams tested is examined and the static and impact behavior is compared...|$|R
40|$|A {{status report}} of work {{performed}} {{during the period}} May 1, 1992 to October 31, 1992 is presented. Research was conducted in three areas: delamination initiation in postbuckled dropped-ply laminates; stiffener crippling initiated by delamination; and pressure pillowing of an orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell. The geometrically nonlinear response and delamination initiation of compression-loaded dropped-ply laminates is analyzed. A computational model of the stiffener specimens that includes the capability to predict the interlaminar response at the <b>flange</b> <b>free</b> edge in postbuckling is developed. The distribution of the interacting loads between the stiffeners and the shell wall, particularly at the load transfer at the stiffener crossing point, is determined...|$|R
50|$|Rosemount's {{solution}} {{was something of}} a blending of these designs. The hard sole of the boot served as the plate, with small metal clips moulded into the toe and heel flanges to provide an attachment point for their bindings. The attachment points were customized for their own SE-1 toe and SE-2 heel, but their position left the <b>flanges</b> <b>free</b> to be used with any conventional binding of the era, even cables. Mechanically, the SE-1 and SE-2 looked and operated like the contemporary designs from Salomon like the 444. However, they lacked the extensions and metal fingers that held down the boot, replacing these with the clips on the boot itself.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method to model failure of steel beam plastic hinges due to local buckling and low-cycle fatigue is proposed herein. This method {{is based on}} the plastic collapse mechanism approach and a yield-line plastic hinge (YLPH) model whose geometry is based on buckled shapes of beam plastic hinges observed in experiments. Two limit states, strength degradation failure induced by local buckling and low-cycle fatigue fracture, are considered. The proposed YLPH model was developed for FEMA- 350 WUF-W, RBS and <b>Free</b> <b>Flange</b> connections and validated in comparisons to experimental data. This model can be used to estimate the seismic rotation capacity of fully restrained beam-column connections in special steel moment-resisting frames under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions...|$|E
