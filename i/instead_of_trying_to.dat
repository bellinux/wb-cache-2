5|$|A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{suppress}} his transformation, he successfully transforms in {{a controlled}} manner. In a final scene, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him a team is being put together.|$|E
5|$|Shelby Corcoran is a {{recurring}} fictional character from the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. Portrayed by actress Idina Menzel, Shelby {{was introduced in}} the fourteenth episode of the show as the coach of Vocal Adrenaline, a rival show choir to New Directions, the show's primary musical group. Fans had lobbied for Menzel to be cast as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) biological mother, due to the strong physical resemblance between Menzel and Michele. After it is revealed that Shelby is, in fact, Rachel's biological mother, Shelby discloses that she had signed a contract that stated that she could not seek out her daughter until she was eighteen. She tells Rachel that <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> act like mother and daughter, they should just be grateful that they have met, and maintain their distance.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course of an article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E
50|$|This website {{represented}} a discursive context that “explicitly refused any {{dialogue with the}} ÖVP-FPÖ government and <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> that <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> develop its own identity”.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflicts}} at Narita were a {{major factor}} in the decision to build Kansai International Airport in Osaka offshore on reclaimed land, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> again <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> expropriate land in heavily populated areas.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run toward {{the middle of the field}} <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games. The victory clinched the AAFC's western division for the Browns and assured the team a spot in the championship game.|$|E
25|$|Australia then {{played a}} two-day match against Northants, a drawn match in which Australia opted for batting {{practice}} <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> force the win.|$|E
25|$|Many times, the {{apparently}} active resistance encountered in subjects {{is no more}} than an unconscious measure of testing the hypnotist's willingness to meet them halfway <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> force them to act entirely in accord with his ideas.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 2016, the NFL {{announced}} it would bring back the veteran combine renaming it the Pro Player Combine and focus its attention on younger players <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> veterans <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get another chance in the NFL.|$|R
50|$|Another show of {{disregard}} came In late 1997 when Suharto {{had to go}} to Germany {{to receive}} health treatment. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> leaving <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> execute Presidential duties, Suharto ordered State Secretary Moerdiono to come to his residence to receive Presidential duties.|$|R
30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} is that solving sub-problems independently from each other, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> directly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> solve the larger problem, may provide better classification results overall. This assumption is not new and has motivated several strategies in computer science (e.g., the divide-and-conquer strategy).|$|R
25|$|The global {{license is}} a {{realistic}} measure {{in the long}} run. Internet users will use peer-to-peer networks anyway and there are already millions of peer-to-peer users so it’s unreasonable to claim {{that they will be}} prosecuted. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> revert this trend {{it would be better to}} tax it.|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find out why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting {{to have taken place}} would have been to fake his death.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} Mack's army {{was divided into}} four corps. Jellačić had 15,000 troops in 16 {{infantry}} battalions, six Jäger companies, and six cavalry squadrons {{to the south of}} Ulm. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg commanded 28 battalions and 30 squadrons at Ulm. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck had 30 battalions and 24 squadrons near Günzburg. Kienmayer's command near Ingolstadt consisted of 19 battalions and 34 squadrons. Unwisely, Mack decided to defend Ulm, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> escape the approaching French army.|$|E
2500|$|Now the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff can {{shape our}} {{military}} establishment to fit {{what is our}} policy, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> having <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be ready to meet the enemy's many choices.

5000|$|The series {{received}} positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "The Jeselnik Offensive {{is one of}} {{the best}} Central shows. It's a highly intriguing and reliably funny take on the late-night format," [...] adding, [...] "Jeselnik and his writers prove that the key to making jokes about touchy subjects is actually being funny <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be edgy." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{innovation}} {{allows the}} player to optionally just {{stand in front}} of an object and type LOOK, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> several nouns <b>to</b> match the object. Also, typing LOOK OBJECT causes Westland to turn towards the object in question.|$|R
25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
25|$|Later, between 1967 and 1971, {{during the}} final years of the {{step-by-step}} dismantling of the White Australia policy, approximately 10,000 Turkish citizens settled in Australia under an agreement between Australia and Turkey. From the 1970s onwards, there was a significant shift in the government's attitude towards immigration, and with the White Australia policy now totally dismantled from 1973 onwards, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make newer foreign nationals assimilate and forgo their heritage, the government became more accommodating and tolerant of differences by adopting a policy of multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the incident, the Canadiens traded Roy and captain Mike Keane to the Colorado Avalanche in {{exchange}} for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Ručinský and Andrei Kovalenko. The return for Roy was seen as uneven {{at the time it}} was made, and eventually became known as one of the most one-sided deals in NHL history. Canadiens General Manager Réjean Houle at the time had been GM for only 40 days and faced criticism for making the trade <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> resolve the tension between Roy and Tremblay.|$|E

50|$|Bombelli avoided {{confusion}} {{by giving}} a special name to square roots <b>of</b> negative numbers, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with them}} as regular radicals like other mathematicians did. This {{made it clear that}} these numbers were neither positive nor negative. This kind of system avoids the confusion that Euler encountered. Bombelli called the imaginary number i “plus of minus” and used “minus of minus” for -i.|$|R
30|$|In our analysis, {{we found}} that {{students}} adopt different concepts at different times. Concept adoption times are quite varied and it is too simplistic to classify students as early adopters or late adopters. This strengthens the value of such fine-grained analysis and subsequent targeted intervention. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> identify students who are having difficulty in general, we can identify the particular concepts certain students are struggling with.|$|R
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|The occupations {{had already}} {{generated}} disorganised local oppositions by numerous militant resistance groups. The {{establishment of an}} organised national movement against the occupying forces was the first goal in Mustafa Kemal's mind. The General Inspector position created an ideal situation in organising the resistance. He contacted local leaders, provincial governors and military commanders calling them to resist the occupations <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> disarm the military units. In June 1919, he and his close friends issued the Amasya Circular, which stated that {{the independence of the}} country was in danger, since the Ottoman government in Istanbul was subject to foreign control the nation had to save itself by its own will and sources.|$|E
25|$|According to Gwendolyn O’ Neal, {{the author}} of African American Aesthetics of Dress (1997), she states that “while an African-American {{aesthetic}} of dress is neither African nor American, it is shaped by unique ‘cultural’ experiences resulting from being of African descent and living in America”. The famous rapper, Jay Z also echoed the same words O’Neal talks about. In a Black Book Magazine interview Jay Z made, he once defended the upper-class tastes of fashion in the hip hop culture as ‘living it on our terms, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> emulate an elite lifestyle’ with the wearing of high-net-worth fashion house brands. It is not necessarily because of conspicuous consumption that the hip hop lifestyle brought in these high end fashion products.|$|E
60|$|Already had {{the two men}} {{succeeded in}} {{removing}} the two dump-carts, and were now at work upon the hay-rack, with every prospect of pulling it sufficiently {{out of the way}} to admit of their driving past; but when they saw the three boys coming down the road, they evidently concluded that they had worked quite as long as was safe, for they began to look out for their own welfare, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> longer <b>to</b> get away with the team.|$|R
50|$|Despite their efforts, University of Arizona {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Nike on August 17. SAS said they {{knew it was going to}} happen, so <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> spending resources <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stop the contract their focused on ways to void it.|$|R
30|$|Professional {{stakeholders}} in risk and hazard management {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the progressive potential of the resilience concept, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> simply <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> keep social-ecological systems as stable as possible and in balance. With the exploration of local knowledge and its integration into risk and hazard management, one can develop an approach that directs attention to the acquisition of local skills and knowledge that help the local population adapt to and cope with future environmental changes.|$|R
25|$|Nest refoundation by colonies that {{lose the}} {{original}} one is pretty common, and allows this species of wasps {{to thrive in}} highly disturbed landscapes, that face frequent fires or other disturbances. When the nest is destroyed or goes lost, the swarm just moves to a near point (a branch or else) and begins another nest. Sometimes, when {{there are lots of}} wasps, the swarm may break up and create several new little nests. Only the one with the foundress in it will produce female offspring and complete the cycle, while the other ones will end up producing worker males. If one of those secondary nests is lost, its workers will rather rejoin a near group of other sisters <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> found it again.|$|E
25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get it on the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
25|$|Born in Munshiganj, Bengal Presidency {{during the}} British Raj (present-day Bangladesh), Bose {{graduated}} from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta.

Instead, he conducted his research with the Nobel Laureate Lord Rayleigh at Cambridge and returned to India.

There, despite racial discrimination and a lack of funding and equipment, Bose carried on his scientific research. He made remarkable progress in his research of remote wireless signalling and was the first to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals.
