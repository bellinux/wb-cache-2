5|$|After leaving Biograph {{at the end}} of 1912, Pickford {{returned}} to stage acting in the Broadway production of David Belasco's play A <b>Good</b> <b>Little</b> Devil. In May 1913 she resumed acting in motion pictures when she signed with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company. The first five features she made for Zukor were released in the United States on a state rights basis, where regional organizations in each state handled the distribution of each film. Only one of these films is known to survive complete.|$|E

He'd made some token appearances in the past—most notably in season one's 'Call of the Simpsons'—but 'Dead Putting Society' much more clearly defined the Ned we'd come to know and love. It also featured scads of <b>good</b> <b>little</b> bits and gags and seemed like a solid program." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, commented that apart from [...] "the memorable lawn mowing sequence at the end, this episode is notable for our first viewing of the gaudy, gadget-filled, God-fearing splendour that is the Flanderses' home." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{years into}} their marriage, Charlotte {{gave birth to}} a daughter, Princess Feodora, on 12 May 1879. The new princess was the first {{grandchild}} of the Crown Prince and Princess, as well as the first great-grandchild of Queen Victoria. Charlotte had hated the limitations placed on her while pregnant, and decided this would be her only child, to the dismay of her mother. Following Feodora's birth, Charlotte devoted her time to enjoying society life in Berlin and embarking on long holiday trips. During these trips, Charlotte would often leave her daughter to stay with Vicky, whom she viewed as the source of a convenient nursery. Feodora frequently made long visits to Friedrichshof, her maternal grandmother's estate; on one occasion, Vicky observed that Feodora [...] "is really a <b>good</b> <b>little</b> child, & far easier to manage than her mother".|$|E

500|$|Sheldon Posen, {{curator of}} the Canadian Museum of Civilization, noted during the opening of an exhibit {{dedicated}} to Richard in 2004 that he had long been an idol in Quebec, but it was Carrier's story that expanded Richard's reputation in English Canada and sealed his place as a pan-Canadian hero. Jason Blake, a professor of English at the University of Ljubljana, argued the irony of this in his book Canadian Hockey Literature. He stated that many francophones viewed Richard as a [...] "hero of the people, an athletic freedom fighter against the rest of Canada". The conflicts Carrier experienced in The Hockey Sweater are sometimes viewed as being an allegory for the relationship and tensions between French and English Canada, {{as well as the}} rivalry between the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs. Carrier stated, however, he had no political motivations, and only wished to [...] "tell a <b>good</b> <b>little</b> story".|$|E
500|$|The remastered soundtrack {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. North {{noted that the}} revamped music [...] "might be less agreeable to fans of the original score", while praising the general improvement in the sound.

Renaudin said that, while the soundtrack was crisper, fans of the original [...] "might not immediately notice the acoustic alterations." [...] Eternal Calm, Last Mission and Will received mixed responses. Caires called Last Mission [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>little</b> distraction", but called Will [...] "incomprehensible". Sullivan didn't enjoy Eternal Calm or Last Mission, while finding Will [...] "incredibly weird and confusing.", recommending players to stay clear of it. Wallace called Last Mission [...] "a nice diversion, but not incredibly engaging.", while North noted that it [...] "may not have as much appeal to fans of your typical Final Fantasy game." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{film critics}} have {{described}} Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, [...] "In this slightly modernized {{version of the}} story, Mulan... {{is something of a}} rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a <b>good</b> <b>little</b> subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes." [...] Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that [...] "Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy," [...] observing {{the way in which the}} character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; broad shoulders and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her [...] "traditionally slim Disney waist." [...] Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as [...] "brainy." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very <b>good</b> <b>little</b> girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
500|$|The Maharishi had {{arranged}} a simple lifestyle for his guests, which included stone cottages and vegetarian meals taken outdoors in a communal setting. The days {{were devoted to}} meditating and attending lectures by the Maharishi, who spoke from a flower-bedecked platform in an auditorium. The Maharishi also gave private lessons to the individual Beatles, nominally due to their late arrival. The tranquil environment provided by the Maharishi – complete with meditation, relaxation, {{and away from the}} media throng – helped the band to relax. Harrison told Saltzman, [...] "Like, we're The Beatles after all, aren't we? We have all the money you could ever dream of. We have all the fame you could ever wish for. But, it isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?" [...] Lennon was respectful of the Maharishi but not in awe of him. At their first meeting Donovan remembers that the Maharishi was [...] "amiable but non-talkative", and during an awkward silence Lennon walked across the room and patted the Maharishi on the head, saying, [...] "There's a <b>good</b> <b>little</b> guru" [...] while the room erupted in laughter. Maharishi cancelled the formal lectures for a time and told students to meditate for as long as possible. One student meditated for 42 straight hours, and Pattie Boyd once meditated for seven hours. Boyd's sister Jenny meditated for long periods as well, but also suffered from dysentery (misdiagnosed as tonsilitis); she said Lennon also felt unwell, suffering from jet lag and insomnia. The lengthy meditation sessions left many students moody and oversensitive. Like the 60 other students at the ashram, the Beatles adopted native dress and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. The Beatles shopped in Rishikesh and the women bought saris for themselves and to be made into shirts and jackets for the men, which affected Western fashion when the Beatles wore them after going home.|$|E

2500|$|Pickford {{left the}} stage to join Zukor's roster of stars.

Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of A <b>Good</b> <b>Little</b> Devil. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called [...] "one of the worst [...] I ever made ... it was deadly".
