5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film. Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as {{executive producer of}} Napoleon Dynamite. Anderson said he intended to select interviewees {{with a variety of}} perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first to}} confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on <b>Fuck,</b> <b>it</b> became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

The resulting wretched, scarred, abused, tortured rape victim of a movie is an unwatchable seventy minutes of shattered homes and broken dreams." ...|$|R
500|$|Knock Madness was {{supported}} by three singles, [...] "Old Friend", [...] "Hop Is Back", and [...] "Rip Your Heart Out", the last of which features Tech N9ne.

500|$|Metal Storm {{reviewed}} the DVD {{recording of the}} live performance and called it [...] "a perfect way to discover the music of Wednesday 13 that I could describe as a mix of Glam with Punk". Justin Donnelly {{reviewed the}} album for The Metal Forge and wrote favorably about the DVD portion: [...] "Shot with six cameras, <b>Fuck</b> <b>It,</b> We'll Do It Live is a raw and honest representation of Wednesday 13 live in concert". A review by Metal Rage was critical of the DVD, but praised the audio on the CD: [...] "All in all I definitely recommend the CD, 'cause you get a nice representative image of what a good Wednesday 13 show sounds like." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 2002 episode [...] "Game Day" [...] (number 9 of {{the first}} season) of The Wire, Detective Lester Freamon uses the phrase when {{investigating}} the dealings of a Baltimore criminal gang to explain the political difficulty of investigating organized crime, saying [...] "You follow drugs, you get drug addicts and drug dealers. But you start to follow the money, and you don't know where the <b>fuck</b> <b>it's</b> gonna take you".|$|R
5000|$|Skinner {{has since}} downplayed {{the quality of}} the song, saying [...] "We did the track and it felt really genuine, but a bit of a laugh as well. Then the label started getting too excited by <b>it,</b> so I <b>fucked</b> <b>it</b> off. I didn't really think it was that good." [...] Despite this, he rapped a part of the song during his {{performance}} at the BBC Electric Proms on 23 October.|$|R

500|$|Originally, [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{was planned}} to be {{released}} as the third single from The Fame Monster, as a preference of Gaga's record label. The singer's own choice, [...] "Alejandro", initially saw poor reception in terms of radio play, thereby was not seen as a viable choice for a single. A quarrel then arose between Gaga and her label where [...] "Alejandro" [...] was ultimately chosen to be released. Through her account on Twitter, the singer remarked on the decision, [...] "Alejandro is on the radio. <b>Fuck</b> <b>it</b> sounds so good, we did it little monsters." [...] The single was officially sent to radio on April 20, 2010 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|West Coast artist The Game also {{recounts the}} impact of Illmatic for fans like himself outside of New York.

H. Smith and Woolworth's. The Conservative Shadow Minister for Education condemned it as [...] "a symptom of the way society is declining" [...] and both the Independent Television Companies' Association and the Association of Independent Radio Contractors banned its advertisements. Nonetheless, advance sales were sufficient to make it an undeniable number one on the album chart.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998 Mackintosh {{was named}} in {{a list of}} the biggest private {{financial}} donors to the Labour Party, a decision he later claimed to regret, saying: [...] "Labour really <b>fucked</b> <b>it</b> up. They were profligate {{at a time when we}} were doing well. That's why we have the problems we have now. They didn't save any money for a rainy day. It couldn't have been worse these last 12 years." [...] In the 2015 British general election, Mackintosh donated £25,000 to the successful Conservative candidate for Somerton and Frome, David Warburton.|$|R
500|$|One {{of their}} collaborations was [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{and like most}} songs on Music, it is bright and {{uplifting}} in its composition, and was described by Madonna as [...] "downright silly". She explained that they [...] "were working on that song and I thought, 'Oh, <b>fuck</b> <b>it,</b> let's just have fun', Life would be such a drag if we were deep and probing all the time." [...] The song {{was intended to be}} released as the fourth single off Music but Warner Bros., Madonna's recording company, wanted [...] "Amazing" [...] to be the next single. Madonna felt that [...] "Amazing" [...] was too similar to her previous single [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] (1999), and wanted the more eclectic and futuristic [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] so they were in a deadlock.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{returned}} to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The string parts were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mastered {{at the same}} location, and mixed {{over the next two}} months at various studios around the city. Godrich preferred a quick and [...] "hands-off" [...] approach to mixing, and said: [...] "I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I <b>fuck</b> <b>it</b> up... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective." ...|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. started {{recording}} Reckoning at Reflection Sound in Charlotte, North Carolina, on December 8, 1983. The group recorded {{over two}} eight-day stretches around Christmas 1983, separated by {{two weeks of}} canceled studio time that allowed the band to play a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, go out to see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio. While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews Buck at times commented that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that {{they were at the}} studio for at least 25 days (during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said [...] "When I read 'eleven days' I thought, what the <b>fuck!</b> <b>It</b> was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven." ...|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, <b>fuck</b> <b>it</b> up and somehow make it a part of your own voice". When assembling the cut for [...] "Deep Down", Patton was able {{to get in touch with}} the original vocalist, a woman named Christy, though mutual friend Daniele Luppi. However, she declined to take part in the project.|$|E
500|$|The album title {{led to a}} {{legal case}} that {{attracted}} considerable attention: a Virgin Records store in Nottingham that put the album in its window was threatened with prosecution for displaying [...] "indecent printed matter". The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that bollocks was an Old English term for a small ball, that it appeared [...] "in place names without stirring any sensual desires in the local communities", {{and that in the}} nineteenth century it had been used as a nickname for clergymen: [...] "Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense." [...] In the context of the Pistols' album title, the term does in fact primarily signify [...] "nonsense". Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. An exasperated Jones said, [...] "Oh, <b>fuck</b> <b>it,</b> never mind the bollocks of it all." ...|$|E
