50|$|In {{order to}} control the trailer service brakes, the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves {{connected}} in-series to give three inputs) of the <b>foot-valve</b> <b>and</b> trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor-protection valve, and onward towards the trailer relay valve via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's service brakes to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor.|$|R

50|$|An {{autonomous}} production {{program for}} magnetic filters <b>and</b> <b>strainers</b> was developed; in 1952 Argo received a patent for magnetic filters. The product portfolio was expanded to hydraulic filters for the mobile and industrial hydraulics, which were produced {{in a former}} cigar factory in Kraichtal/Germany. In 1965 the head office was also transferred to Kraichtal.|$|R
50|$|Production of hemp milk {{requires}} hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes {{call for}} ground vanilla or vanilla extract {{to add more}} flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all ingredients are blended together some people pour the product over a cheesecloth <b>and</b> <b>strainer</b> to get a smoother and more refined milky texture. The straining process is optional.|$|R

50|$|For {{hydrocarbon}} condensates, {{light crude}} or heavy crude and refined products, very little filtration is utilized. Damage to flow meters, valves and pumps is very costly. Traditional filtration {{used in these}} applications is mesh screens in cone <b>strainer</b> <b>and</b> basket <b>strainer</b> formats {{that are designed to}} stop contamination in excess of 100 microns.|$|R
50|$|Monel's {{corrosion}} resistance makes it ideal in {{applications such as}} piping systems, pump shafts, seawater valves, trolling wire, <b>and</b> <b>strainer</b> baskets. Some alloys are completely non-magnetic and are used for anchor cable aboard minesweepers, housings for magnetic-field measurement equipment. In recreational boating, Monel wire is used to seize shackles for anchor ropes, Monel is used for water and fuel tanks, and for underwater applications. It is also used for propeller shafts and for keel bolts.|$|R

5000|$|The pumpman's {{job is to}} {{keep the}} liquid cargo system on a tanker running. [...] The liquid cargo system {{consists}} of several components.

50|$|Some {{industrial}} strainers available are simplex basket strainers, duplex basket <b>strainers,</b> <b>and</b> Y <b>strainers.</b> Simple basket strainers {{are used}} to protect valuable or sensitive equipment in systems that {{are meant to be}} shut down temporarily. Some commonly used strainers are bell mouth strainers, foot valve strainers, basket strainers. Most processing industries (mainly pharmaceutical, coatings and liquid food industries) will opt for a self-cleaning strainer instead of a basket strainer or a simplex strainer due to limitations of simple filtration systems. The self-cleaning strainers or filters are more efficient and provide an automatic filtration solution.|$|R
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, <b>and</b> <b>strainer</b> must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Bronze {{tools and}} {{implements}} were another common burial offering associated with anthropoid ceramic coffins. The bronze items are usually Egyptian {{in style and}} consist of bowls, pitchers, knives, and in one case a wine set. The wine set consisted of a bronze pitcher <b>and</b> a <b>strainer</b> <b>and</b> {{is one of only}} a few complete sets found. In a rich coffin of a woman at Deir el-Balah an Egyptian New Kingdom style bronze mirror was found.

50|$|A {{relay valve}} is an {{air-operated}} valve typically used in air brake systems to remotely control the brakes {{at the rear}} of a heavy truck or semi-trailer in a tractor-trailer combination. Relay valves are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel {{to the rear of the}} vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, <b>foot-valve,</b> parking-control valve, <b>and</b> trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located.|$|R

40|$|The planned or {{potential}} use of roughened channel fishways by boaters requires attention to design to prevent common river hazards to recreationalists and their non-motorized craft. The {{focus of this}} paper is on the synergistic and seemingly opposing design objectives encountered when considering an integrated fish and boat passage structure. The paper identifies and provides examples of various hazards such as overly retentive hydraulics, excessive drops or steep rapids, pinning and broaching hazards, <b>and</b> <b>strainers.</b> Recommendations on the placement of woody debris for habitat creation in low velocity regions are explained as well as alternative methods for creating velocity breaks in fast moving regions. The impact of design flows on the steepness and rapids and the spacing of recovery pools are discussed. The importance of rock placement details and quality control in construction to avoid hand and foot entrapment is also covered. The need for ancillary improvements such as portage paths, warning signs, put-in and take outs are outlined. The paper treats the recreational whitewater boater as a target species where the facility is located on a water body they are known to frequent or could be attracted to by the creation of a naturalistic fish passage...|$|R

40|$|Historically, fouling organisms {{on ships}} {{have been a}} major source of {{introduced}} species (Carlton 1979 a, 1979 b, 1987, 1989). Modern anti-fouling paints and high ship speeds greatly reduce the amount of fouling today. However, fouling is often common in sea chests and at certain points on the bottom. We sampled tankers during routine maintenance in dry dock, selected to estimate the potential range of fouling and diversity of fouling organisms. 7 B. Methods We sampled the fouling communities of two ships in dry dock: the S/R Baytown (in San Francisco Bay), which had not been cleaned in dry dock for approximately 2 years; and the S/R Benicia (in Portland), which had been cleaned in dry dock within about 6 months. The S/R Baytown had remained within San Francisco Bay for several months without making an ocean voyage prior to haul out, providing time for further accumulation of fouling organisms. Representative patches of fouling communities were scraped from the bottoms of the ships within 6 hours of haul out and before any cleaning had commenced. The sea chests <b>and</b> <b>strainers</b> of the ambient water intakes were also sampled. All samples were preserved in 10 % formaldehyde and returned to the laboratory for sorting and identification using a dissectin...|$|R
