6000|$|But can {{you call}} this true: [...] "There is nobody but is ashamed of having loved when once he loves no longer"? If it be true at all, I don't think the love was much worth having or giving. If one really loves once, one can never be ashamed of it; for we never cease to love. However, {{this is the very}} high water of sentiment, you will say; but I blush no more for it than M. le Duc de Rochefoucauld for his own opinion. Perhaps I am {{thinking}} of that kind of love about which he says: [...] "True love is like ghosts; which <b>everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> and few have seen." [...] "Many be the thyrsus-bearers, few the Mystics," [...] as the Greek proverb runs. [...] "Many are called, few are chosen." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{month or}} two after my return to London my aunt Emily (who {{was not one of}} the West Indian side of the house) managed to get me an {{invitation}} to Mrs. Bouverie Barton's. Of course you know Mrs. Bouverie Barton, the famous novelist, whose books <b>everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about.</b> Well, Mrs. Barton lives in Eaton Place, and gives charming Thursday evening receptions, which are the recognized rendezvous of all literary and artistic London. If there is a celebrity in town, from Paris or Vienna, Timbuctoo or the South Sea Islands, you are sure to meet him in the little back drawing-room at Eaton Place. The music there is always of the best, and the conversation of the cleverest. But what pleased me most on that occasion was the fact that Mr. Gerard Llewellyn, the author of that singular book [...] "Peter Martindale," [...] was to be the lion of the party on this particular Thursday. I had just been reading [...] "Peter Martindale"--who had not, that season? for it was the rage of the day--and I had never read any novel before which so impressed me by its weird power, its philosophical insight, and its transparent depth of moral earnestness. So I was naturally very much pleased at the prospect of seeing and meeting so famous a man as Mr. Gerard Llewellyn.|$|E
6000|$|Again, {{there are}} some abuses which cannot be more {{effectively}} attacked, than by a mere statement of the facts in the plainest and least argumentative terms. The history of such an impost as the tax upon salt (Gabelle), and a bold outline of the random and incongruous fashions {{in which it was}} levied, were equivalent to a formal indictment. It needed no rhetoric nor discussion to heighten the harsh injustice of the rule that [...] "persons who have changed domicile are still taxed for a certain time in the seat of their former abode, namely, farmers and labourers for one year, and all other tax-payers for two years, provided the parish to which they have removed is within the same district; and if otherwise, then farmers to pay for two years, and other persons for three years" [...] (Taille). Thus a man under the given circumstances would have to pay double taxes for three years as a penalty for changing his dwelling. We already hear the murmur of the cahiers of five-and-twenty years later in the account of the transports of joy with which the citizens of Lisieux saw the taille proportionelle established (1718), and how numerous other cities sent up prayers that the same blessing might be conferred on them. [...] "Reasons that it is not for us to divine, caused the rejection of these demands; so hard is it to do a good act, which <b>everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about,</b> much more in order to seem to desire it, than from any intention of really doing it.... To illustrate the advantages of this plan, the impost of 1718 with all arrears for five years was discharged in twelve months without needless cost or dispute. By an extravagance more proper than any other to degrade humanity, the common happiness made malcontents of all that class whose prosperity depends on the misery of others,"--that is the privileged class.[161] ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{there is}} another way of testing it: ask {{yourself}} how many people you have met who grumbled at a thing as incurable, and how many who attacked it as curable? How many people we have heard abuse the British elementary schools, as they would abuse the British climate? How few have we met who realised that British education can be altered, but British weather cannot? How few there were that knew that the clouds were more immortal and more solid than the schools? For a thousand that regret compulsory education, where is the hundred, or the ten, or the one, who would repeal compulsory education? Indeed, the very word proves my case by its unpromising and unfamiliar sound. At the beginning of our epoch men talked with equal ease about Reform and Repeal. Now <b>everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> reform; but nobody talks about repeal. Our fathers did not talk of Free Trade, but of the Repeal of the Corn Laws. They did not talk of Home Rule, but of the Repeal of the Union. In those days people talked of a [...] "Repealer" [...] as the most practical of all politicians, the kind of politician that carries a club. Now the Repealer is flung far into the province of an impossible idealism: and the leader of one of our great parties, having said, in a heat of temporary sincerity, that he would repeal an Act, actually had to write to all the papers to assure them that he would only amend it. I need not multiply instances, though they might be multiplied almost to a million. The note of the age is to suggest that the past may just as well be praised, since it cannot be mended. Men actually in that past have toiled like ants and died like locusts to undo some previous settlement that seemed secure; but we cannot do so much as repeal an Act of Parliament. We entertain the weak-minded notion that what is done can't be undone. Our view was well summarised in a typical Victorian song with the refrain: [...] "The mill will never grind again the water that is past." [...] There are many answers to this. One (which would involve a disquisition on the phenomena of Evaporation and Dew) we will here avoid. Another is, that to the minds of simple country folk, the object of a mill is not to grind water, but to grind corn, and that (strange as it may seem) there really have been societies sufficiently vigilant and valiant to prevent their corn perpetually flowing away from them, to the tune of a sentimental song.|$|E

50|$|Despite his {{prolific}} {{output and}} stature in Japan, {{only a handful}} of papers and only one book (although even that remains unpublished) by Amino have been translated in theEnglish language. As a leading scholar of early modern Japan once told me, <b>everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> Muen, kugai, raku, one of Amino’s most important books, but few have read it. For the most part, one could say the same about much of his work.At least two reasons for this arise from Amino’s work itself. One is that much of it has a highly specialized focus on medieval Japan, and another is the context in which his work is read. Many of his essays and monographs focus like a micro laser on the minutiae of landholding patterns, forms of taxation, local power relations, changes in legal codes, the reading and interpretation of documents, and similar specialized topics, and as a consequence even in Japan only specialists find them compelling reading. And while much of his later work is compelling to {{a large segment of the}} Japanese reading public, it is less so to a general audience outside Japan. This is especially true for his work on issues concerning Japanese ethnic origins, the tennø, rice cultivation and consumption, geography, and other topics... Finally, although much of his work would certainly be of interest to students and scholars of Japanese history outside Japan, the shortage of translations remains an obstacle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> trust these days.

Trust, so the argument goes, {{is one of our}} most precious social virtues and its disappearance or misuse threatens not only our moral order but the very foundations of our polity. The crisis in trust is indicative of the general crisis-society in which we live today (Strathern 2004 a), and it is perhaps the social forms that this crisis-awareness and responsiveness has taken (e. g. audit cultures, evidence-based policy, interdisciplinary research), that has spawned the idea of a concomitant breakdown of solidarity, cooperation and moral responsibility, of which trust appears to be their epiphenomenal expression.

40|$|Abstract. Although the {{electronic}} government is under heavy development, {{a clear vision}} doesn’t seem to exist. In this study 20 interviews among leaders {{in the field of}} e-government in the Netherlands resulted in different perspectives on the future of electronic public service delivery. The interviews revealed different objectives and interpretations of the presuppositions regarding citizens ’ desires. Opinions about channel approaches and ‘trigger services’ appeared to vary. Furthermore, the respondents didn’t agree on the number of contact moments between citizen and government, had different opinions about digital skills, pled for various designs of {{the electronic}} government and placed the responsibility for electronic service delivery in different hands. Conclusion {{is that there is a}} lack of concepts on how to do things. <b>Everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> eGovernment, but all have different interpretations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> {{financial}} innovation, but (almost) nobody empirically tests {{hypotheses about}} it. ” Frame and White (2004) The financial turmoil from 2007 onwards has spurred renewed debates on the “bright” and “dark ” sides of financial innovation. Using bank-, industry- and country-level data for 32, mostly high-income, countries between 1996 and 2006, {{this paper is}} the first to explicitly assess the relationship between financial innovation in the banking sector and (i) real sector growth, (ii) real sector volatility, and (iii) bank fragility. We find evidence for both bright and dark sides of financial innovation. On the one hand, we find that a higher level of financial innovation is associated with a stronger relationship between a country’s growth opportunities and capital and GDP per capita growth and with higher growth rates in industries that rely more on external financing and depend more on innovation. On the other hand, we find that financial innovation is associated with higher growth volatility among industries more dependent on external financing and on innovation and with higher idiosyncratic bank fragility, higher bank profi...|$|E
