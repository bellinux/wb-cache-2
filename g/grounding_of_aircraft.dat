50|$|Private {{operators}} and NSOP (non-scheduled operators permit) holders {{are required by}} DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) {{to set up a}} CAR 145 approved maintenance shop or work with a DGCA approved third-party MRO. Most private {{operators and}} NSOP holders prefer the outsourced model for line maintenance (on-tarmac checks) and use OEM/DGCA approved facilities for engine, heavy maintenance and modifications on their aircraft.The Indian business aviation market is complex from a maintenance perspective as it has over 60 different aircraft types operating in a total market of about 350 aircraft (business jets, turboprops and helicopters). Each individual type requires trained technical manpower, tooling, and approvals from regulator as well as the OEM to enable an MRO to offer world-class maintenance services. Creation of this infrastructure requires a level of investment (both initial and recurring) which most MROs do not find economically viable to support. Therefore, the industry is highly fragmented, with one of the largest player in the market Air Works (with approvals on over 50 different types from DGCA at 15 locations in India and OEM certification from Agusta Westland, Bell, Bombardier, Dassault, Embraer, Garmin, Gulfstream, Hawker Beechcraft, Honeywell and Rockwell Collins) commanding a 30% market share and Indamer Aviation Pvt. Ltd, (with approvals on over 28 different aircraft from DGCA at 14 locations across India)commanding 27% of the market share.A significant percentage of the business aviation fleet in India gets heavy maintenance and modifications done at OEM approved facilities in Europe, UK and the US. This trend though is gradually shifting as established players in India are upgrading their heavy maintenance capability and providing customers with an option to reduce turnaround times as well as costs of aircraft maintenance. A key inflection point for this segment of the industry will be as MRO’s in India upgrade their facilities to global certification such as EASA in addition to OEM certification as that will enable customers to access globally certified quality of maintenance services locally at their operating base.The other key challenge which is faced by the industry is non availability of spare parts in the region which leads to frequent <b>grounding</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> for lack of spares. This is driven by a lack of OEM support for the Indian market (which is gradually changing with growth in the market) and the custom duty regime which discourages MROs from stocking parts on behalf of customers. If an NSOP holder imports parts for his aircraft, it is exempt from duty, whereas, if an MRO were to provide him this facility, the customer will be liable to pay customs duty as well as service tax. On the suggestions and white paper published by Ravi Menon, founding family member of Air Works, custom tariff has been amended to exempt custom duty on the Aircraft spare parts imported by Indian MROs for use on aircraft maintained by them.|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To observe pilots with {{asymptomatic}} {{cerebral infarction}} (ACI) for their short-term prognosis. Methods 　Twenty-two pilots who were diagnosed having ACI by {{magnetic resonance imaging}} were enrolled in this study. When {{they returned to the}} hospital for regular reexamination, the number of ACI foci, the incidents of acute cerebrovascular disease and <b>grounding</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> for any reasons were recorded. According to whether the ACI lesions increased, the patients were divided into two groups. The risk factors for cerebral vascular disease were compared between the two groups. Results 　All the patients were followed for 6 - 42 months (mean 14. 18 ± 8. 55 months), and 6 (18. 18 %) patients were found to have increase of lesions. No neurological deficit was seen in the two groups, although 3 flight crews were grounded for non-ACI reason. Age and flight time showed statistically significant differences between the lesions increased group and no lesion increased group. Conclusions 　The number of ACI foci of some pilots may increase, which is affected by age and flight time. Further investigations on the long-term prognosis and the impacts on flight are needed.

40|$|Damage to the lipskin of {{an engine}} nacelle {{can have a}} {{significant}} impact on engine performance and safety, especially in combination with other sources of inlet flow distortion. While the degradation of performance in aircraft propulsion systems as a result of inlet distortion has been well-studied, the impact of lipskln damage upon inlet distortion levels is not well understood. Current practice can result in the <b>grounding</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in order to perform repairs if the damage exceeds the specified tolerance in size and the position on the lip, with these tolerances varying from aircraft to aircraft. If these tolerances are overly conservative, aircraft operating times may be adversely affected. The effect of lipskin damage upon the performance of the inlet of the CF 34 - 3 A engine has been investigated using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics Package ANSYS CFX in a nacelle model which included the fan. The fan was included in order to capture the interaction between the blades and the upstream distortion. The fan was found to have a stabilising effect upon the flow upstream of the fan, reducing the inlet distortion due to a redistribution of the flow. Other sources of inlet distortion have also been studied, with the effects of high angles of attack and crosswinds having been modelled in isolation, and combined with cases of lipskin damage. A typical take-off configuration was primarily used to assess the effect of the damage due to this being the most critical segment of the flight envelope. The resulting distortion levels have been compared to the engine manufacturers limits in order to assess the severity of the damage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Polymer matrix {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in aircraft structures due to their superior specific stiffness and strength. However, laminated composites are susceptible to delaminations due to the low interlaminar fracture toughness of the matrix. Traditional NDI techniques for damage detection involve significant costs due to the requirement for the <b>grounding</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> shutdown time, and labour involved in inspections. Vibration monitoring for damage assessment in aircraft has several advantages such as being applicable in situ, not requiring external excitation {{and the potential for}} application as a continuous structural health monitoring system. Frequency monitoring is employed in modern aircraft for engine diagnostics and identification of major faults; however, when applied to structural components, monitoring frequency shifts only identifies the presence of damage but not its exact location and severity. Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) has been proposed for application to many structural components but not for assessment of delamination in composites. This thesis proposes the application of ERA coupled with Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) for delamination assessment in laminated composite structures, including stiffened composite panels. NExT provides the advantages that any type of excitation of the structure can be employed and the location of the excitation point need not be known. The algorithm for delamination assessment using ERA coupled with NExT was developed using Matlab code. The proposed method is first investigated and validated using transient vibration response generated by finite element simulation of composite laminates with delaminations. The simulated response is fed into the ERA/NExT algorithm to identify changes in the system parameters to estimate the location and reductions in bending stiffness in the damaged areas. The use of different types of excitation modes and excitations provided at different locations have been examined. Sensitivity analyses have been performed conducted study the influence of spacing of measurement points on the accuracy of delamination size and severity estimated using responses by numerical modelling of composite beams and laminated plates. The proposed method is validated experimentally with vibration measurements conducted on laminated carbon/epoxy beams, plates and stiffened panels with embedded delaminations and estimating the location, size and severity of the delaminations in the samples from the measured dynamic responses...|$|E
