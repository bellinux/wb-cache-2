25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and annihilate. But strings can only <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.|$|E

25|$|The story then {{follows the}} doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” {{as they attempt}} to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The {{breakdown}} of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.|$|E

If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake.

50|$|George Lakoff {{has more}} {{recently}} {{claimed that the}} left-right distinction in politics reflects a different ideals of the family; for the right-wing, the ideal is a patriarchal family based upon absolutist morality; for the left-wing, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family.

25|$|Thompson {{became a}} {{helicopter}} pilot {{for the oil}} industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for Yorkshire Television, managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member Larry Colburn, and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn {{had been trying to}} <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton spent a long weekend with Thompson discussing the events at My Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson's death.|$|E
25|$|For Schumpeter, {{entrepreneurship}} {{resulted in}} new industries {{and in new}} combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was {{the combination of a}} steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation, the car, was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time, incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional microeconomic theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would <b>find</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of x-efficiency.|$|E
50|$|More recently, George Lakoff {{has claimed}} that the left/right {{distinction}} in politics comes from a difference between ideals {{of the family in}} the mind of the person in question; for right-wing people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for left-wing people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family.
