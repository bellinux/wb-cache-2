25|$|Most {{aftershocks}} {{are located}} over the full area of fault rupture and either occur along the <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> itself or along other faults within the volume {{affected by the}} strain associated with the main shock. Typically, aftershocks are found up to a distance equal to the rupture length away from the <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Fault</b> <b>plane</b> {{solutions}} {{also played}} the {{key role in}} the discovery that the deep earthquake zones in some subducting slabs are under compression, others are under tension.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in {{structural}} geology {{are concerned}} with the orientations of planes and lines for a number of reasons. The foliation of a rock is a planar feature that often contains a linear feature called lineation. Similarly, a <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is a planar feature that may contain linear features such as slickensides.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, a large {{earthquake}} (M=6.6) {{occurred in}} the South Iceland Seismic Zone. During this event, small scale earthquakes concentrated narrowly and linearly around the transform <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> Thus, with the same method, small scale earthquakes are also used to identify <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> in the Tjörnes Fracture Zone.|$|R
30|$|We have {{estimated}} the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> of several remarkable inland earthquake sequences, that occurred actively after the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku Earthquake, based on double-difference location of earthquake hypocenters. We have also calculated the Coulomb stress change {{due to the}} 2011 Mw 9 earthquake on these <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> The Coulomb stress change estimated for all the inferred <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> are positive. This suggests that these inland earthquake sequences in the overriding plate of NE Japan just after the 2011 Mw 9 earthquake were triggered by a static stress transfer.|$|R

25|$|An {{aftershock}} is {{an earthquake}} that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. An aftershock {{is in the}} same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. If an aftershock is larger than the main shock, the aftershock is redesignated as the main shock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> adjusts to the effects of the main shock.|$|E
25|$|Gregory Beroza, a seismologist with Stanford University, {{made several}} distinctions {{regarding}} the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10km and below on a <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> that dipped 70° to the southwest. Because {{much of the}} slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1983 Coalinga earthquake, a blind thrust {{event in the}} central coast ranges of California, a change in {{perspective}} was brought about regarding these types of (concealed) faults. The October 1987 shock occurred on a previously unrecognized blind thrust fault that {{is now known as}} the Puente Hills thrust system. The fault was delineated by the mainshock and aftershock focal mechanisms, <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> reflection studies, and high resolution seismic profiles, which also revealed that the fault runs from downtown Los Angeles to near Puente Hills. The system {{is considered one of the}} highest-risk faults in the United States due to its moderate dip and its location under a large metropolitan area.|$|E
30|$|We next {{inverted}} the waveforms for the spatio-temporal slip distributions on {{the finite}} <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> (Kikuchi et al., 2003) with the geometry determined {{from the point}} source analyses. We also performed grid search {{in order to determine}} the depths of the rupture starting points for the finite <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> of both the events by varying the depth at 1 km interval. The dimensions of the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> for both the events were determined based on the aftershock distributions and the scaling of characterized slip models for Japanese plate-boundary earthquakes proposed by Murotani et al. (2008). The fault parameterization and the results of the waveform inversions are discussed below separately for each event.|$|R

25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E
500|$|A <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> {{solution}} for the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes (one is always a <b>fault</b> <b>plane,</b> the other an auxiliary plane) striking north–south and dipping approximately 45 degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion and a horizontal east–west axis of confining stress. At the time of the earthquake, no faults were known in the immediate epicentral region (see below), but the motion corresponded to movement along the Wabash Valley Fault System roughly [...] east of the region. The rupture also partly occurred on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812. The New Madrid tremors were the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E
40|$|Approximate {{images of}} the earth’s {{subsurface}} structures are usually obtained by migrating surface seismic data. Least-squares migration, under the single-scattering assumption, is used as an iterative linearized inversion scheme to suppress migration artifacts, deconvolve the source signature, mitigate the acquisition fingerprint, and enhance the spatial resolution of migrated images. The problem with least-squares migration of primaries, however, {{is that it may}} not be able to enhance events that are mainly illuminated by internal multiples, such as vertical and nearly vertical faults or salt flanks. To alleviate this problem, we adopted a linearized inversion framework to migrate internally scattered energy. We apply the least-squares migration of first-order internal multiples to image subsurface vertical <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> Tests on synthetic data demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to resolve vertical <b>fault</b> <b>planes,</b> which are poorly illuminated by the least-squares migration of primaries only. The proposed scheme is robust in the presence of white Gaussian observational noise and in the case of imaging the <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> using inaccurate migration velocities. Our results suggested that the proposed least-squares imaging, under the double-scattering assumption, still retrieved the vertical <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> when imaging the scattered data despite a slight defocusing of these events due to the presence of noise or velocity errors...|$|R
30|$|The 2007 Chuetsu-oki Earthquake (Mj = 6.8) {{occurred}} in the eastern margin of the Japan Sea where high strain rates have been observed and many large earthquakes have occurred. The main shock was located near the Western Nagaoka Basin active fault system dipping in the westward direction. We estimated the well-resolved hypocenter location around the main shock rupture zone from the differential arrival times obtained by both manual picking and waveform cross-correlation analysis. From the relocated aftershock distributions, we successfully resolved the detailed fault structures activated by the main shock. The estimated fault model resolves four individual fault segments. The fault model suggests that the main shock predominantly ruptured the southeastward dipping <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> On the other hand, the aftershocks around the hypocenter of the main shock occurred on both the northwestward and southeastward dipping <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> Both <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> around the hypocenter of the main shock may have been nearly coincidentally ruptured during the main shock.|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} {{study of}} Witteberg Group Rocks was conducted along the Soutkloof River, approximately 14 km east of Steytlerville, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Here a {{north to south}} geotraverse was studied in an attempt at unravelling the structural geology of the rocks belonging to the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Witteberg Group (Upper Cape Supergroup). These rocks are mostly arenaceous and include quartzite, sandstone, siltstone and shale which have been folded, faulted and metamorphosed. Thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting occur in the area. Shallow south-dipping low-angle thrust <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> are displaced by steep south-dipping thrust planes and subordinate north-dipping backthrusts. Displacement along thrust planes is predominantly northwards. Steeply dipping thrust <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> are often reactivated as east-west striking normal faults. Strike-slip faulting postdates all observed structural features and displaces normal and thrust <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> Open to tight folds are present and are mostly northvergent and often steepened or truncated by steep south-dipping thrust <b>fault</b> <b>planes.</b> South-vergent folds are related to backthrusting and post-fold faulting. The study has revealed that the current geological map and the local stratigraphy were compiled without recognising major structural features such as thrust, normal and strike-slip faulting and their (the map and currently accepted stratigraphy) validity are therefore questioned. The presence of extensive faulting suggests that the conventional stratigraphic interpretation of the Witteberg Group should be revised...|$|R
500|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} {{and most}} of the aftershocks lie between the surface traces of two structures, the Spotsylvania Fault, a southeast dipping zone of high ductile strain, and the Chopawamsic Fault, a thrust fault. The earthquake's focal mechanism shows reverse slip faulting on a north to northeast striking <b>fault</b> <b>plane.</b> The spatial distribution of aftershocks show that the causative fault dips to the southeast at 50–55°. There was no surface faulting associated with the earthquake. The size of the rupture is as yet uncalculated, but similar quakes have been caused by slippage along fault segments that are [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Uplift {{associated}} with the earthquake has been measured using SAR interferometry. The {{results are consistent with}} a fault that did not reach the surface. A simple <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> model with a width of 12.8km dipping to the southeast makes a reasonable match with the observed uplift pattern. [...] However, the best fit to both the results from body wave modelling and SAR interferometry comes from a model with two contiguous fault segments, one to the northeast with a strike of 025°, and the other to the southwest with a strike of 065°, both with an overall southeasterly dip. It has been suggested that this earthquake and the 2005 Qeshm event may have ruptured adjacent parts of the same fault.|$|E
500|$|The mainshock {{occurred}} at [...] on July 21 and caused the most {{damage in the}} sequence of events. The shock measured 6.2 [...] {{as measured by the}} International Seismological Centre and originated at a depth of approximately [...] The focal mechanisms of the three largest events (the July 20 foreshock, the mainshock, and the largest aftershock) were primarily strike-slip with a minor amount of normal-slip and were especially well-constrained due to the dense array of seismometers in the area that were operated by the UNR and the USGS. The primary foreshock's preferred <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> solution indicated left-lateral slip on a fault striking N25°E, but neither the mainshock nor the largest aftershock conformed with their right-lateral slip striking N25°W and N15°W respectively.|$|E
30|$|An {{accurate}} and detailed hypocenter distribution map is important basic seismological information {{for understanding the}} nature of earthquakes, establishing, for example, {{the area of the}} mainshock rupture by estimating the extent of aftershocks in the first day. Therefore, using global phase data reported by the USGS and openly available from their website, we relocated the off the Pacific coast of Tohoku mainshock of March 11, 2011, and its foreshocks and aftershocks. We then identified the preferred <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> of the M ≥ 7 earthquakes in the sequence, from the candidate <b>fault</b> <b>planes</b> provided by the global CMT solutions.|$|R
30|$|Structural {{modelling}} {{defined the}} geometry of the Z- 2 reservoir.

The focal mechanism derived for the earthquake indicates that it was the result of reverse faulting on a <b>fault</b> <b>plane</b> dipping either to the north at 50° or to the south-southeast at 40°. No evidence has been found of surface faulting, but a 3-kilometer-long (2mi) set of bedding-parallel cracks was observed on the northwestern flank of the Ramkan syncline, interpreted as representing probable slip along bedding planes, possibly due to further tightening of this fold. Other NW–SE trending tensional cracks observed further southwest along the syncline {{are more likely to be}} due to salt movement at depth.|$|E

2500|$|An {{aftershock}} is {{a smaller}} earthquake that occurs after a previous large earthquake, {{in the same}} area of the main shock.
