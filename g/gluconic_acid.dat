25|$|Cellulose {{production}} depends {{heavily on}} several {{factors such as}} the growth medium, environmental conditions, and the formation of byproducts. The fermentation medium contains carbon, nitrogen, and other macro and micro nutrients required for bacteria growth. Bacteria are most efficient when supplied with an abundant carbon source and minimal nitrogen source. Glucose and sucrose are the most commonly used carbon sources for cellulose production, while fructose, maltose, xylose, starch, and glycerol have been tried. Sometimes, ethanol may be used to increase cellulose production. The problem with using glucose is that <b>gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> is formed as a byproduct which decreases the pH of the culture and in turn, decreases the production of cellulose. Studies have shown that <b>gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> production can be decreased in the presence of lignosulfonate. Addition of organic acids, specifically acetic acid, also helped in a higher yield of cellulose. Studies of using molasses medium in a jar fermentor as well as added components of sugarcane molasses on certain strains of bacteria have been studied with results showing increases in cellulose production.|$|E

The {{aim was to}} identify the derivatives and the chemical pathway of glucose oxidation. Organic derivatives were monitored by HPLC using an Aminex HPX- 78 H column and UV detection. Chromatographic patterns of leaching solutions showed that major compound formed was formic acid. Minor quantities of glycolic, glycerie and traces of <b>gluconic</b> <b>acids</b> were identified.

All five acids, tested at 20 mM, reduced dramatically the haze potential of proteins, either in wine or dissolved in water, throughout the range of pH values typical of wines (i. e., from 2. 8 through 3. 8).

30|$|The role of LPMOs is {{dependent}} on substrate dynamics and process conditions. Practically, the overall saccharification yield increases when LPMOs are combined with the three common cellulases, especially in the processing of dry matter with relevant remnants of lignin (Cannella and Jørgensen 2014). Jung et al. (2015) investigated LPMO from Gloeophyllum trabeum in concert with cellulases and xylanase. Though no significant individual LPMO activity was observed, the work reported an accelerated synergistic degradation of pretreated kenaf and oak (Jung et al. 2015). Also, Müller et al. (2015) studied the activity of LPMOs with Celluclast® on lignocellulosic biomass of high dry matter concentration and reported an improved product generation. However, their work revealed the need to reconsider process conditions to favor the oxygen and free electron demands of LPMOs (Müller et al. 2015). Nevertheless, Westereng et al. (2015) showed that the lignin component of lignocellulosic substrates provides a reserve of electrons capable of promoting the activity of LPMOs. The effects of divalent cations on LPMO effectiveness was previously stressed by Harris et al. (2010). Also, Cannella et al.

A total of 8 phosphate solubilizing bacterial colonies were isolated on the Pikovskaya’s (PKV) agar medium, containing insoluble tricalcium phosphate (TCP). The colonies showed clear halo zones around the bacterial growth were considered as phosphate solubilizers. Out of 8 bacterial isolates, 3 isolates showed high phosphate solubilization index (PSI) ranged from 4. 88  ±  0. 69 to 4. 48  ±  0. 30, lower pH ranging 3. 08  ±  0. 08 to 3. 82  ±  0. 12 and high phosphate solubilization varied from 305. 49  ±  10  μg/ml to 277. 72  ±  1. 45  μg/ml, were selected for further characterization. Based on the 16  S rRNA gene sequence analysis A 4 isolate and H 6 isolate were closely related to Alcaligenes aquatilis (99 %), and C 1 isolate was closely related to Burkholderia cepacia (99 %). In addition, pot examination also showed the greatest efficiency in promotion of maize growth compared to uninoculated plant. Isolated PSB were able to produce different organic <b>acids</b> (such as <b>gluconic</b> <b>acids,</b> formic acid, and citric acid) in the culture supernatant and may consider as the principle mechanism for phosphate solubilization.

It has been reported to be a complex mixture rather than a single compound. We separated sodium stibogluconate into 12 fractions by anion-exchange chromatography. One fraction accounted for virtually all the leishmanicidal activity of the fractionated material against Leishmania panamensis promastigotes, with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 12 micrograms of Sb per ml; that of unfractionated sodium stibogluconate was 154 micrograms of Sb per ml. Further analysis of this active fraction revealed that a major component was m-chlorocresol, which had been included in the sodium stibogluconate formulation as a preservative. The IC 50 of pure m-chlorocresol was 1. 6 micrograms/ml, a concentration equivalent to that present in unfractionated sodium stibogluconate at a concentration of 160 micrograms of Sb per ml. After ether extraction to remove m-chlorocresol, the IC 50 of sodium stibogluconate was > 4, 000 micrograms of Sb per ml. In contrast, when L. panamensis amastigotes were grown in macrophages, the IC 50 of ether-extracted sodium stibogluconate was 10. 3 micrograms of Sb per ml. The 12 fractions of ether-extracted sodium stibogluconate obtained by anion-exchange chromatography had IC 50 s of 10. 1 to 15. 4 micrograms of Sb per ml. We conclude that preservative-free sodium stibogluconate has little activity against L. panamensis promastigotes but is highly active against L. panamensis amastigotes in macrophages.

For the sustainable management {{of natural resources and}} to reduce environmental pollution, it is important to develop a simple recycling process to recover as much of the valuable metals as possible (Li et al. 2010, 2013; Shu et al. 2004). Organic acids could be an attractive extracting agent. With organic acids, the extraction can be performed at mildly acidic conditions (pH 3 – 5). A study reported the percolation leaching of the Cuban nickel tailings. The authors used tartaric acid and a mixture of tartaric and oxalic acids at different concentrations (Hernandez et al. 2007). Several studies reported the leaching of cobalt (Co) and lithium (Li) from spent lithium-ion batteries using various organic acids and hydrogen peroxide (Li et al. 2010, 2013). Merdoud et al. (2016) and Cameselle and Pena (2016) used organic acids as facilitating agents for electrokinetic decontamination of soils. Biswas and Mulaba-Bafubiandi (2016) used citric, oxalic, and <b>gluconic</b> <b>acids</b> for the leaching of copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) from oxidized ore. They achieved maximum recovery of Cu and Co at 80  °C using 150  mM of citric acid. Their findings also suggest that the recovery of Cu and Co from the oxidized ore was highly dependent on the amenability of the ore mineral to organic acid attack. Suanon et al. (2016) used organic acid to improve the removal of metals from the soil because of its ready availability, relatively inexpensiveness, and environmentally benign nature. Also, the organic acids are biologically degradable (Veeken and Hamelers 1999). Considering these advantages of organic acids for metal leaching, the acetic acid was introduced as a leaching reagent in the present study. Acetic acid is commonly known as moderate and weak chelating agents (low molecular weight organic acid). It has been extensively used in the food industry, the medical field, and the manufacturing industry, among others. The present study was carried out to determine the effectiveness of acetic acid for recovery of metals from solders, and also, to determine various factors influencing metal dissolution from solder. Further, the results were compared with the biologically produced acetic acid using Acetobacter sp.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} of bioleaching are set upon {{at least two}} facts: (1) the majority of leaching microbes grow attached on mineral surfaces (Schippers et al. 2013). This attachment is mediated by the extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that surround the cells. The EPSs can be sugars, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and the combinations of these. Attachment and/or surface contact can stimulate EPS production by up to 100 -fold (Noël et al. 2010; Vandevivere and Kirchman 1993); and (2) once cells are attached to minerals, they secrete organic acids, amino acids, peptides, lipids, enzyme complexes or even cyanide ions (Willscher and Bosecker 2003). Organic acids are recognized {{as the most important}} leaching agents in bioleaching processes using fungi and bacteria (Yang et al. 2008). The most observed acids are citric, oxalic, tartaric and <b>gluconic.</b> Organic <b>acids</b> promote mineral dissolution by: (1) donating H+ to proton-promoted dissolution processes; (2) forming inner-sphere surface complexes that dislodge structural metals from the mineral surface; and (3) the formation of aqueous metal–ligand complexes that reduce the relative solution saturation with respect to minerals undergoing dissolution (Goyne et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|Three {{effective}} {{solutions to}} dissolve the filter cake created by water-based drilling fluids weighted with Mn 3 O 4 particles were developed. Hydrochloric acid at concentration lower than 5 wt% can dissolve most of Mn 3 O 4 -based filter cake. Dissolving the filter cake in two-stage treatment of enzyme and organic acid was effective and eliminated the associated drawbacks of using HCl. Finally, combining low and safe concentration of HCl with an organic acid in one-stage treatment was very effective. Hydrochloric acid (10 -wt%) dissolved 78 wt% of Mn 3 O 4 -based filter cake at 250 ?F after 28 hours soaking time. However, Chlorine gas was detected during the reaction of 5 to 15 -wt% HCl with Mn 3 O 4 particles. At 190 ?F, 1 - and 4 -wt% HCl dissolved most Mn 3 O 4 particles (up to 70 -wt% solubility). Their reactions with Mn 3 O 4 particles followed Eq. 8 at 190 ?F, which further confirmed the absence of chlorine gas production at HCl concentrations lower than 5 -wt%. EDTA and DTPA at high pH (12) and acetic, propionic, butyric, and <b>gluconic</b> <b>acids</b> at low pH (3 - 5) showed very low solubilities of Mn 3 O 4 particles. GLDA, citric, oxalic, and tartaric acids produced large amount of white precipitation upon the reactions with Mn 3 O 4 particles. Similarly, DTPA will produce damaging material if used to dissolve Mn 3 O 4 -based filter cake in sandstone formation. At 4 -wt% acid concentration, lactic, glycolic, and formic acids dissolved Mn 3 O 4 particles up to 76 wt% solubility at 190 ?F. Malonic acid at lower concentration (2 -wt%) dissolved 54 wt% of Mn 3 O 4 particles at 190 ?F. Manganese tetraoxide particles were covered with polymeric material (starch), which significantly reduced the solubility of filter cake in organic acids. Therefore, {{there was a need}} to remove Mn 3 O 4 -based filter cake in two-stage treatment. Enzyme-A (10 -wt%) and Precursor of lactic acid (12. 5 -wt%) dissolved 84 wt% of the filter cake.
