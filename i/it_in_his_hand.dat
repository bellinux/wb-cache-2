The next time Jones saw the magic cane, an hour later, Garrison had <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "I like this cane," [...] Jones remembers the general exclaiming, a big grin on his face.

2500|$|Around 1892, Renoir {{developed}} rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, {{he moved}} to the warmer climate of [...] "Les Collettes," [...] a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.|$|E

2500|$|In Wales, {{the game}} of cnapan was {{described}} at length by George Owen of Henllys, an eccentric historian of Pembrokeshire, in 1603:"This game... {{is thought to be}} of great antiquity and is as followeth.

About {{one or two of the}} clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and feet....The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a reasonable quantity so as a man may hold <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and no more, this ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling bolt upright into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more..." ...|$|E

60|$|As he took <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{there was}} a loud {{knocking}} at the door.|$|E
60|$|He reached out, and, to the girl's surprise, {{took up a}} bowl {{from the}} table, and {{appeared}} to weigh <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>It</b> {{was made of the}} indurated fibre which is frequently to be met with in the Bush ranches.|$|R

6000|$|One evening a slave {{brought in}} a small roll of vellum to Cneius. It had been given him at the door, he said, by a Briton, who had at once left after placing <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> The scribe opened it and read as follows:-- ...|$|R

60|$|He {{rose from}} the bed, yawned, and taking <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> held it to the light. I watched him curiously.|$|E
50|$|To Mi Fu {{the brush}} {{was not only}} the sword of his proud spirit but a magic stick, which brought life {{whenever}} he held <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> were <b>it</b> <b>in</b> writing or in painting. The two arts were to him essentially one and the same.|$|R

60|$|He {{went over}} to <b>it,</b> held <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.|$|R
60|$|Near {{the center}} of the room was a raised {{platform}} of mother-of-pearl upon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls. Here reclined Queen Aquareine, a being so lovely that Trot gazed upon her spellbound and Cap'n Bill took off his sailor cap and held <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R

60|$|Francis {{followed}} the other's movements with fascinated eyes. The woman scarcely turned her head.

6000|$|... "Well, if heaven-born archers {{come down}} on one, there's nothing for it but submitting.
