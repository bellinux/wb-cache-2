5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive {{remuneration}} for work done as a trustee.

5|$|During Western Han, the Chancellor was {{the chief}} civil official. The duties of the {{chancellery}} were divided between a Right Chancellor (右丞相) and Left Chancellor (左丞相) between 196 and 180 BC. After 180 BC, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority. The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, maps of the empire's territories, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the government budget. The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-dan or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The Chancellor was held responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.|$|E
5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analysis}} has indicated Overton {{may have been}} treated unfairly for these actions, becoming a scapegoat <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> many other pilots in the war. No new policies had been released warning about crossing the Chinese border, and no pilots before Overton had been punished for doing so. Overton himself expressed frustration at the move, {{as he had been}} the rearmost pilot in the formation that crossed the Yalu River on 24 January, and Mitchell himself had been known to cross the border and condoned the action. Fellow ace and unit member Francis Gabreski challenged the move, claiming that US pilots were outnumbered and {{it was the only way}} to maintain air superiority. It was later revealed that Swiss observers to the peace talks at Panmunjon were traveling through Manchuria on foot when they spotted a UN-Soviet dogfight and lodged a complaint, prompting an investigation which eventually indicted Overton.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established {{that they could be}} liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|UEFA rebranded and {{restructured}} the UEFA Cup in 2009, {{resulting in}} it becoming the UEFA Europa League. By finishing {{fifth in the}} 2009–10 Premier League, Manchester City qualified for this competition. A play-off round took place before the four team group stage, in which Manchester City beat Timișoara of Romania home and away. City's group stage opponents were Juventus, Red Bull Salzburg and Lech Poznań. Each team played the others twice. City's opener was in Salzburg, and resulted in a 2–0 win. A 1–1 draw at home to Juventus then followed. A 3–1 win at home to Lech Poznań is remembered primarily not for the action on the pitch, in which Emmanuel Adebayor scored a hat-trick, but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the Polish supporters, whose backs to the pitch dance was later adopted by Manchester City fans, for whom it became known as The Poznań. The return match with Lech Poznań resulted in a 3–1 defeat, but a 3–0 home victory over Red Bull Salzburg ensured qualification with a match to spare. The dead rubber against Juventus ended 1–1, and Manchester City won the group. In the knockout stages City then beat Aris Thessaloniki 3–0 on aggregate, and met Dynamo Kyiv in the last 16. City lost 2–0 in Kyiv, and had to play most of the second leg with ten men after Mario Balotelli was sent off. A 1–0 win was insufficient to overcome the deficit, as City lost 2–1 on aggregate.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{population}} balance based kinetic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> exoglucanase has been developed.

Having developed <b>the</b> model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> endoglucanase in part I of this work, here a mechanistic model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> exoglucanase and then a holistic model considering all the major steps involved in enzymatic hydrolysis has been proposed. Having established and validated <b>the</b> models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> endo- and exoglucanase, a universal model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cellulose hydrolysis at the surface and inside the particle have been developed. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> unknown parameters in the universal models, an experimental procedure to find the parameters in the holistic model has been proposed. It is believed that the universal kinetic model can be applied to almost any cellulose-cellulase system and once parameters for different systems are available, due to characteristic nature of the model, {{it would be possible to}} optimise the system under different conditions. © 2011...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{result of}} the paper is that the equivariant {{intersection}} cohomology of the semi-stable points on a complex projective variety, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> a complex reductive group, may be determined from the equivariant intersection cohomology of <b>the</b> semi-stable points <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> a maximal torus. It extends the work of Brion who considered the smooth case using equivariant cohomology. Equivariant intersection cohomology is a theory due to Brylinski and the second author. As an application, a surprising relation between the intersection cohomology of Chow hypersurfaces is established in the last section of the paper. In this paper we show that the equivariant intersection cohomology of the semi-stable points on a complex projective variety <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> a complex reductive group may be determined from the equivariant intersection cohomology of <b>the</b> semi-stable points <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> a maximal torus.

The equivariant intersection cohomology we employ is due to Brylinski and the second author (see [Bryl- 2] or [J- 1]).
