5|$|A virtual {{representation}} of Roxas {{appears as a}} boss character in the mobile phone game Kingdom Hearts Coded, in which he confronts a {{virtual representation}} of Sora; he later appears in the ending {{as one of the}} people connected to Sora's heart who may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> returning one day. He makes a cameo appearance at the end of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, where he is shown with Xion and Axel eating sea-salt ice cream in Twilight Town, as well as in , where Roxas contacts both Axel and Sora through dreams. He also appears in Shiro Amano's manga and Tomoko Kanemaki's novels, where he reprises his role from the video games. The book Kingdom Hearts: Another Report includes a novel called Roxas–Somewhere in Time that retells Roxas' days in the Organization with the exception of his befriending Xion.|$|E
5|$|Family Guy {{had been}} {{canceled}} in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on Adult Swim became the cable network's most watched program, {{and more than}} three million DVDs of the show were sold. Much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie North by Northwest; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29shows that were canceled by Fox after Family Guy was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> returning.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 20-yard line needing to score quickly {{in order to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> making up the 10-point deficit, which would require two {{separate}} scores to make good. Mike Cox completed a seven-yard pass, then Maurice Williams broke free for a 15-yard rush that gave Tech a first down and drove the Hokies to the 42-yard line. Cox completed a long pass into the Air Force red zone, but the completion was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against Tech that cost the Hokies the long completion, a loss of down, and an additional 15yards. While scrambling for extra time in which to throw the ball, Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Chris Funk and fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the loose football, and the Falcons' offense returned to the field with just over four minutes left to play.|$|E

5|$|Including Bradley, the Capitals lost {{six players}} {{who played for}} them in the playoffs, as well as back-up goaltender Semyon Varlamov. To replace some of the {{departed}} players, Washington traded its 2011 first round draft pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for veteran winger Troy Brouwer, {{who was a member of}} the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup championship team in 2010. They then signed Joel Ward as a free agent, adding grit and the hopes that he could duplicate his 2011 playoff success. Ward scored seven goals and 13 points in 12 playoff games with the Nashville Predators, after scoring 10 goals and 29 points in 80 regular season games. In net, they added veteran Tomas Vokoun, who was considered to be one of the top goaltenders in the 2011 free agent class. He signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract, well below his believed market value, to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> winning the Stanley Cup. After making these and other off-season moves, the Capitals were over the NHL salary cap. The expectation was that defenseman Tom Poti would not be able to play due to injury and Washington would be forced to place him on long-term injured reserve, where his $2.9 million salary would not count against the cap total. Unexpectedly, Poti told the Capitals that he would be ready to play by training camp. Poti, however, failed his medical exam prior to training camp and was placed on long-term injured reserve.|$|E

25|$|With {{yet another}} new head coach (Jimmy Gardner), the Hamilton Tigers roared {{off to an}} {{impressive}} 10–4–1 start in the 1924–25 NHL season. Only halfway through the season, they had more wins than any other season in their NHL history. The team slumped somewhat {{in the second half}} of the season but still managed to finish first overall with a record of 19 wins, 10 losses, and 1 tie, just ahead of the Toronto St. Patricks. It looked like the franchise would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since winning it as the Bulldogs over a decade prior in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish are {{indeterminate}} growers, so smaller cuttlefish always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> {{finding a}} mate the next year, {{when they are}} bigger. Additionally, cuttlefish unable to win in a direct confrontation with a guard male have been observed employing several other tactics to acquire a mate. The most successful of these methods is camouflage; smaller cuttlefish will use their camouflage abilities to disguise themselves as a female cuttlefish. Changing their body color, concealing their extra arms (males have four pairs, females only have three), and even pretending to be holding an egg sack, disguised males are able to swim past the larger guard male and mate with the female.|$|E

25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century new {{innovations}} in the art of classical dance began to become apparent. With all of this, Petipa's rocky relationship with the new director of the Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovsky, appointed to the position in 1901, served as a catalyst to the Ballet Master's end. Telyakovsky made no effort in disguising his dislike of Petipa's work, as he felt that the art of classical ballet had become stagnant under him, and felt that other choreographers should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> the helm of the Imperial Ballet. But even at the age of eighty-three, and suffering from the constant pain brought on by a severe case of the skin disease pemphigus, the old Maestro showed no signs of slowing down, much to Telyakovsky's chagrin.|$|E
25|$|Knott, the {{incumbent}} keeper for England, turned to World Series Cricket in 1977 on {{the encouragement of}} Tony Greig and was thus banned from Test cricket. Taylor was the next in line {{to take up the}} gloves, and returned to Test cricket on 14 December 1977 against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Although there had been three first-class warm-up fixtures, Taylor had not impressed with the bat and had been rotated out of the second game in order for Paul Downton to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> the gloves. Taylor nevertheless got the nod for the first Test. Captained by fellow Wisden Cricketers of the Year Brearley, he took two catches and a stumping, and score a lengthy 32 from 158 deliveries supporting Geoff Miller who was eventually stranded on 98. He played in the following two Tests of the series, and though keeping tidily he was dismissed for a first ball duck – a score of zero – in the second Test, though improved with a slow (and then career best) 36 from 200 balls and 18 not out in the third match. He also played in the 2nd and 3rd One Day International fixtures. He remained {{the incumbent}} gloveman for the New Zealand leg of the tour, appearing in two warm up games and three Tests. He took four catches in the first, all from the bowling of Chris Old, and scored a career-best 45 in the second. His 236 runs across the entire tour came at 21.45, and he took 20 catches and a stumping.|$|E
25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} {{season with a}} blitz from AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli against SRH at Bengaluru, to comfortably win their first match. A bludgeoning century from Quinton de Kock meant RCB lost their second match of the season. Their form {{deteriorated}} in the coming matches, winning only one match of the next five. Although, Virat Kohli and AB de Villier's brilliant form, along {{with the emergence of}} KL Rahul as an important member of RCB's batting, were positive points. Royal Challengers needed to win at least 6 of their next seven matches to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> qualifying for the playoffs. They won matches against KXIP and Rising Pune Supergiant, the new entrant in the tournament. But a loss against Mumbai Indians meant they needed 4 wins in 4 matches to qualify. Since then, Virat Kohli found himself in sublime form, with captaincy and the bat. RCB most notably defeated the Gujarat Lions by 144 runs, the highest margin in IPL history, during this 4 match winning streak. Through other match results, RCB ended at an unlikely second position {{at the end of the}} league stage. Virat Kohli dominated the run-scoring list, while Shane Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal collectively topped the wicket taking list at the end of the league stage. They faced the Gujarat Lions in the Qualifier 1 at their home ground, the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. They won by 4 wickets to make it to their third final in nine seasons. They played the final against SRH, again in Bengaluru. RCB lost a hard fought match by 8 runs, to end as runners up in this ninth season of the IPL. This is the third instance of RCB losing the finals in the IPL.|$|E
