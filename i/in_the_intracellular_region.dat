40|$|ABSTRACT: The neurotensin {{receptor}} NTSR 1 binds the peptide agonist neurotensin (NTS) and signals preferentially via the Gq protein. Recently, Grisshammer {{and co-workers}} reported the crystal {{structure of a}} thermostable mutant NTSR 1 -GW 5 with NTS bound. Understanding how the mutations thermostabilize the structure would allow efficient design of thermostable mutant GPCRs for protein purification, and subsequent biophysical studies. Using microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations (4 μs) of the thermostable mutant NTSR 1 -GW 5 and wild type NTSR 1, we have elucidated the structural and energetic factors that affect the thermostability and dynamics of NTSR 1. The thermostable mutant NTSR 1 -GW 5 {{is found to be}} less flexible and less dynamic than the wild type NTSR 1.

Many ions have a concentration gradient across the membrane, including potassium (K+), which is at a high concentration inside and a low concentration outside the membrane. Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions are at high concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extracellular region, and low concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>regions.</b> These concentration gradients provide the potential energy to drive the formation of the membrane potential. This voltage is established when the membrane has permeability to one or more ions.In the simplest case, illustrated here, if the membrane is selectively permeable to potassium, these positively charged ions can diffuse down the concentration gradient to the outside of the cell, leaving behind uncompensated negative charges. This separation of charges is what causes the membrane potential. Note that the system as a whole is electro-neutral. The uncompensated positive charges outside the cell, and the uncompensated negative charges inside the cell, physically line up on the membrane surface and attract each other across the lipid bilayer. Thus, the membrane potential is physically located only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate vicinity of the membrane. It is the separation of these charges across the membrane that is the basis of the membrane voltage.Note also that this diagram is only an approximation of the ionic contributions to the membrane potential. Other ions including sodium, chloride, calcium, and others play a more minor role, even though they have strong concentration gradients, because they have more limited permeability than potassium.Key: [...] pentagons - sodium ions; [...] squares - potassium ions; [...] circles - chloride ions; [...] rectangles - membrane-impermeable anions (these arise {{from a variety of sources}} including proteins).

Therefore, the efficacy of LFchimera merits further development of this agent for the therapy of melioidosi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSrc {{homology}} 2 (SH 2) domain-containing protein tyrosine {{phosphatase substrate}} 1 (SHPS- 1) {{is a member}} of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. The amino-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of SHPS- 1 is necessary for interaction with CD 47, a ligand for SHPS- 1, which plays an important role <b>in</b> cell–cell interaction. <b>The</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> of SHPS- 1, on the other hand, may act as a scaffold protein, binding to various adapter proteins. Interestingly, increasing evidence has shown that SHPS- 1 is involved in various biological phenomena, including suppression of anchorage-independent cell growth, negative regulation of immune cells, self-recognition of red blood cells, mediation of macrophage multinucleation, skeletal muscle differentiation, entrainment of circadian clock, neuronal survival and synaptogenesis. Recent progress has been made in attributing these novel exciting functions. Here we discuss how this interesting molecule works and consider its true role in biology...|$|R
40|$|The LAG- 2 {{membrane}} protein is a putative signaling ligand for the LIN- 12 and GLP- 1 receptors of Caenorhabditis elegans. LAG- 2, like its Drosophila homologues Delta and Serrate, acts in a conserved signal transduction pathway to regulate cell fates during development. In this article, we investigate the functional domains of LAG- 2. For the most part, mutants were constructed in vitro and assayed for activity in transgenic animals. We find a functional role for all major regions except one. Within the extracellular domain, the N-terminal region, which bears no known motif, and the DSL domain are both required. By contrast, the region bearing epidermal growth factor-like repeats can be deleted {{with no apparent}} reduction <b>in</b> rescuing activity. <b>The</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> is not required for activity but instead {{plays a role in}} down-regulating LAG- 2 function. Finally, membrane association is critical for mutant rescue...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{familial}} and congenital polycythaemia (PFCP) is {{a disease}} characterized by increased red blood cell mass, and {{can be associated with}} mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR). Here we explore the mechanisms by which EPOR mutations induce PFCP, using an experimental system based on chimeric receptors between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EPOR. The design of the chimeras enabled EPOR signalling to be triggered by EGF binding. Using this system we analysed three novel EPOR mutations discovered in PFCP patients: a deletion mutation (Del 1377 - 1411), a nonsense mutation (C 1370 A) and a missense mutation (G 1445 A). Three different chimeras, bearing these mutations in the cytosolic, EPOR region were generated; Hence, the differences in the chimera-related effects are specifically attributed to the mutations. The results show that the different mutations affect various aspects related to the signalling and metabolism of the chimeric receptors. These include slower degradation rate, higher levels of glycan-mature chimeric receptors, increased sensitivity to low levels of EGF (replacing EPO in this system) and extended signalling cascades. This study provides a novel experimental system to study polycythaemia-inducing mutations in the EPOR, and sheds new light on underlying mechanisms of EPOR over-activation in PFCP patients...|$|E
40|$|Dysregulation of {{apoptosis}} {{through the}} Fas–Fas ligand pathway {{is associated with}} the onset of autoimmune disease. Since autoantibodies directed against unknown antigens are present in the sera of these patients, sera samples were examined for the presence of autoantibodies directed against the Fas molecule. Using Western blotting and a ProteinChip analysis, autoantibodies against Fas were detected in patients with silicosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), and weakly detected in healthy individuals. Using epitope mapping employing 12 -amino-acid polypeptides with the SPOTs system, a minimum of four epitopes and a maximum of 10 epitopes were found. Several amino acid residues involved in binding FasL, such as C 66, R 87, L 90, E 93 and H 126, were presented within the epitopes. Serum containing a large amount of anti-Fas autoantibody from silicosis patients inhibited the growth of a Fas-expressing human cell line, but did not inhibit the growth of a low Fas-expresser nor a Fas-expresser in which the Fas gene had been silenced by small interference RNA. All epitopes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> of Fas were located in the death domain. The possible roles of anti-Fas autoantibody detected in healthy volunteers and patients with silicosis or autoimmune diseases are discussed here...|$|E
40|$|Limb girdle muscular {{dystrophy}} 2 C {{is caused by}} mutations in the γ-sarcoglycan gene (gsg) that results in loss of this protein, and disruption of the sarcoglycan (SG) complex. Signal transduction after mechanical perturbation is mediated, in part, through the SG complex and leads to phosphorylation of tyrosines on the intracellular portions of the sarcoglycans. This study tested if the Tyr 6 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> of γ-sarcoglycan protein (γ-SG) was necessary for proper localization of the protein in skeletal muscle membranes or for the normal pattern of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation after eccentric contractions. Viral mediated gene transfer of wild type gsg (WTgsg) and mutant gsg lacking Tyr 6 (Y 6 Agsg) was performed into the muscles of gsg−/− mice. Muscles were examined for production and stability of the γ-SG, {{as well as the}} level of ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation before and after eccentric contraction. Sarcolemmal localization of γ-SG was achieved regardless of which construct was expressed. However, only expression of WTgsg corrected the aberrant ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation associated with the absence of γ-SG, whereas Y 6 Agsg failed to have any effect. This study shows that localization of γ-SG does not require Tyr 6, but localization alone is insufficient for restoration of normal signal transduction patterns after mechanical perturbation...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of studies examining activity-induced conformational changes in G protein-coupled receptors {{have focused on}} transmembrane helices or <b>intracellular</b> <b>regions.</b> Relatively {{few studies have examined}} the involvement of <b>the</b> extracellular region <b>in</b> general and <b>the</b> N-terminal region <b>in</b> particular in this process. To begin to address this, we generated a series of antibodies to the N-terminal region of opioid receptors. Characterization of these antibodies revealed that they differentially recognize activated receptors. Recently, we generated monoclonal antibodies that recognize regions proximal to glycosylation sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> receptor N terminus. Characterization of these antibodies revealed that agonist treatment leads to a decrease in epitope recognition by the antibody presumably because of a movement of the region of the N terminus proximal to glycosylation sites. The time course of <b>the</b> decrease <b>in</b> antibody recognition suggested that it could be due to a post-activation-mediated event. Examination of the involvement of receptor residues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> C-tail and β-arrestin binding using site-directed mutagenesis and cells or tissues lacking β-arrestin 2 suggests a role for these desensitization-related mechanisms in governing antibody binding to the receptor. Thus, these N-terminally directed antibodies can differentially recognize post-activation-mediated changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal (<b>intracellular)</b> <b>region</b> of <b>the</b> receptor. Therefore, these conformation-sensitive antibodies represent powerful reagents to probe receptor activation states and provide a potential tool for identifying and characterizing new compounds of therapeutic interest...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial homologues of {{mammalian}} potassium channels provide {{structures of}} two states of a gated K channel. Thus, the crystal structure of KcsA represents a closed state whilst that of MthK represents an open state. Using homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations {{we have built}} {{a model of the}} transmembrane domain of KcsA in an open state and have compared its conformational stability with that of the same domain of KcsA in a closed state. Approximate Born energy calculations of monovalent cations within the two KcsA channel states suggest that <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> hydrophobic gate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closed state provides a barrier of height approximately 5 kT to ion permeation, whilst <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open state the barrier is absent. Simulations (10 ns duration) in an octane slab (a simple membrane mimetic) suggest that closed- and open-state models are of comparable conformational stability, both exhibiting conformational drifts of approximately 3. 3 A Calpha RMSD relative to the respective starting models. Substantial conformational fluctuations are observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> gate <b>region</b> during both simulations (closed state and open state). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> simulation of open-state KcsA, rapid (< 5 ns) exit of all three K+ ions occurs through <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> mouth of <b>the</b> channel. Helix kink and swivel motion is observed at the molecular hinge formed by residue G 99 of the M 2 helix. This motion is more substantial for the open- than for the closed-state model of the channel...|$|R
40|$|Clearance of {{apoptotic}} cells by engulfment {{plays an}} important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homeostasis and development of multicellular organisms. Despite the fact that the recognition of apoptotic cells by engulfment receptors is critical <b>in</b> inducing <b>the</b> engulfment process, the molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, we characterize a novel cell corpse engulfment pathway mediated by the integrin a subunit PAT- 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans and show that it specifically functions in muscle-mediated engulfment during embryogenesis. Inactivation of pat- 2 results in a defect in apoptotic cell internalization. The PAT- 2 extracellular region binds to the surface of apoptotic cells <b>in</b> vivo, and <b>the</b> <b>intracellular</b> <b>region</b> may mediate signaling for engulfment. We identify essential roles of small GTPase CDC- 42 and its activator UIG- 1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, in PAT- 2 –mediated cell corpse removal. PAT- 2 and CDC- 42 both function in muscle cells for apoptotic cell removal and are co-localized in growing muscle pseudopods around apoptotic cells. Our data suggest that PAT- 2 functions through UIG- 1 for CDC- 42 activation, which in turn leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement and apoptotic cel...|$|R
