60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> He {{bent forward}} again. 'But if I were poor?' he put in, eagerly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> with {{a little}} gesture of disgust. Louis was summoned elsewhere, a fact for which I was duly grateful.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a terrible}} blow. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> appealingly. 'Harold,' I cried in despair, 'do you think we could manage to hide {{ourselves}} safely anywhere in Scotland for twenty-one days?' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> Sayd <b>I</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Away!</b> is {{a single}} CD by the Italian singer-songwriter Perseo Miranda.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{presence}} of mind enough to conceal my surprise at this unexpected utterance. 'Don't seem to notice her, Elsie,' <b>I</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>away.</b> 'Yes, we are English.' ...|$|R
60|$|Still I {{could neither}} speak nor move. <b>I</b> could only <b>look</b> <b>away</b> {{from him in}} horror, and fix {{my eyes on the}} ground.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed me, {{not having}} energy to question; his {{strength}} had gone, and his splendid physique seemed shrunken; he walked weakly. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from him, for in his feebleness {{he was already}} beginning to feel ludicrous.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said I, [...] "she {{will do it}} now," [...] {{and with}} the {{instinct}} of a gentleman <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> Thus I cannot tell what happened, but presently David exclaimed admiringly, [...] "Oh, mother, do it again!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have another}} {{confession}} {{to make that}} will appear singular. When she said these words, something rose in my throat; and the stars <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> at, seemed to break into sparkles that fell down my face and burnt it.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{tried to}} <b>look</b> <b>away</b> {{from him and}} leave the room. Strange as it seems, I hardly think I should have succeeded in the attempt if Madame Fosco had not helped me by causing him to move and <b>look</b> <b>away</b> first.|$|R
60|$|I {{had kept}} my {{scrutiny}} under control, prepared for any sudden {{movement on the}} part of the girl; but after all she was too quick for me. She turned from the window with a perfectly natural movement, and yet so swiftly that our eyes met before <b>I</b> could <b>look</b> <b>away.</b> She leaned a little forward in her place, and her forehead darkened.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> must <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from him, for my faded eyes Like a cringing dog at {{his heels}} offend him now, Like a toothless hound {{pursuing}} him with my will, Till he chafes at my crouching persistence, and a [...] sharp spark flies In my soul from under the sudden frown of his brow, As he blenches and turns away, and my heart stands [...] still.|$|R
6000|$|But her [...] "orphan" [...] {{had brought}} me back with a guilty shock to what, no doubt, was an {{extremely}} fantastic panorama of Buenos Ayres; and that swiftly back again to Mr Crimble. For an instant or two <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> Perhaps it was my caution that betrayed me.|$|E
6000|$|Ray {{opened the}} {{carriage}} door and gripped Blenavon's arm. [...] "Get in," [...] {{he said in}} a low, suppressed tone. There was something almost animal in the fury of Ray's voice. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> with a shudder. Blenavon stepped quietly into the carriage. Then Ray came over to me, and as he looked searchingly into my face, he pointed up the carriage drive.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked across}} at the man, {{who seemed to}} be {{reproaching}} the girl for her long absence. Almost at that moment he looked up and our eyes met for a brief instant. There seemed to be nothing in his gaze beyond a measure of polite and not too pointed interest. Nevertheless, when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> I begged Mr. Bundercombe to call for the bill.|$|E
60|$|Eve for {{a moment}} sat quite still; she, too, seemed nervous. <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> again at the {{retreating}} figures of Mr. Parker and Mr. Moss. Suddenly my heart sank. I saw the old gentleman spring {{to his feet and}} hurry after them; and I saw, too, {{at the end of the}} line of stalls, Mr. Cullen and a companion standing, waiting. I rose quickly to my feet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{had been}} <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from {{her all the}} time I was talking, gazing determinedly down a sunlit vista of pines. Every word I said seemed to tear my heart, and come from my lips stained with life-blood. Yes, Betty should marry Frank! But, good God, what would become of me! ...|$|R
60|$|The lady {{rested her}} arms upon the table, and again her eyes disdained my words and went {{traveling}} {{by their own}} route direct to my soul. She laughed softly, with a strange quality in the sound--it was a laugh of happiness--yes, and of content--and of misery. <b>I</b> tried to <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from her.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that Louis himself, at any rate, {{believed}} what he was saying. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from the young lady a little reluctantly. As though she understood Louis' warning, her lips parted {{for a moment in}} a faint, contemptuous smile. She leaned over and touched the man Bartot on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear. When I next looked in their direction I found his eyes fixed upon mine in a steady, malignant stare.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Dennisford sat quite {{still for}} several seconds. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon me; but I am quite certain that I had passed from within the orbit of her vision. The things which she saw were of another world--somehow it seemed sacrilege on my part to dream of peering even into the dimmest corner of it. So <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> and I could never tell {{altogether}} what effect my words had had upon her. For when I looked up, she was gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't that," [...] he protested. [...] "It {{was simply}} when I {{sat down in}} that little room, high up over the roofs and {{buildings}} of a strange city, shut myself in and told myself that it was for you--well, the thoughts came too easily. They tumbled over one another. And when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from my work, I saw the people moving around me, and I knew that I had made my dreams real, and that's the great thing, isn't it?... Elizabeth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The little morocco-covered {{notebook}} {{in which}} I set {{down some of}} my impressions is before me as I write. It still vibrates with the ecstasy of that enthusiasm. Sentences like these are frequent. [...] "From the dry hot plains, across the blazing purple of the mesa's edge, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> to where the white clouds soar in majesty above the serrate crest of Uncomphagre. Oh, the splendor and mystery of those cloud-hid regions!... A coyote, brown and dry and hot as any tuft of desert grass drifts by.... Into the coolness and sweetness and cloud-glory of this marvelous land.... Gorgeous shadows are in motion on White House Peak.... Along the trail as though walking a taut wire, a caravan of burros streams, driven by a wide-hatted graceful horseman.... Twelve thousand feet! I am brother to the eagles now! The matchless streams, the vivid orange-colored meadows. The deep surf-like roar of the firs, the wailing sigh of {{the wind in the}} grass--a passionate longing wind." [...] Such are my jottings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] she said, [...] "that {{that man}} must have one. I am safe while I am there, for I have had bolts fitted everywhere, and a {{pane of glass}} in the front door. But I am always afraid that he may get in while <b>I</b> am <b>away.</b> <b>Look!</b> <b>Is</b> that some one coming out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cover up your magical picture, then," [...] replied her friend, [...] "else <b>I</b> {{never can}} <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from it. It is strange, dear Hilda, how an innocent, delicate, white soul like yours {{has been able}} to seize the subtle mystery of this portrait; as you surely must, in order to {{reproduce}} it so perfectly. Well; we will not talk of it any more. Do you know, I have come to you this morning on a small matter of business. Will you undertake it for me?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a monstrous}} big river here, with the tallest and the {{thickest}} kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, {{as well as}} I could see by the stars. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> down-stream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing {{but a couple of}} sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.|$|E
60|$|I {{bent forward}} {{and looked into}} her face. There was in her {{wonderful}} eyes a glint of laughter which became her well. She walked with slow graceful ease, her hands behind her, her head almost on a level with my own. I found myself studying her with a new pleasure. Then our eyes met, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> momentarily confused. Was it my fancy, or was there a certain measure of rebuke in her cool surprise, a faint indication of her desire that I should remember {{that she was the}} Lady Angela Harberly, and I her father's secretary? I bit my lip. She should not catch me offending again, I determined.|$|E
6000|$|He {{began to}} explain the machine with the manner and tone of a {{lecturer}} at a scientific institution. In spite of themselves, the officers burst out laughing. I looked round at Screw as the doctor got deeper into his explanations. The traitor was rolling his wicked eyes horribly at me. They presented so shocking a sight, that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> again. What was I to do next? The minutes were getting on, and I had not heard a word yet, through the peephole, {{on the subject of}} the reserve of Bow Street runners outside. Would it not be best to risk everything, and get away at once by the back of the house? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked,</b> as <b>away</b> she was sweeping. [...] And saw a youth eagerly keeping [...] As {{close as}} he dared to the doorway. [...] No doubt that a noble should more weigh [...] 160 [...] His life than befits a plebeian; [...] And yet, had our brute been Nemean-- [...] (I judge by a certain calm fervour [...] The youth stepped with, forward to serve her) [...] --He'd have scarce thought you did him the worst turn [...] If you whispered [...] "Friend, what you'd get, first earn!" [...] And when, shortly after, she carried [...] Her shame from the Court, and they married, [...] To that {{marriage}} some happiness, maugre [...] The voice of the Court, I dared augur. [...] 170 ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{a strange}} thing happened. Instead of <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> at once, {{she kept her eyes}} {{steadily}} fixed upon me and suddenly gave a distinct start. I saw the colour rush into her face and leave it again almost as swiftly; her thin lips were slightly parted, and her whole expression was one of great agitation. <b>I</b> tried to <b>look</b> <b>away,</b> but <b>I</b> could not; I felt somehow forced to return her steady gaze. But when she turned to her husband and touched him on the arm, evidently to direct his attention to me, the spell was broken, and I moved my chair slightly, making some casual remark to my companion which was sufficient to set the ball of conversation rolling again. But one stolen glance a few moments later showed me that both husband and wife were regarding me attentively, and several times afterwards, when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> over towards their table, I met Lady Langerdale's eyes, full of a sad, wistful, and withal puzzled expression which I could not read.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to examine whether <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> {{behaviour}} of ADHD children interferes with their test performance. ADHD and normal children carried out two continuous performance tests (CPTs) : one with a regular interstimulus interval (ISI), and the other with an irregular ISI. Children were instructed to push a response button when a target stimulus was presented on the monitor. The children's visual behaviour was recorded and scored offline. A micro-analysis of the visual behaviour indicated that ADHD children timed their <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> behaviour in the regular CPT: <b>i.</b> e. they <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from the monitor and back in the interval between two succeeding stimuli. As a result they did not miss stimuli. Timing of <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> was less possible in the CPT with the irregular ISI. In this condition, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> interfered with the ADHD children's task accuracy. In sum, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> behaviour had a negative effect on the accuracy of test performance of ADHD children when stimuli were unpredictable. Looking away behaviour was not associated with the slower reaction times of the ADHD children. Hence, the often reported slowness of ADHD children is not to be explained by their visual behaviour...|$|R
60|$|Yet, after all, was he abject? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{from the}} door, and, {{for the second}} time, studied {{carefully}} {{the features of the}} man who had sought my protection in so extraordinary a manner. He was clean shaven, his features were good; his face, under ordinary circumstances, might have been described as almost prepossessing. Just now it was whitened and distorted by fear {{to such an extent that}} it gave to his expression a perfectly repulsive cast. It was as though he looked beyond death and saw things, however dimly, more terrible than human understanding can fitly grapple with. There were subtleties of horror in his glassy eyes, in his drawn and haggard features.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Tita--ah, Miss Tita," [...] I stammered, for all reply. I did {{not know}} what to do, as I say, but at a venture I made a wild, vague {{movement}} in consequence of which I found myself at the door. I remember standing there and saying, [...] "It wouldn't do--it wouldn't do!" [...] pensively, awkwardly, grotesquely, while <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> to the opposite end of the sala as if there were a beautiful view there. The next thing I remember is that I was downstairs and out of the house. My gondola was there and my gondolier, reclining on the cushions, sprang up as soon as he saw me. I jumped in and to his usual [...] "Dove commanda?" [...] I replied, in a tone that made him stare, [...] "Anywhere, anywhere; out into the lagoon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you left}} me there upon the rock, lads, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{and out to}} sea, to get one last snuff of the merry sea-breeze, which will never sail me again. And as I looked, I tell you truth, I could see {{the water and the}} sky; as plain as ever I saw them, till I thought my sight was come again. But soon I knew it was not so; for I saw more than man could see; right over the ocean, as I live, and away to the Spanish Main. And I saw Barbados, and Grenada, and all the isles that we ever sailed by; and La Guayra in Caracas, and the Silla, and the house beneath it where she lived. And I saw him walking with her on the barbecue, and he loved her then. I saw what I saw; and he loved her; and I say he loves her still.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that Golinger has [...] "emerged {{as one of}} the most prominent fixtures of Venezuela’s expanding state propaganda complex...Reviled by the president’s critics, she appears on state television whenever tension ratchets up between Washington and Caracas, as it did recently in a spat over ambassadors, to explain the motives of the 'empire', the term used Venezuela for the United States." [...] While discussing and acknowledging that there was corruption in the Venezuelan government, she denied investigating the issue saying that [...] "Powerful people are involved. It would be dangerous. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> and focus on all the positive things happening." [...] In Comandante: Hugo Chávez's Venezuela, Golinger is depicted as [...] "someone who applauded Chávez's early stories, the ones about inclusion and social justice of his first years of presidency, and who continued clapping even as his stories turned dark and bizarre". The Center for Public Integrity describes Golinger as [...] "a writer at the pro-Chávez Web site, Venezuelanalysis.com" [...] and says she was asked in 2003 by the Venezuela Information Office (VIO) to be the member of a [...] "rapid response team to combat news articles and editorials critical of Chávez". According to Golinger, the [...] "VIO's communications were not significant, and ... 'Long before that office came into existence ... I was writing articles about Venezuela and engaging in efforts to educate on Venezuelan current affairs'." [...] She frequently appears on RT (TV network), and she edits the English-language edition of Correo del Orinoco.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thrilled," [...] she acknowledged. [...] "That was the pleasurable {{part of it}} I {{have been}} so, used to looking on at shows that bored me, {{listening}} to conversations that wearied me, attempting sensations which were repellent, that I just welcomed feeling, when it came--feeling of any sort. I was excited. I forgot everything else. I was so fascinated that <b>I</b> could not <b>look</b> <b>away.</b> But {{if you ask me}} whether I liked it, and I have to answer truthfully, I hated it! I felt nothing of the sort at the time, but when I tried to sleep I found myself shivering. It was justice, I know, but it was ugly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grieved to the heart, I {{take up the}} pen to lament {{with you}} [...] and my dear Sisters the loss we have just sustained. In [...] truth, for a good while past I have {{expected}} nothing else: [...] but when the inevitable actually comes, {{it is always a}} sad [...] and overwhelming stroke. To think that one who was so dear [...] to us, whom we hung upon with the feelings of early [...] childhood, and also in later years were bound to by respect [...] and love, that such an object is gone from the world, that [...] with all our striving we cannot bring it back,—to think of [...] this is always something frightful. And when, like you, my [...] dearest best Mother, one has shared with the lost Friend and [...] Husband joy and sorrow for so many long years, the parting [...] is all the painfuler. Even when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from what the [...] good Father that is gone was to myself and to us all, I [...] cannot without mournful emotion contemplate the close of so [...] steadfast and active a life, which God continued to him so [...] long, in such soundness of body and mind, and which he [...] managed so honourably and well. Yes truly, it is not a small [...] thing to hold out so faithfully upon so long and toilsome a [...] course; and like him, in his seventy-third year, to part [...] from the world in so childlike and pure a mood. Might I but, [...] if it cost me all his sorrows, pass away from my life as [...] innocently as he from his! Life is so severe a trial; and [...] the advantages which Providence, in some respects, may have [...] granted me compared with him, are joined with so many [...] dangers for the heart and for its true peace! ...|$|R
