40|$|Whenever the Breit-Wigner {{amplitude}} {{appears in}} a calculation,there are many instances (e. g., Fermi's two-level system and the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation) where <b>energy</b> <b>integrations</b> are extended from the scattering spectrum of the Hamiltonian to the whole real line. Such extensions are performed {{in order to obtain}} a desirable, causal result. In this paper, we recall several of those instances and show that substituting the Breit-Wigner amplitude by the complex delta function allows us to recover such desirable results without having to extend <b>energy</b> <b>integrations</b> outside of the scattering spectrum.
