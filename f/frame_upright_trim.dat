5000|$|<b>Upright</b> <b>frames</b> (also called <b>upright</b> columns or uprights) vary in {{size and}} design {{depending}} on load requirements, and styles. The most common upright column is produced by roll forming flat coil stock steel into a modified [...] "C" [...] shape with returns. This style {{is often referred to}} as open-back roll-formed columns. Holes or slots are punched during manufacturing up and down the column at standard intervals so that the load beams can be mounted into the <b>upright</b> columns. <b>Upright</b> <b>frames</b> can also be constructed utilizing structural C shapes for columns. Structural uprights have an increased weight capacity over roll formed uprights.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks in the cross-aisle direction is typically ensured by cold-formed steel bolted <b>upright</b> <b>frames.</b> Sensitive to second-order effects, accurately determining the shear stiffness of these frames {{is essential for}} seismic design and for ensuring the {{stability of}} the rack, especially for high-bay racks and racks supporting the building enclosure, where the outer rack frames must withstand cross-aisle horizontal actions due to wind loading. The main international racking specifications adopt different approaches to determining the shear stiffness of cold-formed steel storage rack <b>upright</b> <b>frames.</b> The Rack Manufacturers Institute (RMI) specification conservatively uses Timoshenko and Gere's theory. The European Specification EN 15512 recommends testing, however {{it is not clear whether}} the shear stiffness obtained using the recommended test procedure is correct. The newly revised Australian Standard AS 4084 adopted the European approach but also introduced an alternative test method for determining the combined bending and shear stiffness of <b>upright</b> <b>frames</b> in the transverse direction. This paper reviews and analyses the factors influencing the shear deformation of cold-formed steel bolted <b>upright</b> <b>frames</b> and introduces the alternative test set-up adopted in the revised Australian Standard. 36 <b>upright</b> <b>frames</b> have been tested using the two test methods, and experimental results are presented, discussed and compared with finite element analysis results. Recommendations on how to use the test outcomes in design are also provided. Based on these recommendations, the paper shows that the two test methods are not equivalent and yield different results for the transverse shear stiffness of <b>upright</b> <b>frames.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} theory {{that there is a}} tendency to interpret the axes of a large tilted frame of reference as surrogates of the main axes of the environment. Therefore {{there is a tendency to}} perceive such a <b>frame</b> as either <b>upright</b> or as less tilted than it is—righting—and, accordingly, to perceive a vertical rod as tilted in the opposite direction—the rod-and-frame effect (RFE). A high correlation was found between righting and the RFE in all experiments. When a double frame apparatus was used, with the outer <b>frame</b> <b>upright</b> and the inner frame tilted, there was no consistent RFE. This condition eliminates any righting effect. When the outer frame was tilted and the inner one was upright, however, the RFE was induced, as was a correlated righting effect. All experiments were repeated with the subject's head tilted, thereby increasing the tendency toward righting of the frame. The result was a corresponding increase in the RFE. The RFE can thus be thought of as the solution to the problem of the rod's tilt given the perceived tilt of the frame. In the classic rod-and-frame effect (RFE...|$|R

50|$|Drums called pasu or pabu {{were present}} in 1841 {{at the time of}} the United States Exploring Expedition, but are no longer used or even remembered. Considered unusual for Western Polynesia, the {{instrument}} was cylindrical in <b>frame,</b> <b>upright</b> in its playing position, crafted of shark's skin, and beaten with two sticks. Slit-gongs, known as lala or lali, were also described in 1841. They were created from a hollow log and struck with a heavy beater. A smaller version of slit gongs was known as kaulalo. Another smaller slit drum, the pate, was used with handclapping or pati (slapping) during taualuga dancing. Weaving boards (papa or papafailalaga) are struck with thin sticks and produce a brittle sound. Beaten with sticks, moega (rolled mats) are used as accompaniment during mauluulu dancing. Plywood is used for crafting the pokihi, a mat-covered box; it accompanies the fatele dance.

40|$|The Second Edition of {{this classic}} {{introduction}} {{to the principles of}} architecture is everything you would expect from the celebrated architect, author, and illustrator, Francis D. K. Ching. Each page has been meticulously revised to incorporate contemporary examples of the principles of form, space, and order-the fundamental vocabulary of every designer. The result is a beautifully illustrated volume that embraces today's forms and looks at conventional models with a fresh perspective. Here, Ching examines every principal of architecture, juxtaposing images that span centuries and cross cultural boundaries to create a design vocabulary that is both elemental and timeless. Among the topics covered are point, line, plane, volume, proportion, scale, circulation, and the interdependence of form and space. While this revision continues to be a comprehensive primer on the ways form and space are interrelated and organized in the shaping of our environment, it has been refined to amplify and clarify concepts. In addition, the Second Edition contains: * Numerous new hand-rendered drawings * Expanded sections on openings and scale * Expanded chapter on design principles * New glossary and index categorized by the author * New 8 1 / 2 ? 11 <b>upright</b> <b>trim</b> In the Second Edition of Architecture: Form, Space, and Order, the author has opted for a larger format and crisper images. Mr. Ching has retained the style of his hand-lettered text, a hallmark of each of his books. This rich source of architectural prototypes, each rendered in Mr. Ching's signature style, also serves as a guide to architectural drawing. Doubtless, many will want this handsome volume for the sheer beauty of it. Architects and students alike will treasure this book for its wealth of practical information and its precise illustrations. Mr. Ching has once again created a visual reference that illuminates the world of architectural form. ...|$|R

50|$|Flail mowers have {{a number}} of small blades on the end of chains {{attached}} to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades. In some types the cut material may be gathered in a collection bin.

40|$|The {{presence}} of an additional external <b>upright</b> <b>frame</b> was studied in three experiments to separate the role of visuovestibular, global, and local mechanisms in the rod-and-frame illusion (RFI). In the first experiment, carried out in a dark room, the external frame surrounded a large tilted frame. Rod-setting errors to the vertical were abolished with the additional-frame condition (at 22 degrees inner-frame tilt) confirming earlier findings. However, small, residual direct (at 11 degrees inner-frame tilt) and indirect effects (at 33 degrees inner-frame tilt) were still present, indicating the persistence of global visual processing. In the second experiment, the RFI in the dark was compared with the RFI with the lights on. Turning the light on abolished the effect at 22 degrees and 33 degrees frame tilt; however, a small direct effect was maintained at 11 degrees frame tilt. These two studies indicate that the addition of veridical vertical information abolishes the effect owing to visuovestibular mechanisms. In the third experiment, a small rod and frame was used with the lights on (a condition abolishing visual-vestibular interaction). In {{the case of a}} small gap between the rod and the inducing frame (a condition which maximises local processing), the effect of the outer <b>upright</b> <b>frame</b> was negligible; this indicates that the additional frame had no effect on local processing. In the case of a large gap (a condition which minimises local processing), the external square reduced the illusion, indicating its modulating effect on visual global processing. Overall, an <b>upright</b> external <b>frame</b> exerts a differential influence depending on which mechanisms contribute most to the RFI in a given experimental condition...|$|R

40|$|The brain can use {{multiple}} reference frames to code line orientation, including head-, object-, and gravity-centered references. If these frames change orientation, their representations must {{be updated}} {{to keep register}} with actual line orientation. We tested this internal updating during head rotation in roll, exploiting the rod-and-frame effect: The illusory tilt of a vertical line surrounded by a tilted visual frame. If line orientation is stored relative to gravity, these distortions should also affect the updating process. Alternatively, if coding is head- or frame-centered, updating errors should {{be related to the}} changes in their orientation. Ten subjects were instructed to memorize the orientation of a briefly flashed line, surrounded by a tilted visual frame, then rotate their head, and subsequently judge the orientation of a second line relative to the memorized first while the <b>frame</b> was <b>upright.</b> Results showed that updating errors were mostly related to the amount of subjective distortion of gravity at both the initial and final head orientation, rather than to the amount of intervening head rotation. In some subjects, a smaller part of the updating error was also related to the change of visual frame orientation. We conclude that the brain relies primarily on a gravity-based reference to remember line orientation during head roll...|$|R
