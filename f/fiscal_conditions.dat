40|$|This paper {{examines}} how schools districts {{have responded to}} fiscal constraints {{in the past to}} gain insight into how they might respond in the future. It uses cross sectional data for Texas and New York first to develop a measure of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition</b> of each district and, second, to examine the choices made by school districts facing differing degrees of fiscal pressure. I conclude that districts respond to fiscal constraint by trying to protect the level of instructional spending, that central administration spending and staffing appear to be a luxury that is more affordable for districts in strong <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition,</b> and that spending on capital outlays is more responsive than other categories to a district's <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition.</b> Annual shortfalls in capital spending and maintenance in response to an extended period of fiscal constraint are likely to leave some districts with serious deficiencies in their capital facilities. ...|$|R

50|$|Congress {{enacted the}} IEEPA in 1977 to clarify and {{restrict}} presidential power {{during times of}} declared national emergency under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 ("TWEA"). Under TWEA, starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933, presidents {{had the power to}} declare emergencies without limiting their scope or duration, without citing the relevant statutes, and without congressional oversight. The Supreme Court in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer limited what a president could do in such an emergency, but did not limit the emergency declaration power itself. A 1973 Senate investigation found (in Senate Report 93-549) that four declared emergencies remained in effect: the 1933 banking crisis with respect to the hoarding of gold, a 1950 emergency with respect to the Korean War, a 1970 emergency regarding the postal workers strike, and a 1971 emergency in response to the government's deteriorating economic and <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Congress terminated these emergencies with the National Emergencies Act, and then passed the IEEPA to restore the emergency power in a limited, overseeable form.|$|E
40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Two key measures {{that have been used}} as indicators of the government's annual <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition</b> are the unified budget deficit measured primarily on a cash basis and the net operating cost measured on an accrual basis for financial statement purposes. The unified budget deficit has historically been the focus of budget debates and media reports in part because it closely approximates the government's short-term borrowing needs. Cash accounting can also be useful for controlling spending in the current year. However, the cash measure of <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition,</b> which is similar to keeping a checkbook, by nature excludes information about the long-term consequences of today's policy decisions and operations. Indeed, understanding our nation's long-term fiscal outlook is important because, as GAO's long-term simulations show, current fiscal policy is unsustainable. The accrual measure primarily provides more information on the longer-term implications of today's policy decisions and operations by showing certain costs incurred today but not payable for years to come, such as civilian and military pensions and retiree health care. While cash and accrual measures each serve different purposes, they present complementary information and can be used together to provide a more comprehensive picture of the government's <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition</b> today and over time. The goal of this primer is to improve understanding of the accrual deficit by describing (1) how it is similar and different from the more commonly reported cash budget deficit, (2) the key drivers behind changes in accrual deficits relative to cash budget deficits, and (3) how the two measures complement each other and give a fuller picture of the government's overall <b>fiscal</b> <b>condition.</b> In addition, see GAO- 07 - 341 SP for updates to selected information in this document. ...|$|R

5000|$|Major {{parts in}} the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the {{population}} were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the Benedictine and Commercial orders) and some feudal lords' recruiting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Even when speculators sought to encourage towns, settlers needed an agricultural belt around or sometimes within defensive walls. When populations were quickly decreased by causes such as the Black Death or devastating warfare (for example, Genghis Khan's Mongol hordes in eastern and central Europe, Thirty Years' War in Germany), this could lead to settlements being abandoned. The land was reclaimed by nature, but the secondary forests usually lacked the original biodiversity.From 1100 to 1500 AD, significant deforestation took place in Western Europe {{as a result of}} the expanding human population. The large-scale building of wooden sailing ships by European (coastal) naval owners since the 15th century for exploration, colonisation, slave trade-and other trade on the high seas consumed many forest resources. Piracy also contributed to the over harvesting of forests, as in Spain. This led to a weakening of the domestic economy after Columbus' discovery of America, as the economy became dependent on colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Milanovic (2011) {{points out}} that overall, global {{inequality}} between countries {{is more important to}} growth of the world economy than inequality within countries. While global economic growth may be a policy priority, recent evidence about regional and national inequalities cannot be dismissed when more local economic growth is a policy objective. The recent financial crisis and global recession hit countries and shook financial systems all over the world. This led to the implementation of large-scale fiscal expansionary interventions and, as a result, to massive public debt issuance in some countries. Governmental bailouts of the banking system further burdened fiscal balances and raises considerable concern about the fiscal solvency of some countries. Most governments want to keep deficits under control but rolling back the expansionary measures or cutting spending and raising taxes implies an enormous wealth transfer from tax payers to the private financial sector. Expansionary fiscal policies shift resources and causes worries about growing inequality within countries. Moreover, recent data confirm an ongoing trend of increasing income inequality since the early nineties. Increasing inequality within countries has been accompanied by a redistribution of economic resources between developed economies and emerging markets. Davtyn, et al. (2014) studied the interaction of these <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions</b> and changes in fiscal and economic policies with income inequality in the UK, Canada, and the US. They find income inequality has negative effect on economic growth {{in the case of the}} UK but a positive effect in the cases of the US and Canada. Income inequality generally reduces government net lending/borrowing for all the countries. Economic growth, they find, leads to an increase of income inequality in the case of the UK and to the decline of inequality in the cases of the US and Canada. At the same time, economic growth improves government net lending/borrowing in all the countries. Government spending leads to the decline in inequality in the UK but to its increase in the US and Canada.|$|E

If such economic conditions are considered, the evaluation of Australia’s <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions</b> is worse than one based on fiscal indicator alone, while the opposite relationship is the case for Japan. The <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions</b> of the two countries are a good example to demonstrate that <b>fiscal</b> <b>conditions</b> should be evaluated as part of economic conditions. ...|$|E
