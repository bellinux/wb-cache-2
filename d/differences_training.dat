50|$|A licence {{will contain}} {{one or more}} ratings. These are sub-qualifications that specify in more detail the exact {{privileges}} that the licence conveys. One type of rating is an Aircraft rating. This specifies the type or types of aircraft which can be flown, and is either a Class rating, when a whole broad class of aircraft can be flown, or a Type rating where the privileges are confined to a single type or group of very closely related types. The very basic aircraft rating usually obtained by PPL(A) holders at their initial skills test is the Single Engine Piston Landplane (SEP-land) Class Rating. This allows flight of single-piston-engined, non-turbocharged, fixed-pitch propeller, fixed tricycle gear, non-pressurised land aeroplanes (with a few exceptions). SEP class rating holders may optionally extend the privileges of this rating to cover complex features by taking formal <b>differences</b> <b>training</b> from a suitably qualified instructor. There are five categories of difference: tailwheel aircraft, retractable undercarriage, variable-pitch propeller, turbocharged engine and cabin pressurisation. There is no formal test for any difference training; the training is signed off as satisfactorily completed in the pilot's logbook by the instructor conducting the training. Other class ratings include Multi Engine Piston (MEP) landplane, Single and Multi engined piston Seaplane, Single Engine Turbine (SET) and Touring Motor Gliders. Note: There is no MET class rating, as multi engine turbine and all jet powered aircraft require a type rating. To add these to their licence a pilot has to undergo a course of training and pass an additional skills test. <b>Differences</b> <b>training</b> is also required for certain complex features within these class ratings. Aircraft ratings are type-specific for multi engine turboprop & all jet aircraft {{and for a few}} other very complex types. To obtain one of these a pilot must undergo specific training and pass a skills test. It is also possible to obtain permission from the CAA to fly an aircraft not covered by any type or class rating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with investigating the {{factors that contribute to}} optimizing information transfer (IT) rate in humans. With an increasing interest in designing complex haptic signals {{for a wide variety of}} applications, there is a need for a better understanding of how information can be displayed in an optimal way. Based on the results of several early studies from the 1950 s, a general “rule of thumb ” has arisen in the literature which suggests that IT rate is dependent primarily on the stimulus delivery rate and is optimized for presentation rates of 2 - 3 items/s. Thus, the key to maximizing IT rate is to maximize the information in the stimulus set. Recent data obtained with multidimensional tactual signals, however, appear to contradict these conclusions. In particular, these current results suggest that optimal delivery rate varies with stimulus information to yield a constant peak IT rate that depends on the degree of familiarity and training with a particular stimulus set. We discuss factors that may be responsible for the discrepancies in results across studies including procedural <b>differences,</b> <b>training</b> issues, and stimulus-response compatibility. These factors should be taken into account when designing haptic signals to yield optimal IT rates for communication devices. Index Terms—Communication, human performance, information transfer rate, mobile device. Ç...|$|E

40|$|Generic airspace, or {{air traffic}} control sectors with similar {{operational}} characteristics, is an operational concept being proposed {{as a means of}} increasing staffing flexibility and reducing training times as part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Next Generation (NextGen) {{air traffic control}} (ATC) modernization efforts. A key need for implementing generic airspace is identifying groups of similar sectors with respect to training required for controllers to make transitions between those sectors. Through the development and validation process of the studies performed in this thesis, a structure-based classification scheme was found to be an effective way to classify sectors in order to support a minimal <b>differences</b> <b>training</b> approach to generic airspace. The resulting classes of sectors are expected to have fewer transition barriers and support increased staffing flexibility. In order to assess similarities of airspace sectors, factors affecting how easily a controller makes a transition from one sector to another were identified using semi-structured interviews with experienced air traffic controllers. The most important factors appear to reflect familiarity with types of operations and common traffic patterns, providing a basis for classifying groups of sectors. The controllers identified some techniques that are easily transferable as well. Some factors that are very specific to transitions were identified as well, such as “knowing the neighbor sectors” and “coastal area” factors. Based on the most important factors, traffic patterns in 404 high-altitude National Airspace System (NAS) sectors were examined for common traffic patterns. These traffic patterns were used as the basis for two classification approaches, a holistic classification approach and a decompositional classification approach. These approaches are used to classify current air traffic control sectors into classes with common structural characteristics. The results identify existing sectors with near-term potential as being generic sectors that support a minimal <b>differences</b> <b>training</b> approach to generic airspace. Further analysis with the sector classification results identified that the number of factors incorporated in the classification methods are directly associated with the method's effectiveness. In order to examine the validity of the developed classification methods and to assess the relative importance of the factors involving transitions identified by the interviews, an online survey was conducted with 56 air traffic controllers. The results indicated that the classification methods developed support controllers' perception of airspace similarities. Some qualitative data gained from the survey provides an insightful aspect for future steps continuing this study such as additional important factors to be considered. Some of these factors are considered as part of the classification schemes developed in this thesis while some are yet to be incorporated. Some of these additional factors were found to be more feasible to be incorporated into future classification schemes than other factors...|$|E

The {{use of the}} DNA barcode gene 16 S mRNA for the {{clarification}} of taxonomic problems within the family Sertulariidae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa). - Zoologica Scripta, 40, 520 - 537. The Sertulariidae are the most speciose family of the Hydrozoa, and their systematics are problematic. Here, 77 new 16 S mtDNA sequence 'barcodes' of Atlantic and Mediterranean sertulariids were subject to phylogenetic analyses along with another 29 already deposited in Genbank. Amongst the 12 nominal genera and around 40 putative species analysed, several taxonomic inconsistencies and corroborations were highlighted by the genetic data. Patterns of morphological characters between the specimens analysed genetically were extremely congruent with molecular estimates. The genera Sertularia, Dynamena and Symplectoscyphus {{were found to be}} polyphyletic, and the genus Sertularella paraphyletic. The validity of Sertularella robusta at a species level was confirmed, along with the exclusion of Sertularelloides cylindritheca from the genus Sertularella. Potential cryptic species were detected within Sertularella fusiformis, Sertularella mediterranea, Sertularella ellisii, Sertularia distans, Dynamena disticha, Thuiaria articulata and Diphasia margareta. Conversely, probable cases of synonomy were revealed for the species pairs: Sertularia cupressina and Sertularia argentea, Amphisbetia minima and Amphisbetia operculata, and Thuiaria thuja and T. articulata. 16 S haplotype data also revealed probable phylogeographic structure across localities of the NE Atlantic and Mediterranean. As an alternative 'DNA barcode', the 16 S gene has the great advantage of being easily amplified and sequenced across hydrozoan taxa.
