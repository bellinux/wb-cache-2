5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation.</b> The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} and autumn of 1996 the UK police made it known that they were {{planning}} to raid an ISP {{with the aim of}} launching a test case regarding the publication of obscene material over the Internet. The direct result of the campaign of threats and pressure was the establishment of the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> (initially known as the Safety Net Foundation) in September 1996.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, Virgin Media was one {{of several}} ISPs in the UK to attempt to censor its users' access to the Wikipedia article about the 1976 album Virgin Killer by stadium rock band Scorpions. The album cover has {{generated}} controversy, as it features the partially obscured image of a naked, underage girl. The Wikipedia article includes this image and its URL was blacklisted by the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> after a user complaint. The blacklisting has since been rescinded.|$|E

500|$|On 5 December 2008 the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{added the}} Wikipedia URLs for the Virgin Killer article and the [...] to its blacklist. After the blacklisting, users of major UK ISPs, {{including}} BT, Vodafone, Virgin Media/Tesco.net, Be/O2, EasyNet/UK Online/Sky Broadband, Orange, Demon, and TalkTalk (Opal Telecom), {{were unable to}} access the content.|$|E

After the block had been removed, Mike Godwin, {{general counsel for the}} Wikimedia Foundation, stated [...] "there is still plenty to be troubled by in the operations of the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> and its blacklist".|$|E
500|$|On 5 December 2008, the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> (IWF), a British {{watchdog}} group, blacklisted {{content on}} the English Wikipedia related to Scorpions' 1976 studio album Virgin Killer, {{due to the}} presence of its controversial cover artwork, depicting a young girl posing nude, with a faux glass shatter obscuring her genitalia. The image was deemed to be [...] "potentially illegal content" [...] under English law which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children. The IWF's blacklist are used in web filtering systems such as Cleanfeed.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} was commented {{in some countries}} implementing or considering to implement Internet filtering or censorship plans. In Australia, Electronic Frontiers Australia vice-chairman Colin Jacobs said that [...] " [...] incident in Britain, in which virtually the entire country was unable to edit Wikipedia because the country's <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> had blacklisted a single image on the site, illustrated the pitfalls of mandatory ISP filtering". The Sydney Morning Herald has commented that [...] "Ironically, the banning of the image has only made it visible to more people as news sites publicise the issue and the image spreads across sites other than Wikipedia." [...] {{an example of the}} Streisand effect.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Patricia Hewitt, then Minister for E-Commerce, said: [...] "The <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> plays a {{vital role}} in combating {{criminal}} material on the Net." [...] To counter accusations that the IWF was biased in favour of the ISPs, a new independent chairman was appointed, Roger Darlington, former head of research at the Communication Workers Union.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2008, {{the image}} again {{gave rise to}} {{controversy}} when the British <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> placed certain pages from Wikipedia on its internet blacklist, since it considered the image to be [...] "potentially illegal" [...] under the Protection of Children Act 1978. This resulted {{in much of the}} UK being prevented from editing Wikipedia, and significant public debate on the decision. The decision was reversed by the IWF after four days of blocking.|$|E

2500|$|The Wikipedia {{article about}} Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions—features {{a picture of}} the album's {{original}} cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a [...] "blacklist" [...] it supplies to British internet service providers.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015 the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology {{released}} a briefing which stated that [...] "There is widespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether {{is not seen}} as an acceptable policy option in the U.K." [...] and that [...] "Even if it were, there would be technical challenges." [...] The report further noted that Tor [...] "plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children" [...] (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation,</b> the utility of its hidden services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.|$|E
2500|$|Facilitated by the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI), {{discussions were}} held between certain ISPs, the Metropolitan Police, the Home Office, {{and a body}} called the [...] "Safety Net Foundation" [...] (formed by the Dawe Charitable Trust). This {{resulted}} in the [...] "R3 Safety Net Agreement", where [...] "R3" [...] referred to the triple approach of rating, reporting, and responsibility. In September 1996, this agreement was made between the ISPA, LINX, and the Safety Net Foundation, which was subsequently renamed the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation.</b> The agreement set requirements for associated ISPs regarding identifiability and traceability of Internet users; ISPs had {{to cooperate with the}} IWF to identify providers of illegal content and facilitate easier traceability.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2004 and 2006, BT Group {{introduced}} its Cleanfeed technology {{which was then}} used by 80% of internet service providers.

2500|$|In December 2008, the <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> (IWF), a UK-based non-government organization, {{added the}} Wikipedia article Virgin Killer to its {{internet}} blacklist due to concerns over {{legality of the}} image, which had been assessed as {{the lowest level of}} legal concern: [...] "erotic posing with no sexual activity". As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, and {{a large part of the}} UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means of blocking in use. Following representations by the Wikimedia Foundation (who host the Wikipedia website) and public complaints, the IWF reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas. The IWF stated that one of the reasons for reversing their decision was that it had increased public interest in the image, an example of the Streisand effect.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> (IWF) is a {{registered}} charity based in Cambridgeshire, England. It states that its remit is [...] "to minimise the availability of 'potentially criminal' Internet content, specifically images {{of child sexual abuse}} (including child pornography) hosted anywhere, and criminally obscene adult content in the UK". Content inciting racial hatred was removed from the IWF's remit after a police website was set up for the purpose in April 2011. The IWF clarifies on its website that potentially criminal activity is addressed, as content can be confirmed to be criminal only by a court of law. As part of its function, the IWF says that it will [...] "supply partners with an accurate and current URL list to enable blocking of child sexual abuse content". It has [...] "an excellent and responsive national Hotline reporting service" [...] for receiving reports from the public. In addition to receiving referrals from the public, its agents also proactively search the peer-to-peer networks of the deep web to identify potentially illegal images. It can then ask service providers to take down the websites containing the images or to block them if they fall outside UK jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the British-based <b>Internet</b> <b>Watch</b> <b>Foundation</b> {{reported}} that child pornography on the Internet {{is becoming more}} brutal and graphic, {{and the number of}} images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003. The CEO stated [...] "The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. We're talking about prepubescent children being raped." [...] About 80 percent {{of the children in the}} abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be children under the age of 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law. Some child pornographers also circumvent detection by using viruses to illegally gain control of computers on which they remotely store child pornography. In one case, a Massachusetts man was charged with possession of child pornography when hackers used his computer to access pornographic sites and store pornographic pictures without his knowledge. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has ruled that if a user downloads child pornography from a file sharing network and possesses it in his [...] "shared folder" [...] without configuring the software to not share that content, he can be charged with distributing child pornography.|$|E
