40|$|Aim: {{to define}} {{clinical}} and etiological, radiation and neurophysiological parameters determining {{the transformation of}} disseminated leukoencephalitis to multiple sclerosis in children. Materials and methods: clinical and etiological analysis of leukoencephalitis in 229 children aged 1 - 17 years old and their catamnesis for 5, 5 ± 1, 8 years were performed. Morphostructural characteristic was made by brain and spinal cord MRI and multimodal provoked potentials. Results: The development of multiple sclerosis in children was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outcome of leukoencephalitis chronic course in 44, 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>in</b> 73, 3 % of <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of mixed herpes viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus and 6 type herpes virus).
