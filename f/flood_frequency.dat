On the marsh surface an elevation gradient is sampled to be analyzed for testate amoebae assemblages and sediment characteristics. Further, vegetation, <b>flooding</b> <b>frequency</b> and soil conductivity have been taken into account to explain the testate amoebae species variation. The data reveal that testate amoebae are not able to establish assemblages at the brackish tidal marsh part with <b>flooding</b> <b>frequencies</b> equal to or higher than 36. 5 %. Further, two separate testate amoebae zones are distinguished based on cluster analysis. The lower zone’s testate amoebae species composition is influenced by the <b>flooding</b> <b>frequency</b> (~ elevation) and particle size, while the species variability in the higher zone is related to the organic content of the soil and particle size. These observations suggest that the ecological meaning of elevation shifts over its range on the brackish tidal marsh.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>flood</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{in three}} coastal sectors of Britain and analyses the associated storm tracks and their principal pathways.

The <b>frequencies</b> of <b>flood</b> incidents in the south and southwest coast of Britain have increased, particularly during the 20 th century, whereas on the west coast <b>flood</b> <b>frequencies</b> have declined. Three distinctive pathways of storm track are identified, related to flood incidents in each coastal sector. A southern pathway in a corridor along the 55 ° N parallel is associated with flood incidents recorded on the south and southwest coast, whilst storms that are associated with floods on the west coast concentrate along the 60 ° N parallel. The relationship between the <b>frequencies</b> of <b>floods</b> and climatic variations needs to be explored further.

40|$|How {{will the}} {{combined}} impacts {{of land use}} change and climate change influence changes in urban <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> {{and what is the}} main uncertainty source of the results? We attempt to answer to these questions in two catchments with different degrees of urbanization, the Fanno catchment with 84 % urban land use and the Johnson catchment with 36 % urban land use, both located in the Pacific Northwest of the US. Five uncertainty sources – general circulation model (GCM) structures, future greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios, land use change scenarios, natural variability, and hydrologic model parameters – are considered to compare the relative source of uncertainty in <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> projections. Two land use change scenarios conservation and development, representing possible future land use changes are used for analysis. Results show the highest increase in <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> under the combination of medium high GHG emission (A 1 B) and development scenarios, and the lowest increase under the combination of low GHG emission (B 1) and conservation scenarios. Although the combined impact is more significant to <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> change than individual scenarios, it does not linearly increase <b>flood</b> <b>frequency.</b> Changes in <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> are more sensitive to climate change than land use change in the two catchments for 2050 s (2040 – 2069). Shorter term <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> change, 2 and 5 year floods, is highly affected by GCM structure, while longer term <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> change above 25 year floods is dominated by natural variability.

40|$|The {{growing concern}} about the {{possible}} {{effects of climate change}} on <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime is leading Authorities to review previously proposed reference procedures for design-flood estimation, such as national <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> models. Our study focuses on Triveneto, a broad geographical region in North-eastern Italy. A reference procedure for design flood estimation in Triveneto is available from the Italian NCR research project "VA. PI. ", which considered Triveneto as a single homogeneous region and developed a regional model using annual maximum series (AMS) of peak discharges that were collected up to the 1980 s by the former Italian Hydrometeorological Service. We consider a very detailed AMS database that we recently compiled for 76 catchments located in Triveneto. All 76 study catchments are characterized in terms of several geomorphologic and climatic descriptors. The objective of our study is threefold: (1)  to inspect climatic and scale controls on <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime; (2)  to verify the possible presence of changes in <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime by looking at changes in time of regional L-moments of annual maximum floods; (3)  to develop an updated reference procedure for design flood estimation in Triveneto by using a focused-pooling approach (i. e. Region of Influence, RoI). Our study leads to the following conclusions: (1)  climatic and scale controls on <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime in Triveneto are similar to the controls that were recently found in Europe; (2)  a single year characterized by extreme floods can have a remarkable influence on regional <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> models and analyses for detecting possible changes in <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime; (3)  no significant change was detected in the <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> regime, yet an update of the existing reference procedure for design flood estimation is highly recommended and we propose the RoI approach for properly representing climate and scale controls on <b>flood</b> <b>frequency</b> in Triveneto, which cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous region...|$|E
