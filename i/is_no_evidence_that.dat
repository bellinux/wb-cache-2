5|$|The 3rd {{century was}} the age in which the {{initiative}} for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out {{under the authority of}} local government officials. Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary evidence}} of building work at Halton Castle shows {{that during the}} 15thcentury and into the 16thcentury it was regularly maintained. Between 1450 and 1457 a new gate tower was built. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the castle featured in the Wars of the Roses; {{this would have been}} unlikely because of its relatively obscure position. However a survey of the Royal Palaces in 1609 suggests that by then the castle had fallen into disrepair. During the Tudor period it was used less as a fortress and more as a prison, an administrative centre, and a court of law. In 1580–81 the castle was designated as a prison for Catholic recusants, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> it was ever used for that purpose.|$|E

5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} great white sharks, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and {{are one of}} the reasons the population has not expanded further north. The great white shark is believed to be their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> sharks actually eat them.|$|E
