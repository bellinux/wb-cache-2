50|$|In New Zealand, these epochs and stages use local {{place names}} (mainly Maori in origin) {{back to the}} Permian.

After approximately 6 months, the NCO and reserve officer training is completed and is followed by a 2-month special training period. Some servicemen are trained as medics and vehicle drivers during this period, while others are given special small arms and combat training. This period is followed by a short [...] "group training" [...] phase, a final combat exercise where the national defence training is tested. The conscript training is ended by a three-month <b>international</b> <b>period</b> during which the servicemen often live in base camps simulating those used in international missions.

40|$|Re-internationalisation {{represents}} a research {{challenge for the}} internationalisation process and international entrepreneurship fields. Many companies withdraw from international operations, go through an <b>international</b> time-out <b>period</b> and later re-enter the international arena. Little is known about this process, and whether re-internationalisers behave differently from those starting {{out for the first}} time. The limited, sketchy evidence is considered and it is argued that some re-internationalisers will go into the re-entry process with a significant international heritage from previous activities, including relevant knowledge and networks, enabling faster re-entry and take-off. However, other firms will have exited in such negative circumstances that international re-entry initially is rejected as an option, and may be slow to respond to new international opportunities. Much depends on what happens during the <b>international</b> time-out <b>period,</b> particularly in terms of changes in management and/or ownership; the nature and strength of new re-entry influences; and how the re-entry process unfolds.
