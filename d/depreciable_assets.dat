5000|$|Many systems {{allow an}} {{additional}} deduction for {{a portion of}} the cost of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> acquired in the current tax year. The UK system provides a first year capital allowance of £50,000. In the United States, two such deductions are available. A deduction for the full cost of depreciable tangible personal property is allowed up to $500,000 through 2013. This deduction is fully phased out for businesses acquiring over $2,000,000 of such property during the year. [...] In addition, additional first year depreciation of 50% of the cost of most other depreciable tangible personal property is allowed as a deduction. [...] Some other systems have similar first year or accelerated allowances.|$|E
50|$|A {{common system}} is to allow a fixed {{percentage}} {{of the cost of}} <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> to be deducted each year. This {{is often referred to as}} a capital allowance, as it is called in the United Kingdom. Deductions are permitted to individuals and businesses based on assets placed in service during or before the assessment year. Canada's Capital Cost Allowance are fixed percentages of assets within a class or type of asset. Fixed percentage rates are specified by type of asset. The fixed percentage is multiplied by the tax basis of assets in service to determine the capital allowance deduction. The tax law or regulations of the country specifies these percentages. Capital allowance calculations may be based on the total set of assets, on sets or pools by year (vintage pools) or pools by classes of assets...Depreciation has got three methods only.|$|E
5000|$|All taxpayers {{claiming}} {{deductions for}} depreciation must adjust those deductions in computing AMT income {{to the amount}} of deduction allowed for AMT. [...] For AMT purposes, depreciation is computed on most assets under the straight line method using the class life of the asset. When a taxpayer is required to recognize gain or loss on disposal of a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset</b> (or pollution control facility), the gain or loss must be adjusted to reflect the AMT depreciation amount rather than regular depreciation amounts. [...] This adjustment also applies to additional amounts deducted in the year of acquisition of the assets. For more details on these calculations, see MACRS.|$|R
50|$|Other {{capital gains}} are taxed at the {{ordinary}} rate. If {{the total amount}} of sales is used for the purchase of <b>depreciable</b> fixed <b>assets</b> within 3 years, the taxation of the capital gains will be spread over the depreciable period of these assets.|$|R
5000|$|In {{determining}} the profits (net income) from an activity, the receipts from the activity must {{be reduced by}} appropriate costs. One such cost {{is the cost of}} assets used but not immediately consumed in the activity. [...] Such cost so allocated in a given period is equal to the reduction in the value placed on the asset, which is initially equal to the amount paid for the asset and subsequently {{may or may not be}} related to the amount expected to be received upon its disposal. Depreciation is any method of allocating such net cost to those periods in which the organization is expected to benefit from use of the asset. The asset is referred to as a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset.</b> Depreciation is technically a method of allocation, not valuation, even though it determines the value placed on the asset in the balance sheet.|$|R
5000|$|Taxable {{income of}} each member is {{computed}} {{as if no}} consolidated return were filed, {{with the exception of}} certain items computed on a consolidated basis. [...] Then adjustments are made for certain transactions between group members. [...] Dividends between group members are eliminated. Sales of property between members give rise to a deferred intercompany transaction. [...] The effect on the selling member is deferred and recognized as the corresponding effects are recognized by the buying member. For example, Member A sells Member B some goods at a profit. This profit is not recognized until Member B sells the goods or recognizes depreciation expense on the goods. These complex rules require adjustments related to intra-group sales of property (including <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> and inventory), transactions in stock or other obligations of members, performance of services, entry and exit of members, and certain back-to-back and avoidance transactions.|$|E
5000|$|For taxpayers, the half-year {{convention}} {{does not}} require knowledge or proof of the date on which depreciable property is placed in service. Depreciable property {{is assumed to be}} placed into service on July 1 of the year in which it is placed into service. The Internal Revenue Service is fond of the rule because without it, taxpayers would be tempted to buy property {{in the second half of}} the year and claim full depreciation deductions as if the property were used for the entire year. Taxpayers like the rule because it {{does not require}} them to keep track of or prove exactly when depreciable property was placed into service. Nonetheless, the IRS is wary of abuse of the half-year convention. Under § 168(d)(3) of the Federal Income Tax Code, if a taxpayer purchases a lot of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> in the last three months of the taxable year, they may be forced to use the less beneficial [...] "mid-quarter convention". This convention treats such property as placed into service in the midpoint of the last quarter of the taxable year. See § 168(d)(4)(c).|$|E

Here, we affirm that result for the specific conditions facing agriculture-where the supply of agricultural land is nearly perfectly inelastic and the supply of depreciable inputs is nearly perfectly elastic. The result is confirmed using three different data sets.

40|$|Generally {{accepted}} depreciation methods do not {{compute the}} intrinsic {{value of an}} asset, as they do not factor for the Time Value of Money, a key principle within financial theory. This is disadvantageous, as knowing the intrinsic value of an asset can assist with making effective purchase and sale decisions. By applying the Time Value of Money principle to deprecation and book valuation, methods can be formulated to approximate the intrinsic valuation of a <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset,</b> which improves the capacity for buyers and sellers of assets to make rational decisions. A deprecation method is formulated within, which aims to better match book value with intrinsic value. While this method makes many assumptions and thus has limitations, more complex formulas, which factor for {{a greater number of}} variables, can be created using a similar approach, to produce better approximations for intrinsic value.

40|$|The present paper amends the two propositions in Peasnell (1995) {{concerning}} the fitness of J. R. Grinyer’s ‘earned economic income’ (EEI) model for its declared purpose of evaluating managerial {{performance in the}} light of comments in Grinyer (1995). Proposition I now includes the requirement that the profitability index is the same for each <b>depreciable</b> <b>asset</b> in the multi-asset firm in order for EEI to yield the same answers as the net present value (NPV) of the firm itself. Proposition II is now adjusted to reflect the possibility that errors in forecasted benefits can be large in magnitude. The new version distinguishes between random forecast errors and ‘earnings management’. The original result {{concerning the}} conditions when EEI will be more or less reliable than re-computed NPV holds as far as random forecast errors are concerned. In the case of management manipulations, the results depend on whether the investment is believed by management to be worthwhile and on whether the forecast biases are sufficient to turn a poor performance into a good one.

40|$|It's {{interesting}} how an economic operator decides to depreciate its <b>depreciable</b> fixed <b>assets,</b> because depreciation is an expense {{input from the}} taxable profit {{in accordance with the}} laws in force, thus contributing to diminishing the operating profit/loss and implicitly the gross and net earnings, without real impact on profitability and especially without any impact on the self-funding capacity. But the impact given by the depreciation expenses may be influenced by the organization policy in the field of depreciation and by the fiscal laws. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} normative capital maintenance model for <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> during a time of inflation. This model is developed on a stipulated physical capital maintenance concept that accumulated depreciation {{at the end of an}} asset 2 ̆ 7 s useful life should be equal to the funds required to replace the asset with a new one of comparable capacity. The soundness of this stipulation is supported by analyses of widely publicized theoretical models and promulgations of standards setting bodies in several countries. A key innovative factor in the model is provision for backlog depreciation as a charge against income. Backlog depreciation is the difference between the depreciation charges that would otherwise be made over the life of the asset and its net replacement cost. The model is developed first for a simple situation where <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> are purchased from a local market. This permits demonstration of the efficacy of backlog depreciation and other somewhat innovative factors. Cognizance is then taken of the following features of the international trade for depreciable assets: (a) the country that is self-sufficient in <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> does not exist in contemporary economic life, (b) different countries experience different inflation rates, and (c) the exchange rates between currencies fluctuate through time. The model is, accordingly, extended to cope with <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> purchased from a foreign country by adding: (1) the price increase of the asset in a foreign market, and (2) the changes in the exchange rates between currencies as two vital dimensions in the model. Each of the following situations involving foreign exchange and acquisition of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> from another country is analyzed under the extended model: (1) forward exchange rate with fixed or certain prices, (2) forward exchange rate with uncertain changing prices, and (3) current spot trade with uncertain changing prices. ...|$|E

40|$|Investors in <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> {{used in a}} {{trade or}} {{business}} claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all gains on sales of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on sales of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets</b> again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of <b>depreciable</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the historiography of {{defining}} amortization {{as the source of}} further reproduction and creation due to the amortization of sinking funds, used by economic entities for future capital investments. Acting as the source of capital investments, sinking funds were established during the socialist era, {{as well as in the}} post-Soviet period, that is before the beginning of the 21 st century. However, starting from 2010, economic entities no longer have been creating sinking funds on the balance sheet and outside it, that corresponds to the international practice, in particular the rules and principles of International Financial Reporting Standards. The author proves that the amortization, recoverable in the price of goods (works, services), is the reimbursement of the past, not future expenditures. Accordingly, the sinking funds, as the source of future investments, cannot be made at the expenses of amortization charges. At the same time, the author analyzes the possible consequences of the legal right of enterprises to unchanged amortization installments in the reporting period with the extension of the life of <b>depreciable</b> fixed <b>assets</b> for the period when no amortization charges were calculated...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{and general}} exclusions, along with {{assessment}} practices, {{have made the}} personal property share of the general property tax base now smaller {{than at any time}} since the assumption of homogeneity emerged in the early 19 th century. Of the types of tangible and intangible personal property, only business <b>depreciable</b> fixed <b>assets</b> remain taxable in a majority of states. Evidence indicates that removing personal property from the base, rather than crippling fiscal capacity, permits higher property taxation possibly because governments feel less constrained by interstate competition after extracting a physically mobile element from the base, possibly because an inequity has been removed (arguments for personal property taxation being less clear than for real property), or possibly because businesses become less vigilant when this property is excluded. Because uniform taxation of all real and personal property may have significant logical and practical problems leading to personal property exclusion, separate state taxation of such property may be appropriate. Governments in the United States collected $ 142. 5 billion in fiscal 1989 from property taxes, $ 137. 1 billion of that going to local governments (U. S. Bureau of the Census 1990, 2). The taxes have survived the property tax revolt of the 1970 s, antitax sentiment of the 1980 s, and 20 years of ranking with the federal income tax as the &dquo;worst tax&dquo; in the annual Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (1990) poll of public attitude.
