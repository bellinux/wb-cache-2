40|$|International audienceWith the {{ever-increasing}} {{volume of}} polymer wastes and their associated detrimental {{impacts on the}} environment, the plastic life cycle has drawn increasing attention. Here, eight commercial polymers selected from biodegradable to environmentally persistent materials, all formulated under a credit card format, were incubated in an outdoor compost to evaluate their fate over time and to profile the microbial communities colonizing their surfaces. After 450 days in compost, the samples were all colonized by multispecies biofilms, these latest displaying different amounts of adhered microbial biomass and significantly distinct bacterial and fungal community compositions depending on the substrate. Interestingly, colonization experiments on the eight polymers revealed a large core of shared microbial taxa, predominantly composed of microorganisms previously reported from environments contaminated with petroleum <b>hydrocarbons</b> or <b>plastics</b> debris. These observations suggest that biofilms {{may contribute to the}} alteration process of all the polymers studied. Actually, four substrates, independently of their assignment to a polymer group, displayed a significant deterioration, which might be attributed to biologically mediated mechanisms. Relevantly, the deterioration appears strongly associated with the formation of a high-cell density biofilm onto the polymer surfaces. The analysis of various surface properties revealed that roughness and hydrophilicity are likely prominent parameters for driving the biological interactions with the polymers...|$|R

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to have an Anthropocene body? The Anthropocene {{period is}} putatively defined by flows of {{hydrocarbons}} and <b>hydrocarbon</b> derivatives (fuels, <b>plastics,</b> fertilizers, etc.), and the very term ‘Anthropocene’ suggests an increasing awareness of the finitude and contingency of contemporary corporealities. This article explores the idea of modelling an Anthropocene body as a living/non-living metabolic process. While identifying bodies with molecules raises a host of problems, metabolism and hydrocarbon biomolecules display a gamut of forms of possession and ways of having a body. Conversion between living and non-living forms of possession can be traced in contemporary genomic science and particularly in synthetic biology as they engineer microbes to produce next-generation biofuels. In contrast to fossil fuels, these fuels derive from genomically re-engineered microbes that digest biomass or photosynthesize to produce hydrocarbons. The problematic contemporary production of these fuels might help us to articulate what it means to have a body as a metabolic manifold of living and non-living forms of possession...|$|R

Commuting and traveling, building and fixing the house, mowing the lawn, etc., are all feasible with petroleum generated energy. Many of the products that we use are made from petroleum <b>hydrocarbons.</b> Hospital syringes, <b>plastic</b> bags, food containers, computers, etc., are things that are all or partly made with petroleum products and we take them for granted. Control of petroleum resources has led to long eras of cold wars between nations and in some cases has led to disastrous conflicts. During any regional conflict, the environment is the last thing that the warring sides focus their attention on. The destruction of terrain, crops or the entire ecosystem is a military tactic practiced from ancient times. When large oil fields are shared among two or more countries, there is always a heated rivalry between neighboring countries to extract the maximum possible petroleum from the shared ground. Here, again, the environment falls victim to the abuse of Earth resources.

40|$|International audienceThe {{automobile}} {{shredder residues}} “ASR” represents a heterogeneous material generated during the shredding {{process of the}} end-of-life vehicles “ELV”. The ASR, while reactive enough to be classified as hazardous waste, could {{be considered as a}} source of energy and reducing agents, since it contains an appreciated combustible <b>hydrocarbon</b> matter, especially <b>plastics.</b> In this context, the present work provides an alternative approach for the thermal valorization of the ASR in iron and steel making operations. Plastics and ASR samples from an European automobile shredder company were collected and their thermal behaviors were studied at temperatures lower than and or equal to 900 °C. Appropriated mixtures of these samples with iron oxides were isothermally treated between 300 °C and 1050 °C for different reaction times. Initial samples as well as solid reaction products were subjected to different analysis methods. The direct reduction of hematite into metallic iron, at 1000 - 1050 °C, by <b>plastics</b> and ASR <b>hydrocarbons</b> was proved. The reduction steps, the possible reaction mechanisms and the behavior of several tramp and harmful elements were also discussed. Experimental results and thermodynamic predictions suggest that the thermal route can be a promised choice for the valorization of the wasted organic materials. Thermal processing overcome the difficulties and costly operations related to the ultimate removal of lead, zinc and copper compounds by physical means from these wastes.

40|$|Plastic has {{achieved}} such an extensive market due to {{fact that it}} is lightweight, cheap, flexible and reusable. But now it is regarded as a serious hazard. All recommendation for and against plastics finally land up on the reality that plastics are slow to degrade. By the end of the 20 th century, plastics are found as persistent polluters of many environmental niches, from Mount Everest {{to the bottom of the}} sea. There are numerous ways by which plastic pollution can be controlled. Pyrolysis is referred to as polymer cracking and its main advantages are that it can deal with plastic waste. This paper provides an overview of the science and technology of pyrolysis of waste plastics. The major advantage of the pyrolysis technology is its ability to handle unsorted, unwashed plastic. The production of gasoline, kerosene and diesel from waste plastics is an emerging technological solution to the vast amount of plastics that cannot be economically recovered by conventional mechanical recycling. The disposal and decomposition of plastics has been an issue which has caused a number of research works to be carried out in this regard. Currently, the paper reviews the production of Petroleum-based fuel viz. gasoline, kerosene and diesel from recycling of waste plastics is an emerging technological solution to the vast amount of plastic wastes that cannot be economically recovered by conventional mechanical recycling operations.

40|$|Organic {{contamination}} of sedimentary rocks can produce artefacts {{in studies of}} hydrocarbon composition, and this can have significant negative consequences for interpretations of the geobiological record. False positives - that is cases of non-syngenetic hydrocarbon biomarkers - are common in Precambrian studies, and significant challenges persist despite the intensive effort devoted to these studies. Efforts to standardize the 'burden of proof' for distinguishing between contamination and syngenetic material have to date failed to yield a simple or universal protocol, yet the need remains great, as both bitumen-lean rocks and bitumen-rich samples can be vulnerable to the accumulation of false-positive signals. In an effort {{to determine the best}} approach to quality control, we tested the capability of different blank materials to collect ambient contamination by assessing their capacity to adsorb hydrocarbons during storage in plastic bags and found that commonly used Quartz sand does not provide an adequate measure of storage- or laboratory-induced contamination. Brick blanks, having the advantage that they can parallel rock samples even during the sawing process, are characterized by similar poor adsorption properties. Primarily steered by mineralogy, organic carbon content and surface area, model-black shales can adsorb up to 20 times more contaminants than sand blanks and up to 200 times more contaminants than organic-free model-carbonates. This observation provides an explanation for reports and observations of seemingly systematic stratigraphic variation of contaminants, but mostly should raise awareness for the evaluation of procedural blanks, in particular of sample-to-blank ratios, when studying bitumen-lean rock samples of varying lithologies. Additionally, differences between the <b>hydrocarbon</b> profiles in <b>plastic</b> bags and the hydrocarbon signatures transferred to blank materials emphasize difficulties in the unequivocal detection of contamination sources. Artificial black shale pellets can provide enhanced contamination control in biomarker studies - particularly for exceptionally vulnerable samples such as Precambrian rocks, meteorites or extraterrestrial sample-return material...|$|R
40|$|Plastic is an {{indispensable}} {{part of our}} daily life. Its production and consumption has been rising very rapidly due to its wide range of application. Due to its non biodegradable nature it cannot be easily disposed off. So, nowadays new technology {{is being used to}} treat the waste plasic. One of such process is pyrolysis. This paper describes non catalytic pyrolysis and catalytic cracking of plastic wastes into useful gasoline range hydrocarbons. Under the pyrolytic and cracking conditions the plastic wastes can be decomposed into three fractions: gas, liquid and solid residue. Here the main consideration is the recovery of liquid products which are composed of higher boiling point <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The waste <b>plastics</b> consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolyzed in this study. Pyrolysis appears to be a technique that is able to reduce a bulky, high polluting industrial waste while producing energy and/or valuable chemical compounds. The pyrolysis of plastic wastes produces a whole spectrum of hydrocarbons including paraffins, olefins, naphthalenes and aromatics. By catalytic cracking more aromatics and naphthene in the range of C 6 -C 8 which are valuable gasoline range hydrocarbons can be produced. Different catalysts like Silica Alumina, Modernite and Activated Carbon were used for catalytic cracking. The catalysts were used in different ratios with feed to find out the optimum range at which maximum yield occurs. The liquid product yield is about 60 % in all the cases. In thermal pyrolysis, the product obtained gets solidified but in catalytic cracking good liquid product can be obtained which can be used as fuel. This application is further combined with technologies of municipal plastic wastes collection, classification and pretreatment at front end and product purification and testing at back end to determine the properties of the various products obtained...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1800 s {{the range of}} {{synthesized}} chemicals has increased dramatically to include pesticides, <b>plastics,</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels, soaps, detergents and other useful substances. The effects in the environment are result of a sequence of processes that depend on the properties of individual chemical. DDT {{has been the focus}} of a large amount of early research due to its effects on the endocrine system leading to egg shell thinning and reduced breeding in birds. DDT is a member of chlorohydrocarbons, a family of chemically related insecticides. Chlorohydrocarbons are highly toxic to aquatic organisms, persistent, soluble in fat and have very low solubility in water. They move from water to animals with a large increase in concentration by a process described as bioaccumulation. This group, banned from use in many countries, includes industrial chemicals such as PCBs and combustion products like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and furans. In terms of used quantities herbicides are of major importance but their properties differ significantly from chlorohydrocarbons. Herbicides are relatively water soluble but less soluble in fat and less persistent. Thus they don't bioaccumulate and are less toxic having a much lower impact in the environment. Organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethrins and pyrethroids also have, in general, low solubility in fat, relatively high solubility in water but low persistence and are not bioaccumulative. Members of this group can be highly toxic to biota including mammals and aquatic organisms but overall their environmental effects are usually low. Soaps and detergents, containing surfactants, have relatively low toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation. Although discharged to environment in large quantities their effects are generally low. Plastics differ from other contaminants since these substances enter environment as solid wastes with little toxicity but have other adverse environmental effects. The management of these effects relates to their degradation and removal from the system. No Full Tex...|$|R

The {{first chapter}} {{analyses}} {{the state of}} the art on plastic production and mainsectors of application, and on generation of plastic wastes, focused on theenvironmental problem generated by uncontrolled dumping and the differentalternatives and processes, at the research or industrial stage, proposed for themanagement and valorization of plastic wastes. Pyrolysis has been found to be one of the most common strategies to produceliquid <b>hydrocarbons</b> from <b>plastic</b> wastes. However, the oil product obtained requiresupgrading through hydrotreatment to be used as a fuel. Catalytic hydrocracking isproposed as an alternative treatment to pyrolysis and hydrotreatment, in a singlestage. In a previous work, the conditions of catalytic hydrocracking of PS forworking under kinetic control were established, and the kinetic model wasproposed. Hydrocracking of plastics has been carried out in a three-phase stirred reactorunder kinetic control with bifunctional catalysts in slurry and hydrogen pressure. Bifunctional Pt/zeolite catalysts have been prepared and characterized, in order toestablish a relationship between properties and performance. Several virginplastics and plastic wastes have been characterized and tested, so that theirbehavior in reaction can be related to their composition. The required experimentalequipments and procedures used all over the work for reaction, preparation andcharacterization are described in detail in Chapter 2. Chapters 3 and 4 have been devoted to optimization of the bifunctional catalyst forhydrocracking of plastics, using virgin PS as the base polymer for comparison. InChapter 3, the effect of the acid properties of the zeolitic supports on activity andselectivity has been studied; the acid properties of the supports have beenmodified by either dealumination or desilication. On the other hand, optimization of the metallic function has been studied inChapter 4, where the effect of platinum content and preparation procedure onactivity and selectivity has been analyzed. Platinum contents in the range 0. 1 ¿ 1. 0 wt. % and prepared by either ionic exchange or impregnation on HBeta zeolitehave been studied. Plastic wastes are composed by a mixture of different polymeric materials. Hence,once catalyst was optimized for PS, its performance in hydrocracking with otherpolymeric materials was studied. In Chapter 5, common polymers with only carbonand hydrogen atoms in their composition, such as PB and HIPS, were chosen. HIPS, besides, is composed by a mixture of PS and PB. Thus, the effect of mixturehas been also analyzed. Thermal hydrocracking experiments were also carried outfor comparison. Hydrocracking of more complex polymers has been studied in Chapter 6. Polymersin plastic wastes are not only composed of carbon and hydrogen. Thus, ABS, withalso nitrogen, has been first studied. ABS, besides, is composed of PS, PB andPAN, and the effect of mixture can be also analyzed. Additionally, halogens arecommonly found in plastic wastes, either in the polymer molecules or in additivessuch as flame retardants. Thus, a residual ABS, with additives and fillers, has beenalso studied in Chapter 6. The effect of pressure, temperature and concentration ofpolymer has been analyzed, mainly focused on the yield to gasoline and itscomposition. Actual, more complex, plastic wastes have been also studied in Chapter 6. Plasticwastes from cellular phones (CP) have been chosen because of their content ofABS and complexity, focused also in the yield to gasoline and its composition. Plastic wastes with a high content of inorganic components, such as many of thewastes from electrical and electronic equipment, are not suitable for catalytichydrocracking. Thus, steam gasification to produce hydrogen has been proposedand studied as an alternative valorization process in Chapter 7, applied to phenolicboards, the main plastic component in printed circuits. Electronic wastes usually include a significant amount of metals in theircomposition. These metals could act as catalysts in steam reforming of theplastics. This catalytic effect has been also studied, with nickel or tantalumcapacitors (TC). The catalytic effect of the presence of molten carbonates in avessel together with the wastes was the object of a previous study. In this work, thecombined effect of nickel and molten carbonates has been also analyzed.
