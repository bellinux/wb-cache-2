5|$|Scottish {{religion}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century {{includes all}} forms of religious organisation and belief in Scotland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. This period saw {{the beginnings of a}} fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E

5|$|After the Reformation, and the {{departure}} of the Scottish court in 1603, artists and artisans looked to secular patronage and estate houses became repositories of art and of elaborate furnishings. Estate houses were adorned with paintings, wood carvings and plasterwork. The Grand Tour encouraged the collection of classical art and the adoption of classical styles for new works that were incorporated into the Adam Style. The Baronial revival resulted a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, symbols of landed power and national affiliation with modern fittings. From the late sixteenth century, many estate houses were surrounded by gardens influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From the late seventeenth century the formal gardens at Versailles and Dutch gardens were important models. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century less formal and symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the jardin anglais. In the nineteenth century there was a return of the formal garden near to the house. The development of the Palladian country house in the seventeenth century separated the family of the householder from the servants. Gentry families spent much of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours and hospitality was an important part of life. Major activities included hunting, cards, chess and music. Large and sumptuous meals were an important part of social life. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, estate houses were designed as centres of public display, but in the nineteenth century they became increasingly private and developed distinct male areas.|$|E
5|$|Among the Tlingit of the Pacific Northwest of America, {{earrings}} were {{a sign of}} nobility and wealth, as {{the placement}} of each earring on a child had to be purchased at an expensive potlatch. Earrings were common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> dynasty of Egypt (1550â€“1292 BCE), generally taking {{the form of a}} dangling, gold hoop. Gem-studded, golden earrings shaped like asps seem to have been reserved for nobility. The ancient Greeks wore paste pendant earrings shaped like sacred birds or demigods, while the women of ancient Rome wore precious gemstones in their ears.|$|E
5|$|Artists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's {{rendition of the}} weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E

5|$|Beyond Julian Park, it {{has been}} conjectured that the {{structure}} originally continued to the Roman garrison fort at Lease Rigg, south west of Sleights, based on reports from antiquarians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> and nineteenth centuries that fragments were visible at numerous points along this course. Hayes and Rutter appear confident of the structure's extent as far as Lease Rigg, but admit that its extent is conjectural from well short of that point, from Dowson Garth Quarry northwards.|$|E
5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and {{tended to be more}} {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this.

The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were drained and Ely ceased to be an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century. The river is now a popular boating spot, and has a large marina.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first studied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> {{century and the}} first serious field research was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, {{with an emphasis on}} establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E
5|$|In 756, Ã“engus {{is found}} campaigning {{alongside}} Eadberht of Northumbria.

5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December.

He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of the}} enigmatic history of the York lodges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighteenth</b> century.
