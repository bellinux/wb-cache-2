5|$|Briseis, {{at least}} for now, is equally {{affected}} {{by the possibility of}} separation from her lover. Troilus goes to her room and they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to hand her over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E

5|$|The miraculous {{story of}} the first known parishioner of the town, Bricstan, is {{documented}} in the Historia Ecclesiastica by the Chronicler Orderic Vitalis (1075 – c.1142). According to the legend, Bricstan was a pious free tenant from the town who had joined the monastery at Ely Cathedral in 1115 to begin training as a monk. However, {{he was accused of}} theft and imprisoned in London. The legend recounts that one night he had a vision of Saint Etheldreda coming towards him, and as if by a miracle, his heavy chains fell from him and he was shackled no longer. When he awoke from his dream, he discovered that this was indeed true and he was free of his chains. The wife of Henry I, Matilda of Scotland, heard of the miracle, and she assured <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> he was no rogue or thief, issued a writ of pardon and declared him a free man.|$|E

As a result, Riley and Mitzeee's relationship {{comes to an end}} and Riley and Mercedes get back together. Mitzeee is sentenced to seven years in prison for her actions, however when she notices Mercedes smiling at her as she is being sentenced, she realises her own innocence. Myra discovers that Mercedes had framed Mitzeee although doesn't tell anyone. Mitzeee goes insane in prison knowing that she is innocent and is transferred to a psychiatric unit. Mitzeee escapes from the psychiatric hospital where she confronts Mercedes and threatens her with a knife although leaves before Mercedes can call the police. Carl returns and attempts to persuade Riley not to marry Mercedes. Mercedes hears a conversation between Riley and Carl in which Riley admits that he does not love Mercedes and that he recently had sex with Mitzeee. Angered, Mercedes kidnaps Bobby in an attempt to punish Riley and lies to the police that Mitzeee has kidnapped him. Mercedes pays Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{to be part of the}} scam and look after Bobby in a secret flat. Mercedes sends a letter to Riley asking for £500,000 ransom money in exchange for Bobby. When dropping off the ransom money, Riley sees Mercedes and realises that she is behind the kidnap. Phoebe exposes Mercedes and tells Riley the truth. Mercedes takes Bobby to the rooftop of a building, threatening to throw herself and Bobby off. Mercedes eventually gives Bobby to Riley and she agrees to leave with the ransom money. They return to the McQueen household where Mercedes' involvement in the kidnap is revealed by Phoebe. Myra then exposes Mercedes for having stabbed herself and framed Mitzeee, and calls the police. Moments later, Riley is shot dead by Simon Walker (Neil Newbon). In prison, Mercedes shows further signs of mental illness, denying to <b>herself</b> <b>that</b> Riley has died. Mercedes is later taken to a psychiatric hospital. Doctor Browning pleads innocent in his trial. When Myra visits Mercedes, Mercedes appears distressed and asks Myra to help her. Myra contacts lawyer Jim McGinn (Dan Tetsell). At the trial, Jim suggests Riley was abusive towards Mercedes and stabbed her and forced her to frame Mitzeee. He also suggests that Lynsey knew of this so Riley killed her. Mercedes backs up the claims and tells the courtroom that Riley had threatened to kill her so she kidnapped Bobby to protect him from Riley. The jury give a not guilty verdict for both charges of perverting the course of justice and Mercedes is released. Myra tells Mercedes she can not come home as she needs to learn her lesson and instead tells her to move into Jacqui's old flat that has recently been flooded.|$|E

25|$|Sedgwick and Frank's {{critique}} of Cvetkovich's first book, however, is merely {{used as a}} way to challenge the “hygiene of…antiessentialism” in poststructuralist theory. In a footnote, they state that there are numerous other theorists (including Sedgwick <b>herself)</b> <b>that</b> are more steeped in the “routines of theory” of which they accuse Cvetkovich, and who are “more directly responsible for their popularization.” However, they chose to critique Cvetkovich's book because using a new scholar's work would allow them to more “effectively defamiliarize” the “critical practices” they are challenging.|$|E
