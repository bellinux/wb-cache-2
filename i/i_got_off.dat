500|$|In 2017, Durant became {{involved}} with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement. On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, [...] "I'm so excited because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> social media. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube." [...] As of April 26, 2017, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 100,000 subscribers and one million video views.|$|E
500|$|After she {{graduated}} from high school, Sanders left her foster parents' home in Detroit to study at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University), a historically black college in Alabama that was Lorenzo Malloy's alma mater. She intended to earn a degree in education and become a teacher. When she left Detroit to go to Alabama, her foster mother stood {{at the train station}} crying. Shabazz later recalled that Malloy was trying to mumble something, but the words would not come out. By the time she arrived in Alabama, she felt she knew what her foster mother was saying. [...] "The minute <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> that train, I knew what she was trying to say. She was trying to tell me in ten words or less about racism." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Piłsudski {{believed}} that {{as head of}} state he must be above partisan politics. The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as [...] "Comrade" [...] ("Towarzysz") and asked his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: [...] "Comrades, I took the red streetcar of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off.</b> You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as 'Mister' !" [...] He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government. He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{might keep}} me in a strait-waistcoat for six weeks,' said Nipper, 'and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it <b>off</b> I'd only be more aggravated, who ever heard the like of them two Griffins, Mrs Richards?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently, however, Kaptein {{began to}} get restless. First he snorted, then {{he got up and}} snorted again. I could not make it out, so like a fool <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>off</b> the waggon-box to have a look round, {{thinking}} it might be the lost oxen coming.|$|R

500|$|Following the 1993 {{release of}} her third album, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, McLachlan spent {{two and a}} half years touring. This long period on the road {{finished}} in January 1996; she was due to begin work on her fourth album in April of that year, but was mentally exhausted. She later said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the road, I thought Fumbling was my swan song, [...] I'd never make another record ever again. I couldn't imagine writing another song in my life. I had a huge psychological block for a long time." [...] She spent time working in the studio in Quebec but struggled to produce anything for her new album. At her manager's suggestion, she returned home to Vancouver and took six months off. She said that after this break—and some time spent in therapy—she began to feel more in control of her creativity and started writing material for the album.|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, {{he married}} American {{psychotherapist}} Alyce Faye Eichelberger. They divorced in 2008. The divorce settlement left Eichelberger with £12million in finance and assets, including £600,000 {{a year for}} seven years. Cleese said, [...] "What I find so unfair {{is that if we}} both died today, her children would get much more than mine ... <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship — such as children, or a conversation." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{song for}} which Barry is {{particularly}} noted is [...] "She Moved Through the Fair". Asked by an interviewer, Karl Dallas, {{whether she had}} learned it from her family or from other Travellers, she replied cheerfully, [...] "Oh, no. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it <b>off</b> a gramophone record by Count John McCormack".|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he never}} went--I--I mean he got caught--put in jail again. Matthews sent for the officers. They came. And they said they'd put Blake away for ten years. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>off...</b> Then Lucy {{was willing to}} marry me--and she did. There's no help for it now... too late." ...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{had a more}} hard edged sound {{than the}} Impressions had before. On this new sound Mayfield claimed it was {{something}} he [...] "long wanted to do...but were out of category of what was expected of me and the Impressions. What <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> in the Curtis album allowed me to be more personal for myself.". The two singles off the album [...] "(Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go" [...] and [...] "Move on Up" [...] showcased Mayfield's new funk musical style, {{while the rest of the}} tracks were much softer soul based songs. Not having any traditional music lessons, Mayfield claimed his backing band would occasionly comment [...] "gosh, this is a terribly strange key to play in", but still played it accordingly as written. According to Joseph L. Tirabassi of Tiny Mix Tapes, [...] "We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue" [...] exemplified the [...] "gliding soul" [...] and [...] "hard-hitting funk" [...] the rest of the album veered between.|$|E
2500|$|And in {{the same}} year, Gibb was seen around town with a Hungarian singer Sarolta Zalatnay, but he later insisted: [...] "I'm not a Casanova and it's all most unfortunate. I've never been publicised to be available. Because of the stories of my affairs with Lulu and Sarolta, the fans feel, 'Oh, we won't bother about Maurice because he's always got a steady girl'. Gibb {{recalled}} the first meeting with his future-in-laws, [...] "I went up to Glasgow to meet Lu's parents, and I was told that Billy, who is younger than Lu, {{would be at the}} station to meet me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the train and was walking along the platform when I saw him. I didn't need to speak, I knew it was Billy and I went up to him and said, 'You're Billy, aren't you?', he said, 'You must be Maurice' and we had met". The couple married on 18 February 1969 and divorced in 1973. Their careers and his heavy drinking forced them apart and they divorced, childless, in 1973. [...] Gibb later stated they both drank: [...] "We didn't have any responsibilities, we'd just party." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what I thought," [...] {{said his}} niece, [...] "but it wasn’t, because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> her <b>off</b> at last and searched it through and through. I never saw {{anything}} like her clothes {{in all my}} life. There was hardly a button or a tape on; and as for her stockings—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} come back, mother, unless this is cleared up. You must feel {{as well as}} I do, that I cannot show my face anywhere. I am {{surprised}} that <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>off</b> myself, and indeed {{if it were not}} that I am sure <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> my horse that night, I should sometimes suspect that I must for a time have been really mad and have done what they accuse me of. I have already sent down a detective to the village. There must be some clue to all this if one could only hit upon it, but I own that at present I do not see where it is to be looked for. I do not believe that it was done by some passing tramp. I agree with every word that was said at my trial in that respect.|$|R
6000|$|... "But that's--I've {{been feeling}} so jumpy lately, I thought maybe {{it might be}} a good thing if <b>I</b> kind of <b>got</b> <b>off</b> by myself and sweat it out of me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he replied, despondently. [...] "Awhile back <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my mind <b>off</b> the game. Then--people who don't like me {{have taken}} {{advantage}} of my slump to----" ...|$|R
5000|$|Richard Shelter was {{the first}} {{promoter}} to bring punk and hardcore to the Cameo.

6000|$|... "Ah--very good on 'im! I wonder them fellows has {{the cheek}} to ask fees for on'y givin' advice.

6000|$|... "Bank drafts for two millions," [...] was his summing up, [...] "and a {{thousand}} a day piling {{up from my}} claims. And now I want some beef stew and canned peaches. <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the train since I mushed out of Seattle, and I'm hungry. The stuff the niggers feed you on Pullmans don't count.

60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>off</b> {{the watch}} {{by this time}} {{and laid it on}} the table, unobserved, as I thought.

He did not look in the least ogreish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dandy's a darling, and wouldn't do {{anything}} of the sort if you asked him to. He's a kind little 'oss, as Thomas says. He only walked away when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>off</b> to pick some roses, and I couldn't catch him. And then I met Jimmy." ...|$|E

5000|$|After being {{diagnosed}} with AIDS, Nicols decided that he couldn't be quiet about his illness any longer.
