Though he has not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as an advisor and full-time after his son {{graduated from high school}} in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal {{humanoid}} race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his race will be revived. Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the 2011 reboot, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E

5|$|Coming off {{the back}} of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 {{campaign}} with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|E
5|$|As expected, the Australian team's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller, {{retired from}} cricket after the tour. Harvey {{replaced}} Johnson as Victorian captain {{and was the}} logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy, as the most experienced {{member of the team}} (48 Tests). Queensland's captain, the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall, was no longer an automatic Test selection. However, both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy, which went to Ian Craig, who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper. Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> establish himself in the team. After several disappointing results against England, the selectors chose a youthful team. Harvey was named vice-captain to Craig for both the 1956–57 non-Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957–58 Test tour to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation. Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E

5|$|Born in Reading, Berkshire {{and educated}} at Uppingham School, Chapman {{established}} {{a reputation as}} a talented school cricketer and was named one of Wisden's schoolboy Cricketers of the Year in 1919. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge and represented the University cricket team with great success; his fame reached a peak when he scored centuries against Oxford University and in the Gentlemen v Players match within the space of a week. Chapman made his Test debut in 1924, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> play County Cricket. Having qualified for Kent, he was the surprise choice to take over from Arthur Carr as England captain in 1926. He achieved victory in his first nine matches in charge but lost two and drew six of his remaining games. Perceived tactical deficiencies and possibly growing concerns over his heavy drinking meant that Chapman was dropped from the team for the fifth Test against Australia in 1930. He captained England on one final tour in 1930–31, after which he never played another Test. After he assumed the Kent captaincy in 1931, his career and physique declined until he resigned the position in 1936; he retired altogether in 1939, by which time he was drinking heavily.|$|E

25|$|Born in Herning, Riis began cycling {{at local}} club Herning CK. When {{he was not}} {{selected}} for the 1984 Summer Olympics, former cyclist Kim Andersen advised Riis to start his professional career not in Italy, but in Luxembourg. His professional career started in 1986, his first result was a fifth-place finish in the GP Wallonie that year. Following a few years with no personal wins, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> impress when his contract ran out in 1988.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to the U.S. from Europe, Reeve chose to focus solely on acting, although Cornell University had several general education requirements for graduation that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> complete. He managed to convince theater director Jim Clause and {{the dean of the}} College of Arts and Sciences that, as a theater major, he would achieve more at Juilliard (Group 4, 1973–1975), than at Cornell. They agreed that his first year at Juilliard would be counted as his senior year at Cornell.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} of his successes against India, against whom he took his wickets at an average of 18. This put him in a small group of spinners whose career averages were {{inferior}} to their performances against India, generally regarded as the best players of spin in the world. At this stage of his career, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> perform consistently with bat and ball simultaneously, apart from his breakthrough series in the Caribbean.

25|$|Richardson's Quaker beliefs entailed {{an ardent}} pacifism that {{exempted}} him from military service during World War I as a conscientious objector, though this subsequently disqualified him from having any academic post. Richardson worked from 1916 to 1919 for the Friends' Ambulance Unit {{attached to the}} 16th French Infantry Division. After the war, he rejoined the Meteorological Office but was compelled to resign on grounds of conscience when it was amalgamated into the Air Ministry in 1920. He subsequently pursued a career {{on the fringes of}} the academic world before retiring in 1940 to research his own ideas. His pacifism had direct consequences on his research interests. According to Thomas Körner, the discovery that his meteorological work was of value to chemical weapons designers caused him to abandon all his efforts in this field, and destroy findings that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> publish.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey won a Heath Harrison Exhibition {{award and}} a place at Brasenose College at Oxford University to study {{geography}} {{in the autumn of}} 1951. He played for the Oxford University Cricket Club in 1952 and 1953 {{at the start of the}} season and the rest of the summer for Kent. He made 50 and 57 for the Gentlemen vs the 1953 Australians at Lords. In 1954 he captained Oxford University and was a surprise choice for the MCC tour of Australia, replacing Willie Watson. Len Hutton later told him that his selection was a gamble, but it was thought that his technique would be good on the hard Australian wickets. At 21, Cowdrey was the youngest man in the side and the schoolboy photographs used in the brochures made him appear younger. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make a century in the County Championship, go on tour or play a Test, though he was made twelfth man for the Fourth Test against Pakistan and fielded for 20 minutes, but was so nervous he could barely watch.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007–08 season, Edgar voiced {{his concern}} at {{his lack of}} first team soccer at Newcastle, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make any senior {{appearances}} despite being the reserve team captain. Towards {{the end of the}} season he was given a run of games in the first team and was praised by manager Kevin Keegan for his performance against Reading. On May 5, 2007 he signed a contract with Newcastle that kept him at the club until 2009. In April 2008 Edgar stated his belief that he needed to bulk up to compete in the Premier League, after facing players like Dean Ashton. On December 28, 2008, Edgar scored his second goal for the club in a 5–1 loss against Liverpool. On May 24, 2009, he was sent off in the last minute of the final game of the season against Aston Villa, a game that Newcastle lost 1–0, thus confirming their relegation from the Premier League. After a season in which Newcastle failed to win a single match that Edgar featured in– 11 losses and 2 draws in his 13 games– Edgar rejected a contract offered by Newcastle and consequently left the club.|$|E

25|$|The last {{match of}} the tour and the swansong of the AIF team was played 31 January to 3 February at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) against New South Wales (NSW) and the AIF won by 203 runs. The AIF batted first and Gregory opened against his home state, for whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> make his debut, and scored 122. They totalled 185 for three {{at the end of}} day one and went to 265 all out. Gregory batted for 170 minutes and hit {{nineteen}} boundaries. Bill Trenerry's brother Edwin was playing for NSW. NSW managed a slender first innings lead thanks to Test players Warren Bardsley and Stork Hendry who added 121 for the second wicket. Gregory followed his century with five for 65. In the second innings, Collins scored 129 and Gregory again reached three figures with 101 in 102 minutes with sixteen boundaries. Like Gregory, Collins was opposing his home state. The AIF totalled 395 to lead by 381 with nearly all the third day still to be played. NSW had no real hope of winning and collapsed instead, scoring 178 in 200 minutes with only Tommy Andrews offering any real resistance. He scored 65 and Gregory, looking for a match double, had to be content with three for 65.|$|E
25|$|Oak Hill Academy {{entered the}} 2001–02 {{campaign}} boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP. Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final, and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, {{where he was}} matched up with high school phenom LeBron James. James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win. The team ended the season ranked third {{in the country at}} 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67. He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill and named a USA Today All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American. He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the Sprite Slam Jam dunk contest. His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002, ranked 2nd by College Basketball News and 3rd by All-Star Sports. Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse. In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012.|$|E
