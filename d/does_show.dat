5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data <b>does</b> <b>show</b> some differentiation between the island populations. These {{data suggest that}} the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a brown or black radial band called a varix. This appears to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus <b>does</b> <b>show</b> evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{based on}} evidence from ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA sequence data have not confirmed that Leucopholiota decorosa belongs in the Tricholomataceae family. However, the analysis <b>does</b> <b>show</b> it to be phylogenetically related to Phaeolepiota aurea, a species of unclear status in the Agaricales, and it confirms that L.decorosa does not belong in the family Agaricaceae. According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales. This tribe also contains the genera Catathelasma and Armillaria.|$|E

5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she <b>does</b> <b>show</b> excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is a {{chemical}} element with symbol La and atomic number 57. It is a soft, ductile, silvery-white metal that tarnishes rapidly {{when exposed to}} air and is soft enough to be cut with a knife. It is the eponym of the lanthanide series, a group of 15 similar elements between lanthanum and lutetium in the periodic table, of which lanthanum is {{the first and the}} prototype. It is also sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals and is traditionally counted among the rare earth elements. The usual oxidation state is +3. Lanthanum has no biological role in humans but is essential to some bacteria. It is not particularly toxic to humans but <b>does</b> <b>show</b> some antimicrobial activity.|$|E
5|$|US8 {{was created}} with the {{beginnings}} of the United States Numbered Highway System on November 26, 1926. The highway was originally shown on maps running between Forest Lake, Minnesota and Powers, Michigan. At the time, its planned routing was not previously designated as part of the State Trunkline Highway System in Michigan. The trunkline connection from Quinnesec south into Wisconsin was part of M-57, which met WIS57 at the state line. US8 ended at WIS57 in Pembine at the time, with no connection into Michigan shown on official maps. A map by the American Automobile Association <b>does</b> <b>show</b> the highway continuing east through Faithorn and Hermansville in Michigan to end at US2. The Wisconsin Highway Commission previously indicated an unnumbered state highway on their 1925 state map that connected Pembine with the Menominee River near Hermansville. A later extension in 1927 moved US8 to run along US141, which had replaced WIS57 and M-57, ending in Quinnesec at US2. By the next year, the highway was shifted to end in Norway, utilizing a separate crossing of the Menominee River to enter Michigan.|$|E

However, the first novel <b>does</b> <b>show</b> Cassady as frankly promiscuous. Kerouac's novels feature an interracial love affair (The Subterraneans), and group sex (The Dharma Bums). The relationships among men in Kerouac's novels are predominantly homosocial.|$|E

If the umpires of that match had halted play one ball earlier, England would have been ahead on D/L, and so would have won the match. Equally, if play had stopped one ball later, India could have won the match with a dot ball – indicating how finely-tuned D/L calculations can be in such situations.|$|E
