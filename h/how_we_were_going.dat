500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on {{and ready to go}} for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice that we saw them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Rihanna {{explained}} why {{she liked to}} collaborate with Minaj, saying [...] "She has a great buzz {{and she has a}} 'thing' to her. She is a star and that's why people love her. She's also really entertaining with her visual as well as her lyrics, and she has a great melody." [...] The singer continued to reveal how she was impressed with Minaj's songwriting abilities, saying [...] "I'm really amazed that she can write like that. [...] not only raps but she can write songs too... It was really easy actually. We were going back and forth with the texts on <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get to do it because we were in two different places and had two opposite schedules." [...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they sent me a record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy." [...] "Raining Men" [...] was sent for urban radio adds as the third single from Loud on December 7, 2010. On January 25, 2011, the song was re-released for urban radio adds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded {{in a room}} that the band nicknamed [...] "The War Room." [...] Bell states that [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{took a long time to}} record; [...] "I think the song 'The Greatest Man That Ever Lived' used about 20 feet of butcher paper and we discussed <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to successfully record it almost as long as actually recording it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It wasn't easy getting down, and I'd {{feel better}} if I knew just <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> back," [...] he said. [...] "I guess it's not quite wise either to bang that can about on the rocks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's an improvement," [...] Jack said. [...] "I {{was just}} {{wondering}} <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to sit on those things, which are not saddles at all, but only things for boxes and barrels to be fastened to." ...|$|E
60|$|We were puzzled for a while; then {{somebody}} {{thought of the}} ladders. One of these was leaned against the rock, and the men went up it tied together in couples. Another ladder was sent up for use in descending. At the end of half an hour everybody was over, and that rock was conquered. We gave our first grand shout of triumph. But the joy was short-lived, for somebody asked <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get the animals over.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, there! Don't {{think about}} it any more, Nellie-- at least, for to-day. Think of the jolly good time <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to defeat Roxley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to turn around," [...] {{said one}} of the other girls. [...] "The trees are too close to the sides of the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad, Tom, {{that you}} are not coming back next Fall," [...] went on Songbird, seriously. [...] "I don't know <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get along without you." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{morning was}} {{beautiful}} and fresh when we stood on the verandah, and the lagoon was like a sheet of multicoloured glass. Someone suggested a dip before going to bed, but none cared to bathe in the lagoon, sticky and treacherous to the feet. Miller had his car {{at the door and}} he offered to take us down to the pool. We jumped in and drove along the deserted road. When we reached the pool it seemed as though the day had hardly risen there yet. Under the trees the water was all in shadow and the night had the effect of lurking still. We were in great spirits. We had no towels or any costume and in my prudence I wondered <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to dry ourselves. None of us had much on and it did not take us long to snatch off our clothes. Nelson, the little supercargo, was stripped first.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stayed on}} deck to see <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to manage it}} with such a big ship and such a strong wind. On the bridge our giant captain, in uniform; at his side a little pilot in elaborately gold-laced uniform; on the {{forecastle}} a white mate and quartermaster or two, and a brilliant crowd of lascars standing by for business. Our stern was pointing straight {{at the head of}} the channel; so we must turn entirely around in the puddle--and the wind blowing as described. It was done, and beautifully. It was done by help of a jib. We stirred up much mud, but did not touch the bottom. We turned right around in our tracks--a seeming impossibility. We had several casts of quarter-less 5, and one cast of half 4--27 feet; we were drawing 26 astern. By the time we were entirely around and pointed, the first buoy was not more than a hundred yards in front of us. It was a fine piece of work, and I was the only passenger that saw it. However, the others got their dinner; the P. & O. Company got mine [...] . More cats developed. Smythe says it is a British law that they must be carried; and he instanced a case of a ship not allowed to sail till she sent for a couple. The bill came, too: [...] "Debtor, to 2 cats, 20 shillings." [...] . News comes that within this week Siam has acknowledged herself to be, in effect, a French province. It seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are going to be grabbed [...] . A vulture on board; bald, red, queer-shaped head, featherless red places here and there on his body, intense great black eyes set in featherless rims of inflamed flesh; dissipated look; a businesslike style, a selfish, conscienceless, murderous aspect--the very look of a professional assassin, and yet a bird which does no murder. What was the use of getting him up in that tragic style for so innocent a trade as his? For this one isn't the sort that wars upon the living, his diet is offal--and the more out of date it is the better he likes it. Nature should give him a suit of rusty black; then he would be all right, for he would look like an undertaker and would harmonize with his business; whereas the way he is now he is horribly out of true.|$|E

5000|$|The National Party's Daniel Malan, {{leader of}} the opposition, unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to amend the bill to prohibit Jewish immigration explicitly, to end the further naturalization of Jewish permanent residents of South Africa and to close certain professions from Jews and [...] "other non-assimilable races". Malan argued that Jews were getting the best jobs and that [...] "the Afrikaner is suffering in consequence". Arguing for his amendment, Malan said of Jews, [...] "Now the question arises with us, as a people, not only <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to keep them out}} in future, but <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to protect ourselves against those who are here." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{cool thing}} {{about using the}} Myth II engine from day one is that we already had a {{solution}} for <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make levels. We had the level designers immediately start cranking out levels. Because we had Tiki, and access to that, our modelers immediately started making 3D Studio Max models. Because we had all of these key components in place starting out, {{we were able to}} start asset production, and that's how I think we'll be able to ship a literally one-year project.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Alternative Ulster, the band told {{the story behind the}} album name. [...] "We got an endorsement from an amplifier company who looked after us for years, but their amps kept breaking. So we joked about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to write them a letter saying, ‘Dear such-and-such, thanks for all the great service and the amplifiers but we’re going to use this other brand now. Unfaithfully yours, General Fiasco’. As soon as we said it, it seemed to sum up everything that was going on with the band at the time." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the board of}} the Olin Foundation began to worry about the perpetuation of donor intent in {{subsequent}} generations.

[...] "With the escalation of building costs, would we be able to sustain that grant program? We were locked into what we had as a private foundation.
