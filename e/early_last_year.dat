5000|$|The {{residents}} of Hermosa Beach are very strongly {{divided on the}} merits of reversing its ban on oil drilling within the city limits. In the past year, the City of Hermosa Beach has held several public meetings on the project's EIR, as well as upon the health and economic impacts of the project. Advocates against oil drilling have rallied loudly against overturning the city's ban since <b>early</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> citing the inescapable health and environmental concerns attached to such a project. A local advocacy group, Keep Hermosa Hermosa, has actively campaigned against undoing the city's current law banning oil drilling, and has become a significant political advocacy group in the city. E&B promises a windfall in profits to the community and contends that it is able to mitigate the health, environmental, and aesthetic concerns of the community, though the EIR released in April 2014 demonstrates that not all of the community's concerns can be completely mitigated. The estimated revenue to the city is projected to be approximately $500 million or more, according to the oil company. [...] Some residents are concerned with the payback of the $17,500,000 loan to E&B if the project does not pass by the voters. It may be possible that {{it is for this reason}} that some residents are in favor of the project, though the city manager of the City of Hermosa Beach has also publicly stated that a vote [...] "no" [...] on this proposal will not bankrupt the city, as it has sizable cash reserves and an excellent credit rating.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1889, Fourcade {{left for}} Natal on his own, with {{a mandate to}} report on the {{condition}} of the indigenous forests on Crown or Trust lands; to advise on the feasibility of creating artificial forests and {{to report on the}} supply of timber for use by the railways. Upon arrival at Durban, he was met by the botanist John Medley Wood, who provided him with his analytical key of Natal plants, Colonel Bowker, a keen naturalist and writer, and Richard Vause, co-founder of the Natal Mercury paper and also past Mayor of Durban - all waiting in person. This may well have been the most harmonious period in Fourcade's life. It was certainly the highlight of his career as a forestry officer. He was welcomed by the Natal Government, given transport and made a member of several clubs, introduced to all the magistrates of the districts included in his brief and had the railway workshops at his disposal. He was free to employ his skills and knowledge without hindrance from anyone and quickly demonstrated an immense capacity for hard work. The work included inspecting each forest's climate, average altitude, area and extent, soils, rock, tree species and surface growth. He had to assess the extent of damage by exploitation, fire or sapling depletion (by local hut builders or herders with grazing animals). The quality of the prose in the report shows that he was passionate {{about the state of the}} forests. He reconstructed how particular sequences of events had to have happened for forests to be in the state he found them. He took nearly 300 specimens of wood from about 70 species of trees for testing. The Report on the Natal Forests, which was published on 3 December 1889, towers over both the previous and later reports by other authors. It discusses the Natal forests, their utility and protection, management as well as plantations, and organisation of staff and works. It contains a list of 167 species of tree indigenous to Natal; mechanical constants determined by experiment of the hardness, density, elasticity coefficient, elasticity limit, breaking stress; notes on the preparation of wood and railway sleeper manufacture, a list of trees with high bark tannin content, measurements of rates of growth for indigenous trees, timber measurements, recommendations for vegetation from other countries that would be suitable for acclimatisation in Natal as forest vegetation, the altitude ranges at which some 91 species of exotic tree were found, statistics of timber imports for the decade 1880 to 1889 as well as a short extract on 'diminished rainfall' that the Governor had requested, concerning the theory that there might be a link between sunspots and rainfall. All the work was done in 10 months. Fourcade was 24 years old. The report was tabled in Parliament to an enthusiastic response: Of all the official documents that have been presented to the Legislative Council this session, by far the most interesting is the [...] "Report of the Natal Forests" [...] by Mr. H. G. Fourcade of the Cape Service, who was appointed <b>early</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> to perform the work of which this report is the representation and the result .... No one who reads this report will or can doubt his complete competency for the task committed to him. He has produced a monograph of immediate utility, absorbing interest, of abiding value. We have read the 95 pages of the report with unflagging attention, and benefit; and that is more than might be said of most Blue-books. These pages are pregnant with instructive and suggestive matter that it is impossible to take more than a cursory survey of them in this column. To be appreciated and understood, as it deserves to be, the whole report must be read. Storrar 1990, p. 38 Almost all his recommendations were adopted: The appointment of a conservator of forests was approved; a proclamation protected ironwood, stinkwood and yellowwoods; and the forests were shut down for 16 months. Fourcade was offered the new post, but he turned it down and returned to Cape Town. A year later, the report was still in the news, being regarded as the only Government publication that was ever seen to have been taken [...] "on a railway journey to relieve the monotony of travel on the Natal line" [...] (Storrar 1990, p. 39, quoting from the Natal Witness).|$|E
