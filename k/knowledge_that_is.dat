25|$|Embodied {{cultural}} capital comprises the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consciously acquired and the passively inherited, by socialization to culture and tradition. Unlike property, {{cultural capital}} is not transmissible, but is acquired over time, {{as it is}} impressed upon the person's habitus (character and way of thinking), which, in turn, becomes more receptive to similar cultural influences. Linguistic cultural capital is the mastery of language and its relations; the embodied cultural capital, which is a person's means of communication and self-presentation, acquired from the national culture.|$|E

25|$|The Frankfurt School avoided {{taking a}} stand on the precise {{relationship}} between the materialist and transcendental methods, which led to ambiguity in their writings and confusion among their readers. Habermas's epistemology synthesizes these two traditions by showing that phenomenological and transcendental analysis can be subsumed under a materialist theory of social evolution, while the materialist theory makes sense only {{as part of a}} quasi-transcendental theory of emancipatory <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the self-reflection of cultural evolution. The simultaneously empirical and transcendental nature of emancipatory knowledge becomes the foundation stone of critical theory.|$|E
25|$|Remnants of the Vision Serpent {{have survived}} until modern times. Around 1930, J.E.S. Thompson noted in San Antonio, Belize, that the Q'eqchi' Maya still {{performed}} a ritual {{very similar to}} the vision quest of the classic Maya, although in a different context. The ritual marked the initiation of a new shaman for the village. The participant came into direct contact with a giant serpent, Ochan (Och-Kan). It was through this experience that he completed his initiation rites and gained the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> needed to become a powerful shaman.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{universities}} of Oxford and Paris had come up, and the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life—the fields {{were not as}} clearly demarcated {{as they are in}} the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of Johannes Campanus, of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new body of <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now known as physics.|$|E

25|$|Naturalism of {{this sort}} says nothing about the {{existence}} or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, {{anything that can be}} scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

500|$|This {{problem of}} {{explaining}} introspective first-person aspects of mental states and consciousness in general {{in terms of}} third-person quantitative neuroscience is called the explanatory gap. There are several different views {{of the nature of}} this gap among contemporary philosophers of mind. David Chalmers and the early Frank Jackson interpret the gap as ontological in nature; that is, they maintain that qualia can never be explained by science because physicalism is false. There are two separate categories involved and one cannot be reduced to the other. An alternative view is taken by philosophers such as Thomas Nagel and Colin McGinn. According to them, the gap is epistemological in nature. For Nagel, science is not yet able to explain subjective experience because it has not yet arrived at the level or kind of <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required. We are not even able to formulate the problem coherently. For McGinn, on other hand, the problem is one of permanent and inherent biological limitations. We are not able to resolve the explanatory gap because the realm of subjective experiences is cognitively closed to us in the same manner that quantum physics is cognitively closed to elephants. Other philosophers liquidate the gap as purely a semantic problem. This semantic problem, of course, led to the famous [...] "Qualia Question", which is: Does Red cause Redness? ...|$|E

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been leveled by Brody (2004), {{who claimed that}} unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT [...] "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks {{that are related to}} the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> assessed". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.|$|E

2500|$|Following Becker, {{the human}} capital {{literature}} often distinguishes between [...] "specific" [...] and [...] "general" [...] human capital.

Economists view firm specific human capital as risky, since firm closure or industry decline lead to skills that cannot be transferred (the evidence on the quantitative importance of firm specific capital is unresolved).|$|E

2500|$|Kant, however, {{contests}} this: {{he claims}} that elementary mathematics, like arithmetic, is synthetic a priori, in that its statements provide new knowledge, but <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not derived from experience.

That is, {{he argues that the}} possibility of experience depends on certain necessary conditions — which he calls a priori forms — and that these conditions structure and hold true of the world of experience. In so doing, his main claims in the [...] "Transcendental Aesthetic" [...] are that mathematic judgments are synthetic a priori and in addition, that Space and Time are not derived from experience but rather are its preconditions.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem of}} using deductively closed <b>knowledge</b> bases <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no {{distinction}} <b>is</b> made between pieces of <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> known by themselves {{and pieces of}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> merely consequences of them. This distinction is instead done by the foundational approach to belief revision, which is related to foundationalism in philosophy. According to this approach, retracting a non-derived piece of knowledge should lead to retracting all its consequences <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not otherwise supported (by other non-derived pieces of knowledge). This approach can be realized by using <b>knowledge</b> bases <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not deductively closed and assuming that all formulae in the knowledge base represent self-standing beliefs, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> they are not derived beliefs. In order to distinguish the foundational approach to belief revision to that based on deductively closed knowledge bases, the latter is called the coherentist approach. This name has been chosen because the coherentist approach aims at restoring the coherence(consistency) among all beliefs, both self-standing and derived ones. This approach is related to coherentism in philosophy.|$|R
