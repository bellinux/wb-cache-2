5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who then removed Emmett for a duck.

5|$|Traditionally, {{illustrations}} of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat {{over his left}} shoulder and has two kids under his left arm; he holds the reins to the chariot <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. The reins <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas Hyginus deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds the reins of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. Jacob Micyllus depicted Auriga in his Hyginus of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly {{from those of the}} European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a mule, called Mulus clitellatus by Johann Bayer. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as Adam kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put his pistol in his overcoat pocket.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|Of {{greatest}} {{interest is}} the fourth composition of historical figures, {{a young man and}} a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E
2500|$|In Hindu inconography, Vishnu {{is usually}} {{depicted}} {{as having a}} dark, or pale blue complexion and having four arms.

5|$|Though Shiva {{is often}} {{described}} as a naked ascetic Yogi, iconographically he is rarely portrayed as nude except in his form as Bhikshatana. Often the seductive nature of the naked Bhikshatana is emphasised in his torso and buttocks. Though his manhood is fully visible, Bhikshatana is never displayed as ithyphallic in South Indian iconography. In contrast to textual descriptions, Orissan images of Bhikshatana depict him clothed with tiger skin and other body ornaments, but displaying an erect phallus. He is two-armed, holding the begging bowl kapala in his left hand and the trishula (trident) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry the ball <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bhairava's {{headgear}} has a ruff on the back, a {{skull and}} cobra over the forehead, and the crescent {{high on the}} right. His facial expression is of anger, conviction of something he must do, {{and one in the}} middle of action. The legs and five of the eight arms are broken, attributed to Portuguese vandalism. The smaller broken image Andhaka is seen below Bhairava's image. Also depicted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> is the symbolic weapon that Shaiva mythology states Shiva used to kill the destructive elephant demon. A hand holds a bowl to collect the blood dripping from the slain Andhaka, which Shaiva legend states was necessary because the dripping blood had the power to become new demons if they got nourished by the ground. Furthermore, the artwork shows ruined parts of a male and two female forms, figures of two ascetics, a small figure in front, a female figure, and two dwarfs. The uppermost part shows flying apsaras bringing garlands.|$|E
5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised {{in the act of}} blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face is identical to the representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|The cross Vladimir held {{when he was}} {{beheaded}} is also {{regarded as}} a relic. Traditionally {{under the care of}} the Andrović family from the village of Velji Mikulići in southeastern Montenegro, the cross is only shown to believers on the Feast of Pentecost, when it is carried in a procession to the summit of Mount Rumija. Jovan Vladimir is regarded as the first Serbian saint and the patron saint of the town of Bar in Montenegro. His earliest, lost hagiography was probably written sometime between 1075 and 1089; a shortened version, written in Latin, is preserved in the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. His hagiographies in Greek and Church Slavonic were first published, respectively, in 1690 and 1802. The saint is classically depicted in icons as a monarch wearing a crown and regal clothes, with a cross <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and his own head in his left hand. He is fabled to have carried his severed head to his place of burial.|$|E

60|$|There was, perhaps, some {{advantage}} in this absence of ceremony.

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
5|$|In reply, Australia were {{in trouble}} at 7/208 when Johnston came to the crease to join Lindwall, with five more runs needed to avoid the follow on. As Sid Barnes was unable to bat due to injury, Australia were {{effectively}} eight wickets down. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Dick Pollard {{in the direction of}} Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball at full stretch <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> The wicket-keeper could not hold onto the ball, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Jack Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Johnston was out for three as Australia ended with 221 to narrowly avoid the follow on by eight runs. He was wicketless in the second innings, taking 0/34 as England declared at 3/174 and set Australia 317 for victory on the last day after the fourth day was completely washed out by rain. The match ended in a draw with Australia at 1/92, after many rain interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular bone <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase {{to hold up the}} title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E
