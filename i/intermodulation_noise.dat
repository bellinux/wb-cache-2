The {{performance}} of a telemetry system is affected by three principal sources: {{the noise of the}} electronics, the noise of the transmission link, and the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>noise.</b> <b>Intermodulation</b> <b>noise</b> is a significant contributor to signal-to-noise ratio of a telemetry system and can sometimes be more serious than the other noise sources.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Three {{types of}} low noise {{amplifiers}} operating at 2. 4 GHz were designed. They are the commonly used single-ended and differential amplifiers {{as well as}} a new quasi-differential amplifier. The substrate noise injected into these amplifiers is examined for both heavily and lightly doped CMOS substrates. For the single-ended amplifier the noise is modeled in SPICE with good correlation between measurements and simulations. Using these models and simulations the major noise coupling mechanisms are identified. In both types of substrates, harmonics of the clock couple into the bond pads and the inductor at the LNA output. Intermodulation products of the clock and the RF carrier are produced by noise coupling directly into the input transistor in the heavily doped substrate or into the gate interconnect in the lightly doped substrate. Methods of noise mitigation are identified and simulated for each substrate. In the differential amplifier harmonic noise is dominated by unequal coupling into passive circuitry. <b>Intermodulation</b> <b>noise</b> in the differential amplifier arises from coupling of substrate noise into the active devices. Even though the substrate noise is common mode, it is shown that the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>noise</b> is not reduced in a differential amplifier circuit. The performance of the quasi-differential amplifier is comparable to the differential amplifier in the lightly doped substrate. However, in the heavily doped substrate the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>noise</b> is much larger with the quasi-differential amplifier...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve optimum service availability, Ka-band {{gateways}} must deliver very large effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) per signal. For most signal types, and for all multicarrier uplinks, uplink power is limited by distortion in the final amplifier.

Accurate methods for predicting the effects of distortion are critical for sizing the gateway antenna/amplifier hardware and for planning service quality. This paper reviews the method of distortion simulation using complex envelope transformation by the AM-AM and AM-PM transfer functions. Provided that the quasi-static approximation holds, as is normally the case for traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, these transfer functions fully characterize the device, and thus the simulation technique provides accurate predictions of all distortion properties, including two-tone <b>intermodulation,</b> <b>noise</b> power ratio, and single- or multicarrier modulated signal distortion.

The model allows one {{to take into account}} different modes of operation, like a continuous as well as a pulsed or even a multi-ball operation. For monokinetic atoms, we show that the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>noise</b> can be completely filtered out with a continuous mode of operation and an optimum modulation scheme for any modulation frequency but also with a pulsed operation however only for specific launching frequencies.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{high-temperature}} superconducting (HTS) transmitting filter based on a reaction-type resonator is presented. The purpose of an HTS reaction-type filter (HTS-RTF) is to eliminate the <b>intermodulation</b> distortion <b>noise</b> generated by microwave power amplifiers such as those employed in mobile base stations. An HTS-RTF enables both higher power handling capability and sharper cutoff characteristics compared to existing planar-type HTS transmitting filters, since a reaction-type resonator does not resonate with high-power fundamental signals. To achieve steep skirt characteristics and high-power handling capability simultaneously, a 5 -GHz three-pole HTS-RTF using split open-ring resonator is designed. This split open-ring resonator offers low maximum current densities and a high-unloaded Q-factor with low radiation. The designed prototype filter has Chebyshev characteristics with a centre frequency of 4. 95 GHz and a bandwidth of 1. 5 MHz. The HTS-RTF is fabricated using a double-sided YBa_ 2 C_ 3 O_[7 -δ] thin film deposited on a 0. 5 mm thick MgO substrate. The measured filter shows an insertion loss of less than 0. 1 dB and a third intermodulation distortion value of - 56. 7 dBc for a 40 dBm passband signal. In addition, adjacent channel leakage power ratio (ACLR) measurements using an actual Wideband CDMA signal confirm an ACLR improvement of about 10 dB for a four-carrier signal with power of up to 40 dBm...|$|R

An output-to-input approach is used to obtain a general system equation for the laser and then Volterra series expansion is applied to the system equation to obtain system transfer functions. First, the nth-order Volterra transfer functions, Gn(w 1, [...] .,wn), from output to input are calculated. Then, based on harmonic balance the forward Volterra transfer functions, Fn(w 1, [...] .,wn), are calculated from Gn(w 1, [...] .,wn), and these Fn(w 1, [...] .,wn), are used to model the frequency dependent form input-to-output nonlinearities of the laser. The theoretical models for second harmonic (2 HD), third harmonic (3 HD) and third-order intermodulation (IMD) distortions are expressed in terms of signal frequency, optical modulation depth and laser parameters.

40|$|Abstract—A new CMOS {{active mixer}} {{topology}} can operate at low supply voltages {{by the use}} of switches exclusively connected to the supply voltages. Such switches require less voltage headroom and avoid gate-oxide reliability problems. Mixing is achieved by exploiting two transconductors with cross-coupled outputs, which are alternatingly activated by the switches. For ideal switching, the operation is equivalent to a conventional active mixer. This paper analyzes the performance of the switched transconductor mixer, in comparison with the conventional mixer, demonstrating competitive performance at a lower supply voltage. Moreover, the new mixer has a fundamental noise benefit, as noise produced by the switch-transistors and LO-port is common mode noise, which is rejected at the differential output. An experimental prototype with 12 -dB conversion gain was designed and realized in standard 0. 18 - m CMOS to operate at only a 1 -V supply.

Quicker and more reliable systems are in demand. Therefore, to fulfill these demand wideband signal processing is required, which can be achieved from the microwave photonics due to its unique features like low loss and immunity to the electromagnetic interference (EMI). Most of the different signal processor, the down converted photonic frequency is used in several remote area antennas, radar communication as well as defense system. And this thesis also deals only with the lower intermediate frequency (down converted frequency) output of the mixer that also gives the advantage over long distance transmissions, which may prove to be further advantageous when transmitting signals to remote areas.

40|$|The {{integral}} nonlinearity (INL) is {{used for}} the postcorrection of analog-digital converters (ADCs). An input-frequency-dependent INL model is developed for the postcorrection. The model consists of a static term that is dependent on the ADC output code and a dynamic term that has an additional dependence on the input frequency. The concept of ADC digital output postcorrection by INL is first introduced. The INL model is subtracted from the digital output for postcorrection. The static compensation part is made by adjacent sets of gains and offsets, where each set corrects a range of output codes. The dynamic information, i. e., the frequency dependence of the INL dynamic component is used to construct a set of filter blocks that performs ADC compensation in the time domain. The compensation scheme is applied to the measured data of two ADCs of the same type (Analog Devices AD 9430). Performance improvements in terms of spurious-free dynamic range, signal-to-noise and distortion ratio, <b>intermodulation</b> distortion, and <b>noise</b> are obtained.

40|$|Integral {{nonlinearity}} (INL) for pipelined analog-digital converters (ADCs) {{operating at}} radio frequency is measured and characterized. A parametric {{model for the}} INL of pipelined ADCs is proposed and the corresponding least-squares problem is formulated and solved. The estimated model parameters are used to design a post-correction block in order to compensate the pipeline ADC. The INL is modeled both {{with respect to the}} ADC output code k and the frequency stimuli, which is dynamic modeling. The INL model contains a static and a dynamic part. The former comprises two one-dimensional terms in ADC code that are a sequence of zero-centered linear segments and a polynomial term. The two-dimensional dynamic part consists of a set of polynomials whose parameters are dependent on the ADC input stimuli. The INL modeling methodology is applied to simulated and experimental data from a 12 -bit commercial ADC running at 210 MSPS. It is demonstrated that the developed methodology is an efficient way to capture the INL of pipelined ADCs running at radio frequency. The concept of ADC digital output post-correction by INL is firstly introduced. Further, the estimated INL model is used for ADCs post-correction. The INL model is subtracted out of the digital output for post-correction. The static compensation part is made by a set of gains and offsets, that each (gain and offset) corrects an output code k range. The dynamic information, i. e. frequency dependency of the INL dynamic component is used to construct a set of filters blocks that perform ADC compensation in the time domain.

Performance improvement in terms of spurious free dynamic range, signal to noise and distortion ratio, <b>intermodulation</b> distortion and <b>noise</b> are obtained. The frequency-dependent dynamic compensation can be generalized by making the use of the likely similar frequency information of the INL models (of different ADCs of the same type) to achieve a cross-ADC compensation, i. e. post-correcting of one ADC by the INL model of another converter. ...|$|R
40|$|Phase-Locked Loop based {{frequency}} synthesis is {{an essential}} technique employed in wireless communication systems for local oscillator generation. The ultimate goal in any design of frequency synthesisers is to generate precise and stable output frequencies with fast switching and minimal spurious and phase noise. The conflict between high resolution and fast switching leads to two separate integer synthesisers to satisfy critical system requirements. This thesis concerns a new sigma-delta fractional-N synthesiser design which is able to be directly modulated at high data rates while simultaneously achieving good noise performance. Measured results from a prototype indicate that fast switching, low noise and spurious free spectra are achieved for most covered frequencies. The phase noise of the unmodulated synthesiser was measured − 113 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset from the carrier. The intermodulation effect in synthesisers is capable of producing a family of spurious components of identical form to fractional spurs caused in quantisation process. This effect directly introduces high spurs on some channels of the synthesiser output. Numerical and analytic results describing this effect are presented and amplitude and distribution of the resulting fractional spurs are predicted and validated against simulated and measured results. Finally an experimental arrangement, based on a phase compensation technique, is presented demonstrating significant suppression of intermodulation-borne spurs. A new technique, pre-distortion noise shaping, is proposed to dramatically reduce the impact of fractional spurs in fractional-N synthesisers. The key innovation is the introduction in the bitstream generation process of carefully-chosen set of components at identical offset frequencies and amplitudes and in anti-phase with the principal fractional spurs. These signals are used to modify the Σ-Δ noise shaping, so that fractional spurs are effectively cancelled. This approach can be highly effective in improving spectral purity and reduction of spurious components caused by the Σ-Δ modulator, quantisation <b>noise,</b> <b>intermodulation</b> effects and any other circuit factors. The spur cancellation is achieved in the digital part of the synthesiser without introducing additional circuitry. This technique has been convincingly demonstrated by simulated and experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{comprehensive}} dynamic {{model has been}} developed for simulating a novel semiconductor laser type, {{referred to as the}} Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL). The high-speed behavior was simulated and compared to experiments, where excellent agreement was found. The model was also applied in the development of high-power single mode VCSELs, using a novel surface relief technique. The VCSEL is a small volume laser, which makes it suitable for high-speed communication. The epitaxial structure of the laser is complex, but once it is fabricated, the remaining fabrication steps are relatively simple. Surface emission enables on-wafer testing and therefore the unit cost of a VCSEL can be considerably reduced compared with other semiconductor lasers. Further, the low power consumption, low threshold current and the low-divergent circular output beam are additional advantages. This has made the VCSEL an established transmitter in optical communication systems, especially in short to medium distance networks with a large number of end-users, where many reliable, high-speed, low-cost components must be used. However, a drawback of the VCSEL is the tendency to lase in multiple modes, which degrades the beam quality and affects the dynamics. Further, at 10 Gbit/s modulation, which is the next generation standard for Ethernet communication, even the VCSEL is slow in some respects. The developed model takes the 3 D geometry of the laser into account, and it can follow relevant physical properties (temperature, optical fields, carrier density) in time. Also considered are the random fluctuations in the processes that supply or consume and generate or annihiliate carriers and photons, adding noise to the output.

40|$|Communication is an {{integral}} part of people’s daily life, and its demand will never cease. After multiple generations of communication system improvement, broadband wireless communication has become a conspicuous development trend but the congested spectrum has turned into one of the system bottlenecks. Therefore, shifting into higher frequency bands, that is, wavelengths of millimeter scale would be a solution to suffice the escalating consumer demand, and Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) is the key for successful system deployment. Under RoF structure, Radio Frequency (RF) signals can be directly distributed from central station to base stations via optical fiber, as a result, size of base station can be implemented into a palm-size package, and more importantly, lower unit cost of base stations crucial due to high volume use. 	In this work, we started with the design of an optical receiver as the first step of transceiver integration, and targeted at 40 GHz or above. Different from the widespread digital optical receiver, optical nature of RoF transmission is analog signal, and consequently its receiver demands higher qualification standards. <b>Noise,</b> <b>intermodulation</b> distortion, nonlinearities and other aspects are all required to be validated. 	Putting the cost factor into consideration, we used Miniature Hybrid Microwave Integrated Circuit (MHMIC) technology to implement our analog optical receiver. Design and simulation of the 40 GHz receiver was mainly carried out by Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS), and the bondwire interconnection is identified as a major potential bandwidth degradation factor of the receiver. 	After the circuit fabrication, the S-parameter results showed the receiver bandwidth is limited to 30 GHz due to certain fabrication error caused by bondwires. The bandwidth evaluation is further verified from Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) results by transmitting Ultra-wideband (UWB) signal centered at 30. 31 GHz through a 20 KM long optical fiber.
