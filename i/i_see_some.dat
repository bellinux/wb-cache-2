500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of you made it out here." [...] Almost as if to predict the upcoming Vietnam War, he stated: [...] "Our most important duty {{is to keep the}} peace for the U.S., as Dwight Eisenhower had done.

2500|$|Returning to the United States in {{the late}} summer of 1870—as the Franco-Prussian War was starting—Cassatt lived with her family in Altoona. Her father {{continued}} to resist her chosen vocation, and paid for her basic needs, but not her art supplies. Cassatt placed two of her paintings in a New York gallery and found many admirers but no purchasers. She was also dismayed at the lack of paintings to study while staying at her summer residence. Cassatt even considered giving up art, as she was determined to make an independent living. She wrote in a letter of July 1871, [...] "I have given up my studio & torn up my father's portrait, & have not touched a brush for six weeks nor ever will again until <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> prospect of getting back to Europe. I am very anxious to go out west next fall & get some employment, but I have not yet decided where." ...|$|E

60|$|HON. You say right; and yet {{the most}} of them who count {{themselves}} pilgrims do indeed do thus. I am, as you see, an old man, and have been a traveller in this road many a day, and I have taken notice of many things. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> that have set out as if they would drive all the world afore them, who yet have, in a few days, died as they in the wilderness, and so never got sight of the promised land. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> that have promised nothing at first, setting out to be pilgrims, and that {{one would have thought}} could not have lived a day, that have yet proved very good pilgrims. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> that have run hastily forward, that again have, after a little time, run just as fast back again. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>some</b> who have spoken very well of a pilgrim's life at first, that, after a while, have spoken as much against it. I have heard some, when they first set out for Paradise, say positively there is such a place, who, when they have been almost there, have come back again, and said there is none. I have heard some boast what they would do in case they should be opposed, that have, even at a false alarm, fled faith, the pilgrim's way, and all.|$|R
