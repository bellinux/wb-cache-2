The optical technology uses wavelength-division-multiplexing and {{a high degree of}} integration in order to surpass electrical I/O in both throughput and energy by more than an order of magnitude. However, <b>integrated</b> <b>photonic</b> <b>systems</b> need to be properly designed in order to reach their full potential, and electronic design techniques need to be updated {{to take full advantage of}} tight integration with photonics. This thesis explores the engineering of <b>integrated</b> <b>photonics</b> <b>systems,</b> focusing on optical data receiver design and techniques. We develop a representation of a <b>photonic</b> communication <b>system</b> based on circuit and device models, and perform a system-level optimization to find the optimal operating point for each of the components. This operating point sets the specification for the receiver circuits developed. An equivalent model of the receiver is used to develop a host of split-photodiode topologies that enable new ways to implement double-data-rate and decision-feedback-equalization operation. The receivers are fabricated as part of an <b>integrated</b> <b>photonic</b> test platform, and the measurements are detailed.

40|$|It {{is crucial}} for various quantum {{information}} processing tasks {{that the state of}} a quantum system can be determined reliably and efficiently from general quantum measurements. One important class of measurements for this purpose is symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements (SIC-POVMs). SIC-POVMs have the advantage of providing an unbiased estimator for the quantum state with the minimal number of outcomes needed for full tomography. By virtue of Naimark's dilation theorem, any POVM can always be realized with a suitable coupling between the system and an auxiliary system and by performing a projective measurement on the joint system. In practice, finding the appropriate coupling is rather non-trivial. Here we propose an experimental design for directly implementing SIC-POVMs using multiport devices and path-encoded qubits and qutrits, the utility of which has recently been demonstrated by several experimental groups around the world.

We assemble small groups of freestanding, chemically synthesized nanoribbons and nanowires into model structures that illustrate how light is exchanged between subwavelength cavities made of three different semiconductors. The coupling strength of the optical linkages formed when nanowires are brought into contact depends both on their volume of interaction and angle of intersection. With simple coupling schemes, lasing nanowires can launch coherent pulses of light through ribbon waveguides that are up to a millimeter in length. Also, interwire coupling losses are low enough to allow light to propagate across several right-angle bends in a grid of crossed ribbons. The fraction of the guided wave traveling outside the wire/ribbon cavities is used to link nanowires through space and to separate colors within multiribbon networks. In addition, we find that nanoribbons function efficiently as waveguides in liquid media and provide a unique means for probing molecules in solution or in proximity to the waveguide surface.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{numerical}} investigation of surface plasmon (SP) propagation in ordered and disordered linear chains of metal nanospheres. In our simulations, SPs are excited {{at one end}} of a chain by a near-field tip. We then find numerically the SP amplitude as a function of propagation distance. Two types of SPs are discovered. The first SP, which we call the ordinary or quasistatic, is mediated by short-range, near-field electromagnetic interaction in the chain. This excitation is strongly affected by Ohmic losses in the metal and by disorder in the chain. These two effects result in spatial decay of the quasistatic SP by means of absorptive and radiative losses, respectively. The second SP is mediated by longer range, far-field interaction of nanospheres. We refer to this SP as the extraordinary or non-quasistatic. The non-quasistatic SP can not be effectively excited by a near-field probe due to the small integral weight of the associated spectral line. Because of that, at small propagation distances, this SP is dominated by the quasistatic SP. However, the non-quasistatic SP is affected by Ohmic and radiative losses to a much smaller extent than the quasistatic one. Because of that, the non-quasistatic SP becomes dominant sufficiently far from the exciting tip and can propagate with little further losses of energy to remarkable distances.

This thesis includes our work in material development, micro-mechanical design and device engineering towards enabling novel flexible <b>integrated</b> <b>photonic</b> <b>systems.</b> First, we pioneered a monolithic approach to realize flexible, high-index-contrast chalcogenide glass photonics with significantly improved processing throughput and yield. Noting that the conventional multilayer bending theory fails when laminates have large elastic mismatch, we derived a mechanical theory accounting for multiple neutral axes in one laminated structure to accurately predict its strain-optical coupling behavior. Through combining monolithic fabrication and local neutral axis designs, we fabricated devices that boast record optical performance (Q = 460, 000) and excellent mechanical flexibility enabling repeated bending down to sub-millimeter radius without measurable performance degradation. The capabilities of these devices far surpass those of current ‘state-of-the-art’ designs. Moreover, we demonstrated that our flexible glass device technology offers a simple, effective fabrication route for 3 -D photonic structures including vertical-stack resonator filters, interlayer waveguide couplers, and woodpile photonic crystals.

We then make use of this three-photon interference to detail the first proof-of-principle demonstration of a new intermediate model of quantum computation called boson sampling. Finally, we perform an on-chip demonstration of the quantum teleportation protocol where all key parts [...] - entanglement preparation, Bell-state analysis and quantum state tomography [...] - are performed on a reconfigurable photonic chip. The element-wise characterisation scheme developed earlier is shown to be critical to mitigate fabricated component errors. We develop a theoretical model to account for all sources of possible error in the circuit and find good agreement with the measured teleported state fidelities, which exceed the average teleportation fidelity possible with a classical device. We identify the elements of this error budget relevant to scaling and propose improvements to chip characterisation and fabrication in order to achieve high fidelity operation. In the second half, we discuss the use of high efficiency superconducting transition edge sensors in enabling quantum experiments using more photons. We detail the installation and characterisation of these detectors in a new lab in Oxford. We achieve good photon number-resolution and high-efficiency operation. Work to integrate these detectors on the silica-on-silicon waveguide architecture is discussed and we detail the optical and thermal device modelling performed to optimise the on-chip detection efficiency. New, on-chip detectors, fabricated according to this design are shown to operate as expected and achieve high-efficiency and good energy resolution.

40|$|We {{report on}} a compact (footprint) silicon <b>photonics</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>system</b> {{performing}} high-sensitivity monitoring of in-band optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The system, including a thermally tunable racetrack resonator filter and an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, performs the autocorrelation measurement of a filtered fraction of the noisy signal spectrum. Monitor performance is evaluated on a 10 Gb/s ON/OFF keying nonreturn to zero signal, demonstrating an accuracy of 0. 4 dB over a wide OSNR range from 8 to 28 dB. We also demonstrate that the proposed system induces a tiny distortion of the optical signal, making it suitable for in-line monitoring of signal quality...|$|R
