40|$|IntroductionPromoting {{oral hygiene}} and {{stimulating}} patient's responsibility for his/her personal health remain challenging objectives. The presence of <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> {{has led to}} delegation of preventive tasks. However, in some countries, such as Belgium, this profession is not yet legalized. The aim of this exploratory study was to compare the attitude towards oral-hygiene instructions and patient motivational actions by <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and by general practitioners/periodontists in a context without <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> Materials and MethodsA questionnaire on demographics (six items), oral-hygiene instructions (eight items) and patient motivational actions (six items) was distributed to 241 Dutch <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists,</b> 692 general practitioners and 32 periodontists in Flanders/Belgium. Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact-test, Pearson's chi-square test and multiple (multinomial) logistic regression analysis to observe the influence of profession, age, workload, practice area and chair-assistance. ResultsSignificant variance was found between general practitioners and <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> (in 13 of 14 items), between general practitioners and periodontists (in nine of 14 items) and between <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and periodontists (in five of 14 items). In addition to qualification, chair-assistance was also identified as affecting the attitude towards preventive oral care. ConclusionThe present study identified divergence in the application of, and experienced barriers and opinions about, oral-hygiene instructions and patient motivational actions between <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and general practitioners/periodontists in a context without <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> In response to the barriers reported {{it is suggested that}} preventive oriented care may benefit from the deployment of <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> to increase access to qualified preventive oral care...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} active dentists in Sweden will fall {{sharply in the}} next decade and will {{partially}} be countered by an increased number of <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> The acceptance of this transition to primary oral health care by hygienists will be dependent on many factors; among them will be the perceived service quality offered by the <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists,</b> which may depend on how their professional status is perceived. Aim To find out whether the professional status of Swedish <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> is such {{that it is possible to}} meet the demands from the population. Methods The professional status of Swedish dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> was analysed by the variables suggested by Greenwood (1957). [Greenwood E. Social Work. 1957 2 : 45 - 55. ] Results The variables used point to shortcomings in the professional status of Swedish <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> Dentists in Sweden constitute a strong profession, while <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> are emerging as a profession. They lack a coherent and systematic theory in their academic education. Their fields of expertise are not exclusive to their group and that further weakens their professional status. They will probably not meet the service quality that is presently expected by the population. Many factors will have to be combined to make possible the necessary transition from dentists to <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> as primary providers of oral health care. One of them is that the expected level of service must be adjusted to the available personnel. Conclusions The professional status of the <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> needs to be consolidated and strengthened by a more homogenous curriculum.

40|$|Aims: Attitudes of dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> towards {{extended}} {{scope and}} independent dental hygiene practice {{are described in}} several studies, but the results are heterogenous. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the attitudes of dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> towards extended scope and independent dental hygiene practice. Methods: PubMed, AMED and CINAHL were screened by two independent assessors to identify relevant studies. Only quantitative studies that reported the percentages of dentists' and dental hygienists' attitude towards extended scope and independent dental hygiene practice were included. The random-effects model was used to synthesise possible heterogenous influences. Results: Meta proportions with regard to a positive attitude towards extended scope of practice are 0. 54 for dentists and 0. 81 for <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> Meta proportions of a positive attitude towards independent practice are 0. 14 for dentists and 0. 59 for <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> A meta analysis with regard to negative attitudes could only be performed on extended scope of practice and did not reveal {{a difference between the}} two professions. We obtained homogeneous outcomes of the studies included regarding negative attitudes of dentists. A minority of dentists hold negative attitudes towards extended scope of dental hygiene practice. Study outcomes regarding negative attitudes of <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> were heterogeneous.

40|$|Background: Recent {{literature}} has identified that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) {{are a significant}} occupational health issue for both dentists and <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> Research on the occupational health of <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> is lacking in Australia, which is of particular concern given {{that it is a}} rapidly growing field in this country. The aims of this research are to investigate the prevalence of MSD and correlating regions of pain among Australian <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists.</b> A self-reporting questionnaire was distributed to all registered <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> in Australia. The questionnaire was a modified version of a validated tool, used previously among health practitioners and students. Results: A total of 624 <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> responded to the questionnaire, achieving a response rate of 42 %. MSD were frequently reported by <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> in the neck (85 %), shoulder (70 %), and lower back (68 %). Of those reporting pain, over two thirds reported that the pain lasted for longer than two days, for all body regions. Logistic regression analysis revealed that there is a correlation between reports of MSD in the neck, shoulder and lower back regions. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests that MSD are a reasonably common problem for Australian <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists,</b> and that they often need to seek medical treatment for these problems. It is concerning that there is a correlation between reports of MSD in the neck, shoulder and lower back regions; further studies are needed to establish the epidemiological patterns of MSD in this profession...|$|R

25|$|In the past, {{bacteremia}} {{caused by}} dental procedures (in most cases due to streptococci viridans, which reside in oral cavity), {{such as a}} cleaning or extraction of a tooth {{was thought to be}} more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a <b>dental</b> <b>hygienist</b> be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current American Heart Association guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.|$|E
25|$|Preventive dental {{treatment}} {{is also necessary}} (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a <b>dental</b> <b>hygienist.</b> Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth can not be effectively treated through teeth cleaning alone, and are at {{a high risk of}} spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. This treatment regimen is the same as that used for all xerostomia patients, such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy which often damages the salivary glands, as they are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.|$|E

The snowball sampling technique was used to identify LAP <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and collaborating dentists. The snowball sampling technique begins with the identifi-cation of a known expert in the field who serves as the initial “sampling unit. ” Subsequent individuals are then recommended, or nominated, to the investigator by the initial study participant and are selected based upon the need to fill in or extend information. The final sample consisted of seven LAP <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and two collaborating dentists. Interviews, field observations, and document analysis were utilized for data collection. Factors that {{led to the creation of}} LAP dental hygiene practice, current LAP practice, personal characteristics, relationships between LAP <b>dental</b> <b>hygienists</b> and dentists, and the impact that LAP dental hy-gienists have had on access to oral health care were explored.

500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill {{grew up in}} Fullerton, California. She is {{the fifth}} of seven children; {{her mother was a}} <b>dental</b> <b>hygienist</b> and her father an {{aerospace}} engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls [...] "had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling [...] "resistant to rules", an attitude she identified as both normal for her age and influenced by the era in which she grew up: [...] "My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girls—the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.|$|E
