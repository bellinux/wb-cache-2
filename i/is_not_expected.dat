Although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes {{that it needs to}} make a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E

5|$|During Gaudí's life {{only the}} crypt, apse {{and part of}} the Nativity facade were completed. Upon his death his {{assistant}} Domènec Sugrañes took over the construction; thereafter it was directed by various architects. Jordi Bonet i Armengol assumed responsibility in 1987 and continued as of 2011. Artists such as Llorenç and Joan Matamala, Carles Mani, Jaume Busquets, Joaquim Ros i Bofarull, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs (creator of the Passion facade) have worked on the sculptural decoration. Completion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> until at least 2026.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, and worker {{policing}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> {{as there is}} no genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic. In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar properties to its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital {{is expected to be}} nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger than male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> given the genetic implications of a new queen.|$|E

5|$|The Himalayas {{and other}} {{mountain}} chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions. An estimated 15,000 glaciers {{can be found}} in the greater Himalayas, with double that number in the Hindu Kush and Karakoram and Tien Shan ranges, and comprise the largest glaciated region outside the poles. These glaciers provide critical water supplies to arid countries such as Mongolia, western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9percent reduction in ice mass. Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). If the present trends persist the ice mass will gradually be reduced, and will affect the availability of water resources, though water loss <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to cause problems for many decades.|$|E
5|$|Gamma: Hyde of the Dark Dimension follows Okabe, and {{is set in}} the gamma attractor field; he {{got there}} when {{attempting}} to undo the changes caused by his friend Luka Urushibara's D-mail in the Steins;Gate game. He discovers that in this world line, he is a Rounder partnered with Moeka Kiryu, and that they have just completed a mission to kill Europol agents who have discovered their identities. He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming a dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to budget}} {{constraints}} and the scheduled closure of Boeing's Globemaster production line in 2015, {{it was considered}} unlikely in 2012 that the RAAF would acquire more Globemasters. However, in August 2014 Minister for Defence David Johnston stated that the Government was likely to purchase a further one or two C-17s. The Government {{announced that it would}} purchase two Globemasters in October 2014, and requested information on the pricing and availability for a further pair of aircraft. In November 2014 Australia lodged a formal request with the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency for four C-17s and associated equipment, for a total cost of $A1.85 billion. An order for the RAAF's seventh and eighth Globemasters was formally announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott on 10April 2015. The first of the new C-17s arrived in Australia on 29 July 2015, and the second on 4 November that year. These two aircraft were among the last C-17s to have been built before the production line was closed, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> that the RAAF will acquire more Globemasters. It was reported in December 2014 that the New Zealand Government was considering purchasing between two and four Globemasters, and Australian Aviation journalist Andrew McLaughlin suggested that any such acquisition would build on Australia's C-17 support infrastructure. The New Zealand Government ultimately decided to not purchase any Globemasters.|$|E

5|$|Since 2001, Oxford United {{have played}} at the Kassam Stadium. The all-seater stadium has a {{capacity}} of 12,500 and has only three stands {{instead of the usual}} four; when first planned in 1995 it was originally going to have a 16,000-seat capacity, {{but by the time the}} stadium opened Oxford was playing in a lower division, so the smaller capacity was deemed adequate. Construction of the fourth stand <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to take place for several years, although foundations have already been put in place. The record attendance is 12,243, which was achieved in the final game of the 2005–06 season, when a defeat against Leyton Orient condemned them to relegation from the Football League. The average attendance in the previous season was 7,415, which was the second highest in League Two and the thirty-fourth highest in the whole Football League. The average attendance was highest in the Conference in two out of the four years the team spent in the division, with the average in the other two years placing second, behind Exeter City and Cambridge United respectively. The stadium has also hosted rugby union matches, a woman's international football match (England v Sweden), an Under-17 international football tournament and music concerts.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and topsides were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E
