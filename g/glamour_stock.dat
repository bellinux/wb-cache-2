40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the impact of capitalization of research and development on the valuation of equities for listed firms in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: 15 years of financial data (2000 to 2014) was collected, and portfolios with similar price-to-book and market size ratios were formed to find any evidence of any post-investment excess returns and the association to the level of research and development investment. Portfolios were re-formed and annually ranked by their research and development intensity relative to sales. In addition, we looked at the changes in excess returns after adjusting the book value as a result of capitalizing R&D expenditure, to see if the distortion imposed by expensing R&D contributed to the under-valuation of firms that invest in R&D. Findings: The results indicate that firms that invest in research and development are systematically under-valued. We found no evidence of any positive association between the returns and investment levels, but rather found evidence of the <b>glamour</b> <b>stock</b> phenomenon in highly intensive research and development firms. Research limitations/implications: The sample data is limited to listed firms in South Africa, and for firms with intermittently omitted R&D on their financial report, we have assumed that such expenditure is zero for the non-disclosed period for the purpose of capitalization and amortisation. Listed firms whose main focus is on building intangible assets, are relatively few, hence our research is descriptive in nature. Practical implications: This paper highlights the commercial significance of valuing the long-term benefits of research and development. Capitalizing the development phase as afforded by the IASB lacks standardization, and as such, inconsistencies arise in the earnings reflected on companies’ financial statements. For investors though, highly intensive R&D firms should be avoided as these earn negative returns. Originality/value: The authors are not aware of any studies showing the effect of accounting rules on research and development that have been conducted in South Africa, or any research that have shown the <b>glamour</b> <b>stock</b> phenomena when investigating the impact of capitalization of research and development. Thus our contribution was to provide evidence on the valuation of stocks for listed firms that report research and development in South Africa that may be a result of the accounting rules. There is limited research on the on the accounting treatment of research and development in emerging markets, whose stock exchanges have been shown to not be highly correlated with the more developed markets, hence enables investors to diversify risk. This should motivate both managers and investors to venture beyond what the conservative accounting treatment of R&D has possibly instigated when valuing stocks...|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} the value premium {{documented}} in the literature is actually a glamour discount. The difference in average returns between high book-to-market (value) and low book-to-market (<b>glamour)</b> <b>stocks</b> is driven by unusually low returns to <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks.</b> There is {{no significant difference in}} returns between high book-to-market and medium book-to-market stocks. Furthermore, the return discount exists only for <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> with low analyst coverage. These findings suggest that low coverage stocks whose prices are bid well above book value become overpriced because investors have little information to rationalize their pricing. This inference is further supported by tests based on accounting measures of firm performance and earnings announcement returns. The return on assets (ROA) of <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> with low analyst coverage in the two-year period after portfolio formation is significantly lower than the ROA of <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> with high analyst coverage, and earnings announcement returns of the former group are much more negative than the insignificant returns of the latter group. These results suggest the prices of <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> with low coverage are high because investors are overly optimistic about future performance, and investors are subsequently surprised by performance when earnings are announced. In sharp contrast, no difference in ROA or announcement returns exist between value stocks that have low versus high analyst coverage.

40|$|Purpose – To {{test the}} Miller Price Optimism Model {{using a new}} proxy for {{heterogenous}} expectations and to examine if high differential <b>stocks</b> behave like <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> and low differential stocks behave like value stocks. Design/methodology/approach – Whisper/analyst forecast differentials were measured for a sample of stocks, combined into portfolios and held for one month. If the Miller model was supported, high differential stocks were expected to have lower portfolio returns than low differential stocks due to the greater divergence between optimistic whisper forecasts and rational analysts consensus forecasts. Findings – High differential quintiles had significantly lower future returns than low differential quintiles supporting the Miller model. High differential <b>stocks</b> resembled <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> while low differential stocks behaved like value stocks. Research limitations/implications – These results pertain to the ultra-short time horizon of two {{months prior to the}} earnings announcement.

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{magnitude}} and determinants of spinoff value effects using robust methodologies and different theoretical perspectives. From a sample of 170 European spinoffs in the period 1987 - 2005, I find that spinoff announcement returns are significantly positive while the long-run shareholder value performance of postspinoff firms is insignificant when the cross-sectional return dependence problem is controlled. This is consistent with market efficiency overall in relation to spinoffs. However, this overall efficiency may conceal irrational investor behaviour towards certain types of spinoffs. Assuming investor irrationality, I examine whether investor sentiment affects spinoff wealth effects and spinoff decisions. I use four different proxies to measure investor demand for corporate focus and <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks,</b> and observe a positive association between these proxies and spinoff announcement returns. In addition, I find that offspring, born of spinoffs to cater to investor demand for <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks,</b> significantly underperform various benchmarks including the performance of less glamourous offspring. An improvement in operating efficiency of post-spinoff firms may not be realised if post-spinoff firms have weak corporate governance and agency conflicts are not mitigated. I investigate this issue by examining changes of corporate governance mechanisms around spinoffs. I observe that spinoff firms with a controlling family shareholder have higher announcement stock returns but lower post-spinoff performance than others. Moreover, controlling family shareholders generally reduce their stock ownership in post-spinoff firms, indicating that they may undertake spinoffs to reshuffle their wealth portfolios. I also find that board monitoring and takeover threats for post-spinoff firms positively affect the long-run performance of post-spinoff firms. This thesis further inspects the relationship between information asymmetry between the pre-spinoff parent and the stock market, and spinoff value effects. By employing four different information asymmetry proxies, I find no evidence that a spinoff resolves information asymmetry problems. In contrast, I document some evidence that the information asymmetry problem may be exacerbated following spinoffs when the liquidity of post-spinoff firms is decreased. Taken together, my findings suggest that managers and shareholders should assess the desirability of a spinoff more carefully and take investor irrationality into account. This is the first study that focuses on European spinoffs {{over a long period}} and tests various theories concerning the sources of value. It also provides the first time empirical evidence on the validity of the catering theory in the context of spinoffs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This contribution to the extant literature is significant since it introduces stock volatility as a potential explanation of value premium.

40|$|By {{assuming}} {{that a large}} share of investors follows a fundamental approach to stock picking we build a discounted cash flow (DCF) model (which we assume to be commonly used by fundamentalists) and test on a sample of high-tech stocks whether the strong and the weak version of the model are supported by data. Empirical results show that, even though our "fundamental" price earnings explain a significant share of cross sectional variation of the observed price earnings, the strong version of the discounted cash flow model is rejected for the relevance of additional variables. These are the dividend payout, the number of recommending brokers, the sales to earnings ratio, the institutionals' share and a proxy of firm risk. We argue that all these variables are either signals of firm actual and future capacity of being profitable in a framework of imperfect information and/or proxies for the value of the real option of expansion which represents an important part of value for high-tech stocks. Empirical results of the paper therefore outline a new benchmark for testing market anomalies in which simple rules for building portfolios of value and <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> (size, P/E, book to market), may be replaced by more sophisticated rules based on indicators of the deviation between fundamental and observed firm DCF (plus real option) value...|$|R
40|$|Essay I Liquidity Premium and Catching-up Effect: Evidence {{from the}} Japanese Stock Market We extend the asset-pricing model with focus on {{liquidity}} of Amihud and Mendelson (1986) and Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1995) to incorporate previous market information. Consistent with their results, {{we find that}} without knowing the previous market information, expected returns are negatively related to the turnover ratio. If we further assume that liquid and illiquid stocks react to the previous market information asymmetrically, then the return-turnover relationship becomes more (less) significant for an up (a down) market in the previous period. Using the monthly data from the Japanese stock market {{where there are no}} formal market makers, we find that the empirical results support the prediction of the model. The pattern of the asymmetric return-turnover relationship is insensitive to the estimation methods and is robust to the Fama-French three factor model. We also find that about half of the asymmetric liquidity premium is due to the correlation between the portfolio return and the lagged market return, i. e., the "lead-lag" effect. Essay II Asymmetric Liquidity Premium and Lead-Lag Effect Across Firm Size and Exchange* In this article we are concerned with the return-turnover relationship in the U. S. stock market across firm size and exchange. We find that expected returns are negatively related to turnover ratios for both NYSE/AMEX firms and NASDAQ firms. Nonetheless, this relationship is more profound for small stocks than large stocks. In addition, this relationship is stronger for NASDAQ firms than NYSE/AMEX firms. This evidence indicates that the market structure in the NYSE/AMEX provides more liquidity than that in the NASDAQ. However, both market structures provide similar liquidity for the transactions of large stocks. We also document that the return-turnover relationship is more profound conditioned on an "up market" than a "down market" in the pervious month. This pattern of asymmetric liquidity premium is robust even after controlling for the "lead-lag" effect. This asymmetric pattern also exhibits in the size and book-to-market effects. Finally, we find that the liquidity premium does not exhibit any seasonal pattern for both the NYSE/AMEX firms and the NASDAQ firms.

The results from NYSE/AMEX stocks and the NASDAQ stocks indicate that past return and turnover are the two major determinants for cross-sectional expected stock returns even after controlling for the Connor and Korajczyk (1988) risk factors. The evidence suggests that the profit of the momentum strategy (i. e., to buy past winners) could be enhanced when the turnover ratios for winner and loser stocks are taken into account. Furthermore, while the momentum and size effects are more profound when conditioned on a previous "down market", the turnover and book-to-market effects are more significant when conditioned on a previous "up market. " This implies that <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> (as characterized by large firm size, low book-to-market ratio, high turnover, and past winner) outperform the value stocks (as characterized by small firm size, high book-to-market ratio, low turnover, and past loser) more when the previous market movement was down than when it was up. These patterns are consistent with the notion that <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks</b> overreact to the common and firm-specific information and/or value stocks react with a delay to the common and firm-specific information. Finally, we find that the momentum effect is concentrated in non-January months, while the turnover, size and book-to-market effects are more apparent in January months...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{financial}} literature contains several {{analyses of}} the characteristics and performance of various classes of stocks and investment strategies. These include the analysis of value vs. <b>glamour</b> <b>stocks,</b> IPO firms, and contrarian/momentum investment strategies. We examine a previously unexplored class of stocks generally distinct from these groups but discussed regularly in the financial press {{over the past three}} decades: concept stocks. Empirically, concept stocks are defined as firms with extremely high levels of market to sales. To many, these stocks appear overvalued. However, proponents argue that because of their unique characteristics, traditional pricing models fail to correctly value these firms. Using a sample extending from 1967 through 1999, we demonstrate that the identity and characteristics of concept stocks have changed dramatically over time. Although the obvious recent examples are Internet and biotech stocks, concept stocks characterize every period. The industries containing the most popular concept stocks evolve from oil and gas extraction in the 60 s and 70 s, to computer and office equipment in the 80 s, and to computer-related services in the 90 s. We find that the sales-to-market ratio has decreased considerably over the sample period and that the percentage of firms with positive earnings has sharply declined. In more recent years, concept stocks tend to be larger in terms of market value, less profitable and with a higher level of R&D and capital investment. The analysis of long-run performance of concept stocks, using both Fama-French factors and buy-and-hold returns, reveals significant underperformance. The results are robust to extensive sensitivity analysis and are separate from glamour, IPO, or contrarian effects. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{cross-sectional}} variation between <b>glamour</b> (high <b>stock</b> market price) {{and value}} (low stock market price) portfolios {{to address the}} possible relationship between misvaluation and fixed investment. In a large sample of U. S. firms over the period 1980 - 2001, glamour firms invest substantially more than value firms. The difference between the investment of glamour and value firms persists when we control for fundamentals. The higher investment of glamour firms {{could be due to}} the fact that overvaluation makes equity finance cheap. In fact, the median glamour firm raises more in new share issues than its total capital expenditures for the year. If glamour firms are responding to misvaluation rather than fundamentals, then they may be investing too much. We describe and implement four tests designed to distinguish whether the high investment of glamour firms is the result of fundamental shocks or misvaluation shocks: investment reversals, stock market returns of high-investment firms, the path over time of the marginal product of capital, and overreaction tests.

40|$|Does {{stock market}} misvaluation affect investment? We use {{cross-sectional}} variation between <b>glamour</b> (high <b>stock</b> price) and value (low stock price) portfolios {{to test whether}} there is a relationship between misvaluation and fixed investment. In a large sample of U. S. firms over the period 1980 - 2001, glamour firms invest substantially more than value firms. If glamour firms are responding to misvaluation rather than fundamentals, then they may be investing too much. We describe and implement four new tests designed to distinguish whether the high investment of glamour firms is the result of fundamental shocks or misvaluation shocks: investment reversals, stock market returns of “overinvesting ” glamour firms, the time path of the marginal product of capital, and overreaction tests. In addition, we provide parametric estimates of the effect of misvaluation on investment; the parametric estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in misvaluation raises investment by more than 40 %. We consider the possibility that overinvestment might be due to excessive optimism on the part of managers [...] and present empirical specifications designed to detect whether either the active financing mechanism (cheap equity finance) or managerial excess optimism influence overinvestment...|$|R
40|$|The vast {{literature}} in finance examining {{the impact of}} takeovers on the share price of the bidder and target firms finds conclusive results for targets and inconclusive results for bidders. For both the UK and the US, previous studies show target firms to experience large positive abnormal returns {{at the time of}} the bid-announcement while bidder firm shareholders experience small abnormal gains as well as losses. Previous studies also show that approximately half the acquirers experience positive post-acquisition performance. There exists a serious gap in extant knowledge on what factors lead some acquirers to experience a positive post-acquisition performance while other acquirers experience a decline in their wealth. In this study we examine whether target firm managerial resistance to a takeover may be one factor which can affect the post-acquisition performance of acquirers. By segregating our sample of acquirers by the target firm management response to a takeover we are able to examine the post-acquisition performance of different acquirer types. This study attempts to fill the gaps in our knowledge regarding the relative performance of different acquirer types by addressing three research questions: i) what is the relative post-acquisition performance of different acquirer types? ii) what are the sources of long run post-acquisition value creation for each acquirer type? how effective are the agency monitoring mechanisms in determining the long run postacquisition performance for each acquirer type? In attempting to address the above questions we also examine a number of subsidiary issues that arise in the context of the relative post-acquisition performance of different acquirer types defined in terms of their financial profile. The subsidiary issues are: i) whether the acquirer firm size affects the long run post-acquisition performance? whether the acquirer's profile as a <b>glamour</b> or value <b>stock,</b> measured by the market to book value, affects the long run post-acquisition performance? whether the acquirer's profile as a <b>glamour</b> or value <b>stock,</b> measured by the price to earnings ratio, affects the long run post-acquisition performance? We use a sample of 547 acquirers, consisting of friendly, single hostile, multiple hostile and white knights, in takeovers completed between the period 1983 to 1995 to generate wealth gains. Wealth gains are measured in the form of abnormal returns and estimated by event study methodology using five different benchmark models (i. e. Fama and French Three Factor, market to book value, size, mean and market adjusted models). Then we use multiple regression analysis to test a range of hypothesis based on previous {{literature in}} finance with respect to our research questions. Our results show that single hostile acquirers outperform all other acquirer types in each of our three long run event windows. White knights tend to have a higher postacquisition performance than either multiple hostile and friendly acquirers. Friendly acquirers tend to have the worst post-acquisition performance compared to other acquirer types. We find differences in the impact of the sources of value creation and agency monitoring mechanisms on different acquirer types. Consistent with previous studies we find that shareholders of value acquirers (based on the PE ratio and market to book value) experience greater wealth gains than shareholders of glamour acquirers. We also find that shareholders of large acquirers tend to experience greater wealth gains than shareholders of smaller acquirers...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{topics for}} this project. Topic 1 : Can Brokers' Recommendations Predict the Performance of Companies Conducting Seasoned Equity Offerings?AbstractThis study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} predictability of brokers' recommendations {{on the performance of}} companies conducting seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). We will work in two steps. First, we investigate the impacts of changes in brokers' recommendations around the announcements of SEOs on issuers' performance every half year (up to three years) following the SEOs. We argue that brokers' recommendations should have only short-run impacts on SEO companies' stock returns if analysts pursue their own benefits. On the other hand, brokers' recommendations should have predictability for the medium- or long-run performance of companies if analysts provide their professional opinions. Second, we examine the relations between changes in brokers' recommendations and company characteristics to infer how analysts evaluate SEO stocks. Specifically, we select company variables related to price momentum, the contrarian property (<b>glamour</b> and value <b>stocks),</b> and corporate investment. Topic 2 : The Information Contents of Brokers' Recommendations prior to Seasoned Equity OfferingsAbstractThis study attempts to investigate the impacts of brokers' recommendations on (1) the announcement effect and (2) offer price decision of companies conducting seasonedequity offerings (SEOs). These two issues can help us {{to know more about the}} role of brokerage analysts in the secondary market and to explain the variations of SEO announcement returns and underpricing across companies. Empirically, we separate SEO companies into the upgraded, favorable, unfavorable, and downgraded, and no-recommendation groups, and identify whether brokers that provide recommendations are affiliated with issuers. We then examine the market reaction and underpricing of these groups. It is expected that companies with positive recommendations, especially for those from unaffiliated brokers, would have less negative announcement returns and more severe underpricing. 2 經紀商推薦與現金增資的關聯性本研究共有兩個子題。子題一：經紀商的推薦可以預測現金增資公司的績效嗎？摘要本研究試圖調查 (美國) 經紀商在現金增資前後的推薦對公司績效之預測能力，本研究有兩個步驟，第一，調查經紀商的推薦與現金增資後每半年的買入持有報酬率的關係 (至多三年) ，本研究認為，如果分析師只重視本身的利益，所提供的推薦對公司績效只有短期的預測能力，但分析師若提供專業且無偏頗的意見，則其提供的推薦對公司績效應有中長短期的預測能力。第二，本研究檢驗經紀商的推薦與公司特性的關係，以便推論分析師對現金增資公司的評估，本研究將選擇與價格動能、反向操作與公司投資相關的變數來進行分析。子題二：現金增資前經紀商推薦的資訊內涵摘要本研究試圖調查 (美國) 經紀商的推薦對公司現金增資 (1) 宣告效果及 (2) 承銷價格決策之影響，這兩個事項可以幫助我們瞭解經紀商分析師在次級市場中的角色，並可解釋現金增資宣告報酬率與承銷折價的變異性。實證上，本研究將增資公司區分為增資前調升、贊同、不贊同、調降及無推薦等組別，並分辨出經紀商是否具有關聯性，然後計算這些組別在增資時的宣告報酬率及折價程度。本研究預期，具有經紀商正向推薦的公司 (尤其是來自無關聯的經紀商) ，增資宣告的報酬率下跌程度較低，承銷折價程度會較高...|$|R

Her start in the film industry was not a smooth ride. [...] "Rukhe Darao", her first movie, did not {{do well in the}} box office as she was deemed to be too conservative for films. She was under pressure to change this tag and appeared in a bolder role in her next movie [...] "Varate Khuni". The movie did not fare well but Shahara caught the eyes as she shed clothes, flaunted skin in exotic revealing outfits. This change in appearance brought her the break she wanted. She signed a plethora of new action films, the most coveted genre of that era. One of them named [...] "Bishakto Chokh", a big budget movie starring super star Rubel and Reaz, was the film that brought her fame and also raised a few eyebrows. Shahara shelved her conservative tag completely and even appeared in lingerie {{in front of the camera}} in a smoking hot song with superstar Rubel.

This song brought her tremendous success as more and more directors were interested in taking her in their movies. She was a leading action film heroine at the end of the year 2005.In 2008, the demand of romantic flick was at all-time high and Shahara, mainly an action film heroine, was thought be in trouble.
