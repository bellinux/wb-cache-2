40|$|ABSTRACT. Geologically, the Barents Sea is {{a complex}} mosaic of basins and platforms. It {{underwent}} intracontinental sedimentation from about 240 million years ago to the early Cenozoic, about 60 million years ago, after which it bordered the developing Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Geophysical investigations began during the 1970 s, and the first offshore drilling occurred in the early 1980 s. In Norwegian waters, drilling has proven 260 â€“ 300 billion cubic meters of gas, with minor oil. Most of the reserves are contained in Jurassic sandstones. Exploration problems include the predominance of gas over oil and leakage of hydrocarbons from traps in recent geological time; both are connected with the intense erosion of the Barents Shelf that {{took place during the}} Cenozoic. Exploration efforts currently focus on new targets in areas such as the Finnmark Platform, the Nordkapp Basin, the Western Margin, and the area between 74 Ëš 30 'N and Spitsbergen. Oil accumulations have been discovered in Russian waters offshore from the Timan-Pechora Basin. However, major sedimentary basins west of Novaya Zemlya have yielded the most significant results. The largest finds include the Stokmanovskaya and Ludlovskaya supergiant gas fields. Stokmanovskaya alone has gas reserves in the order of 2500 billion cubic meters. Seismic surveys have documented a large inventory of untested structures, and further resources are probably present in the disputed area between Norwegian and Russian waters. Options for commercial development of both Norwegian and Russian discoveries are currently being evaluated. These include the possible export of liquefied natural gas from the Norwegian SnÃ¸hvit Field to the European market. A consortium has carried out feasibility studies on the Russian Stokmanovskaya Field, and gas export solutions are being evaluated. In general, economic exploitation is hindered by the low price of natural gas, the distance to potential markets, difficult logistics, restricted <b>drilling</b> <b>seasons</b> and environmental concerns...|$|R

40|$|Jack-ups {{have been}} {{constructed}} for numerous ocean environments, but to date {{there has been no}} operating experience under Arctic sea ice conditions. The current state of jack-up technology does not allow working outside the ice-free season and thus ice management will be needed to extend the <b>drilling</b> <b>season.</b> Currently, ice load calculations are reasonably well defined for level ice, while the ice loads due to managed ice are not known evenly well. In order to extend the <b>drilling</b> <b>season</b> for multi-legged jack-up structures by means of ice management, a better understanding of managed ice loads is required. To this purpose, the relation between level ice loads and managed ice loads on a multi-legged jack-up structure is investigated. Experiments for a 4 -leg jack-up model were carried out in the ice tank of the Hamburgische Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt (HSVA) in Germany, at a scaling ratio of 1 : 32. Two ice thicknesses (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m full scale) and three model orientations (0 Â°, 22. 5 Â° and 45 Â°) were tested. Additionally, ice concentration (level ice, 8 / 10 th and 6 / 10 th) and ice velocity (0. 5 m/s and 1. 0 m/s full scale) were varied.

This type of drill is also modular allowing for expansion to provide more heat if necessary without constructing an entirely new drill. Discovery of bubbles in the ice at 1000 m required expansion of drilling capability to drill holes 2000 m deep to accommodate 13 -inch spheres. We did this by adding more heating and pumping capacity and a larger hose. The successful AMANDA drilling experiences and the analysis of the data returned from the AMANDA spheres has led to the IceCube project proposal. This project will require drilling 80 âˆ¿ 60 -cm diameter holes to 2400 m. This paper describes the design of a production hot-water drill called Wotan that is capable of drilling 16 such holes per <b>drilling</b> <b>season...</b>|$|E

Silicoflagellates, ebridians, and a chrysophyte cyst provide supporting biostratigraphical information. More than 100 dominantly planktic diatom taxa are recognised. Of these, more than 30 are treated informally, pending SEM examination and formal description. Many other taxa are noted only to generic level. Lower Oligocene (c. 31 Ma) through lower Miocene (c. 18. 5 Ma) diatoms occur from 28 mbsf down to 565 mbsf. Below this level, {{to the bottom of}} the hole at 624. 15 mbsf, diatom assemblages are poorly-preserved and many samples are barren. A biostratigraphic zonal framework, consisting of ten diatom zones, is proposed for the Antarctic continental shelf. Ages inferred from the diatom biostratigraphy correspond well with geochronological data from argon dating of volcanic materials and strontium dating of calcareous macrofossils, as well as nannofossil biochronological datums. The biochronostratigraphical record from CRP- 2 / 2 A provides an important record of diatom events and mid-Cenozoic environmental changes in the Antarctic neritic zone...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) programâ€”a {{collaboration}} between Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States {{that is one}} of the larger programs endorsed by the International Polar Year (IPY; [URL] www. ipy. org) â€”successfully completed the drilling phase of the Southern McMurdo Sound (SMS) Project in December 2007. This second drill core of the programâ€™s campaign in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica, complements the results of the first <b>drilling</b> <b>season</b> [Naish et al., 2007] by penetrating deeper into the stratigraphic section in the Victoria Land Basin and extending the recovered time interval back to approximately 20 million years ago. The primary objectives of ANDRILL ([URL] www. andrill. org/) were to recover stratigraphic records from the Antarctic continental margin that document key steps in Antarcticaâ€™s Cenozoic (0 - to 65 -million- year- old) climatic and glacial history, and in the tectonic evolution of the Transantarctic Mountains and the West Antarctic Rift System [Harwood et al., 2006]. These two ANDRILL stratigraphic drill cores are guiding the understanding of the speed, size, and frequency of the past 20 million years of glacial and interglacial changes in the Antarctic region. The drill cores will help to establish, through their correlation to existing records and their integration with climate and ice sheet models, how these local changes relate to regional and global events...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{petroleum}} {{drilling in}} harsh and cold environment, {{like in the}} Barents Sea, can be challenging and risky due to the prevailing weather condition. How the physical environment affects systems, components, and working environment has to be enlightened in order to operate safely. The vulnerable environment, remoteness, and possible outcomes if an accident occurs are of great concern. The society, the regulatory authority, and involved industries such as fishery, expect and demand that the risk shall be in an acceptable limit. The thesis will looks into one specific area in the Barents Sea; the location is south and east from the BjÃ¸rnÃ¸ya Island. The main objective is to find important environmental risk influencing factors that influences the safety of petroleum drilling in the region. The purpose {{of this is to}} find vulnerable areas and to state if it is possible to achieve an acceptable risk level for drilling operation in the region. The scope will be to look at factors that may affect the drilling process. The thesis is delimited to only consider environmental risk influencing factors that may affect the topside drilling process. The methodology used in this thesis is mainly theoretical. It is a literature study where existing acts, regulations, experience, and technology regarding the topic is analysed and compared with the physical environment in the region. The analysis performed in the thesis indicates that there is several environmental risk influencing factors that may influence drilling operations in the Western Barents Sea. The interaction of the risk influencing factors are complex and can in many situations have a negative synergy effect on systems, components, equipment, and working environment. Based on the risk evaluation performed in the thesis, the risk level for drilling operations will be within an acceptable limit if it is optimized. It is possible to reduce the risk to an acceptable limit if the <b>drilling</b> <b>season</b> is narrowed to summers or if winterized structures are used.
