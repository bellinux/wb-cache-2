25|$|Mithal al-Alusi, {{a secular}} Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid {{a heavy price}} for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as {{terrorist}} organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunmen opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed.

Alusi returned to Israel for a second visit in September 2008. Upon his return to Iraq, he was stripped of parliamentary immunity so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>face</b> charges of traveling illicitly to Israel.

500|$|Other teams, however, {{had more}} serious {{interest}} in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club {{president and general}} manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals. Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him. In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>face</b> the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily—a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military. Robinson was aghast: [...] "Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?" [...] Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player [...] "with guts enough not to fight back." [...] After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to [...] "turn the other cheek" [...] to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today. Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs, instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts' not containing a reserve clause. Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith, writer for the black weekly Pittsburgh Courier, who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck [...] "influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson, for which he's never completely gotten credit." ...|$|E

[...] "...I figured that because Anarky represents the epitome of reason, one of the biggest crises <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>face</b> would be to discover that his father was the exact opposite: a raving lunatic!" [...] Alternatively, Grant saw it as an opportunity to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise.|$|E
