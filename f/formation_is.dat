5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{discovered}} in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99.6 million years. This <b>formation</b> <b>is</b> the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein {{it is part of}} the Río Limay Subgroup. The <b>formation</b> <b>is</b> composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind).

5|$|The Morrison <b>Formation</b> <b>is</b> a {{sequence}} of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This <b>formation</b> <b>is</b> interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This <b>formation</b> <b>is</b> similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.|$|E

40|$|Iron <b>formations</b> <b>are</b> {{economically}} important {{sedimentary rocks}} {{that are most}} common in Precambrian sedi-mentary successions. Although many aspects of their origin remain unresolved, it is widely accepted that sec-ular changes {{in the style of}} their deposition are linked to environmental and geochemical evolution of Earth. Two types of Precambrian iron <b>formations</b> have <b>been</b> recognized with respect to their depositional setting. Al-goma-type iron <b>formations</b> <b>are</b> interlayered with or stratigraphically linked to submarine-emplaced volcanic rocks in greenstone belts and, in some cases, with volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits. In contrast, larger Superior-type iron <b>formations</b> <b>are</b> developed in passive-margin sedimentary rock successions and gener-ally lack direct relationships with volcanic rocks. The early distinction made between these two iron-formation types, although mimimized by later studies, remains a valid first approximation. Texturally, iron <b>formations</b> <b>were</b> also divided into two groups. Banded iron <b>formation</b> (BIF) <b>is</b> dominant in Archean to earliest Paleopro-terozoic successions, whereas granular iron <b>formation</b> (GIF) <b>is</b> much more common in Paleoproterozoic suc-cessions.

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after <b>formation</b> <b>is</b> favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as the Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west.
