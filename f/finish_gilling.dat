[...] He further noted that midtempo songs like [...] "Only If for a Night", [...] "No Light, No Light" [...] and [...] "What the Water Gave Me", [...] "are soulful, spooky, and bold, allowing room for both Welch and her machine to strut their stuff without sounding like a murder of caged crows." [...] Rob Tannenbaum of Rolling Stone gave a positive review for the album saying, [...] "While the harp, violins and choir remain delicate, Welch erupts into wild, simmering high notes, most notably on 'No Light, No Light.' Her singing is stunning; this should be credited to Florence and the Vibrato." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent wrote in his review: [...] "The strictures of the Unplugged format don't impact too much upon Florence & the Machine, thanks to their semi-acoustic roots, so when she opens this MTV performance with 'Only If for a Night', the piano, harp and drums are more like familiar old hands than brave new departure." [...] He noted that [...] "What does give the ghost story new character is the 10-piece gospel choir, which, combined with the strings, adds depth to its mystery." [...] <b>Gill</b> <b>finished</b> his review by noting that it was [...] "an impressive show, but not one likely to persuade doubters".|$|R
