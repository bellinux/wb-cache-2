25|$|I {{never thought}} that I could win this tournament, but I don't know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the future. I am sure I will play more both in Asia and Europe, but my {{ultimate}} target is to get onto the US Tour.|$|E
500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think {{we thought it was}} a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} have said and Senator Kerry has said that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> order {{to get us out of}} the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
5000|$|... "What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{differently}} <b>in</b> {{this type}} of situation next time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pecksniff,' cried Martin, in a tremble, 'what {{does all}} this mean? You are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>in</b> haste, you may regret!' ...|$|R
60|$|You {{need not}} be afraid. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. <b>In</b> any case I must {{preserve}} the native respect for the white man.|$|R
2500|$|My {{feeling was}} one of {{confidence}} when Spruance was there. When you moved into Admiral Halsey's command from Admiral Spruance's … you moved [...] {{an area in which}} you never knew what you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the next five minutes or how {{you were going to do}} it, because the printed instructions were never up to date.... He never did things the same way twice. When you moved into Admiral Spruance's command, the printed instructions were up to date, and you did things in accordance with them.|$|E
2500|$|On August 10, 2010, Nita Hanson, a {{black woman}} married to a white man, called Schlessinger's show to ask for {{advice on how to}} deal with a husband who did not care when she was the subject of racist {{comments}} by acquaintances. Schlessinger first replied that [...] "some people are hypersensitive" [...] and asked for some examples from the caller. Hanson informed Schlessinger that her acquaintances had stated, [...] "How you black people do this? You black people like doing that." [...] Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that [...] "a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black. Didn't matter what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> office; it was a black thing. You gotta' know that. That's not a surprise." [...] Schlessinger continued by telling the caller that she had a [...] "chip on [...] shoulder," [...] was [...] "sensitive," [...] and also, [...] "Don't NAACP me," [...] and, [...] "a lot of what I hear from black think… it's really distressing and disturbing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow morning!" [...] exclaimed Martin-Roget in {{a passion}} of fury. [...] "And what the d----l am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the meanwhile?" ...|$|E
5000|$|They say San José is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{become another}} Los Angeles. Believe me, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{everything}} <b>in</b> {{my power to}} make that come true. [...] "Dutch" [...] Hamann, 1965 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bithri is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>in</b> style," [...] Dick laughed to his brother. [...] "I shouldn't mind some iced sherbet at present, {{if he has}} got any to spare." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whenever Ted Nugent's {{character}} Skunk Tarver is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>in</b> {{the movie}} Beer for My Horses the intros to [...] "Cat Scratch Fever" [...] and [...] "Stranglehold" [...] are played.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a great deal. But I try to {{make enough}} {{to pay the rent}} and store bills. May I ask what you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> New York?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hastings looked thoughtful. [...] "Well," [...] she observed, [...] "I {{believe you}} were wise, but that opens up another question. What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the meanwhile?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] {{said the}} Squire in astonishment, for George {{had never been}} known {{to go out of}} his own county before. [...] "Why, what on earth are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of course, she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good <b>in</b> person. What {{she wants}} is the {{sensation}} of doing good--of seeing and hearing the results of her beneficence. She'd care very little about it if she didn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{precisely}} and {{exactly what she}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Go <b>in</b> <b>to</b> your supper, and I will push him about until you come out again. Then you can {{show me how to}} put him to bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The shock {{would have}} dropped a man {{raised in the}} cities right off, but I think we'll pull him round," [...] he said. [...] "Still, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a day or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{help feeling}} sorry for the husband {{of a person who}} {{mistakes}} herself to that extent. What is Mr. Grosvenor Green <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Paris while she's working her way into the Salon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{looked out}} across the sea, and he {{repeated}} her question to himself. What was he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this great, strange land, whose ways were not his ways, and whose sympathies lay so far apart from his? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not try {{to shield}} him, Miss Bartlett. I know him better than you do. He is a very lazy and heedless boy, and I have already {{made up my mind}} what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} up my mind to change them. But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>in</b> New York. Mr. Pett is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give me a job in his office. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> start at the bottom and work my way still further down." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> travel, <b>do</b> it <b>in</b> style. Besides, a Rolls Royce Phantom II doesn't {{have enough}} seats." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, {{you must}} {{let me stay}} for five minutes. I have {{made up my mind}} what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to-night <b>in</b> the House. The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven. [A chair falls in the drawing-room.] What is that? ...|$|R
6000|$|Bartley quaffed {{half of it}} in {{tolerant}} content. [...] "I always do. Find {{it takes}} my nerves {{down at the end}} of a hard week's work. Well, now, tell me some thing about yourself. What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Illinois?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} pretty in its way," [...] I said at last, [...] "but it's a dream. Let's come back to reality. What I want to know is, what are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Brompton, let us say, or Walham Green NOW?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! Of course! I {{understand}} that. Well, I don't want {{to hurry}} you. Seen that old fellow of yours yet? I {{think we ought}} to have that translation in the first number; don't you? We want to give 'em a notion of what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> that line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Balderdash!" [...] said Sir William, when he {{had read}} the letter. [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> that way. It was all very well <b>going</b> <b>to</b> that Serjeant as he has the case in hand, though a worse {{messenger}} in an affair of love--" ...|$|R
50|$|Arthur {{is trapped}} inside his office. Alone against the world. But his main enemy, {{the author of}} the video, {{turns out to be a}} widow who is {{convinced}} that it was Arthur who drove her husband to suicide. She is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything <b>in</b> her power to drive him off the deep end.|$|R
6000|$|And then? What sort {{of working}} {{arrangements}} are our renascent owning and directing classes {{likely to make}} with the new labouring class? How is the work <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>in</b> the harder, cleaner, more equalised, and better managed State that, in one's hopeful mood, one sees ahead of us? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{be three}} weeks, anyway, {{before you get}} your new deck in, {{and it may be}} longer," [...] said Valentine. [...] "All the {{carpenters}} on this coast are going up to the new railroad trestles, where they're getting almost any price they ask. What are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the meanwhile?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a while. In {{the first}} place, you need rest, and secondly, those men will soon {{come back to}} find you, after which a hunt is certain {{to be made for}} both of us. Hold on until we see what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> order to the better decide upon our own course of action." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But oh, what's the use? I can't ever be {{anything}} but a dub! Cleaning my nails, to make a hit with a girl that's got hands like hers! It's a long trail to Seattle, but it's a darn sight longer one to being--being--well, sophisticated. Oh! And incidentally, what the deuce am I <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Seattle if I do get there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "I could not. The Artesian ray kept {{me awake}} nearly all night, and I felt that I must quiet {{my mind as}} soon as I could by giving it {{something}} real and tangible to take hold of. Now {{what is it that}} you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Anything <b>in</b> the ship line?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A month, anyway, {{and quite}} likely six weeks; that is, {{before you could}} let him start out on the trail. I don't quite know what we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him <b>in</b> the meanwhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know just}} {{how you feel about}} it, you {{daughter}} of Eve," [...] she said, with gay sympathy, [...] "but December roads are damp, and if you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk to Marrs' you are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it <b>in</b> those frivolous Parisian concoctions, even with overboots on; so be brave, dear heart, and show that you have a soul above little red satin shoes." ...|$|R
