25|$|As time passed, Tarlton {{began to}} lose some of its importance. The state capital was moved from nearby Chillicothe (its last {{location}} outside Columbus) to Columbus, Ohio in 1816, and the National Road (present U.S. Route 40 or more roughly Interstate 70) went {{through the center of}} Ohio. This road started at Baltimore and ending in Illinois. So, the focus of commerce in Ohio shifted from the communities along Zane's Trace {{to the center of the}} state. Among the cities the National Road crossed was Springfield, Ohio, where it arrived in 1836 and stopped for ten years while lawmakers argued about where it would <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> Located at that terminus, Springfield especially boomed during those ten years.|$|E

25|$|The romancers' {{versions}} of Camelot drew on earlier descriptions of Arthur's fabulous court. From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants. Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral {{tradition of the}} grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale Culhwch and Olwen, associated with the Mabinogion and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> on great adventures, placing it in Celliwig, an uncertain locale in Cornwall. Although the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various {{versions of}} the Welsh Triads agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one {{in each of the}} areas inhabited by the Celtic Britons: Cornwall, Wales and the Hen Ogledd. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as Arthur's Seat, indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as Brittany. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location. Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and London perhaps being the most prominent.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} {{to delve into}} Bobby's backstory was the third season's [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me".

However, the writers could not determine where to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> Following writer Cathryn Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically-possessed wife.|$|E

500|$|On 30 July 2002, Neil Wilkes from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Taylor had quit Coronation Street after five years. Wilkes revealed that her contract would expire in October that year, but the actress {{had chosen to}} stay with the serial beyond that to give the writers time {{to come up with a}} storyline for her character's departure. Series producer Kieran Roberts added that he was sorry to see Taylor go, but understood her decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> and couldn't think what she could do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her." [...] Taylor filmed her final scenes on 3 January 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Björk {{has since}} {{stated that the}} album was not [...] "hip hop" [...] {{and that she had}} not {{intended}} for it to be so. She said that {{she did not want to}} work with Timbaland as a [...] "hitmaker", or because of his affiliation to a particular genre, but wanted to work with him solely as a musician in his own right. Björk has also explained that when the two of them were together, Timbaland asked Björk what kind of music she would like to make with him, for example a hit song or [...] "something weird", and Björk replied that she was interested in finding out where they [...] "overlapped" [...] musically, and they would <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> The result was a tribal sound, because they were both interested in it. She has also said that One Little Indian [...] "always feel that ‘my latest release is the most commercial to date’", and that she feels Volta is no more commercial than any of her previous work.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music in}} Orchid {{combines}} elements influenced by progressive rock and acoustics pieces of folk {{music to the}} black metal scream and the death metal growl, as well having clean vocals. It also contains influences from jazz and melodic passages played by a piano and acoustic guitars. Opeth sounded much different than the casual black or death metal bands {{at that time and}} it's the closest album that the band came to the black genre. Critics described the sound of the album as it being [...] "unique". Jim Raggi wrote [...] "If you're wanting the more deathy and song oriented Opeth, skip down to My Arms, Your Hearse and <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> If you're looking for a unique journey of music built alternately around dual guitar harmonies knocking into sequences when the two guitars and the bass are all playing different parts, stop-start transitions at times and smooth here-to-theres at others, here you go." [...] Matt Smith stated that [...] "with Orchid, the band introduced its blend of intricate, down-tempo acoustic guitar and piano lines and swinging, Celtic-sounding, distorted rhythms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tamouridis' team-mate Miguel Mínguez {{attacked}} on the climb, and was {{the last}} member of the breakaway to be brought back by the main field, eventually doing so with [...] remaining. There were several mini-attacks from there, lasting {{all the way to}} the foot of the other climb, the Croce Ferrata, where 's Sylvain Georges attacked out of a six-rider move at the bottom; he managed to establish a maximum lead of over a minute, before [...] moved to the front of the peloton. 's Danilo Di Luca and Robinson Chalapud (...) attacked out of the peloton and soon passed Georges on the road, maintaining a small gap over the main field. Di Luca launched a long sprint for the line, doing so from around [...] out, and was not caught until [...] to <b>go.</b> <b>From</b> <b>there,</b> 's Enrico Battaglin finished strongest to take the biggest win of his short professional career, by two lengths ahead of Sella's team-mate Fabio Felline and the 's Giovanni Visconti, who had earlier done enough to regain the mountains classification lead. Paolini retained the maglia rosa after finishing tenth on the stage.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} 2001, {{the band}} reconvened to record its fourth album. After {{spending}} four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album [...] "just didn't sound right" [...] and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band {{was on the verge}} of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the Coachella Festival, with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the One by One album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there.</b> The group went and re-recorded nearly all of the album (save [...] "Tired of You") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, Virginia. The original version of One by One, referred by the band as [...] "Million Dollar Demos", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.|$|E

2500|$|With most of {{the album}} being revamped, other musicians joined the project, {{including}} Midi Mafia, RedOne, Toby Gad, Frank Ocean, and Brian Kennedy, the latter of which was consulted to replace Cox as the album's executive producer. Together, they crafted a bunch of new songs, including [...] "Freedom", [...] "One Thing" [...] and [...] "Today" [...] which Norwood later described as sounding [...] "more true to the sound" [...] that she had initially envisioned for the album. However, in early 2008, her A manager, Brandon Creed, presented Norwood several demo tracks that were produced by Rodney Jerkins, including [...] "Right Here (Departed)". Her former main producer on previous albums such as Never Say Never (1998) and Full Moon (2002), Jerkins hadn't worked with Norwood since 2002, due to conflicting schedules and a disagreement on her decision to work with Timbaland on Afrodisiac in 2003. Again, the album was reconstructed, with Jerkins taking over executive duties. On her decision to collaborate with Jerkins, Norwood commented: [...] "With Rodney being the person who produced , I, of course, wanted to <b>go</b> <b>from</b> <b>there</b> because of our history and all the music we have made in the past. It felt like {{the right thing to}} do [...] I wanted to see where that chemistry would take us creatively this time round." [...] With Jerkins on board, providing the bulk of Human, the sound of the album shifted drastically, with Norwood and her team abandoning most R records in favour of his international pop sounds.|$|E
