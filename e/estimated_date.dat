5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of completion was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of the ribbon and an opening of the gates {{at each end of the}} lift span. In return he was presented with a silver cigarette case.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> for the Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often {{used in the}} panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a Freedom of Information request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E

25|$|The {{fragment}} of papyrus was {{among a group}} acquired on the Egyptian market in 1920 by Bernard Grenfell. The original transcription and translation of the {{fragment of}} text was not done until 1934, by Colin H. Roberts. Roberts found comparator hands in dated papyrus documents between the late 1st and mid 2nd centuries, with the largest concentration of Hadrianic date (117 CE to 138 CE). Since this gospel text {{would be unlikely to}} have reached Egypt before c. 100 CE he proposed a date {{in the first half of}} the 2nd century. Roberts proposed the closest match to 52 as being an undated papyrus of the Iliad conserved in Berlin; and in the 70 years since Roberts's essay the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of this primary comparator hand has been confirmed as being around 100 CE, but other dated comparator hands have also since been suggested, with dates ranging into the second half of the 2nd century, and even into the 3rd century.|$|E
25|$|In {{talks between}} Prime Minister Erlander and Commander-in-Chief Swedlund in 1959, Erlander {{confirmed}} that the program on enhanced defense research would give results {{with regard to the}} warhead design. He emphasized, however, that he was uncertain about the effect it would have on the nuclear weapons issue and would delay the final decision on production until closer to the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of completion in 1963. Thus, Palme preferred to postpone the crucial decision for years, with the goal of avoiding a serious split in the party, as opposed to a difficult compromise necessary to satisfy the desires of both sides for the long run. The implication of this doctrine meant that almost any nuclear weapons research could be pursued under the terms “defense research” and “freedom of action”, while the Social Democratic leadership and the government had partially included the nuclear opponents’ lines in their public declarations. With the nuclear opponents essentially co-opted, AMSA's activity was diminished, and the Swedish peace movement started focusing primarily on advocating reduction of nuclear arsenals in the major nuclear powers. When the government brought up the issue in 1961, Erlander said that he himself now swung in the negative direction regarding the nuclear program, as compared to his views 3–4 years earlier, which he had never announced publicly. The decision that was expected {{to be made in the}} coming years remained suspended. The research was continued and the freedom of action doctrine was intact. Erlander's scientific adviser, Torsten Gustafson, was one of those advocating for the continued investment in research.|$|E
500|$|Others have disagreed, {{and more}} recent {{research}} has suggested the strain may have originated in a nonhuman, mammalian species. An <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> for its appearance in mammalian hosts has been put at the period 1882–1913. This ancestor virus diverged about 1913–1915 into two clades (or biological groups), which {{gave rise to the}} classical swine and human H1N1 influenza lineages. The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, [...] they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.|$|E

500|$|In September 1970, bidding began for {{the final}} portion of the {{northern}} half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5; a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR94, and SR54 to 12th Street had funding allocated. By {{the end of the}} year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bid of around $7.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for the northernmost portion. The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to LStreet was completed in February 1971; by then, the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972. By March, the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972. A 102-home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.|$|E
500|$|The major {{diversification}} {{amongst the}} Angiosperms (flowering plants) can be dated {{to the end}} of the Early Cretaceous period which stretched from 146 to 100 million years ago (mya). The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy, starting with Charles Bessey's The phylogenetic taxonomy of flowering plants (1915) suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest monocots, with an <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of origin of 124mya for the stem node (most recent common ancestor of the clade of interest and its sister clade) age and between 117mya to 82mya for the crown node (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) age. Molecular analysis suggests that the Liliaceae sensu APG ("core Liliales") were part of one of four early clades of Liliales, namely Campynemataceae, Melanthiaceae, Alstroemeriaceae + Luzuriagaceae + Colchicaceae and Smilacaceae + Liliaceae, dated to 68–65mya (stem node) with the separation of the Smilaceae and Liliaceae sister clades (crown node) occurring later at around 55–52mya. [...] divergence within the Liliaceae appeared at about 36–34mya, within Liliaceae sensu Tamura (Lilioideae s.l.) at 27mya, Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren (Lilieae s.s. and Tulipeae) at 20mya (Miocene).|$|E
500|$|Over {{the last}} several {{thousand}} years a series of large landslides have occurred {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River Gorge, sending massive amounts of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak into the gorge near the present site of Bonneville Dam. The most recent and significant is known as the Bonneville Slide, which formed a massive earthen dam, filling [...] of the river's length. Various studies have placed the date of the Bonneville Slide anywhere between 1060 and 1760 AD; the idea that the landslide debris present today was formed by more than one slide is relatively recent and may explain the large range of estimates. It has been suggested that if the later dates are accurate there may be a link with the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The pile of debris resulting from the Bonneville Slide blocked the river until rising water finally washed away the sediment. It is not known how long it took the river to break through the barrier; estimates range from several months to several years. Much of the landslide's debris remained, forcing the river about [...] south of its previous channel and forming the Cascade Rapids. In 1938, the construction of Bonneville Dam inundated the rapids as well as the remaining trees that could be used to refine the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of the landslide.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 September 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they would order 36 new trains from Ansaldo, with an option for an additional 40 units. Each train would cost 50million Norwegian krone (NOK), and NSB had 28 months to use their option. NSB's CEO, Osmund Ueland, stated that Ansaldo had been chosen because they had the best technical offer and had by far the lowest price. The new trains would have 35% lower maintenance costs and use 33% less electricity than the Class 69. The new trains would also have a higher maximum speed, have wider doors and make less noise. The electronics would be delivered by Ansaldo, the superstructure by Breda and the bogies by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM). The <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of delivery for the trains was from 1 July 2000 to 1 July 2001. The exterior and interior design was made by Pininfarina, with assistance from NSB's own designers. The latter were used to tailor the design to the Norwegian public's preferences, which among other things involved use of wood in the interior. [...] At the time, Ansaldo also had an order for the Oslo Tramway's SL95.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about the early life of this {{important}} early Tudor composer, and his date and place of birth are currently unknown. However, on 27 November 1510 he supplicated for the degree of BMus at Oxford University, proposing for his examination an oration on the volumes of Boethius, and the submission (and performance) of a mass and an antiphon. He stated that he had studied music in the University Music School for eight years (suggesting that he must have been in his mid-20s by that date, hence the <b>estimated</b> <b>date</b> of birth of around 1485). Presumably his study of Boethius was of the 6th century philosopher's De Institutione Musica which had been published in Venice in 1491 and 1492 (one of the first musical works to be published). The University records show that his examination was successful, and the University ordered that the University Proctors supervising the examination should retain the two manuscripts. It seems most likely that these were Aston's five part Missa Te Deum Laudamus and the clearly associated antiphon Te Deum Laudamus. Though the original manuscripts are not in Music School archives today, excellent early copies of ca. 1528-30 almost certainly made for Cardinal's College (now Christ Church) Oxford [...] are in the Forrest-Heather Part Books now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.|$|E
