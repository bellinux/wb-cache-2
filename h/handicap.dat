5|$|In May, McMahon signed another <b>Handicap</b> match, {{with the}} Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead the Spirit Squad {{attacked}} Michaels, and, {{as part of}} the storyline, shattered his knee with a steel chair. McMahon brought Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, after Triple H felt that the Squad had disrespected him, he attacked the group. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on the Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in <b>handicap</b> tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination <b>handicap</b> match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} attitudes of parents of school-aged and preschool aged children with and without <b>handicaps,</b> toward the issue of mainstreaming. A sample of 212 individuals responded to a parent questionnaire which was mailed to each household to be completed by both parents. This questionnaire examined attitudes and concerns of parents across 14 mainstreaming issues (Appendix 2). Of the total sample, 123 responses were used for the final analysis. Cases were discarded because some were missing the age of their child, some we::e not qualified because of their child 2 ̆ 7 s age, and others had not completed the survey. Regarding overall attitudes toward mainstreaming, there was a significant interaction between <b>handicapping</b> condition and sex of parent. Fathers of <b>handicapped</b> children disagreed more with the attitude questions than mother-s of <b>handicapped</b> childr-en. Also, the <b>handicapping</b> condition of the child affected parental attitudes about problems which a <b>handicapped</b> child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation. Parents of nonhandicapped children disagreed more with these issues than parents of <b>handicapped</b> children. Fathers of <b>handicapped</b> and nonhandicapped children agreed more than mothers that there might be problems encounter-ed by <b>handicapped</b> children in a mainstreaming situation. Mothers of nonhandicapped children and fathers of <b>handicapped</b> children disagreed more with these statements. The interaction between sex of parents and <b>handicapping</b> condition of the child was found to be significant for the dependent variables of overall mainstreaming attitudes and attitudes toward problems which a <b>handicapped</b> child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation. Another significant independent variable was <b>handicapping</b> condition of the child which was found to be significant on attitudes toward problems which a <b>handicapped</b> child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation and attitudes toward safety issues of both <b>handicapped</b> and nonhandicapped children in a mainstreaming situation. In other words, parents of <b>handicapped</b> children were more children were more concerned about school related problems and safety issues for <b>handicapped</b> children in a mainstLeaming situation. Age of the child was not found significant for- any of the dependent variables. In addition, the interaction of <b>handicapping</b> condition and age of the child was found to be significant for the dependent var-iable which dealt with attitudes toward safety of both <b>handicapped</b> and dealt with attitudes toward safety issues of both <b>handicapped</b> and nonhandicapped children.

40|$|Negative {{attitudes toward}} the <b>handicapped</b> still exist. Children begin to form attitudes when very young. Educators, support {{personnel}} within the school system, and parents {{play a major role}} in shaping the attitudes of young children. Exposing children to the <b>handicapped</b> and providing educational programs about the <b>handicapped</b> are two primary methods used to promote positive attitudes. This study compared the attitudes of students in four different school settings demonstrating situations with <b>handicapped</b> children and/or an educational program about the <b>handicapped.</b> The results showed a significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) more positive attitude in settings having <b>handicapped</b> children. In settings where there were <b>handicapped</b> children and an educational program, the data suggests that the primary influence toward positive attitudes came from the presence of the <b>handicapped,</b> not from having an educational program. However, having an educational program promotes a significantly (p 3 ̆c. 05) better attitude than having neither a program or <b>handicapped</b> children...|$|R
5|$|The {{question}} of whether selection of signals works {{at the level of}} the individual organism or gene, or {{at the level of the}} group, has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins, arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better, including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the <b>handicap</b> principle, where the best horse in a <b>handicap</b> race is the one carrying the largest <b>handicap</b> weight. According to Zahavi's theory, signallers such as male peacocks have 'tails' that are genuinely handicaps, being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the <b>handicap</b> principle, but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene (diploidy) would make to honest signalling, demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection. The evolutionary equilibrium depends sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.|$|E

40|$|Self-handicapping {{is one of}} the {{strategies}} people use when facing potential failure. Paper presents new scale for assessing self-handicapping tendency as relatively stable trait, as well as its relations with personality traits, sex and age. Self-handicapping questionnaire and shortened form of Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire were administered to 230 participants of both sexes, age 18 to 59. Confirmatory factor analysis shows that model with four latent dimensions, encompassed by a higher-order latent dimension, fits the data well. Those lower order dimensions correspond to originally created scales: External <b>handicaps</b> in interpersonal area, Internal <b>handicaps</b> in interpersonal area, Internal <b>handicaps</b> in achievement area and External <b>handicaps</b> in achievement area. Results of MANCOVA shows that Neuroticism is predictor of all dimensions of self- <b>handicapping.</b> Impulsive sensation seeking predicts choice of external <b>handicaps</b> in interpersonal area, as well as internal <b>handicaps</b> in achievement area.
