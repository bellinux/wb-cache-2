5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many were {{relieved}} {{to have survived}} {{the worst of the}} Category4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and <b>freezers.</b> Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
25|$|Dried {{and smoked}} salmon were usually stored in smokehouses, <b>freezers,</b> or caches {{belonging}} {{to the head of}} the salmon production unit. Salted fish were kept in buckets or wooden barrels and were stored in the house, entryway, cache, or smokehouse. Frozen salmon were kept in household <b>freezers.</b> Whole frozen coho salmon, used for dog food, were sometimes stored outside in underground pits.|$|E
50|$|Inside the <b>freezer,</b> air is {{circulated}} {{by means}} {{of one or more}} fans. In a typical design cold air from the <b>freezer</b> compartment is ducted to the fresh food compartment and circulated back into the <b>freezer</b> compartment. Air circulation helps sublimate any ice or frost that may form on frozen items in the <b>freezer</b> compartment.|$|R

25|$|The dietary {{building}} was located directly behind Reed Hall and connected through suspended walkways. Built {{in the early}} 1900s and designed by Frederick John Osterling, this building contained the main kitchen at Dixmont, the large <b>freezers,</b> and storage areas where food was kept. The cafeteria and auditorium were located on the second floor. Also part of this building were the loading docks, cleaning supplies, and staff quarters on the third floor.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prepared}} frozen meals {{first became}} {{widely available in}} the late 1970s. Since then they have steadily grown in popularity with the increased ownership of home <b>freezers</b> and microwave ovens. Demographic trends such as the growth of smaller households have also influenced the sale of this {{and other types of}} convenience food. In 2003, the United Kingdom spent £5 million a day on ready meals, and was the largest consumer in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{refrigerator}}/freezers {{have the}} <b>freezer</b> {{on top and}} the refrigerator on the bottom. Most refrigerator-freezers—except for manual defrost models or cheaper units—use {{what appears to be}} two thermostats. Only the refrigerator compartment is properly temperature controlled. When the refrigerator gets too warm, the thermostat starts the cooling process and a fan circulates the air around the <b>freezer.</b> During this time, the refrigerator also gets colder. The <b>freezer</b> control knob only controls the amount of air that flows into the refrigerator via a damper system. Changing the refrigerator temperature will inadvertently change the <b>freezer</b> temperature in the opposite direction. Changing the <b>freezer</b> temperature will have no effect on the refrigerator temperature. The <b>freezer</b> control may also be adjusted to compensate for any refrigerator adjustment.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>freezer</b> units {{accumulated}} {{ice crystals}} around the freezing units. This {{was a result}} of humidity introduced into the units when the doors to the <b>freezer</b> were opened condensing on the cold parts, then freezing. This frost buildup required periodic thawing ("defrosting") of the units to maintain their efficiency. Manual Defrost (referred to as Cyclic) units are still available. Advances in automatic defrosting eliminating the thawing task were introduced in the 1950s, but are not universal, due to energy performance and cost. These units used a counter that only defrosted the <b>freezer</b> compartment (<b>Freezer</b> Chest) when a specific number of door openings had been made. The units were just a small timer combined with an electrical heater wire that heated the <b>freezer's</b> walls for {{a short amount of time}} to remove all traces of frost/frosting. Also, early units featured <b>freezer</b> compartments located within the larger refrigerator, and accessed by opening the refrigerator door, and then the smaller internal <b>freezer</b> door; units featuring an entirely separate <b>freezer</b> compartment were introduced in the early 1960s, becoming the industry standard by the middle of that decade.These older <b>freezer</b> compartments were the main cooling body of the refrigerator, and only maintained a temperature of around , which is suitable for keeping food for a week.|$|R

25|$|The major {{application}} of 4,4'-MDI is {{the production of}} rigid polyurethane. Typically, one metric ton of polyurethane foam needs 616 kg of MDI and 386 kg of polyol, with 54 kg of pentane as a blowing agent. These rigid polyurethane foams are good thermal insulators and used in nearly all <b>freezers</b> and refrigerators worldwide, as well as buildings. Typical polyols used are polyethylene adipate (a polyester) and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (a polyether).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper studies {{the concept of}} developing {{a different type of}} <b>freezer</b> rather than vapor-compression for Dippin 2 ̆ 7 Dots, a company who sells frozen goods. The <b>freezer</b> in question is a magnetic <b>freezer</b> that works by removing the compressor and bringing in magnetocaloric materials, which provide cooling by being subjected to a magnetic field. Many possibilities for improvements are available from this technology including a safer more environmentally benign fluid, a higher efficiency, and a possible cost savings. A theoretical model was designed and efficiency calculations and a cost analysis were both performed to determine if there were any improvements and if constructing a prototype <b>freezer</b> was feasible. The coefficient of performance of the designed <b>freezer</b> had the theoretical capability of being up to 5 times that of the vapor-compression <b>freezer,</b> but with the pumps found to complete the design this high number fell significantly short. The price to build a prototype was calculated to be around 7, 050. After considering the data building a magnetic <b>freezer</b> prototype does not seem feasible. Although this <b>freezer</b> does not seem reasonable, the magnetic refrigerator technology seems applicable for other uses and is capable of developing in the future...|$|R
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Sledge Store, or Phase IV. The {{building}} was erected in 1978/79, and originally housed the science offices, cold room and travel store. It is now used mainly as the travel store or sledge store. The huge amount of mountaineering or camping equipment for use in Antarctica is maintained and stored here. The cold store remains, with four large <b>freezers</b> storing all the base's frozen food. It was named after Sir Vivian Fuchs, BAS Director from 1958 to 1973.|$|E
25|$|The first {{purpose built}} stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was {{much larger than}} any other {{trawlers}} then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate <b>freezers</b> that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E
25|$|Sainsbury's Freezer Centres were {{a frozen}} food chain {{operated}} between 1974 and 1986, the stores were entirely dedicated to frozen food. Due to competition from specialist frozen food chains such as Bejam, Sainsbury's converted its original service stores {{that were too}} small for modern use to small frozen specialist stores. Despite initial difficulty as only 11% of the population owned a freezer, the chain expanded to 21 stores at its height. As <b>freezers</b> became more popular, frozen food departments were designed into Sainsbury's main supermarkets, and the chain was sold to Bejam in 1986, who were ultimately sold to Iceland in 1989.|$|E

50|$|This {{means the}} {{refrigerator}} may become too warm. However, because only enough air is diverted {{to the refrigerator}} compartment, the <b>freezer</b> usually re-acquires the set temperature quickly, unless the door is opened. When a door is opened, either in the refrigerator or the <b>freezer,</b> the fan in some units stops immediately to prevent excessive frost build up on the <b>freezer's</b> evaporator coil, because this coil is cooling two areas. When the <b>freezer</b> reaches temperature, the unit cycles off, {{no matter what the}} refrigerator temperature is. Modern computerized refrigerators do not use the damper system. The computer manages fan speed for both compartments, although air is still blown from the <b>freezer.</b>|$|R

25|$|Kimchi {{refers to}} often {{fermented}} vegetable dishes usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes cucumber, commonly fermented in a brine of ginger, garlic, scallions, and chili pepper. There are endless varieties with regional variations, {{and it is}} served {{as a side dish}} or cooked into soups and rice dishes. Koreans traditionally make enough kimchi to last for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as Jangdokdae although with the advent of refrigerators, special Kimchi <b>freezers</b> and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is packed with vitamin A, thiamine B1, riboflavin B2, calcium, and iron. Its main benefit though is found in the bacteria lactobacilli; this is found in yogurt and fermented foods. This bacteria helps with digestion. South Koreans eat an average of 40 pounds of Kimchi each year.|$|E

50|$|When {{foods are}} frozen without preparation, <b>freezer</b> burn can occur. It {{happens when the}} surface of the food is dehydrated, and this leads to a dried and {{leathery}} appearance. <b>Freezer</b> burn also ruins the flavor and texture of foods. Vacuum packing reduces <b>freezer</b> burn by preventing the food from exposure to the cold, dry air.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to slow <b>freezer</b> burn by filling plastic containers with water and leaving them open (leaving room for expansion) in the <b>freezer</b> to help maintain humidity. Proper packaging can also help delay <b>freezer</b> burn because small, air-tight packaging allows local homeostasis of humidity, and, to a lesser degree, temperature, although current available packaging cannot do this perfectly.|$|R
