40|$|Most {{people would}} {{acknowledge}} the importance <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, {{but the same}} is not true <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Historically, the corporate law <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care has been underenforced at best, and arguably unenforced entirely. Some scholars do not consider the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care to be a fiduciary duty at all, {{and there are those}} who would do away with it entirely. In this paper, I intend to provide a comprehensive defense of the corporate law fiduciary <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. I hope to show that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care is not simply an ill-fitting appendage to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, but rather an essential aspect of the singular fiduciary concept that also encompasses the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. Simply put, a fiduciary has the duty to act {{in the interests of the}} beneficiary in all relevant respects. Once the breadth of this singular fiduciary concept is properly understood, it is revealed to be much more than any <b>of</b> the individual <b>duties</b> that it comprises. Far from being streamlined or focused, fiduciary law would be impoverished if it were limited to the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. However, I do not intend to argue for a more robust <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care. Rather, I will defend the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care as it currently exists in corporate law (more or less) — deliberately and advisedly underenforced, but not entirely unenforced. The <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care works in the corporate context precisely because caution is built into the enforcement equation...|$|R

40|$|Under {{well-established}} {{principles of}} nonprofit corporation law, {{a board member}} must meet certain standards of conduct and attention in carrying out his or her responsibilities to the organization.

These standards are usually described as the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care, the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, and the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> obedience. <b>Duty</b> <b>of</b> Care The <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> care describes the level of competence that is expected of a board member and is commonly expressed as the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> "care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise in a like position and under similar circumstances. " This means that a board member owes the duty to exercise reasonable care when he or she makes a decision as a steward <b>of</b> the organization. <b>Duty</b> <b>of</b> Loyalty The <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is a standard of faithfulness; a board member must give undivided allegiance when making decisions affecting the organization.

40|$|The {{fact that}} a <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty within the Swedish company law exists should be {{regarded}} as indisputable according to the Swedish doctrine, but its content and scope is however more severe identified. As the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is not regulated in the ABL and {{the fact that there are}} not many precedents in this area, means that it is difficult to know the boundaries of the company management´s <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. It is also unclear whether the company management´s <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to the company also is targeting the shareholders. It is this issue that we intend to discuss in the final chapter of this thesis. In order to answer our questions, we will in chapter two to six give an account of the foundation <b>of</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty and thereafter describe the management's <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to the company. With these elements as background we will in the final chapter try to answer our problem. Through analysis, we have concluded that the company management's <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to some extent is directed towards shareholders. Shareholders with a stake of at least one tenth of all the company's shares should have the same protection from the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty as the company while minority shareholders with less than one tenth only should be protected by the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty when it appears in the ABL, the Annual Accounts Act, or the articles of association. The present situation is that the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty within the company law is not explicitly regulated in the words of the ABL, whereby compensation for infringement of the same can only be paid in cases where the <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> loyalty is implicit, like for example the general clause in 8 chapter 41 § ABL...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I present a {{relation}} between two principles on individuals that John Rawls presented {{in his two}} major works.

But, in the circumstances of reasonable pluralism {{it is not clear how}} can such a vague duty guide us in political reasoning. That is why I claim that moral <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> civility, which demands that we respect boundaries of public reason, is the way how we fulfill our natural <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> justice in circumstances of reasonable pluralism. This implies that moral <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> civility has its moral grounding in natural <b>duty</b> <b>of</b> justice. Then I try to present how this view can answer to some objections raised against the idea of public reason and also how it can refers to some problems of distributive justice...|$|R
