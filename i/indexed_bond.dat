We assume a market structure that {{is characterized by}} a cash account, an <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> (i. e., inflation-linked bond) and stock. We obtain optimal share of portfolio values (that depend on the minimum guarantee) in the <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> and stock for the pension plan member (PPM) at time t. We find that in the presence of <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> in the investment strategy, the inflation risk that is associated with the PPM’s contributions and minimum guarantee is hedged. Hence, <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> can be used to hedge inflation risk that is associated with a contributory pension funds scheme. We also find in our numerical result that, with effective management of the pension funds by pension fund administrators (PFAs), PPMs will have high returns from their investment. From our results, we find that the optimal terminal wealth that will accrue to the PPM and PFA to be 221097. 1 N. We also find that the minimum guarantee that will accrue to the PPM at retirement to be 81005. 3 N. The portfolio values in stock, <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> and cash account are 0. 5, 3. 1, and- 2. 6, respectively. Therefore, more investment should go to <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> and stock since they yield positive portfolio value...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{evaluate}} stock <b>index</b> <b>bonds</b> return to risk ratio in order to investigate to which degree an investor in a stock <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> take part of the underlying index return and what the investor must pay {{for the security of}} not losing his funds.

40|$|A {{major issue}} {{in the design of}} both public and private pension plans {{involves}} the indexation of benefits to price-level changes. A major pur-ported virtue of current public pensions in the United States is that they provide an asset with a fixed real return.

It is frequently alleged that the failure to provide indexed benefits is a major weakness of standard private pension arrangements. These views have influenced the recommendations of groups such as the President’s Commission on Pen-sion Policy (1980) and the Advisory Council on Social Security (1979). Both these groups, without detailed argument, strongly endorsed the indexation of social security benefits. Serious consideration of issues regarding indexation requires the care-ful specification of an alternative to indexing.

Avellaneda's uncertain volatility model with non-constant coefficients to describe equity price variation, forward price variation, <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> price variation and rate of inflation, together with Merton's intertemporal portfolio choice model, are utilized to enable an investor to choose an optimal portfolio consisting of equity, nominal <b>bonds</b> and <b>index</b> <b>bonds</b> when {{the rate of inflation}} is uncertain. A hedge ratio is universal if investors in different countries hedge against currency risk to the same extent. Three universal hedge ratios (UHRs) are defined with respect to the investor's total demand for <b>index</b> <b>bonds,</b> hedging risky asset returns (i. e. equity and nominal bonds) against currency risk, which are not held for hedging purposes. These UHRs are hedge positions in foreign <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> portfolios, stated as a fraction of the national market portfolio.

Our analysis emphasizes the two main pillars of the Brazilian public domestic debt market: home-bias {{and the role of the}} banking sector in intermediating the debt. Evidence from yields of a “perfectly ” <b>indexed</b> <b>bond</b> shows that the rollover premium was very small when the devaluation occurred, and is still fairly small by October, 1999, indicating that the rollover of the public domestic debt has not, so far, constituted a serious problem.

40|$|In 1997, the U. S. Treasury {{began the}} {{quarterly}} issuance of inflation indexed bonds, called Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS). So far, the Treasury has issued both 5 -year and 10 -year indexed bonds and {{will begin to}} issue 30 -year indexed bonds and inflation indexed savings bonds in 1998. TIPS differ from conventional Treasury bonds in both their payment flows and risks. With virtually no inflation risk, they are the safest assets currently available in the U. S. market. Combined with conventional Treasury bonds, they allow investors to separate inflation risk from real interest rate risk and thus manage risk more efficiently. > To help investors understand and {{take full advantage of}} these new securities, Shen discusses the features and risks of the Treasury inflation indexed bonds.

30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the optimal {{consumption}} and portfolio decision with a quadratic utility {{in the presence}} of inflation risk. For a hedging instrument for inflation risk, we introduce an inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> which is directly linked to the price process. Depending on market parameters, the investment in the risk asset and in the inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> exhibit quite different patterns. For the life-time financial planning, the inflation risk is easily ignored but it may frustrate an agent which consumes and invests optimally. Therefore, it is worthwhile to look into how an agent manages the inflation risk {{in the presence of}} an inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> through lifetime utility maximization with a quadratic utility function.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{explicit}} expressions for consumption and portfolio rules {{by applying the}} duality approach. Due to the optimal consumption process, we have to separate the wealth into three regions as in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the third region, where the wealth level is above the bliss level, the optimal consumption stays constant as its maximum so the value function is also fixed. To make the value function constant, {{there should be no}} risky asset investment. This fact is well-described in Koo et al. [5] and Rho et al. [8]. In the presence of inflation risk, however, even though the value function in the third region is still constant, the optimal investment in an inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> is not fixed. To hedge the inflation risk, all the financial wealth is invested in an inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> and investment in other assets becomes zero in the third region. When the wealth level is below the bliss level, the role of inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> can be different according to market parameters. In particular, for sufficiently large growth rate of the price process, the demand for speculative motive is reflected only on the inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond.</b> For a small growth rate of the price process, however, the demand for speculative motive is distributed into both portfolios of inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> and the risky asset.|$|R
30|$|Now we can {{describe}} the optimal portfolios in more details. In region 1, {{the investment in}} the inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> consists of two components, which are the demand for hedging inflation risk and an additional investment which is proportion to the total capital. Since n_-< 0, the additional investment is positive if θ_ 2 > 0, which implies the speculative or myopic demand due to the excess return on the inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond.</b> Moreover, {{under the condition that}} θ_ 1 -ρθ_ 2 /√(1 -ρ^ 2)> 0, the investment in risky asset also represents myopic demand which is proportion to the total capital. We can verify that the total myopic demand in the risky asset and inflation-linked <b>index</b> <b>bond</b> is borrowed from the bank account.|$|R
