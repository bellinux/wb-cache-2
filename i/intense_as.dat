5|$|Weakening as {{it crossed}} the peninsula, Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche and re-strengthened {{before making a}} second {{landfall}} in Veracruz. Although the second landfall did not bring winds as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the first, it brought more rainfall and caused devastating landslides in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Between the two landfalls, Dean caused MXN$2billion (US$184million; 2007dollars) of damage and killed 13people.|$|E
5|$|Due to Fort Corcoran's {{large size}} and {{proximity}} to Georgetown, duty {{as part of}} the fort's garrison was less of a hardship than it was at many of the more isolated forts in the defenses of Washington, such as Fort Greble. Morale and sanitation officers often visited Fort Corcoran, and leave to visit Georgetown or Washington was sometimes granted to both officers and enlisted men. Men at the fort served in regimental bands or played baseball in their spare time between periods of infantry and gunnery drill. Due to Fort Corcoran's location behind the Arlington Line, however, drill was not as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> at many front-line fort.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} {{became more}} <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> kick-off approached. Moments later, {{a group of}} Liverpool fans charged into section Z, causing the fans there to retreat. As they had nowhere to go, they moved towards the side perimeter wall. As more people moved up against the wall, it collapsed, which resulted in 39 deaths and injuries to 600 people. At {{the other end of}} the ground, Juventus fans began to riot in retaliation for the events in section Z. They advanced down the pitch towards the Liverpool fans and were stopped by the police. The resulting confrontation lasted two hours and was still ongoing when the match kicked-off.|$|E

5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, it is not as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working their way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very <b>intense,</b> <b>as</b> programmers had to work for two straight months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose {{different}} styles for the separate {{halves of the}} film. Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used as the plot builds to the attempt on Hitler's life, and the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the plotters are hunted down. The colors in the film also become more <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the story continues. Sigel focused on red, {{the color of the}} Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting historical accuracy of the era required blackouts. Sigel noted in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio, and since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses.|$|E

Between {{the second half of}} 1980s and the early 2000s he had an <b>intense</b> career <b>as</b> a character actor, working with Gabriele Muccino, Paolo Virzì, Marco Risi, Carlo Verdone and Antonello Grimaldi, among others. He died of an intracranial aneurysm. His daughter Carlotta Natoli is also an actress.|$|R
50|$|The rivalry of {{both teams}} is still remembered {{to this day}} by older {{basketball}} fans, sharing countless stories of the historic rivalry.

25|$|In addition, {{a design}} {{constraint}} {{is that the}} microwave beam must not be so <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations.

25|$|During the 25 {{years of}} the Original Six-era (1942–67), teams played each other 14 times during the regular season, and with only four teams {{continuing}} into the playoffs, rivalries were <b>intense.</b> <b>As</b> one of this era's most successful teams, the Maple Leafs established historic rivalries with the two other most successful teams of the time, the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

RNA from eukaryotic organisms shows distinct bands of 28s and 18s rRNA, the 28s band being approximately twice as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> the 18s band. Degraded RNA has less sharply defined bands, has a smeared appearance, and intensity ratio is less than 2:1.|$|E

25|$|Throughout its history, {{the empire}} also was {{involved}} in series of wars and rivalries with the neighbouring kingdoms of Champa, Tambralinga, and Đại Việt — and later in its history with Siamese Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. The Khmer Empire's relations with its eastern neighbour Champa was exceptionally <b>intense,</b> <b>as</b> both sides struggled for domination in the region. The Cham fleet raided Angkor in 1177, and in 1203 the Khmer managed to push back and defeat Champa.|$|E
25|$|In a {{defensive}} battle, the Redskins played {{a little better}} by limiting the Vikings to only 76 rushing yards and piling up eight sacks among seven different players (Dave Butz, Kurt Gouveia, Ravin Caldwell, Dexter Manley, Charles Mann, Alvin Walton, and Clarence Vaughn). The Vikings string of playoff upsets {{came to an end}} in a game that proved to be just as hard fought and <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> Washington's 27–24 overtime victory over them in Week 15 of the regular season.|$|E

25|$|The {{order in}} which the stages was opened was {{influenced}} by the industry-centric flows of passengers of the Soviet period, and the depot placement issue. Cross-river traffic used not to be as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> it is today. GAZ was not only the dominating employer of the Avtozavodsky district, but also consumed a lot of workforce from the Northern parts of the city. The only suitable plot for the train depot was found near the automobile plant, too.|$|E

Initially, the Italians were stunned by the massive fire and a company of the Pavia was overrun in the predawn darkness, but resistance in the Bologna gradually stiffened.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Marcel Sembat won {{the debate}} on several fronts: the Salon d'Automne {{remained}} at the Grand Palais des Champs Elysées for years to come; the press coverage following the Assemblée nationale's discussions was as <b>intense</b> <b>as</b> it was widespread, publicizing Cubism still further; the reverberations caused by the Cubist scandal echoed across Europe, and elsewhere, extending far beyond {{what would have been}} predicted without such publicity. Marcel Sembat would soon become Minister of Public Works; from 1914 to 1916, under Prime Ministers René Viviani and Aristide Briand.|$|E
