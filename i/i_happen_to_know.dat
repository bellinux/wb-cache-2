60|$|<b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{something}} about it, because I prepared the Drum-Horse for his resurrection. He {{did not take}} kindly to the skeleton at all.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, she was {{the only}} young woman <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in Southampton, that's true. But what of that? It would have been all the same if I had known a hundred.' ...|$|R

40|$|Dear Mr Ranmuttu, This {{being my}} first letter to you please {{allow me to}} {{introduce}} myself before anything else. I am one Kalupane working in the EXPRESS TRAVEL GROUP. <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you and your esteemed family through one Mr Hatharagama who is also working in our Company today.

6000|$|... "I remember. I'd {{just got}} the idea. <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> you see, that Bennett and Mortimer were both frightfully keen on getting Windles for the summer, but my mother wouldn't hear of it and gave them both the miss-in-baulk. It {{suddenly}} {{occurred to me that}} mother was going to be away in America all the summer, so why shouldn't I make a private deal, let them the house, and make it a stipulation that I was to stay there to look after things? And, to cut a long story short, that's what I did." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Hays, resuming {{his place}} by the fire, [...] "you see this yer man I was goin' to see lives about four miles beyond the summit on a ranch that furnishes most of the hay for the stock {{that side of the}} Divide. He's bin holdin' off his next year's contracts with me, hopin' to make better terms from the prospects of a late spring and higher prices. He held his head mighty high and talked big of waitin' his own time. <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> he couldn't do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, very likely! Only <b>I</b> do <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{that one}} of them has been a great trouble and vexation to Tom Underwood; and we didn't want the same over again with the poor old Squire.' ...|$|R

Last week he wrote to us {{that he had just}} {{returned}} from Paris; but <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he had then been back for some time. He has arranged to come twice, but on each occasion, at the last moment, he has made excuses. He can do as he likes now. I wish he would say definitely that he doesnt intend to come, instead of shilly-shallying from week to week. Hallo, Prentice, have the ladies returned yet?" [...] This was addressed to the keeper of the gate-lodge, at which they had now arrived. He replied that the ladies were still absent.|$|R
