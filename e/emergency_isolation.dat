Such pipelines are considered to be the most likely method for the transportation of captured CO 2 from power plants and other industries to subsequent sequestration sites, and their safe operation is of paramount importance as their inventory is likely to be large. The developments presented describe a state-of-the-art, multi-phase heterogeneous discharge and dispersion model capable of predicting the near-field fluid dynamic and phase behaviour in such CO 2 releases. Predicting the correct fluid phase during the discharge process in the near-field is of particular importance given the very different hazard profiles of CO 2 in the gas and solid states. Validation of the model is undertaken using recently obtained experimental data from discharge tests. Model predictions are found to describe the experimental observations very well, {{with a high level of}} agreement between the two. The study clearly demonstrates that models addressing accidental releases of CO 2 must include shock-capturing methods and complete three-phase formulations for prediction of the physical and thermodynamic properties of CO 2 in order to accurately predict the discharge and dispersion phenomena of interest in risk assessments...|$|E

40|$|Background: Room {{ventilation}} {{is a key}} {{determinant of}} airborne disease transmission. Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission. Methods: We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an <b>emergency</b> department negative-pressure <b>isolation</b> room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. Results: Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and <b>emergency</b> department <b>isolation</b> room limited infection risks to 0. 1 %- 3. 6 %. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3. 6 % to 20. 7 %, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room. Conclusion: Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of room ventilation for preventing airborne disease transmission...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the severe}} {{accident}} in {{nuclear power plant}} (NPP), large amounts of fission products are released with accident progression, including In-vessel and Ex-vessel release. Thus, the Source term evaluation {{is essential for the}} probability risk assessment (PRA) and is still imperative for the licensing and operation of NPPs. Iodine {{is one of the most}} reactive fission products emitting in a large amount to containment and have a severe impact on health and sounding environment. Therefore, the iodine source term has been evaluated for 2720 MW (thermal) Reactor, by considering the TMI- 2 as the reference reactor. The modeling and simulation of released radioactivity have been carried out by developing a MATLAB computer-based program. For post 1100 operation days, with the instantaneous release of radioactivity to the containment has been studied under LOCA. The dependency of radioiodine on ventilation exhaust rates has been studied in normal, <b>emergency</b> and <b>isolation</b> mode of containment. Moreover, the containment retention factor is also evaluated in said states of containment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} {{modeling}} and simulation of release of radiation form two loops PWR {{has been carried out}} for flow blockage accident. For this purpose, a MATLAB based program “Source Term Evaluator for Flow Blockage Accident ” (STEFBA) has been developed, which uses the core inventory as its primary input. The TMI- 2 reactor is considered as the reference plant for this study. For 1100 reactor operation days, the core inventory has been evaluated under the core design constrains at average reactor power. With the instantaneous release of radiation to the containment atmosphere, some reliable results have been achieved for determined states of containment, i. e., Normal, <b>Emergency</b> and <b>Isolation</b> state in this accident situation. Resulting noble gasses, iodine and aerosol source term variation has been evaluated against the containment performance. The dependency of the source term on containment performance parameters has been studied. Typical trend of release of radioactivity has been found corresponding to increase in ventilation exhaust rate values. The dependency of radioisotopes on ventilation exhaust rate has been studied in accident situation. The removal dependency of radio iodine and aerosol has also been studied with boric and caustic acid spray in this study...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: It is {{necessary}} to define the problem of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in every hospital to evolve control strategies. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine factors influencing the persistence of MRSA in patients with hospital acquired infection and to identify alternate cost effective antibiotics. Methods: A six month study was carried out for 50 patients with MRSA infection. Treatment modalities and risk factors were determined by a preset protocol. Minimum inhibitory concentration of commonly used antibiotics was determined. Results: The risk factors were prolonged postoperative morbidity, prior antibiotic therapy and emergency admissions. Seventy percent of the isolates were from postoperative cases undergoing <b>emergency</b> surgeries. <b>Isolation</b> was highest during the second week of hospital stay. Emergency admissions had a significantly higher chance of early isolation. Prior treatment with multiple antibiotics in 38 &#x 0025; was found to be another major risk factor. Ofloxacin was seen to be efficacious in a small percentage of cases. Rifampicin in combination with ofloxacin and clindamycin were found to be other good alternatives. Ofloxacin was found to be the cheapest and vancomycin the most expensive, for a full course of treatment. Conclusions: Minimizing risk factors and attention to alternate cost effective combination therapy may ease the problem of management of infections with MRSA...|$|R

According to the performance and impact on the MTDC, they have been divided into the emergency condition and non-emergency condition. Under the <b>emergency</b> condition, the <b>isolation</b> between the faulted AC and DC sides is not achieved using the normal control and protection strategy. A special control and protection strategy, which achieves both {{the isolation of the}} fault terminal with reducing the fault current and recovery of the other terminals, is proposed. Under the non-emergency condition, a potential risk of overcharging the blocked SMs has been identified. The simulation is conducted using the RTDS. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed special control and protection strategy under the emergency condition.|$|R
40|$|The Emergency Department has {{witnessed}} multiple paradigm shifts {{within a very}} short period of time. It is likely that the aging of the population will create the greatest shift to date. As the number of people over age 75 swells, the demands on the emergency department to have available multi-disciplinary geriatric capabilities to manage their complex non-medical problems risk overwhelming the ability of the department to manage the acutely ill and injured as is its mandate. Crowding could spiral out of control, resulting in worsening outcomes for emergency department patients. Anticipating the geriatric tsunami and preparing a health care system, both in and outside of a hospital will be critical. Creating a geriatric <b>emergency</b> department in <b>isolation</b> risks having governments designate the emergency department as the portal of entry for all community geriatric needs, which can only compromise further acute care, care already threatened by tightened budgets, increasing health care costs and insufficient community resources...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: When an {{influenza}} pandemic occurs {{most of the}} population is susceptible and attack rates can range as high as 40 – 50 %. The most important failure in pandemic planning is the lack of standards or guidelines regarding {{what it means to be}} ‘prepared’. The aim of this study was to assess the preparedness of acute hospitals in the Republic of Ireland for an {{influenza pandemic}} from an infection control perspective. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study involving a questionnaire completed by infection control nurses, time period from June – July 2013, (3 weeks) from acute public and private hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. A total of 46 out of 56 hospitals responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: From a sample of 46 Irish hospitals, it was found that Irish hospitals are not fully prepared for an influenza pandemic despite the 2009 Influenza A (H 1 N 1) pandemic. In 2013, thirty five per cent of Irish hospitals have participated in an emergency plan or infectious disease exercise and have plans or been involved in local planning efforts to care for patients at non-health care facilities. Sixty per cent of Irish hospitals did not compile or did not know if the hospital had compiled a “lessons learned” from any exercise that were then used to revise emergency response plans. Fifty two per cent of hospitals have sufficient airborne isolation capacity to address routine needs and have an interim emergency plan to address needs during an outbreak. Fifty one percent of hospitals have taken specific measures to stockpile or have reserve medical supplies e. g. masks, ventilators and linen. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study carried out in the Republic of Ireland investigating the current preparedness for an influenza pandemic from an infection control perspective. Deficits exist in the provision of emergency planning committees, testing of <b>emergency</b> plans, airborne <b>isolation</b> facilities, stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies and organisational schemes/incentives for healthcare workers to continue to work in a pandemic. While Irish standards are comparable to findings from international studies, the health care service needs to continue to enhance preparedness for an influenza pandemic and implement standard preparedness guidance for all Irish hospital...|$|R
