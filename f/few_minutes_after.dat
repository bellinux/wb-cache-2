5|$|In 2011, astronomers {{found what}} {{they believe to be}} {{pristine}} clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the Big Bang, during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.|$|E

Harriet Jacobs was re-hired by Willis to work for the family.|$|E

He made his UEFA Champions League debut in a group stage match against Manchester United coming on as a substitute for Sidney Govou.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> 6:00am Szent István sank.

On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there.

During the team's first match of the tournament, she scored the team's third goal in the 51st minute in a 3–3 draw against China PR. The U.S. faced Denmark during its second group stage match. Goals from Kristine Lilly and Tiffeny Milbrett led to a 2–0 win for the U.S. Hamm played goalkeeper for a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> Briana Scurry received a red card and {{was removed from the}} match. After defeating Australia 4–1 on June, 10, the U.S. advanced to the knock-out stage and defeated Japan 4–0 in the quarter-final.

Hamm scored the second U.S. goal of the match in the 55th minute.|$|E

Although the track was drying, it was not until the last half hour that teams were able to improve on their first session times. The No. 2 Audi and No. 8 Peugeot swapped the pole position multiple times before the session ended with the No. 8 Peugeot claiming the top position on the final lap of the session with a time of 3:26.344. In GT1 the No. 008 Larbre Aston Martin took the class lead on the final lap with a 3:50.761. The LMP2 and GT2 classes saw very little improvement; the class leading teams remained the same.|$|E

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the naval base was soon {{apparent}} when the First World War broke out in August 1914. Only a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the declaration of war went into effect at midnight on 3/4 August, a German liner was captured by a torpedo boat from Gibraltar, followed by three more enemy ships the following day. Although Gibraltar was {{well away from the}} main battlefields of the war – Spain remained neutral and the Mediterranean was not contested {{as it was in the}} Second World War– it played an important role in the Allied fight against the German U-boat campaign. The naval base was heavily used by Allied warships for resupplying and repairs. The Bay of Gibraltar was also used as a forming-up point for Allied convoys, while German U-boats stalked the Strait looking for targets. On two occasions, Gibraltar's guns unsuccessfully fired on two U-boats travelling through the Strait. Anti-submarine warfare was in its infancy and it proved impossible to prevent U-boats operating through the Strait. Only two days before the end of the war, on 9 November 1918, SM UB-50 torpedoed and sank the British battleship HMS Britannia off Cape Trafalgar to the west of Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|Hicks, who was {{generally}} {{described as the}} most effective of the Manchester City forwards, had a chance which he hit high over the crossbar. In a rare spell of sustained Manchester City pressure, a free kick by captain Jimmy McMullan forced a save from Pym, and the resulting near-post corner prompted a goalmouth scramble which ended with a foul on Bolton's Greenhalgh. Pym made further saves from Browell and Hicks, the latter resulting in a corner. From the corner Bolton won the ball and headed upfield on the counter-attack. Billy Butler's cross from the right went beyond the goal and was retrieved by Vizard on the left wing. The outside-forward then cut inside and played the ball across goal in a manner described by some correspondents as a shot and others as a pass. David Jack received {{the ball in the}} six-yard box and put the ball between Goodchild and McCloy into the City goal, giving Bolton the lead with 14 minutes remaining. In the <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> the goal, Manchester City came forward in numbers but lacked clear chances and were hindered by over-eager forwards going offside. Following a goal kick by Pym, the referee blew the final whistle. Bolton won the cup for a second time, becoming the first club to win twice at Wembley.|$|E
