There is slush, sludge, <b>ice</b> <b>rind,</b> pancake ice, brash, pack ice, {{northern}} slob, Arctic slob, string ice, glitter, lolly and probably others.

40|$|Water ice {{nanoclusters}} {{are useful}} analogs for studying {{a variety of}} processes that occur within icy grains in the extraterrestrial environment. The surface of ice nanoclusters prepared in the laboratory {{is similar to the}} surface of interstellar ice grains. In cold molecular clouds, the silicate cores of interstellar grains are typically approx. 100 nm in diameter and have a coating of impure amorphous water ice. Depositional, thermal and radiolytic processes leave the surface and subsurface molecules in a disordered state. In this state, structural defects become mobile and reactions of trapped gases and small molecules can occur. The large surface area of nanocluster deposits relative to their bulk allows for routine observation of such surface-mediated processes. Furthermore, the disordered surface and subsurface layers in nanocluster deposits mimic the structure of amorphous <b>ice</b> <b>rinds</b> found on interstellar dust grains. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM has been used tn characterize the crystallinity, growth mechanism, and size distribution of nanoclusters formed from a mixture of water vapor with an inert carrier gas that has been rapidly cooled to 77 K. E M imaging reveals a Gaussian size distribution around a modal diameter that increases from approx. 15 to 30 nm as the percentage of water vapor within the mixture increases from 0. 5 to 2. 007, respectively. TEM bright and dark field imaging also reveals the crystalline nature of the clusters. h 4 any of the clusters show a mosaic structure in which crystalline domains originate at the center Other images show mirror planes that are separated by approx. 10 nm. Electron diffraction patterns of these clusters show that the clusters are composed of cubic ice with only a small hexagonal component. Further, the crystalline domain size is approximately the same as the modal diameter suggesting that the clusters are single crystals...|$|R
40|$|Previous soil stratigraphic {{analysis}} of soil morphogenesis in the Okstindan Mountains established a Late Neoglacial soil evolutionary sequence based on historically monitored and radio carbon-dated moraine positions {{over the last}} ~ 3. 0 cal yr BP. Thus pedon evolution ranged from C/Cu→Ah/Cox/Cu→pedostratigraphic succession of Ah/C/Cu/Lb/ Cub/Ahb/Coxb/Cub pro files with a max i mum rind weathering time of ~ 1. 0 kyr. Following successive re treat phases of Neoglacial <b>ice,</b> weathering <b>rind</b> development continued apace on moraines, each rind population recording weathering time fol lowing successive glacier still stands. The age of the youngest deposits falls within the period 1900 - 1910 AD, or the last 100 yrs, with variable moraine positions all documented by historical depictions {{of the position of}} the Austre Okstindan glacial lobe prior re treating to its present position. The next older group of deposits is considered to have been emplaced {{near the end of the}} LIA or around ~ 1800 AD, with time of rind development set at 200 yr, possibly older. The old est moraine set within the late Neoglacial sequence lies atop a pedostratigraphic column, the upper-most soil radio carbon dated at ~ 1. 0 yr BP. Given the range of mean rind development across this thresh old of deposits, from 0. 22 ± 0. 03 mm in the inner group, 0. 66 ± 0. 07 mm in the middle group, to 1. 38 ± 0. 15 mm in the outer, older group, it is clear that finite measurements at several sites within a suite of deposits, some dated by radio carbon, can evenly discriminate be tween deposits in a glacial succession...|$|R
