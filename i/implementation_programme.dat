DESIGN: Data on students' dietary intakes were collected 1 - 4 weeks and 6 months after <b>programme</b> <b>implementation.</b> Teachers filled in a logbook on <b>programme</b> <b>implementation</b> after each lesson. The relationships between changes in students' dietary intakes and completeness of <b>implementation</b> of the <b>programme</b> and of specific programme elements were tested using mixed linear regression analyses. SETTING: Thirteen Dutch prevocational schools. SUBJECTS: Eight hundred and seventy-six of the 1117 participating students and eighteen of the twenty-two participating teachers. RESULTS: Completeness of <b>programme</b> <b>implementation</b> was positively related to an increase in fruit consumption in the short term. Completeness of implementation of food exposure activities and a practical lesson on advertisements were related to an increase in fruit consumption in the short as well as the longer term. No such relationships were found for sweets and breakfast consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that efforts should be made to help teachers implement the programme as fully as possible...|$|R
