5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles out into the open, wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone</b> {{could have been the}} shooter.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone</b> near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone</b> whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

5000|$|Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike was {{initially}} met with mixed opinions, however {{it has in}} recent years been critically acclaimed. In 2004, Game Revolution said that it [...] "just isn't a very exciting addition.

[...] GameSpy also added the game to their Hall of Fame in , further describing it as the seventh [...] "Most Underrated Game of All Time" [...] as of 2003. Adventure Gamers listed Grim Fandango as the seventh [...] "Top Adventure Game of All Time" [...] in 2004; in their 2011 list of [...] "Top 100 All-Time Adventures" [...] it was listed as #1. In , IGN included the game in the [...] "Top25 PC Games" [...] (as 15th) and [...] "Top100 Games of All Time" [...] (at 36th), citing that [...] "LucasArts' second-to-last stab at the classic adventure genre may very well be the most original and brilliant one ever made."

500|$|Shaunna Murphy of Entertainment Weekly criticized [...] "Britney's {{complete}} lack of verbal audience interaction [...] and her obviously diminished dancing ability" [...] but also added that [...] "with her slim waist, her dangerously toned legs, and most importantly her engaged, wide-eyed smile, [...] looked happy {{to be there with}} us—the crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing— or at least tweaking— the past. [...] Spears manipulates pop's virgin-whore complex better than <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone,</b> and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of 'Don’t Let Me Be the Last to Know' [...] felt true to the sweep of her career— she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club's heat or into literal thin air." [...] Matt Kivel of Variety commented, [...] "Though visually impressive, the show lacked a truly engaging human quality. Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment, lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself. With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks, she appeared onstage as some strange blend of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Kraftwerk's Ralf and Florian." [...] However, Jam! Canoe considered the show was [...] "best described as Janet Jackson-like." ...|$|E

However, his virtuosity was never restored to the original level, and his playing after his stroke relied principally on his right hand. In 1995 he returned to public performances on a limited basis, and also made several live and studio recordings for Telarc. In 1997 he received a Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award. Canadian politician, friend, and amateur pianist Bob Rae contends that [...] "a one-handed Oscar was better than <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone</b> with two hands".|$|E

500|$|Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Adam Sessler of X-Play stated: [...] "Whether it's a decade-late {{answer to the}} Marvel vs. Capcom team up games or an off-the-cuff boardroom joke gone wildly too far, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is destined to make <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone's</b> shortlist of bizarre video game team-ups. Still, sometimes two disparate things can merge to create a unique synergy that makes the melding work, however unlikely it may have seemed at the outset." [...] In GamePro, Sid Shuman called it [...] "surprisingly enjoyable." [...] Wired.com's preview stated {{that the concept of}} the game was [...] "nose-pokingly ludicrous", noting that Superman's powers could be used to easily defeat a character with the comment, [...] "from Sub-Zero to Well-Done in eight seconds flat." [...] ABC News praised the game's story because it did [...] "a great job of giving players a cohesive, if far-fetched, story line that's fun if not engaging," [...] as well as [...] "comic book-like" [...] dialogue. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universes Kombo Challenge mode was criticized as a thin and frustrating mode with combos that required very precise timing. The modes of Klose Kombat and Free-fall Kombat were praised as concepts but were criticized in their execution as they appeared to slow the gameplay down and took the player out of the fast gameplay experience. Critics noted that the change in the amount of gore was disappointing to longtime fans of the series who were used to the [...] "insane amounts of gore." ...|$|R

2500|$|Eurogamer {{scored the}} game a 9.0/10, calling {{it tough to}} resist. Gamespy gave it 4.5/5 stars, {{claiming}} the game [...] "opened up Middle-Earth to the masses" [...] but commented negatively on its weak PvP content, while GameTrailers awarded it 8.5/10, citing its interesting tweaks to the MMO genre. IGN ranked it a similar 8.6/10, praising it for its solid experience, though criticizing it for its lack of major improvements to the genre. The New York Times called the game [...] "a major achievement of interactive storytelling, the first game truly worthy of the ‘Lord of the Rings' franchise and a must-play for <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>anyone</b> {{with an interest in}} Tolkien or the future of online entertainment." [...] In a GameSpot review, the product was awarded an 8.3/10, praising its appealing polish and intriguing Monster Play feature. Gamepro.com's review gave it an overall 4.25/5, pointing out how engaging the epic quests are, as well as how faithful to the novels the game managed to stay.
