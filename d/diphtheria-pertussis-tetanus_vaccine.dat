40|$|The {{development}} of combined vaccines constitutes {{one of the}} priorities in modern vaccine research. One {{of the most successful}} combined vaccines in use is the <b>diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus</b> <b>vaccine.</b> However, concerns about the safety of the pertussis arm have led to decreased acceptance of the vaccine but also to the {{development of}} new, safer, and effective acellular vaccines against pertussis. Unfortunately, the production cost of these new vaccines is significantly higher than that of previous vaccines. Here, we explore the potential of live recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG producing the hybrid protein S 1 -TTC, which contains the S 1 subunit of pertussis toxin fused to fragment C of tetanus toxin, {{as an alternative to the}} acellular vaccines. S 1 -TTC was produced in two different expression systems. In the first system its production was under the control of the 85 A antigen promoter and signal peptide, and in the second system it was under the control of the hsp 60 promoter. Although expression of the hybrid antigen was obtained in both cases, only the second expression system yielded a recombinant BCG strain able to induce both a specific humoral immune response and a specific cellular immune response. The antibodies generated were directed against the TTC part and neutralized toxin activity in an in vivo challenge model, whereas interleukin- 2 production was specific for both parts of the molecule. Since protection against tetanus is antibody mediated and protection against pertussis may be cell mediated, this constitutes a first promising step towards the development of a cost-effective, protective, and safe combined vaccine against pertussis, tetanus, and tuberculosis...|$|E

Since Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination against tuberculosis is used in most developing countries, a recombinant BCG-pertussis vaccine could be a more viable alternative. We have constructed recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains expressing the genetically detoxified S 1 subunit of pertussis toxin 9 K/ 129 G (S 1 PT) in fusion with either the β-lactamase signal sequence or the whole β-lactamase protein, under control of the upregulated M. fortuitum β-lactamase promoter, pBlaF*. Expression levels were higher in the fusion with the whole β-lactamase protein, and both were localized to the mycobacterial cell wall. The expression vectors were relatively stable in vivo, since at two months 85 % of the BCG recovered from the spleens of vaccinated mice maintained kanamycin resistance. Spleen cells from rBCG-S 1 PT-vaccinated mice showed elevated gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and low interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) production, as well as increased proliferation, upon pertussis toxin (PT) stimulation, characterizing a strong antigen-specific Th 1 -dominant cellular response. The rBCG-S 1 PT strains induced a low humoral response against PT after 2 months. Mice immunized with rBCG-S 1 PT strains displayed high-level protection against an intracerebral challenge with live Bordetella pertussis, which correlated with the induction of a PT-specific cellular immune response, reinforcing the importance of cell-mediated immunity in the protection against B. pertussis infection.

Towards the ultimate goal of developing a live oral <b>diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus</b> <b>vaccine,</b> we used these plasmids to stably express the S 1 subunit of pertussis toxin in CVD 908. Driven by the anaerobically inducible nirB promoter, the S 1 subunit alone was expressed poorly in Salmonella cytoplasm. In contrast, hybrid proteins with S 1 fused to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of fragment C were expressed at a high level in CVD 908 and were recognized in Western blot (immunoblot) analysis by monoclonal antibodies directed to S 1 and to fragment C. Mice were immunized by the oral or intranasal routes with CVD 908 derivatives harboring these recombinant plasmids. All fusion proteins elicited serum antibody responses to fragment C following intranasal immunization, whereas oral inoculation did not. The configuration of antigens constituting the fusion was critical; S 1 fused to the amino terminus of fragment C was less effective than S 1 fused to the carboxyl terminus in generating anti-fragment C antibodies.

40|$|IntroductionThe {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) causes up to {{a million}} deaths worldwide and 16 million health care related infections in the tropics each year(1, 2), and over 350 million become chronically infected carriers who have no significant liver disease; approximately three quarters {{of them are in}} Asia and the western pacific region(3, 4). HBV infection is a potentially life threatening condition as many of the affected individuals progress to chronic hepatitis,cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (3). In infants and children, acute hepatitis B infection is nearly always asymptomatic, whereas in adults it is usually the opposite. But on the other hand, the risk of becoming chronic carriage is much greater in children than in adults; as many as 90 % of infants born to Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) positive mothers become carriers themselves and, therefore, in long term are more likely to developchronic liver disease(5). Currently, though several antiviral drugs are used,there is no reliable curative treatment for HBV once it has been acquired and prevention by universal immunization remains the strategy for reducing the number of acute infections, chronic carriage and the long-term burden from diseases such as HCC(4, 6). In 1991, in an attempt to reduce the global impact of HBV infection, WHO recommended that hepatitis B vaccination should be integrated into national immunization programs in all countries(7). Some Asian countries, for instance, Thailand, haveadopted the policy of immunizing children universally against the disease as early as 1992, however many others lagged behind(4). The true prevalence of Hepatitis B in Bangladesh is yet to be ascertained by a reliable study. Data available from different studies show that it ranges between 0. 8 and 5. 4 % depending on the study design, samples and laboratory methods used(8 - 10). These data were based on detection of HBsAg antigen; the rates would have been higher, had they been based on anti-HBc antibody(11). Relying on these statistics Bangladesh can be categorized as an intermediate endemic zone for HBV(12). Unfortunately, despite an increased prevalence of HBV infection, the country has not incorporated hepatitis B vaccination into its national childhood immunization policy until recently, most probably because of its economic constraints. Presently it offers three doses hepatitis B vaccine to all babies. It is felt that the current regimen was drawn in on the basis of ongoing uncertainties and disagreements surrounding the vaccine all over the globe. Uncertainties Surrounding HBV ImmunizationThe rationale of HBV immunization is illustrated in the box; however uncertainties surrounding HBV immunization do exist, these are:Box: Rationale of Hepatitis B Immunization The rationale of HBV vaccination is to prevent: · Episodes of acute hepatitis B · Chronic hepatitis B surface antigenaemia · Chronic hepatitis and the need for therapy · Hepatocellular carcinoma · HBV transmission Correspondence:Dr. Harunor Rashid, Research Fellow, Academic Departmentof Child Health, Queen Mary University of London, 38 NewRoad, London, E 1 2 AX, UKFax: + 44 (0) 2073777167 E-mail: h. rashid@qmul. ac. ukHep Mon 2006; 6 (1) : 41 - 44 - Duration of vaccine- induced immunity:It has been shown that immunization with three doses of HBV vaccine provides acceptable level of seroprotection for at least five years(13). Titersdecreased to 99 % of the 14 year olds had titers of |“| 10 mIU/mL while one year after the booster 10 mIU/mL after 1 month of first, second and third vaccinations were 58 %, 70 % and 94 % respectively(16). However, it has been observed in other studies that two doses of recombinant HBV vaccine given over 4 or 6 months provide adequate seroprotection (|“| 10 mIU/mL) in |“| 95 % of adolescent vaccines(13, 17). There were small variations in vaccine response between infants and teenagers. The range of protection for different doses is shown in Table(17). If we accept that a level of 80 - 95 % seroprotection is sufficient for Bangladesh then a strategy with only two doses would be more economical. Table: Percentage of infants and teenagers/adults responding to 1, 2 or 3 doses of HBV vaccineDose # Infants Teens and adults 1 16 - 40 % 20 - 30 % 2 80 - 95 % 75 - 80 % 3 98 - 100 % 90 - 95 % [Adapted from Margolis H et al. (copy right free resource) 17]- Acceptability of a universal program:The data available from WHO reveal that the uptake of other vaccines in routine immunization schedule can vary in Bangladesh from 83 % for DPT 3 (<b>Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus</b> <b>vaccine)</b> to 95 % for DPT 1 (18). Utilizing this experience we may suppose that the acceptability of HBV vaccine will be somewhere between 80 and 95 %. The uptake can be increased by improving health education, creating awareness among people in general and among health care providers in particular as well as involving politicians and religious leaders in the vaccination campaign. There were concerns that HBV vaccine could be related to central nervous system demyelinating disorders. However, a later study in France concluded that in the worst case considered the number of complications prevented by vaccination outweighs quantitatively the potential risks(19). - Vaccine Failure:A small percentage of adults fail to mount an immunological response despite completion of the immunization schedule. The variables associated with vaccine failure are: site of vaccination, obesity, smoking, presence of diseases that alter immune system, medications, age (> 40 years) and male sex(17, 20). Preterm babies < 2 Kgs are also known to show insufficient responses(17). - Cost-effectiveness:Cost is an important issue for a resource poor country like Bangladesh. Cost analysis done in countries with low endemicity shows that routine infant vaccination against HBV costs about US$ 1800 per life saved, compared with over US$ 10000 for coronary artery bypass surgery or pneumococcal vaccination for the over 65 s(21). Economic analysis of vaccinating Asian Americans in Philadelphia was found to be cost-effective and even cost-beneficial with a benefit-cost ratio of 4. 4 : 1 (22). However these data are not adequateenough to justify economic analysis of HBV vaccination in Bangladesh. A separate study to analyze cost benefit/cost effectiveness is recommended for Bangladesh, as its infrastructure of health care and disease prevalence are different from those of resource rich countries. HBV immunization in Bangladesh- Current Strategyand a New RecommendationRecently (since late 2004) Bangladesh has started incorporating the HBV vaccination into national immunization program with the schedule ofimmunizing babies at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of birth. It is certainly a welcome step but the schedule may need to be reviewed. Immunizing babies at six weeks of life with the first dose of vaccine will leave many at risk babies unprotected in their neonatal period when they need it most. It has been found that about 1. 2 - 3. 5 % of the pregnant ladies in Bangladesh are HbsAg positives and that 22 - 38 % of them are also HBeAg positives, so delaying vaccination for the first six weeks will put 70 - 90 % babies at risk of acquiring perinatal infection(8). Immunizing them in the first twenty-four hours of birth is conceivably the best approach. Bangladesh has already a policy of immunizing children with BCG at birth. To make sense of economics and thus save extra costs both vaccines can be administered at the same time. Regarding the second dose of hepatitis B vaccine:it can be administered at 6 weeks with other EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) vaccines at the same sitting, which will save both time and cost. The interval between the first two doses does not necessarily need to be one month as it has long been practiced, a dose interval as long as one year could still be equally effective(20). It has been established that two doses are quite efficacious giving almost 80 - 95 % seroprotection in infants (see Table) (17). Regarding the third dose we think it can be either selective or optional as the level of seroprotection increased by the third dose is very minimum(17); hence it can entirely be left on the parents' choice. If they want to vaccinate their children with the third dose they should be encouraged to do so depending on their affordability; or this can be reserved only for the babies of HbsAg positive mothers. The third dose can be timed with measles vaccine at 38 weeks. We think that this two-dose neonatal vaccination strategy plus selective antenatal screening, instead of a universal screening, will probably be a superior and cost effective approach. Another advantage of neonatal vaccination is that, it can pave the way to the cessation of antenatal screening for HBV infection in future. A neonate today {{is expected to be a}} 'mother' in a couple of decades, so screening may not be essential at that time for an already vaccinated person. This neonatal approach has been found to be quite effective in some neighboring countries such as Thailand, with a national seroconversion rate of 87. 6 % within one year of initiation of vaccination and the prevalence of carrier rate decreased drastically from 3. 4 % to 0. 7 %(15). It can be exemplary for Bangladesh. Further, a reliable multi-centre seroprevalence study needs to be conducted with samples representative of the whole population to determine the exact prevalence of HBV infection; data drawn simply from laboratory report or notification may not reflect the true situation. An epidemiological survey of saliva testing for anti-HBc antibody may be an easy-to-do alternative. Promising results have been reported with a new aluminium-adjuvanted vaccine that has been shown to produce 99 % seroprotection only after two doses; moreover the vaccine was well tolerated by the volunteers in its initial trial in Argentina(23). A hexavalent combination vaccine that includes among others hepatitis B vaccine has been found to be immunogenic and generally safe in various studies(24, 25); it has been licensed in Europe and America and shown to improve timeliness of immunization(26), its use in Bangladesh could be considered in the future. ConclusionsBangladesh needs an effective vaccination strategy against HBV. Infant immunization with two doses is the minimum recommendation. The first dose can be effectively introduced as early as on the first day of life with BCG. To optimize the compliance, second dose can be administered at 6 weeks with other routine vaccines e. g. DPT, Polio etc. The third dose should be optional, however, can be implemented as compulsory for at risk babies and the timing should be at 38 weeks with measles vaccine. Further study is needed to evaluate the costeffectiveness of this novel policy.

We calculated the proportion, in mean percentage, of children who had received bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, three doses of <b>diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus</b> (DPT) <b>vaccine</b> and measles vaccine. To measure inequities between wealth quintiles, we calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) for all surveys. Findings From 2001 to 2014, the proportion of children who received all vaccines {{at the age of}} 12 months increased from 68. 8 % (95 % confidence interval, CI: 67. 5 - 70. 1) to 82. 4 % (95 % CI: 80. 7 - 84. 0). While coverage of BCG, DPT and measles immunization statistically increased during the study period, the proportion of children who received the third dose of polio vaccine decreased from 93. 3 % (95 % CI: 92. 7 - 93. 9) to 88. 1 % (95 % CI: 86. 8 - 89. 3). The poorest wealth quintile showed the greatest improvement in immunization coverage, from 58 % to 77. 9 %, While the wealthiest quintile only improved from 84. 8 % to 86. 0 %. The SII for children who received all vaccines improved from 0. 070 (95 % CI: 0. 061 - 0. 078) to 0. 026 (95 % CI: 0. 013 - 0. 039) and RII improved from 1. 13 to 1. 03. Conclusion The improvement in immunization coverage between 2001 and 2014 in Nepal can mainly be attributed to the interventions targeting the disadvantaged populations...|$|R
40|$|Objective:: To {{check the}} effects of the {{vaccines}} on the hematopoietic system and weight of mice after immunization. Methods:: The study was done with the Expanded Programme on Immunization vaccines donated by the Ministries of Health of Abia and Imo States of Nigeria. The vaccines were collected from the cold-chain stores and transported in vaccine carriers to the cold-chain facility in Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital within 3 hours of collection. They were used to immunize a total of 160 mice. The Ethics Committee of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi of Anambra State, Nigeria approved the protocol. Results:: Mice body weight changes test showed that the mice all had increased body weight at Days 3 and 7 post-immunization and none died during the 7 d post-immunization observation. The percentage weight gains of the mice compared with the control were 69 %, 70 %, 64 %, 63 %, 65 % and 68 % for oral polio <b>vaccine,</b> <b>diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus,</b> bacillus Calmette–Guérin, measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines respectively collected from Imo State. The mice immunized with oral polio vaccine, pentavalent, bacillus Calmette–Guérin, measles, yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines collected from Abia State had 123 %, 114 %, 121 %, 116 %, 142 % and 119 % weight gain respectively compared with the control. Leukocytosis promoting toxicity test showed that none of the vaccines was able to induce proliferation of leukocytes up to ten folds. Leukopenic toxicity test showed that all the vaccines had an leukopenic toxicity test value higher than 80 % of the control (physiological saline). Conclusions:: The vaccine samples tested were safe and did not affect the hematopoietic system adversely. The storage conditions of the vaccines in the States’ cold-chain stores had not compromised the safety of the vaccines...|$|R
