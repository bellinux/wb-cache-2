It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E

40|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} the indication and method of repair of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. Whereas the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend tricuspid repair {{in the setting}} of severe TR, tricuspid repair is advised for less than severe TR {{in the setting of}} annular dilation or pulmonary hypertension. Although multiple repair strategies exist, the use of a ring annuloplasty (semirigid remodeling rings vs <b>flexible</b> <b>bands)</b> is the preferred method of therapy to avoid short- and long-term recurrence of TR. The new Tri-Ad Adams annuloplasty ring combines elements of semirigid and <b>flexible</b> <b>bands</b> that will not only allow for annular remodeling in the region of the right ventricular free wall but also potentially reduce injury to the conduction system with its flexible and “open” ends.

So when he got back to New York, he called Robert Shelton and said, [...] "Are there any jug bands around town?" [...] Bob said, [...] "Well, yeah, but what you really ought to do is get hold of Dave Van Ronk and have him put one together." [...] So he did, and I did. I called up a bunch of friends, and we formed the Ragtime Jug Stompers. Sam Charters was back in town, so he was our Pooh-Bah and Lord High Everything Else—he sang, arranged, and played washtub bass, washboard, jug, and occasionally would lend a hand on guitar. Barry Kornfeld played banjo and guitar. Artie Rose was on mandolin, and also played some fine Dobro. Finally, Danny Kalb, who had been a student of mine, played lead guitar and some very nice harmonica. (We also made him sing bass on [...] "K.C.

40|$|We {{review and}} compare our {{experience}} with tricuspid ring annuloplasty between {{usage of the}} Cosgrove-Edwards <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> and the MC 3 rigid ring for repair of functional tricuspid regurgitation to determine the efficacy and mid-term durability of tricuspid annuloplasty. 117 patients with functional tricuspid regurgitation undergoing open heart surgery and tricuspid valve repair from May 2005 to December 2007 were reviewed. The flexible bands were used in thirty five patients before October 2006. Since then, the rigid rings {{were used in the}} next consecutive eighty two cases. Echocardiographic evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in follow-up schedule. The degree of tricuspid regurgitation was reduced from 2. 80 ± 0. 67 to 0. 71 ± 1. 0 (regurgitation severity grade: 0 to 4) in the patients with flexible bands at discharge. It was from 2. 68 ± 0. 70 to 0. 22 ± 0. 60 in the patients with rigid rings. At thirty six months postoperative period, tricuspid regurgitation grades in patients with flexible bands and rigid rings were 0. 80 ± 0. 95 and 0. 36 ± 0. 77, respectively. Freedom from recurrent tricuspid regurgitation (grade 2 or 3) in patients with flexible bands and rigid rings were 68. 6 % and 87. 8 %, respectively.

Although both <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> and rigid ring annuloplasty provide low rate of recurrent tricuspid regurgitation, rigid ring annuloplasty might be more effective than <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> annuloplasty for decreasing functional tricuspid regurgitation in immediate and mid-term postoperative periods...|$|E
40|$|V tem prispevku obravnavamo dve vrsti zdrsa v natančnem mehanizmu med valjem in trakom, imenovanim "Rolamite" tračni mehanizem (oblikovno in vzmetno drsenje). Dva valja sta povezana s prilagodnim trakom v mehanizem, tako da je povezava med njima le preko prilagodnega traku, katerega konca sta pritrjena na usmerjevalni ravnini. V mehanizmu pride do oblikovnega zdrsa, ki zavisi od debeline traku. Izravnavo oblikovnega drsenja dosezemo z uporabo dodatnih valjev, katerih usmeritev je nasprotna usmeritvi obeh glavnih valjev. Obravnavamo tudi vpliv prostih koncev prilagodnega traku na natančnost nastavitve mehanizma. Podane so računske enačbe za odmero in izračun vzmetnega drsenja "Rolamite" tračnega mehanizma.

This paper {{looks at}} two variants of slipping {{that exist in}} precision roller-band mechanisms (PRBM), such as a Rolamite-type mechanism (geometric and springy slipping). The rollers are wrapped by a <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> in the mechanisms and contacted between themselves only through a <b>flexible</b> <b>band,</b> the ends of which {{are attached to the}} directing planes of the rolamite type mechanism (RTM). In the PRBM there is geometric sliding, the value of which isinfluenced by the thickness of the <b>flexible</b> <b>band.</b> Compensation of the geometric sliding can be achieved by introducing additional band-wrapping rollers, the direction of which is opposite to the main band 2 ̆ 7 s direction. The influence of the <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> 2 ̆ 7 s free ends on the accuracy of the positioning of the mechanism is reviewed. The calculation scheme of the mechanism for the measurement and calculation of springy slipping of RTM units is presented and described by equations. It is established that the springy slipping in the RTMis connected to the strain of the free band 2 ̆ 7 s pieces from the resistance forces of motion. The value of springy slipping directly depends on the resistance force, the amplitude of motion and the value of the coordinate of the swinging centre. The scheme of a compensator of the springy slipping is presented. The calculation relations permitting us to define the parameters of spring-compensator, eliminating springy slipping, are deduced...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} {{model for a}} compliant non-pneumatic tire on frictionless, rigid ground is presented. The tire model consists of a thin flexible annular band and spokes that connect the band to a rigid hub. The annular band is modeled using curved beam theory {{that takes into account}} deformations due to bending, shearing and circumferential extension. The effect of the spokes, which are distributed continuously in the model and act as linear springs, is accounted for only in tension, which introduces a nonlinear response. The quasi-static, two-dimensional analysis focuses on how the contact patch, vertical tire stiffness and rolling resistance are affected by the stiffness properties of the band and the spokes. A Fourier series representation of the shear strain in the annular band and the complex modulus of the material were used to predict rolling resistance due to steady state rolling. From the analysis point of view, when the wheel is loaded at its hub, the following three distinct regions develop: (1) a support region where the hub hangs by the spokes from {{the upper part of the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>band,</b> (2) a free surface region where the spokes buckle and have no effect, and (3) a contact region where the <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> is supported by the ground without the effect of the spokes. The angular bounds of these three regions are determined by the spoke angle and the contact angle, which are respectively the angle at which the spokes start to engage in tension and the angle that defines the edge of contact. Closed-form expressions of contact stress, stress-resultants and displacements at the centroids of the cross-sections of the <b>flexible</b> <b>band</b> are expressed in terms of these angles, which must be determined numerically. A thorough parametric analysis of quantities of interest for the tire is presented, which can be used to help support the optimal and rational design of compliant non-pneumatic tires. The model was validated by comparison with two computational models using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS and by experimental rolling resistance data...|$|E

5000|$|Brazilian three-banded {{armadillos}} have a head-and-body {{length of}} about 22 to 27 cm and the tail is between 6 and 8 cm long. They weigh 1 - 1.6 kg. The armor {{is composed of}} ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by <b>flexible</b> <b>bands</b> of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, ears, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside {{of the body and}} the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection, and are covered instead by long, coarse hair. The genus Tolypeutes, which includes both the Brazilian and southern species of three-banded armadillos, is unique in the ability to roll up in a tight, almost impenetrable ball. This is because their armor is slightly looser than that of other armadillo genera, which allows for greater freedom of movement. The loose armor also creates a layer of air between the shell and the body, which insulates the animal. This higher capacity for thermoregulation allows them to survive in climates too arid for some of the other armadillo species. When the armadillo rolls into a defensive ball, the ears are tucked into the shell and the head and tail interlock to seal the shell completely. The teeth are soft and peg-like, adapted solely for smashing the exoskeletons of insects.|$|R
