5|$|QF-16: In September 2013, Boeing and the US Air Force tested an {{unmanned}} F-16, {{with two}} US Air Force pilots controlling the airplane {{from the ground}} as <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> from Tyndall AFB over the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Convair F2Y Sea Dart was an American {{seaplane}} fighter {{aircraft that}} rode on twin hydro-skis for takeoff. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> {{only as a}} prototype, and never entered mass production. It is the only seaplane to have exceeded the speed of sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was the Amana, a Douglas DC-4-1009 registered VH-ANA and the flagship of the Australian National Airways fleet. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> {{for the first}} time on 28 January 1946 and was flown to Australia on 9 February 1946.|$|E

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>flies</b> in May and June. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> between 7000 and 9000 ft in Garhwal (near Mussoorie) {{and between}} 5000 and 6000 ft further east at Chungthang, north Sikkim in the Teesta valley.|$|R
50|$|The blue {{corporal}} has {{a single}} brood per year. It mates on the wing. The female, guarded by the male, who hovers above her, deposits her eggs immediately after mating, dipping her abdomen into the water to do so. She spreads her eggs out, spacing them several meters apart {{around the perimeter of}} a pond; overall, she lays few eggs in any one site. The young develop synchronously, which increases the amount of intraspecific competition between them. The blue corporal overwinters as a final instar nymph, and the entire population of an area emerges over a one-month period in early spring. The flight period varies with latitude. For example, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from November to May in Florida, while in Louisiana <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from February to May. Further north, it emerges later. In South Carolina, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from late March until early May, while in Kansas <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to May. In Ohio and Kentucky, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to June, and in New Jersey, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to July.|$|R
5|$|The last US {{passenger}} Boeing 747 will be {{retired from}} Delta Air Lines in December 2017, after <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> for every American major carrier since its 1970 introduction.|$|E
5|$|A radio {{report was}} {{received}} from the Amana at 10:00pm advising it was on course and climbing to 9,000 feet. Nothing more was heard from the aircraft. As <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> east over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous {{people on the ground}} observed that it was flying unusually low, and heard at least one of its engines running roughly and backfiring repeatedly. Amana crashed at about 10:13pm.|$|E
5|$|Among other destinations, Concorde flew regular transatlantic {{flights from}} London's Heathrow Airport and Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, and Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados; <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> these routes {{in less than}} half the time of other airliners.|$|E
5000|$|This rule means that, if [...] is a bird, {{and it can}} {{be assumed}} that <b>it</b> <b>flies,</b> then we can {{conclude}} that <b>it</b> <b>flies.</b> A background theory containing some facts about birds is the following one: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Aerobie {{allows for}} throws over unusually long distances. <b>It</b> <b>flies</b> faster and farther than a common flying disc. When well tuned, <b>it</b> can <b>fly</b> in a {{straight}} line, [...] "like a puck on an invisible sheet of ice". It {{does not have the}} tendency to roll when thrown level, as a flying disc does. But similarly to a disc, an Aerobie can be thrown in a curved path by throwing it in a slant. Its lift depends on its speed relative to the air. Therefore, throwing into the wind makes <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> higher. Throwing with the wind makes <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> lower.|$|R

5|$|British Airways {{conducted}} a North American farewell tour in October 2003. G-BOAG visited Toronto Pearson International Airport on 1 October, after which <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. G-BOAD visited Boston's Logan International Airport on 8 October, and G-BOAG visited Washington Dulles International Airport on 14 October.|$|E
5|$|British Airways was the {{official}} airline {{partner of the}} London 2012 Olympic Games. On 18 May 2012 <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> the Olympic flame from Athens International Airport to RNAS Culdrose while carrying various dignitaries, including Lord Sebastian Coe, Princess Anne, the Olympics minister Hugh Robertson and the London Mayor Boris Johnson, along with the footballer David Beckham.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E

50|$|The Significance of {{the colour}} of the ensigns {{is based on}} the use of the vessel, but {{generally}} when the vessel is on official Royal Navy business through the training of Officer Cadets then <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> the white ensign, when it is not, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> the blue ensign.|$|R
5|$|No. 33 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{strategic}} transport and air-to-air refuelling squadron. It operates Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports from RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. The squadron {{was formed in}} February 1942 for service during World WarII, operating Short Empire flying boats {{and a variety of}} smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with Douglas C-47 Dakota transports, which <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses in the {{vicinity}} of Seven-Mile Beach estimated that the aircraft reached a height of a little above 400ft (122m) before turning left slightly and descending steeply. The aircraft cleared the land and crashed into Frederick Henry Bay about 300yards (275m) beyond the water's edge and a mile (1.6km) from the western end of Seven-Mile Beach. After takeoff <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> for less than 2 minutes and covered a distance of only 2.9nautical miles (5.4km).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} {{the third}} and final air {{offensive}} over the Bay of Biscay, patrols continued until the liberation of France. The Bay of Biscay patrol statistics for the period 1 May to 2 August 1943, show Coastal Command had flown for 32,343 hours and lost 57 aircraft to all causes, sinking 28 U-boats and damaging 22. From 3 August 1943 to 31 May 1944, <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> 114,290 hours, losing 123 aircraft to all causes, and sinking 12 U-boats and damaging ten more.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 36 - 64 mm (H. croatica croatica) up to 65 - 71 mm (H. croatica fahira). In {{the north}} and in mountainous areas <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> in one generation in July. In warm areas <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> in two generations from May to June and in August.|$|R

5|$|Following its {{tour in the}} Mediterranean, No.78 Wing was reorganised at Williamtown. On 16March 1955, {{the wing}} {{headquarters}} was re-formed, and Nos.76 and 378 Squadrons were disbanded. No.75 Squadron remained with the wing, augmented on 21March by Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons. On 1April, No.478 Squadron absorbed the maintenance functions of No.77 Squadron. Nos.75 and 77 Squadrons initially operated Meteors from Williamtown and No.3 Squadron was based at RAAF Station Canberra, where <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> P-51D Mustangs. By November 1956 the wing had re-equipped with CAC Sabres {{and all of its}} units were stationed at Williamtown.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 1966, a B-52G AF Ser. No. 58-0228 {{deployed}} from Barksdale Air Force Base {{crashed and}} was destroyed when <b>it</b> <b>flew</b> {{into the ground}} in swampland south of Stone Lake, Sawyer County, Wisconsin. The crew was on a low level terrain avoidance night mission, before SAC stopped such flights, and had just entered low altitude and were calibrating their terrain avoidance radar, when they flew too low, clipped {{the tops of the}} forest and crashed.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E

Kiss the Joy as <b>it</b> <b>Flies</b> was shortlisted for the 2009 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.|$|R
5|$|On 6 November 1945, Lewis {{flew the}} Enola Gay {{back to the}} United States, {{arriving}} at the 509th's new base at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico, on 8 November. On 29 April 1946, Enola Gay left Roswell {{as part of the}} Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> to Kwajalein Atoll on 1 May. It was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll and left Kwajalein on 1 July, the date of the test, reaching Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field, California, the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Great Artiste was a U.S. Army Air Forces Silverplate B-29 bomber (B-29-40-MO 44-27353, Victor number 89), {{assigned}} to the 393d Bomb Squadron, 509th Composite Group. The aircraft was named for its bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, in reference to his bombing talents. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> 12 training and practice missions in which it bombed Japanese-held Pacific islands and dropped pumpkin bombs on targets in Japan. It was the only aircraft to participate in both the bombing of Hiroshima and the bombing of Nagasaki, albeit as an observation aircraft on each mission.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{had been}} far from absent {{over the front}} in December. <b>It</b> <b>flew</b> several {{thousand}} sorties over the theatre. Its encounters with the RAF and USAAF had meant heavy losses in matériel and pilots. On the eight days of operations between 17 and 27 December 1944, 644 fighters were lost and 227 damaged. This resulted in 322 pilots killed, 23 captured and 133 wounded. On the three days of operations 23–25 December, 363 fighters were destroyed. None of the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commanders) expected any large-scale air operations {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E
