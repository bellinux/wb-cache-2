5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford's law, {{the probability that the}} first decimal-digit of an item in the data sample is d (from 1 to 9) equals , regardless of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect fraudulent accounting.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E

5|$|Hubble <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs {{needed to run}} pipeline reduction on raw data files, {{as well as many}} other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of IRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot <b>data)</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|In both {{navigation}} modes, Air-Cobot is {{also able}} to detect, track, identify and avoid obstacles that are in its way. The laser data from laser range sensors and visual data from the cameras {{can be used for}} detection, monitoring and identification of the obstacles. The detection and monitoring are better in the two-dimensional laser data, while identification is easier in the images from the cameras; the two methods are complementary. Information from laser <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to delimit work areas in the image.|$|E

30|$|<b>Data</b> reuse <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{critical}} {{in determining the}} performance of tree-based algorithms (Gioachin et al. 2007). Modern SMP-based supercomputers offer several levels at which <b>data</b> sharing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> effective. One possibility is that requests for the same remote elements from two traversals on a core <b>can</b> <b>be</b> merged. The fetched <b>data</b> <b>can</b> then <b>be</b> reused by all traversals on the core. Similarly, cores in the same SMP domain can share remotely fetched data. In the following we describe a two-level caching scheme that enables the data reuse across traversals on a core, as well as across cores on an SMP processor. This caching mechanism is transparent to the traversal code.|$|R
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed in any data item {{that can be}} stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.|$|E
5|$|Customize mode {{is divided}} between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where {{opponent}} machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players can create a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, cockpit, and booster categories, and affect the vehicle's overall durability, maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor is a tool-set for decal creation.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> analysed.|$|E

5|$|Other major {{subsystems}} in the E-3 Sentry are navigation, communications, and computers. Fourteen consoles display computer-processed data in graphic and {{tabular format}} on video screens. Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions. The radar and computer subsystems on the E-3 can gather and present broad and detailed battlefield information. This includes position and tracking information on enemy aircraft and ships, and location {{and status of}} friendly aircraft and naval vessels. The information {{can be sent to}} major command and control centers in rear areas or aboard ships. In times of crisis, <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> forwarded to the National Command Authority in the U.S. via RC-135 or naval aircraft carrier task forces.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there <b>data</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E
