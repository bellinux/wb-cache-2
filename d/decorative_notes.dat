40|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Interior Design {{resulted}} {{from the work of}} architects, decora - tors, painters and carvers. Although then integrated into the world of decorative arts, we believe that already existed as a profession regulated by a coherent network design principles and the under - standing of interior space as global web of relationships established between plans, ornament, light - ing and furniture solutions. At the end of the previous century, before the need for a reform of industrial training, the Portuguese Government opened a tender for hiring of foreign teachers. We emphasize the role of Ernesto Korrodi (1870 - 1944). His works arise from an attitude paradoxically modern and eclectic, leaning one hand on a reinterpretation of solutions referenced in the medieval period or the Renaissance, on the other, based on formulas from Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau or Secession. In his projects certain rooms and hierarchies remain, but these are intersect with the needs aroused by technical innovations, which causes an attempt to answer to the emergence of new func - tions and features in the house, along with the hygienists demands of the moment. This article consists in the analysis of Bouhon home, located in the city of Covilhã, Portugal. If Art Nouveau is visible in the elevations, inside we find a cleaner space, marked by <b>decorative</b> <b>notes</b> which we can find in tiles and embedded in the stucco or coffered ceilings. The ornament thus contributes to the dignity of the walls, wainscots and ceiling plans, assuming {{a key role in the}} spatial composition...|$|E

The documents are absent. The isolated arrangements are like secrets that can be parsed only with the help of their captions.|$|R

30|$|Gudenrath [19] has {{observed}} that some 13 th-century beakers show elongated bubbles and stretched gilding and enamels, {{indicating that the}} vessel was shaped at the furnace during firing after decoration. However, Gudenrath [19] mentions that mosque lamps from the same time {{do not seem to}} share these features, remarking on the relative crookedness of many lamps. No indications of shaping during firing of the <b>decorative</b> materials were <b>noted</b> on the Brooklyn Museum’s lamp, consistent with Gudenrath’s observations. The discrete glass particles visible in the red enamel and the preponderance of bubbles in the red and white enamels indicate a very short firing, which would have helped maintain the shape of the body and handles.|$|R

40|$|U članku se obrađuju dva nova ranoromanička ulomka crkvenog namještaja pronađena tijekom građevinske i konstruktivne sanacije na kninskoj tvrđavi, točnije sjevernom kaštelu Tnin 2006. godine. Prilikom razgradnje četvrtaste kule, koje je išlo do zdrave osnove, pronađena su dva uzidana ranoromanička ulomka, očito kao spolija u zidu. Detaljnom analizom utvrđeno je da ta dva ranoromanička ulomka pripadaju rekonstruiranom pilastru čija su dva originalna ulomka pronađena 1934. godine u bedemima kninske tvrđave. Do sada su, što u objektima kninske tvrđave, što u objektima ispod kninske tvrđave, pronađena i dvadeset četiri ulomka crkvenog namještaja. Upravo jednom od njih posvećuje se pažnja, a to je rekonstruirani pilastar kojemu su dva ulomka originalni dijelovi, a preostala dva rekonstrukcijom su nadomještena. U radu se prvi put objavljuje podatak o pronalasku dvaju ulomaka istoga pilastra koji se kod S. Gunjače navodi pod rednim brojem 9, a kasnije dobiva muzejski inventarni broj 2133. u MHAS-u. Stoga je logično primijetiti da bi i ova dva novopronađena ulomka pripadali istoj crkvi. Također se navode i komparacije s prethodno pronađenim ulomcima s kninske tvrđave, koje je svojevremeno i V. Delonga analizirala s obzirom na postojanje natpisnog polja na njima. Riječ je o pet ulomaka crkvenog namještaja, i to onih s natpisnim poljem, te ih s obzirom na stilske karakteristike datirala u vrijeme rane romanike. Iz tog vremena poznata je crkva sv. Stjepana s kraja 11 ili prijelaza u 12. st. Na kraju se daje i osvrt na radionički krug kojemu bi mogli pripadati obrađeni ulomci. The article {{analyzes}} two {{newly discovered}} original early Romanesque fragments of a pilaster {{that was long}} ago reconstructed by Gunjača {{on the basis of}} two original pieces, while the other two were replaced. During structural repairs and conservation at the fortress of Tnin in Knin in 2006, the missing two original segments were discovered, which Gunjača had though had been forever lost. They consist of {{the central part of the}} pilaster and the base. The fragments are analyzed in catalogue form. In addition to the analysis of the two newly found fragments, other fragments discovered earlier that also have early Romanesque characteristics were also considered. In contrast to the majority of earlier known examples that have an inscription field, fragments are analyzed here that have a characteristic decoration that ties them to the previously noted finds. Through a method of comparison, stylistic <b>decorative</b> traits are <b>noted</b> that characterize one and the other fragment on the kymation. The comparisons were carried out not merely on the early Romanesque fragments from the Knin fortress, but also from the site of Kapitul, and further on one fragment of an architrave beam whose provenience is not known, currently located in the Archaeological Museum in Split. As it has the same stylistic decorative characteristics as the two new Romanesque fragments from Knin, a three-braided ribbon and stylized flowers, it probably came from the same workshop circle or even the same ecclesiastical structure, the Church of St. Stephen in Knin. As arched elements that come from Kapitul are also located in the Archaeological Museum in Split, it is not excluded that several fragments that are kept in the that museum come from the Knin region. The analysis carried out on the two new early Romanesque pilaster fragments has led to results tied to the question of the stonemasonry workshops, or workshop circle in which the carving took place. The emphasis on a workshop circle in Knin again becomes topical, and explanations offered by earlier researchers for this Knin workshop find their confirmation in the discovery of these two new early Romanesque fragments. It can be concluded that the investigation into the past of Knin becomes more interesting everyday in archaeological terms, as it once was long before. This refers primarily to the area of Podgrađa (the suburbium), where excavations have been performed for several years, as well as the Knin fortress itself. The results of such investigation, as well as the conservation works following structural repairs that have been carried out at the Knin fortress for a long time at the northern fortress of Tnin, are particularly valuable, as they are one of the indicators of the development of the medieval city, as indicated by the discovered material, as well as the stone furnishings. Similarly, in this case the confirmation of the existence of an ecclesiastical structure has acquired full meaning though the identification of its interior stone inventory...|$|R
