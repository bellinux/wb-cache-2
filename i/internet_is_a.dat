Any computer on the Internet has a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet {{that is used to}} publish election advertising within 12 hours after the start of the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E

500|$|Munchausen by <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{pattern of}} {{behavior}} akin to the Munchausen syndrome (a psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves) in which Internet users seek attention by feigning illnesses in online venues such as chat rooms, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It has been described in medical literature {{as a manifestation of}} factitious disorder or factitious disorder by proxy. Reports of users who deceive Internet forum participants by portraying themselves as gravely ill or as victims of violence first appeared in the 1990s due to the relative newness of Internet communications. The pattern was identified in 1998 by psychiatrist Marc Feldman, who created the term [...] "Münchausen by Internet" [...] in 2000. It is not included in the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, how are we to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{example from}} that period is IBM's TCP/IP Tutorial and Technical Overview (...) from 1989, which stated that:The words {{internetwork}} and <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> [...] simply <b>a</b> contraction {{of the phrase}} interconnected network. However, when written with a capital [...] "I," [...] the Internet refers to the worldwide set of interconnected networks.

2500|$|The <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{global network}} that {{comprises}} many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. The technical underpinning and standardization {{of the core}} protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. [...] This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Gerhards and Schäfer {{say they}} have found [...] "only minimal {{evidence}} to support the idea that the <b>internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> better communication space as compared to print media". [...] "In both media, communication is dominated by (bio- and natural) scientific actors; popular inclusion does not occur". [...] The scholars argue that the search algorithms select the sources of information based on the popularity of their links. [...] "Their gatekeeping, in contrast to the old mass media, relies mainly on technical characteristics of websites". [...] For Gerhards and Schäfer the Internet is not an alternative public sphere because less prominent voices end up being silenced by the search engines' algorithms. [...] "Search engines might actually silence societal debate by giving more space to established actors and institutions". Another tactic that supports this view is astroturfing. The Guardian columnist George Manbiot said that Astroturfing software, [...] "has the potential to destroy the internet as a forum for constructive debate. It jeopardizes the notion of online democracy".|$|E

2500|$|Because the Internet {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews. Writing for The Boston Globe, Franklin Soults said, [...] "Love Donald Glover or hate him, this writer/actor/comedian/rapper unquestionably ranks among America's most accomplished performers. [...] The production is {{as rich as}} the raps, spanning pop, underground R, club music, and psychedelic experimentation. The project is further heightened by Glover's knowing irony, his gift for hooks, and his visionary theme. Without making it a burdensome concept to explain and belabor, the Internet figures prominently throughout the disc in ways empowering and emasculating." [...] Killian Fox, writing for The Observer, said, [...] "Glover reflects on some unsettling phenomena of our internet-addled age, such as the 3D printing of guns – and his restless delivery is matched by jerky, off-kilter production. The results are intriguing, occasionally frustrating, rarely boring." [...] Jabbari Weekes of Exclaim! said, [...] "Because the <b>Internet</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> vast improvement over his debut effort, showcasing an artist who has confidently {{found a way to}} coalesce his love for music and films into one hybrid effort." [...] Christian Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "He raps because, well, he can. Most of all, in his ambitious second album Because The Internet, he raps as if to pass the time. Anxious introverts may recognize what Childish Gambino does here, repeatedly: flit around, try to be sociable, but then flee. Childish Gambino still manages to mostly hold our attention, though, because he concerns himself instead with his own terms." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Connecting with the album is nearly impossible, understanding it is difficult, and often enough, its inflated ego is irksome, but Because the Internet is too free and fascinating to be dragged down by these complaints, so if a Yeezus with more flash and fun is what's required, Gambino's got the good stuff." ...|$|E
