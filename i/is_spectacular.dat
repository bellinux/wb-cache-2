500|$|The island's relief <b>is</b> <b>spectacular,</b> a 19th-century {{commentator}} remarking that [...] "the {{interior is}} one heap of rude mountains, scarcely possessing {{an acre of}} level land". This combination of geology and topography make for less than ideal agricultural conditions, and {{it is doubtful that}} more than one tenth of the island has ever been cultivated. In the 18th century average land rental values on Rùm were a third those of neighbouring Eigg, and only a fifth of Canna's.|$|E
500|$|We {{want to stay}} in New York, New York {{has been}} {{incredibly}} good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show... Our New York crew <b>is</b> <b>spectacular,</b> they've worked their [...] off to make the show look great. But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming.|$|E
500|$|The {{area has}} {{excellent}} diving. Underwater visibility at Bardsey Island extends to [...] {{and there is}} a rich variety of sea life; it is considered some of the best diving in Gwynedd. The Ynysoedd Gwylanod are particularly popular, and the wreck of the Glenocum, in Bae Aberdaron, is excellent for novices, having a maximum depth of an extremely large conger eel lives in the lower section of the boiler openings. There <b>is</b> <b>spectacular</b> diving at Pen y Cil, where there is a slate wreck and an unusual cave dive; nearby Carreg Ddu is an isolated rocky island in Bardsey Sound, although care must be taken as there are strong currents.|$|E

500|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{are generally}} medium to large parrots of stocky build, {{which range from}} [...] in length and [...] in weight; however, one species, the cockatiel, is considerably smaller and slimmer than the other species, being [...] long (including its long pointed tail feathers) and [...] in weight. The movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, <b>is</b> <b>spectacular</b> in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused. Cockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two middle toes forward and the two outer toes backward. They differ {{in the presence of}} an erectile crest and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.|$|E
500|$|A Lesson in Romantics is {{considered}} a fan favorite. Daniel Thompson of Music Emissions wrote that: [...] "every song <b>is</b> <b>spectacular</b> on this album and is a potential hit." [...] Despite its eventual success and acclaim, A Lesson In Romantics received little attention from professional music critics. Reviewers noted the improved sound from the band's debut EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends. Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk.net wrote that: [...] "after their unimpressive release of the EP Tales Told By Dead Friends in November, the band's back with their debut album that will surely become one of your most played of the Summer." [...] Sputnikmusic reviewer Adam Knott gave the album a score of 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a {{hell of a lot}} better" [...] than most pop punk records.|$|E
500|$|Two {{day after}} the game, Crusinberry wrote a column in the Chicago Daily Tribune opining that Michigan's offense was the {{culmination}} of the new, less brutish game of football:"The old time player, who did his stuff by brute strength, has given way to the modern man with a head full of tricks[...] [...] [...] And now we have Mr. Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but with one of the brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him. [...] Before Benny Friedman ends his career all the teams of the country, even the Navy, will have abandoned the old style football and will be using, or at least trying to use, smart and unexpected stuff.

500|$|Danny Peary {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about A View to a Kill but was generally complimentary: [...] "Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [...] looks trimmer and more energetic than {{in some of the}} previous efforts... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his actions scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work <b>is</b> <b>spectacular.</b> Walken's the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes... Unfortunately, the filmmakers – who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in Moonraker – make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day)... lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it's fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.".|$|E
500|$|Lisa Alspector {{from the}} Chicago Reader praised {{the film and}} wrote, [...] "The blend of {{animation}} techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent." [...] Houston Chronicles Jeff Millar reviewed by saying, [...] "The handsomely animated Prince of Egypt is an amalgam of Hollywood biblical epic, Broadway supermusical and nice Sunday school lesson." [...] James Berardinelli from Reelviews highly praised the film saying, [...] "The animation in The Prince of Egypt is truly top-notch, and is easily a match for anything Disney has turned out in the last decade", and also wrote [...] "this impressive achievement uncovers yet another chink in Disney's once-impregnable animation armor." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave a somewhat negative review and wrote, [...] "Prince of Egypt <b>is</b> <b>spectacular</b> but takes itself too seriously." [...] MovieGuide also reviewed the film favorably, saying that [...] "The Prince of Egypt takes animated movies {{to a new level}} of entertainment. Magnificent art, music, story, and realization combine to make The Prince of Egypt one of the most entertaining masterpieces of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sun of a Gun" [...] is a synth-pop and Europop {{song that}} lasts three minutes and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of E minor using common time with a tempo of 133 beats per minute. It was written by Jimmy Harry and Nanna Øland Fabricius, while Dave McCracken served as the song's executive producer. The song was written while Oh Land was in Los Angeles. Lyrically, the song depicts a relationship by comparing it to the earth's orbit. In an interview with MTV News, Oh Land described its lyrics: [...] "It's a love story about being {{in a relationship with}} a person who's kind of destructive, but you keep coming back because you can't let it go". She further confirmed [...] "that it was also a metaphor for how we orbit around the sun". The singer ended with: [...] "The sun is a really beautiful thing: a sunset, a sunrise <b>is</b> <b>spectacular.</b> But it's also something we need to protect ourselves against, because it can burn you and it can be dangerous." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly good movie, {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational". Writing for Film Journal International, Doris Toumarkine praised its pace and how [...] "Atchison takes spelling competitions and conveys {{the excitement of}} the 'sport,' the appeal of the 'game,' the thrill of the win, [...] the crushing blow of the loss." [...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn. A turn that leaves you facing your stereotypes and feeling a little sheepish." [...] Dana Stevens, writing for The New York Times, asserted, [...] "The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee," [...] and [...] "a trio of crack performances" [...] can turn [...] "a formulaic sports picture" [...] into a [...] "tale that manages to inspire without being sappy." [...] Shantayaé Grant of The Jamaica Observer wrote that [...] "acting <b>is</b> <b>spectacular,</b> the emotions are real and this story of black triumph is simply phenomenal." [...] New York Press critic affirmed that Akeelah and the Bee [...] "resurrects a nearly lost idea of what an art-movie really is" [...] because it has [...] "dramatic attention to character and place, psychology and existence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Industrial unionists {{motivated}} by a more global impulse act upon a universal premise, that all workers must support each other no matter their particular industry or locale. These might be unskilled or migratory workers who conceive of their union philosophy as one big union. In 1922 these workers were described as [...] "believing in assault rather than in agreements with employers, and having little faith in political action. [...] power <b>is</b> <b>spectacular</b> rather than continuous, as its members have little experience in organization." ...|$|E

2500|$|GamesRadar's Rich Grisham {{scored the}} game a 4.5 out of 5 and wrote: [...] "NBA 2K16 is {{absolutely}} brimming with content; {{so much so}} that it’s virtually impossible to experience it all. Its core basketball experience <b>is</b> <b>spectacular,</b> and it takes big chances with an expansive story mode, a multitude of online options, and a presentation that is second to none in the sports game space. The only lingering doubt is its ability to keep its online infrastructure up and running from Day One, as many of the game’s features are tied to the 2K servers being operational. It’s the most ambitious sports game ever made, and a must-play for anyone who’s ever picked up a virtual basketball." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 31, Friedman threw two {{touchdown}} passes in a 54–0 victory over Navy. Friedman also kicked five extra {{points in the}} game. Writing in the Chicago Daily Tribune, James Crusinberry wrote: [...] "If any one man stood out, it was Benny Friedman, who hurled forward passes with accuracy and abandon time after time[...] [...] [...] Besides that, Benny was a regular whirligig in carrying the ball. [...] And it was Benny who was the field general. [...] His selections of plays was something that would make any general envious." [...] Crusinberry later added: [...] "And now we have Mr. Yost's new Michigan team, with not a Grange on it, but {{with one of the}} brainiest players of the age in Benny Friedman and a lot of smart fellows to work with him.

60|$|I {{began to}} see in their proper {{proportion}} the vast enduring normal human existence, the peasant's agricultural life, unlettered, laborious and essentially unchanging on the one hand, {{and on the other}} those excrescences of multitudinous city aggregation, those stormy excesses of productive energy that flare up out of that life, establish for a time great unstable strangenesses of human living, palaces, cities, roads, empires, literatures, and then totter and fall back again into ruin. In India even more than about the Mediterranean all this <b>is</b> <b>spectacular.</b> There the peasant goes about his work according to the usage of fifty thousand years. He has a primitive version of religion, a moral tradition, a social usage, closely adapted by countless years of trial and survival to his needs, and the whole land is littered with the vestiges and abandoned material of those newer, bolder, more experimental beginnings, beginnings that merely began.|$|E
