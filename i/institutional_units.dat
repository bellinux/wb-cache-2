40|$|I. Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue In many cases, a business will set up a separate legal entity in order to undertake operations in an economy outside its home economy. However, where a separate entity is not created in the outside economy, but the operations are substantial, a notional <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> resident in that economy may be identified for statistical purposes. In this paper, such a unit is called a “branch. ” 1 Although a branch is not a legal entity, it behaves in many ways as if it were, and treating it as a unit can allow statistics to give a better portrayal of the economic reality, see 1993 SNA paras. 4. 49 - 52. (An issues paper for DITEG deals with the valuation of branches, so this paper is only concerned with the units and residence issues.) The BPM 5 criteria for identifying the operations of an unincorporated branch as a separate <b>institutional</b> <b>unit</b> are that the branch: • engage in significant production of goods and services; • plan to operate the business indefinitely or {{a long period of}} time; • have a substantial physical presence; • maintain a complete and separate set of accounts of local activities (i. e., incom...|$|R

Findings: (1) formally ascribed design interfaces and informal communication networks correlate only marginally.

Examples taken from specific projects currently being undertaken by the <b>Institutional</b> Research <b>Unit</b> will be used to illustrate the issues and, where applicable, we will discuss a number of the strategies we have used in an attempt to address them. I would hope that members of the audience can relate to the types of issues discussed and perhaps the question session could be one in which we can compare experiences and share possible solutions. Before launching into the issues section of the paper it would seem appropriate to give some background to the <b>Institutional</b> Research <b>Unit</b> (IRU) of University of Western Australia...|$|R
