50|$|A beamline {{transports}} the proton beam {{from the}} cyclotron to a <b>gantry</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>gantry</b> <b>system</b> contains magnets for deflecting and focusing the proton beam onto the beryllium target. The {{end of the}} <b>gantry</b> <b>system</b> {{is referred to as}} the head, and contains dosimetry systems to measure the dose, along with the MLC and other beam shaping devices. The advantage of having a beam transport and gantry are that the cyclotron can remain stationary, and the radiation source can be rotated around the patient. Along with varying the orientation of the treatment couch which the patient is positioned on, variation of the gantry position allows radiation to be directed from virtually any angle, allowing sparing of normal tissue and maximum radiation dose to the tumor.|$|E

40|$|Lattix has developed, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} light-weight <b>Gantry</b> <b>systems</b> for road traffic support since 1995. Besides the low weight, their products are competitive due to capabilities {{such as the}} total system delivery, high design agility, on-time delivery, possibility of customization, appealing visual appearance, low maintenance cost, and more. Nevertheless, the main challenge {{is to reduce the}} total cost. It embraces the material cost, purchased components, assembly and installation cost, and, the most important driver, the customization cost. A lack of standardization solutions, components and subsystems that enable to have a product matrix that covers a wider range of customers needs requires engineers to redevelop existing solutions to make them fit to specific customer needs. In {{order to be able to}} sustain competitiveness in the existing markets and allow the possibility of expanding into new growing markets, a common design platform across the variants that provides possibilities for mass-customization is desired. The challenge can be summarized as the focus of creating standard design solutions, which maintain the capability of tailor-make <b>Gantry</b> <b>systems</b> accordingly with individual customers needs. Therefore, a new gantry will be developed in this work, having a holistic product perspective with the final goal of minimizing the total cost and maximizing perceived customer value.

40|$|Fiber {{composites}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important in different fields of lightweight application. To guarantee the estimated demand of components made of carbon fiber reinforced plastics the use of industrial robots is suggested in production. High velocity of the layup process is addressed to significantly increase the production rate. Today, the layup of the fiber material is performed by <b>gantry</b> <b>systems.</b> They are heavy weight, slow and the variety of possible part shapes is limited. Articulated robots offer a huge operational area {{in relation to their}} construction size. Moreover, they are flexible enough to layup fiber material into different shaped molds. Thus, standard articulated robots are less accurate and more susceptible to vibration than <b>gantry</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, this paper illustrates an approach to classify volumetric errors to obtain a relation between the achievable speed in production and precision. The prediction of a precision at a defined speed is the result. Based on the measurement results the repeatability of the robotic unit within the workspace is calculated and presented. At the minimum speed that is applicable in production the repeatability is less than 30 mm. Subsequently, an online strategy for path error compensation is presented. The approach uses a multilateration system that consists of four laser tracer units and measures the current absolute position of a reflector mounted at the end-effector of the robot. By calculating the deviation between the planned and the actual position a compensated motion is applied. The paper concludes with a discussion for further investigations...|$|R

50|$|Due to the machine's {{relatively}} low price, and subsequent popularity, {{all of the}} Solidoodle printers to date have enjoyed an active modding community, with blogs like Solidoodle Tips leading the way. Solidoodle modifications typically strive to enhance the functionality of the printer {{in order to achieve}} the performance of more expensive printers, taking advantage of the machine's relatively sturdy steel <b>gantry</b> <b>system.</b> Common modifications include hot-end and extruder replacements, improved carriage systems, bowden style extrusion systems, build plate replacements, and thread ball screws. Installing a cooling fan at the point of extrusion is a popular modification. This drastically improves the accuracy of prints by allowing the contours to cool rapidly and evenly. This minimises any distortion created by forms that cool unevenly and may buckle during printing. This buckling is persistent in forms like bowls, where the cantilever edge of each layer cools faster than the inside edge of the layer which is kept warmer by its contact with the previous layer. The uneven cooling sees the outside edges shrink inwards and up. As more layers of the print proceed, the extruder can be seen to be pushing the print around with each new layer as the problem of contours leaning inwards and upwards multiplies the distortion. The use of a fan however reduces the binding of the layers with less merging of the surfaces.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a class of}} robust {{non-linear}} controllers for a <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> are discussed. The gantry crane has three degrees of freedom, {{all of which are}} interrelated. These are the horizontal traverse of the cart, the vertical motion of the goods (i. e. rope length) and the swing angle made by the goods during the movement of the cart. The objective is to control all three degrees of freedom. This means achieving setpoint control for the cart and the rope length and cancellation of the swing oscillations. A mathematical model of the <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> is developed using Lagrangian dynamics. In this thesis it is shown that a model of the <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> can be represented as two sub models which are coupled by a term which includes the rope length as a parameter. The first system will consist of the cart and swing dynamics and the other system is the hoist dynamics. The mathematical model of these two systems will be derived independent of the other system. The model that is comprised of the two sub models is verified as an accurate model of a <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> and it will be used to simulate the performance of the controllers using Matlab. For completeness a fully coupled mathematical model of the <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> is also developed. A detailed design of a gain scheduled sliding mode controller is presented. This will guarantee the controller's robustness in the presence of uncertainties and bounded matched disturbances. This controller is developed to achieve cart setpoint and swing control while achieving rope length setpoint control. A non gain scheduled sliding mode controller is also developed to determine if the more complex gain scheduled sliding mode controller gives any significant improvement in performance. In the implementation of both sliding mode controllers, all system states must be available. In the real-time <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> used in this thesis, the cart velocity and the swing angle velocity are not directly available from the system. They will be estimated using an alpha-beta state estimator. To overcome this limitation and provide a more practical solution an optimal output feedback model following controller is designed. It is demonstrated that by expressing the system and the model for which the system is to follow in a non-minimal state space representation, LQR techniques can be used to design the controller. This produces a dynamic controller that has a proper transfer function, and negates the need for the availability of all system states. This thesis presents an alternative method of solving the LQR problem by using a generic eigenvalue solution to solve the Riccati equation and thus determine the optimal feedback gains. In this thesis it is shown that by using a combination of sliding mode and H&# 8734; control techniques, a non-linear controller is achieved which is robust {{in the presence of a}} wide variety of uncertainties and disturbances. A supervisory controller is also described in this thesis. The supervisory control is made up of a feedforward and a feedback component. It is shown that the feedforward component is the crane operator's action, and the feedback component is a sliding mode controller which compensates as the system's output deviates from the desired trajectory because of the operator's inappropriate actions or external disturbances such as wind gusts and noise. All controllers are simulated using Matlab and implemented in real-time on a scale model of the <b>gantry</b> crane <b>system</b> using the program RTShell.
