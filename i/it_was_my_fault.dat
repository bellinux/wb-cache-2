500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blanche is {{a little}} odd," [...] Mannering answered. [...] "I <b>am</b> afraid that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Here <b>are</b> the Redfords. I wonder if they would join us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you have, for I hear it beating like a trip-hammer, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> I {{ought to}} have stopped as we went by and told you I was all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is," [...] {{she said}} coolly. [...] "I'm afraid <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I {{made a mistake}} in trying to force the Colonel to speak in favour of one of the candidates." ...|$|R
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't be afraid. I {{shall not}} keep you. Come {{with me a}} moment. There is {{something}} I must tell you at once. You have made a mistake. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth {{looked at}} the bushman, {{and his face was}} curiously grim. [...] "You know who he is, Tom? We must have him at any cost, and I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> he got away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> {{and mine}} only that Archie {{has been made}} prisoner," [...] I cried bitterly, and Hiram asked in surprise, for until this moment he {{believed}} the lad to be with me: ...|$|R
2500|$|It {{emerged in}} May 2009 that an RAF {{commander}} destroyed {{a number of}} official documents after the loss of Nimrod XV230. The Times newspaper, 31 May 2009, reported that all documents relating to the aircraft were immediately impounded but Sqn Ldr Guy Bazalgette, commander of the Nimrod detachment in the Gulf, managed to retrieve one file. Bazalgette subsequently destroyed the document but later told the coroners inquest {{that none of the}} shredded documents were relevant to the loss of XV230. However, Bazalgette admitted: [...] "They should not have been shredded and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that they were." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other was}} the Davis Cup {{in the semifinals}} against Spain in Málaga, where the two top Argentine players Guillermo Coria and David Nalbandian were {{unavailable}} due to injury. An out-of-form Gaudio was called up along with Agustín Calleri, Mariano Zabaleta, and Lucas Arnold. Although Gaudio had a 4–0 singles record from the first round and quarterfinals coming into the semifinals, Spain won 3–2, with Gaudio Gaudio losing both of his singles matches. In the first rubber against Juan Carlos Ferrero, he lost 14 {{games in a row}} in a 4–6, 0–6, 0–6 defeat. In the fifth and deciding rubber against Carlos Moyà, he lost, 1–6, 4–6, 2–6, and was roundly criticised back in Argentina for these performances. [...] "When I returned to Buenos Aires after playing Davis Cup in Moscow and Málaga, you had the impression <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> and that hurt me," [...] he said. He finished the year ranked No. 34.|$|E
60|$|THE NEGRESS [sunnily: still {{busy with}} the scarf] Why? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'That <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Before our marriage, you and {{she were}} {{the whole world to}} each other; but since I came, I have seen, as you say, that the craving for work was strong, and I fear it actuates her more than she knows.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O darling Eve, I don't {{know how}} to say how sorry I am, so terribly sorry I've started things going! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> But can't you see I've got to stop it before it's too late, just for that reason? Let's be chums again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} that comes within <b>my</b> duty. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that Mountjoy <b>is</b> a gambler, any more than that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that Augustus <b>is</b> a beast. Gambler and beast, there they are. And, moreover, nothing will turn the squire from his purpose. I am only a tool in his hands,--a trowel for the laying of his mortar and bricks. Of course I must draw his will, and shall do it with some pleasure, because it will {{dispossess}} Augustus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If any mistake should {{arise from}} {{not having the}} name, don't say <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> Sir,' added Dick, still lingering.--'Oh blame not the bard--' ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (alarmed). Nonsense! don't act so hastily. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I annoyed Miss Craven--insulted her. Hang it all, don't go and spoil {{everything}} like this.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean I'm sorry I was so infernal unlucky--running into you--and {{bringing}} {{all this}} distress--to you. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> If I'd only kept--my mouth shut!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Madam,’ I interposed, ‘they {{were about}} to do so. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> if <b>it</b> <b>be</b> not done already. But I made it my prayer that your slumbers might be respected, and this {{necessary}} formula of <b>my</b> presentation should <b>be</b> delayed until to-morrow in the morning.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|I laid {{my hand on}} Rashleigh's collar, {{who made}} no resistance, but said, {{with a sort of}} scornful smile, [...] "You hear him, MacGregor! he rushes on his fate--will <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> if he falls into it?--The {{warrants}} are by this time ready, and all is prepared." ...|$|R
60|$|Madame {{looked at}} me as though <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that her plans were disarranged, which was a little unfair. And then Isobel, very serene, but with that weary look about the eyes which seemed only to have {{increased}} during the evening, came quietly up and took my arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, don't you worry, old man. I'll pay the damages, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Joe will dodge, but I won't, so {{make your}} mind easy.|$|E
6000|$|He was all concern instantly, {{and putting}} his arm about her, tenderly exclaimed: [...] "Dear heart, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> You shouldn't {{have gone down}} at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> a good deal; but if {{you want}} the truth, you haven't been much of {{anything}} up to date. Now, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, master," [...] {{answered}} Martin stolidly, [...] "I did {{not think}} that you would be such a fool. But I forgot that you are young--yes, I forget that you are young and good, too good for the days we live in. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> On <b>my</b> head <b>be</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wet through," [...] he said gravely. [...] "And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Instead of {{bringing}} you home at once, as I {{ought to have}} done, I kept you out there talking. Run upstairs at once, Margharita, please, and change all your things. I will send up hot water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} why I have {{referred}} you to what I felt (and confessed to feeling) when we were together at Craig Fernie. If you think hard thoughts, and say hard words of me, I can claim no right to blame you. I <b>am</b> innocent--and yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Was I? How {{on earth}} did you know? Why should you {{know all about it}} when I can't {{remember}} a thing? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> not yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; we {{will have}} no more running away: I am sorry that you ever did so. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> {{altogether}} my fault; but it was foolish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Brice!" [...] she lamented. [...] "I am so dreadfully sorry, and I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Why don't {{you let me}} {{write to}} him, and explain--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} enough, sir," [...] said the boy. [...] "Would to God you {{had left me}} where you found me![Endnote: 4] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> not <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that you took me from the alms-house. But <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> if I ever eat another bit of your bread, or stay under your roof an hour longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{you have}} no {{occasion}} to <b>be</b> sorry; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all <b>my</b> own fault; at least, if I <b>was</b> clear how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I should not mind it so much. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> that ball.

6000|$|... "I {{knew your}} funny sneeze, and I guessed {{that you came}} to see how I did, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very late. Don't be worried, I'm better now, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> I <b>was</b> ill, not yours; for I needn't have been so silly as {{to wait in the}} cold just because I said I would." ...|$|R
