5|$|At the Emperor's death, the Byzantines {{had control}} {{of most of}} Italy, North Africa, and a small <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> {{southern}} Spain. Justinian's reconquests have been criticised by historians for overextending his realm and {{setting the stage for}} the early Muslim conquests, but many of the difficulties faced by Justinian's successors were due not just to over-taxation to pay for his wars but to the essentially civilian nature of the empire, which made raising troops difficult.|$|E
5|$|Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed {{as a threat to}} the Caliphate's survival.|$|E

5|$|Her father's {{business}} and political contacts helped John McCain to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Arizona politics. She campaigned with her husband door to door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982, and was heavily involved in campaign strategy. Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans to the campaign and helped it survive a period of early debt.|$|E
5|$|On 10, 12 and 13 April, {{the lines}} {{held by the}} 104th Infantry in Bois Brule (near Apremont), and by the French to the left, were heavily {{attacked}} by the Germans. At first the enemy secured a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> some advanced trenches which were not strongly held, but sturdy counterattacks succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, and the line was entirely re-established.|$|E
5|$|Projects in the United States {{during the}} late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> {{occupied}} Japan. This helped to restart the building boom in occupied Japan after the war. This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York.|$|E
50|$|Ice {{hockey is}} the fourth leading {{professional}} team sport. Always a mainstay of Great Lakes and New England-area culture, the sport gained tenuous <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> regions like the American South since the early 1990s, as the National Hockey League pursued a policy of expansion.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} wheatear is a migratory insectivorous species breeding in open stony country in Europe and Asia with <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> northeastern Canada and Greenland {{as well as}} in northwestern Canada and Alaska. It nests in rock crevices and rabbit burrows. All birds spend most of their winter in Africa.|$|R
30|$|It {{would be}} {{interesting}} in future work to combine this method and the terrain classification methods [17]. For example, terrain that {{is found to be}} fragile using the leg-grope walk can be used as learning data for terrain classification to estimate fragile <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> advance, which compensates for the slow walking speed of the leg-grope walking method.|$|R
5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City.

It was here that he gained a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> the art world and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{philosophy}} and literature have contributed immensely {{to the religious}} and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam, which had an early presence {{on the west coast}} of India as early as the tenth century, gained a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role in saving the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key <b>foothold.</b> <b>In</b> 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
50|$|Although the French {{lost their}} <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> Maine, present-day New Brunswick would remain under French control {{for a number}} of years.

50|$|As SsangYong had a technology-sharing {{deal with}} Mercedes-Benz at the time, the {{decision}} was made to sell the Musso as a badge-engineered Mercedes-Benz model in some markets. This allowed SsangYong to gain <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> new markets without having to build their own infrastructure (utilizing existing Mercedes-Benz networks) while giving Mercedes a competitor in the then-booming SUV market.|$|R
40|$|As the Pentagon {{prepares to}} redeploy U. S. forces around the world, it should review its {{practice}} {{of setting up}} bases in nondemocratic states. Although defense officials claim that having U.

5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the Greeks (and {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> the Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled {{to wipe out the}} remains of Peter's existence. But at the last moment September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E
5|$|English in Ireland {{was first}} during the Norman invasion. It was spoken {{by a few}} peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely {{replaced}} by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for {{a vast majority of}} the population.|$|E
50|$|More recently, muxes {{have been}} able to use their {{relatively}} high levels of education to gain important <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> the more prestigious white-collar jobs in government and business that constitute the social elite in their communities.

50|$|The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China. Merchants {{arriving}} from India {{in the port}} city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen. The kingdoms of Vijaynagara and Kalinga established <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> Malaya, Sumatra and Western Java.|$|R
5|$|In 1971 Juan Cutillas, {{selected}} four Spanish {{players and}} one Chinese {{in an effort}} to boost the Philippine national team.

5|$|In the mid-ninth century BC, Egypt made {{a failed}} attempt to once more gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Western Asia. Osorkon II of Egypt, along with a large {{alliance}} of nations and peoples, including Persia, Israel, Hamath, Phoenicia/Canaan, the Arabs, Arameans, and neo Hittites among others, engaged in the Battle of Karkar against the powerful Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 853BC. However, this coalition of powers failed and the Neo Assyrian Empire continued to dominate Western Asia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> the steppe transitional zone. Despite the {{withdrawal from the}} steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E
40|$|Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (AREfm) {{has gained}} {{increased}} <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> many hospital intensive care units (ICUs) and belongs to specific hospital-adapted E. faecium sub-populations.

50|$|Although Islamic <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> India {{were made}} {{as early as}} {{the first half of the}} 10th century, it wasn't until the Mughal Empire that one observes {{emperors}} with a patronage for the fine arts.

5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> the growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but it was cut short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{was introduced}} to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.|$|E
50|$|During {{its early}} years, SCLC {{struggled}} to gain <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> black churches and {{communities across the}} South. Social activism in favor of racial equality faced fierce repression from police, White Citizens' Council and the Ku Klux Klan. Only a few churches {{had the courage to}} defy the white-dominated status-quo by affiliating with SCLC, and those that did risked economic retaliation against pastors and other church leaders, arson, and bombings.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, SsangYong {{started a}} {{technology}} partnership with Daimler-Benz. The deal was for SsangYong {{to develop an}} SUV with Mercedes-Benz technology. This was supposedly to allow SsangYong to gain <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> new markets without having {{to build their own}} infrastructure (utilizing existing Mercedes-Benz networks) while giving Mercedes a competitor in the then-booming SUV market. This resulted in the Musso, which was sold first by Mercedes-Benz and later by SsangYong.|$|R
50|$|Massoud, who {{expected}} {{an attack}} {{similar to the}} previous ones, had disposed his defenses close {{to the entrance of}} the valley, and was thus unable to prevent the Soviets from gaining <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> the Panjshir. They established three main bases at Rukha, Bazarak and Anava. Most of the Mujahideen had survived the attack and Massoud divided them into small, mobile groups that fought the Soviets all down the valley.|$|R
