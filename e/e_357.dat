40|$|The {{contribution}} of metal ion ligand type and charge to catalysis and regulation {{at the lower}} affinity metal ion site (n 2 site) of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase (GS) was tested by mutagenesis and kinetic analysis. The 2 glutamate residues at the n 2 site, E 129 and <b>E</b> <b>357,</b> were changed to E 129 D, E 129 H, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> H, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> Q, and <b>E</b> <b>357</b> D, representing conservative and nonconservative alterations. Unadenylylated and fully adenylylated enzyme forms were studied. The Mn(2 +) -KD values, UV-cis and fluorescence emission properties were similar for all mutants versus WTGS, except E 129 H. For kinetic determinations with both Mn 2 + and Mg 2 +, nonconservative mutants (<b>E</b> <b>357</b> H, E 129 H, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> Q) showed lower biosynthetic activities than conservative mutants (E 129 D, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> D). Relative to WTGS, all the unadenylylated Mn(2 +) -activated enzymes showed reduced kcat/Km values for ATP (> 7 -fold) and for glutamate (> 10 -fold). Of the unadenylylated Mg(2 +) -activated enzymes, only E 129 D showed kinetic parameters competitive with WTGS, and adenylylated E 129 D was a 20 -fold better catalyst than WTGS. We propose the n 2 -site metal ion activates ADP for departure in the phosphorylation of glutamate by ATP to generate gamma-glutamyl phosphate. Alteration of the charge density at this metal ion alters the transition-state energy for phosphoryl group transfer and may affect ATP binding and/or ADP release. Thus, the steady-state kinetic data suggest that modifying the charge density increases the transition-state energies for chemical steps. Importantly, the data demonstrate that each ligand position has a specialized spatial environment and the charge of the ligand modulates the catalytic steps occurring at the metal ion. The data {{are discussed in the}} context of the known X-ray structures of GS...|$|E
40|$|Members of the SLC 26 {{family of}} anion {{transporters}} mediate {{the transport of}} diverse molecules ranging from halides to carboxylic acids and can function as coupled transporters or as channels. A unique feature of the {{two members of the}} family, Slc 26 a 3 and Slc 26 a 6, is that they can function as both obligate coupled and mediate an uncoupled current, in a channel-like mode, depending on the transported anion. To identify potential features that control the two modes of transport, we performed in silico modeling of Slc 26 a 6, which suggested that the closest potential fold similarity of the Slc 26 a 6 transmembrane domains is to the CLC transporters, despite their minimal sequence identity. Examining the predicted Slc 26 a 6 fold identified a highly conserved glutamate (Glu−; Slc 26 a 6 (<b>E</b> <b>357))</b> with the predicted spatial orientation {{similar to that of the}} CLC-ec 1 E 148, which determines coupled or uncoupled transport by CLC-ec 1. This raised the question of whether the conserved Glu− in Slc 26 a 6 (<b>E</b> <b>357)</b> and Slc 26 a 3 (E 367) have a role in the unique transport modes by these transporters. Reversing the Glu− charge in Slc 26 a 3 and Slc 26 a 6 resulted in the inhibition of all modes of transport. However, most notably, neutralizing the charge in Slc 26 a 6 (<b>E</b> <b>357</b> A) eliminated all forms of coupled transport without affecting the uncoupled current. The Slc 26 a 3 (E 367 A) mutation markedly reduced the coupled transport and converted the stoichiometry of the residual exchange from 2 Cl−/ 1 HCO 3 − to 1 Cl−/ 1 HCO 3 −, while completely sparing the current. These findings suggest the possibility that similar structural motif may determine multiple functional modes of these transporters...|$|E
40|$|VopK, a type III {{effector}} protein, {{has been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of Vibrio cholerae strains belonging to diverse serogroups. Ectopic expression of this protein exhibits strong toxicity in yeast model system. In order to map critical residues in VopK, we scanned the primary sequence guided by available data on various toxins and effector proteins. Our in silico analysis of VopK indicated the presence of predicted MCF 1 -SHE (SHxxxE) serine peptidase domain at the C-terminus region of the protein. Substitution {{of each of the}} predicted catalytic triad residues namely Ser 314, His 353 and Glu 357 with alanine resulted in recombinant VopK proteins varying in lethality as evaluated in yeast model system. We observed that replacement of glutamate 357 to alanine causes complete loss in toxicity while substitutions of serine 314 and histidine 353 with alanine exhibited partial loss in toxicity without affecting the stability of variants. In addition, replacement of another conserved serine residue at position 354 (S 354) within predicted S 314 H 353 <b>E</b> <b>357</b> did not affect toxicity of VopK. In essence, combined in silico and site directed mutagenesis, we have identified critical amino acids contributing to the lethal activity of VopK in yeast model system...|$|E

40|$|The CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) {{receptor}} is {{a family}} B GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor). It consists of a GPCR, CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) and an accessory protein, RAMP 1 (receptor activity-modifying protein 1). RAMP 1 is needed for CGRP binding and also cell-surface expression of CLR. There have been few systematic studies of the ECLs (extracellular loops) of family B GPCRs. However, {{they are likely to}} be especially important for the interaction of the N-termini of the peptide agonists that are the natural agonists for these receptors. We have carried out alanine scans on all three ECLs of CLR, as well as their associated juxtamembrane regions. Residues within all three loops influence CGRP binding and receptor activation. Mutation of Ala 203 and Ala 206 on ECL 1 to leucine increased the affinity of CGRP. Residues at the top of TM (transmembrane) helices 2 and 3 influenced CGRP binding and receptor activation. L 351 A and <b>E</b> <b>357</b> A in TM 6 /ECL 3 reduced receptor expression and may be needed for CLR association with RAMP 1.

Results: The luminescence spectroscopy observed upon binding of Eu 3 + to the exonuclease active site of T 4 DNA polymerase was interpreted relative to the binding of Eu 3 + or Tb 3 + observed with KF Both wild-type enzymes tightly bind a single Ln 3 + ion but in two isomeric forms. The single mutants of KF (D 424 A) and T 4 (D 219 A) also bind a single Eu 3 + ion tightly, but the alignment of the coordinating ligands is altered. The KF double mutant (D 355 A, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> A) exhibits a markedly altered and weakened binding site (Kd = 20 – 26 μM). Eu 3 + serves as a competitive inhibitor of Mg 2 +-induced polymerase and exonuclease activity, validating its use as a probe for these active sites. Conclusions: Ln 3 + luminescence spectroscopy is established as a sensitive way to determine the consequences of exonuclease binding-site mutations and to examine binding site similarities and differences among DNA polymerases from different sources. The binding sites of KF and T 4 DNA polymerase are shown to be quite similar...|$|E
30|$|Tannase can {{catalyse}} the hydrolysis of ester and depside bond in hydrolysable tannins {{to release}} glucose and gallic acid. Thus, tannase was crucial in the industries of foods, drinks and pharmaceutics (Chamorro et al. 2017; Lekha and Lonsane 1997; Li et al. 2018; Martins et al. 2016). In the past decades, both the high-yield production of tannase {{and the high}} activity conservation were considered as the research priorities. Since the discovery of tannase, its esterase and depsidase activities have been in debate {{for a long time}} (Haslam and Stangroom 1966). However, only few reports described the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of tannase. In the previous works, our group reported the crystal structure of LP-tan, which was the first tannase 3 D structure (Ren et al. 2013). Based on the apo and complexes structures of LP-tan, the hydrolysis mechanism of tannase was explained. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the esterase and depsidase activities of LP-tan shared the same catalytic site. When LP-tan binding the substrates, two hydrogen-bond binding networks were observed, the first network was formed between the amino acids G 77, A 164, S 163, H 451 and the carboxyl group of galloyl unit of the substrates; the other hydrogen-bonding network was formed between amino acids <b>E</b> <b>357,</b> K 343, P 421 and the hydroxyl groups of the galloyl unit of the substrates (Ren et al. 2013).

Nine different mutations were identified, of which six are novel. Three mutations involve consensus sequences for correct splicing, viz. IVS 6 - 1 (g-t), IVS 7 - 1 (g-a) and IVS 12 + 5 (g-a). Two missense mutations (C 193 R and G 369 V) and three nonsense mutations (R 237 X, <b>E</b> <b>357</b> X and E 364 X) were found.

Multivariable logistic regression examined the association between e-cigarette awareness and covariates. RESULTS: 75. 4 % of adults had heard of e-cigarettes, and 2. 3 % reported having used e-cigarettes. Greater awareness was associated with male gender and higher education.

40|$|The Brazil Lake {{pegmatite}} {{of southwestern}} Nova Scotia {{is a rare}} example of Li-Cs-Ta (LCT) -type pegmatite in the Meguma terrane of Nova Scotia. This spodumene-rich pegmatite is hosted by metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks of the Silurian White Rock Formation, which records both Acadian and Alleghanian deformation. In order to constrain the petrogenesis and thermal history of the pegmatite, samples of tantalite, molybdenite, and muscovite were collected for U-Pb, Re-Os, and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating, respectively. A single, large, euhedral tantalite crystal from an albite-quartz-spodumene assemblage yielded concordant U-Pb ages between 365 and 395 Ma (all ± 1 – 2 Ma). In contrast, molybdenite from quartzite adjacent to the pegmatite gave a Re-Os age of 353 ± 2. 5 Ma. Finally, a coarse muscovite grain from a quartz-feldspar-muscovite intergrowth surrounding a blocky K-feldspar megacryst was dated with the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar spot laser technique and yielded a maximum age of 347. 6 Ma for a core analysis and minimum age of 318. 4 Ma for a rim analysis. These data are interpreted {{to indicate that the}} time of pegmatite crystallization occurred at 395 Ma with the younger U-Pb tantalite ages (i. e., youngest ~ 365 Ma), the 353 Ma Re-Os molybdenite age, and the oldest 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age (i. e., 347 Ma) recording hydrothermal activity related to later magmatic events {{in this part of the}} Meguma terrane (<b>e.</b> g., <b>357</b> Ma Wedgeport Pluton). The muscovite ages record resetting and cooling related to the ca. 357 Ma magmatic event and later overprinting by Alleghanian deformation at ca. 320 Ma in this area.

40|$|The fourth EGF-like {{domain of}} thrombomodulin (TM 4), {{residues}} E 346 -F 389 in the TM sequence, has been synthesized. Refolding of the synthetic product under redox conditions gave a single major product. The disulfide bonding {{pattern of the}} folded, oxidized domain was (1 - 3, 2 - 4, 5 - 6), {{which is the same}} as that found in EGF protein. TM 4 was tested for TM anticoagulant activity because deletion and substitution mutagenesis experiments have shown that the fourth EGF-like domain of TM is essential for TM cofactor activity. TM 4 showed no TM-like activity in two assay systems, both for inhibition of fibrin clot formation, and for cofactor activity in thrombin activation of protein C. A preliminary structure of TM 4 was determined by 2 D 1 H NMR from 519 NOE-derived distance constraints. Distance geometry calculations yielded a single convergent structure. The structure resembles the structure of EGF and other known EGF-like domains but has some key differences. The central two-stranded beta-sheet is conserved despite the differences in the number of amino acids in the loops. The C-terminal loop formed by the disulfide bond between C 372 and C 386 in TM 4 is five amino acids longer than the analogous loop between C 33 and C 42 of EGF protein. This loop appears to have a different fold in TM 4 than in EGF protein. The loop forms the two outside strands of a broken, irregular tri-stranded beta-sheet, and amino acids H 384 -F 389 lie between the two strands forming the middle strand of the sheet. Thus, although the C-terminus of EGF protein forms one of the outside strands of a tri-stranded antiparallel sheet, the C-terminus of TM 4 forms the inside strand of an irregular tri-stranded parallel-anti-parallel sheet. The residues D 349, <b>E</b> <b>357,</b> and E 374, which were shown to be critical for cofactor activity by alanine scanning mutagenesis, all lie in a patch near the C-terminal loop, and are solvent accessible.

Com base nos deslocamentos destas freqÃÃncias para menores valores, comparativamente ao ligante livre, foi possÃvel identificar que os ligantes TCNQ e TCNE estÃo coordenados em sua forma radicalar, estado de oxidaÃÃo â 1, sugerindo assim a ocorrÃncia de um processo de transferÃncia de elÃtrons do centro metÃlico, previamente reduzido (Fe 2 +), para os ligantes TCNX. Os potenciais redox dos Ãtomos de ferro, nos complexos com os ligantes polinitrialados TCNQ (693 mV vs ENH) e TCNE (854 mV vs ENH), foram deslocados para potenciais mais positivos, comparativamente ao observado no complexo precursor cis-[Fe(cyclam) Cl 2]Cl (405 mV vs ENH), indicando assim um forte deslocamento de densidade eletrÃnica d&# 960; para os orbitais de simetria &# 960; dos ligantes TCNX. Os processos centrados nos ligantes coordenados ficaram mais prÃximos do que nos ligantes livres, indicando uma diminuiÃÃo na barreira de transferÃncia de elÃtrons, que segundos dados da literatura leva a uma melhor conduÃÃo elÃtrica. Os espectros eletrÃnicos dos complexos, em meio aquoso, apresentaram uma banda localizada em baixa energia, atribuÃda a transferÃncias de carga do tipo LMCT dos orbitais p&# 960; &# 61472;das molÃculas de TCNX, para os orbitais d&# 960;* do Ãon Fe 3 +.

Observa-se ainda nos dois complexos a presenÃa das bandas referentes Ãs transiÃÃes LMCT dos cloretos para o Ãon Fe 3 + em regiÃes muito prÃximas, em 557 no complexo com TCNE e em 568 nm no complexo com TCNQ. A presenÃa desta banda novamente sugere a presenÃa do Ferro no estado oxidado (Fe+ 3). The {{main objective}} of this work is to contribute with the chemistry of the system Fe-Cyclam through the synthesis and characterization of complexes with carboxylate ligants, acetate and oxalate, and polinitrilate ligands, 7, 7, 8, 8 -tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetracyanoethylene (TCNE). The infrared spectra of the cis-[Fe(cyclam) ox]PF 6 complex allowed to identify the coordination of the oxalate ligand to the iron metal in a bidentate mode {{as well as to}} suggest the presence of the macrocycle in the coordination sphere of the metal. The redox potential of the complex was observed at â 39 mV vs Ag/AgCl. The potential is dislocated 240 mV for more positive potential when compared to that observed for the precursor complex cis-[Fe(cyclamCl 2]Cl. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} stronger &# 963; effect of the oxalate ligand when compared to the chlorine. The UV-Vis spectra of the complex, presented three bands: 229 nm, attributed to a cyclam intraligand transition and the bands 293 nm and 357 nm, referring to ligand to metal electronic transfer from &# 960; orbitals of the oxalate to d&# 960;* of the metal. The photochemical experiments proved the great sensibility of the complex to the light presence, being observed the reactivity effect of the complex formed after the light exposition by the formation of the trans-[Fe(cyclam) acet 2]PF 6 complex. Through the Ray-X obtained of the crystal of the trans-[Fe(cyclam) acet 2]PF 6 complex was possible to identify the coordination of two molecules of acetate at the trans position, as well as to identify the disposition of the cyclam ligand on the plane in a trans-III arrange. The infrared spectrum of the complexes cis - [Fe(cyclam) (TCNX) Cl]Cl, where the TCNX represent the ligands TCNQ and TCNE, present a great number of bands referring to the &# 957;CN, when compared with the ligands not coordinated, confirming the symetry changed induced by the metal coordination. Through the wavenumber variation of these bands was possible to identify that the TCNQ and TCNE ligands are coordinated in your radical way, oxidation state â 1, suggestion this way the occurrence of a electron transfer from the iron, previously reduced (Fe+ 2), to the TCNX ligands. The redox potentials of the iron metals in the complexes with the polinitrilate ligands TCNQ (693 mV vs ENH) and TCNE (854 mV vs ENH) were dislocated for more positive potentials, when compared to the cis-[Fe(cyclam) Cl 2]Cl precursor complex (405 mV vs ENH), indicating the occurrence of an electronic density transfer to the TCNX molecules. The two potentials of the ligands on the complexes were closer than the ligands not coordinated, this approximation of the potential indicate a decrease of the inner electron transfer. The electronic spectra of the complexes, showed bands in the low energy region, attributed to a charge transfer LMCT, from the TCNX p&# 960; orbital to the metal d&# 960;* orbital. In the cis-[Fe(cyclam) (TCNQ) Cl]Cl complex, the band was observed at 764 nm while in the complex with the TCNE ligand this band was observed at 861 nm. Also, the complexes presented bands at 557 nm (TCNE complex) and 568 nm (TCNQ complex) referring to the LMCT transitions from the chlorine atoms to the iron metal reinforcing the assignment of the (Fe+ 3) oxidation state for the metal center...|$|E
40|$|RNA viruses {{have been}} used as model systems to {{understand}} the patterns and processes of molecular evolution because they have high mutation rates and are genetically diverse. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1), the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is highly genetically diverse, and is classified into several groups and subtypes. However, it has been difficult to use its diverse sequences to establish the overall phylogenetic relationships of different strains or the trends in sequence conservation with the construction of phylogenetic trees. Our aims were to systematically characterize HIV- 1 subtype evolution and to identify the regions responsible for HIV- 1 subtype differentiation at the amino acid level in the Pol protein, which is often used to classify the HIV- 1 subtypes. In this study, we systematically characterized the mutation sites in 2, 052 Pol proteins from HIV- 1 group M (144 subtype A; 1, 528 subtype B; 380 subtype C), using sequence similarity networks. We also used spectral clustering to group the sequences based on the network graph structures. A stepwise analysis of the cluster hierarchies allowed us to estimate a possible evolutionary pathway for the Pol proteins. The subtype A sequences also clustered according to when and where the viruses were isolated, whereas both the subtype B and C sequences remained as single clusters. Because the Pol protein has several functional domains, we identified the regions that are discriminative by comparing the structures of the domain-based networks. Our results suggest that sequence changes in the RNase H domain and the reverse transcriptase (RT) connection domain are responsible for the subtype classification. By analyzing the different amino acid compositions at each site in both domain sequences, we found that a few specific amino acid residues (i. <b>e.,</b> M <b>357</b> in the RT connection domain and Q 480, Y 483, and L 491 in the RNase H domain) represent the differences among the subtypes. These residues were located {{on the surface of the}} RT structure and in the vicinity of the amino acid sites responsible for RT enzymatic activity or function...|$|R
40|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) {{processing}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive method for near-net-shape manufacturing due to the distinct advantages it holds over conventional near-net-shape forming technologies. These advantages include lower cycle time, increased die life, reduced porosity, reduced solidification shrinkage, improved mechanical properties, etc. SSM processing techniques can not only produce the complex dimensional details (e. g. thin-walled sections) associated with conventional high-pressure die castings, but also can produce high integrity castings currently attainable only with squeeze and low-pressure permanent mold casting processes. There are two primary semi-solid processing routes, (a) thixocasting and (b) rheocasting. In the thixocasting route, one starts from a non-dendritic solid precursor material that is specially prepared by a primary aluminum manufacturer, using continuous casting methods. Upon reheating this material into the mushy (a. k. a. "two-phase") zone, a thixotropic slurry is formed, which becomes the feed for the casting operation. In the rheocasting route (a. k. a. "slurry-on-demand" or "SoD"), one starts from the liquid state, and the thixotropic slurry is formed directly from the melt via careful thermal management of the system; the slurry is subsequently fed into the die cavity. Of these two routes, rheocasting is favored in {{that there is no}} premium added to the billet cost, and the scrap recycling issues are alleviated. The CRP (Trade Marked) is a process where the molten metal flows through a reactor prior to casting. The role of the reactor is to ensure that copious nucleation takes place and that the nuclei are well distributed throughout the system prior to entering the casting cavity. The CRP (Trade Marked) has been successfully applied in hyper-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. e., 390 alloy) where two liquids of equal or different compositions and temperatures are mixed in the reactor and creating a SSM slurry. The process has been mostly used for hypo-eutectic Al-Si alloys (i. <b>e.,</b> 356, <b>357,</b> etc.) where a single melt passes through the reactor. In addition, the CRP (Trade Marked) was designed to be flexible for thixocasting or rheocasting applications as well as batch or continuous casting. Variable heat extraction rates can be obtained by controlling either the superheat of the melt, the temperature of the channel system, or the temperature of the reactor. This program had four main objectives all of which were focused on a mechanistic understanding of the process {{in order to be able}} to scale it up, to develop it into a robust process,and for SSM processing to be commercially used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{production}} of 16 S rRNA methylases by Gram-negative bacilli {{has emerged as}} a novel mechanism for high-level resistance to aminoglycosides by these organisms in a variety of geographic locations. Therefore, the spread of high-level aminoglycoside resistance determinants has become a great concern. Methods Between January 2006 and July 2008, 680 distinct Escherichia coli clinical isolates were collected from a teaching hospital in Wenzhou, China. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify 16 S rRNA methylase and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes, including armA and rmtB, and in situ hybridization was performed to determine the location of 16 S rRNA methylase genes. Conjugation experiments were subsequently performed to determine whether aminoglycoside resistance was transferable from the E. coli isolates via 16 S rRNA methylase-bearing plasmids. Homology of the isolates harboring 16 S rRNA methylase genes was determined using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results Among the 680 <b>E.</b> coli isolates, <b>357</b> (52. 5 %), 346 (50. 9 %) and 44 (6. 5 %) isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, respectively. Thirty-seven of 44 amikacin-resistant isolates harbored 16 S rRNA methylase genes, with 36 of 37 harboring the rmtB gene and only one harboring armA. The positive rates of 16 S rRNA methylase genes among all isolates and amikacin-resistant isolates were 5. 4 % (37 / 680) and 84. 1 % (37 / 44), respectively. Thirty-one isolates harboring 16 S rRNA methylase genes also produced ESBLs. In addition, high-level aminoglycoside resistance could be transferred by conjugation from four rmtB -positive donors. The plasmids of incompatibility groups IncF, IncK and IncN were detected in 34, 3 and 3 isolates, respectively. Upstream regions of the armA gene contained IS CR 1 and tnpU, the latter a putative transposase gene,. Another putative transposase gene, tnpD, was located within a region downstream of armA. Moreover, a transposon, Tn 3, was located upstream of the rmtB. Nineteen clonal patterns were obtained by PFGE, with type H representing the prevailing pattern. Conclusion A high prevalence of plasmid-mediated rmtB gene was found among clinical E. coli isolates from a Chinese teaching hospital. Both horizontal gene transfer and clonal spread were responsible for the dissemination of the rmtB gene. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we studied the {{possibility}} of using nanoscale self-assembled arrays as templates to achieve periodic nanomodulation in superconducting thin films and their vortex pinning properties. The first system that was investigated was the periodic surface of a colloidal crystal grown by convective self-assembly of spherical colloidal polystyrene (PS) particles on SiO 2. The top layer of the crystal consists of a closely packed (= triangular) array of nanospheres on which thin Nb films were grown. We studied crystals of nanospheres with a different diameter i. <b>e.</b> <b>357</b> nm and 202 nm. The Nb film thickness turned out to be crucial for achieving a reasonable level of electrical conduction in the weakly linked Nb "net" on top of the colloidal crystal. In the case of the 357 PS colloidal crystal covered with 130 nm Nb, we established the existence of a honeycomb potential of pinning centers which can be associated with the voids between the colloidal particles. The H – T phase diagram and resistance measurements indicate that this system behaves as a superconducting network, giving rise to integer and non-integer matching effects between the vortex lattice and the colloidal void lattice in magnetic fields up to 72 mT. However, the 202 nm PS colloidal crystal covered with 70 nm Nb shows that the nanosphere diameter clearly controls the vortex pinning properties of the colloidal crystal surface. Here, the resistance measurements only reveal weak pinning effects which are not entirely-field stable, apart from one single strongly pinned phase. The H – T phase diagram suggests the weak pinning to originate from purely geometric ordering effects due to competing symmetries in the colloidal lattice. Nevertheless, by using colloidal crystals of sufficiently large diameter, it is possible to observe periodic matching effects in magnetic fields covering the entire 100 G range. Currently, we are investigating {{the possibility of}} using macroscopically ordered monolayers of PS nanopsheres (monolayer) as etching mask to produce periodic pinning arrays in Nb thin film substrates (and magnetic films) and to study the effect of the nanosphere diameter on vortex pinning by magnetization and transport measurements. Futhermore, the use of neutron scattering is targetted {{for the study of the}} evolution of the vortex lattice symmetry with magnetic field in these structures. The second system that was investigated was the surface of anodized Al 2 O 3 (AAO), which is essentially a membrane of triangularly arranged parallel hollow channels. AAO templates with different channel spacing and diameter were prepared; their surface was covered with 50 nm Nb. The superconductor mimics the periodic surface features, resulting in a Nb thin film with a triangular array of porous defects. We were able to analyze the vortex pinning properties of these system in the framework of the research conducted on lithographic antidot lattices. In the case of the template with 100 nm period and a pore diameter of 40 nm, the H – T phase diagram obtained from transport measurements indicates the existence of integer matching effects in fields up to 700 mT. The magnetization measurements showed that the "porous" antidots to act as efficient pinning centers, providing strongly increased critical currents compared to the plain reference film. Therefore, the triangular porous lattice can be labeled as a triangular lattice of "porous antidots". The second template with 50 nm period and a pore diameter of 25 nm suffered from a decrease in local order, but showed a single strong matching peak at a magnetic field close to 1 T. AAO templated Nb thin films can provide enhanced critical currents and periodic matching effects in magnetic fields covering the entire 1000 G range. A practical application of nanoporous Al 2 O 3 might be its incorporation into wires and cables as a template – matrix for Nb 3 Sn in the construction of high-field magnets. Recently, our interest in AAO membranes shifted partially away from the membrane surface towards the membrane itself. First, we are investigating the possibility to grow thin, long magnetic nanowires with local monopole character as a PPA system for AAO templated Nb thin films. Secondly, we are investigating the possibility to take advantage of the membrane porosity of AAO by using it as a directing or channeling guide for (superconducting or magnetic) ions to create arrays of size-dependent clusters in a host substrate. In conclusion, the analysis of the colloidal and AAO templates as topographic modulators has clearly shown that the notion and importance of the antidot in the context of superconductivity can be extended to non-lithographic, less ideal systems. Nanoscale self-assembled surfaces have evidenced to provide lateral nanostructuring which allows controlling and manipulating up to a certain degree vortex motion and critical currents in superconducting thin films. In the case of AAO, the template effect has shown to provide efficient pinning centra in a large range of temperature and magnetic field. The potential of self-assembly is not limited to the functionality produced by the surface of its structures, but can reasonably be expected to be further integrated in the solid state research on nanostructures.

To this end, we measured phytoplankton fluorescence characteristics and their ratio of xanthophyll cycle pigment to photosynthetic pigments within the upper mixed layer (UML) and in short-term deck incubation experiments. Phytoplankton within the UML photoacclimated by increasing their ratio of xanthophyll cycle (diadinoxanthin [dd] and diatoxanthin [dt]) pigments to chlorophyll a. The photoacclimation processes observed within the UML did, however, not influence the protection of phytoplankton from photodamage during short-term near-surface irradiance experiments. Exposure to near-surface irradiance resulted in photodamage in all experiments, regardless of the phytoplankton community composition and irradiance levels. Incubating phytoplankton for six hours at either 2 % or 50 % of surface irradiance prior to exposure to near-surface irradiance did not alter the photodamage characteristics. This suggests that short-term photoacclimation processes within the UML are not adequate to protect phytoplankton from photodamage when cells are mixed up to the surface from depth, and that repair of damaged photosystems is crucial for maintaining photosynthesis under fluctuating irradiance conditions, even at very low mean irradiance levels. Likely, continuously operating photoacclimation processes offset to some extent the negative effects of photodamage on photosynthetic performance, albeit with increased metabolic costs.
