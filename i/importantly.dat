5|$|More <b>importantly,</b> the irreplaceable mediaeval street plan remained.|$|E
5|$|Johnson offered Wollstonecraft {{work as a}} translator, {{prompting}} her {{to learn}} French and German. More <b>importantly,</b> Johnson provided encouragement at crucial moments during the writing of her seminal political treatises A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{functions}} of the queen ant sounds are to recruit workers, smell nestmates, and facilitate oral exchanges of food and pheromones. Most <b>importantly,</b> however, {{is the fact that}} distress noises made by the queen causes workers to raise their guard and bolster her protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{ostensible}} reason given {{was that}} Britain {{was required to}} safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the casus belli and, <b>importantly,</b> legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the Fundamental Rights is to {{preserve}} individual liberty and democratic principles based on equality of all members of society. Dr Ambedkar said that {{the responsibility of the}} legislature is not just to provide fundamental rights but also and rather more <b>importantly,</b> to safeguard them.|$|E
5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is {{displayed on the}} hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most <b>importantly</b> in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E
5|$|After leaving politics, Rutherford {{continued}} his law practice and {{his involvement with}} a wide range of community groups. Most <b>importantly,</b> he became chancellor of the University of Alberta, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and Jasper National Park's Mount Rutherford are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, Rutherford House, was opened as a museum in 1973.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to get its men and materiel to France, had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected El Occidente and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their s for transatlantic crossings, and, most <b>importantly,</b> were in port or not far at sea. After El Occidente discharged her last load of passengers and cargo, she was officially {{handed over to the}} Army on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most <b>importantly</b> with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous {{is tired}} of {{corporate}} interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information, but more <b>importantly,</b> the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more <b>importantly,</b> a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} moment came on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D. Cal. 1879), {{that the federal government}} controlled the railroad land grants, and more <b>importantly,</b> the state could not control ultra vires acts of corporations.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. <b>Importantly,</b> the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most <b>importantly,</b> the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are useful}} as bioindicators (of good water quality), {{since they are}} {{sensitive}} to water pollution, and are {{large enough to be}} assessed conveniently in the field. Some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature <b>importantly</b> in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most <b>importantly</b> glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} new {{war against the}} Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. Trajan continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, <b>importantly,</b> annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E
5|$|Espanto Jr. is {{the most}} {{recognizable}} ring name of Jesús Andrade Salas (born May 11, 1956), a retired Mexican luchador, or professional wrestler. Over his 25-year-long career, Andrade worked under {{a number of different}} aliases, most <b>importantly</b> as Espanto Jr. ("Terror Jr."), later on as El Santo Negro ("The Black Saint"), and as the first person to work as Pentagón. Andrade was forced to retire from wrestling after suffering a life-threatening injury during a match that briefly left him clinically dead before being revived {{in the middle of the}} ring.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. More <b>importantly,</b> Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most <b>importantly</b> for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, most <b>importantly,</b> the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the troops who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E
5|$|Frank Case, {{owner of}} the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by {{treating}} them to free celery and popovers; more <b>importantly,</b> they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although they referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle.|$|E
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more <b>importantly,</b> between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
5|$|Gogel's General Taxation Plan {{was finally}} enacted in June 1805; a first government-approved attempt at {{unification}} of the Dutch spelling was made; an embryonic Department of Agriculture and Department of Hydraulics were formed, to foreshadow the later government departments; even a Pharmacopeia Batavia started {{the regulation of}} drugs; and the School Law of 1806 organized a national system of public elementary education. Most <b>importantly</b> perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather observations, are logged by location. Their siting predates the massive sprawl, roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which {{contribute to the}} UHI. More <b>importantly,</b> station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets. Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, but overall trends change in magnitude, not direction.|$|E
5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More <b>importantly,</b> though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 he {{photographed the}} film Kentucky Kernels, {{starring}} the comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey. More <b>importantly,</b> Edward {{got to work}} with his father, Henry Sr., on the final film of Henry's career. 1936 saw his tenure at RKO come to an end, {{when he decided to}} turn down a new contract and enter the freelance arena; he shot films at both RKO and Paramount during the remainder of the year. The year also saw Cronjager's selection to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) nominating rules committee for the cinematography Oscar.|$|E
5|$|In AD 13, Augustus {{appointed}} him {{commander of the}} forces in the Rhine, which totaled eight legions and was about one-third of Rome's total military force. The next year in August, Augustus died and on 17 September the Senate met to confirm Tiberius as princeps. That day the Senate also dispatched a delegation to Germanicus' camp to send its condolences {{for the death of}} his grandfather, and more <b>importantly,</b> to grant him proconsular imperium. The delegation would not arrive until October.|$|E
5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More <b>importantly,</b> the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data. An intermediate case is fiber diffraction in which the subunits are arranged periodically {{in at least one}} dimension.|$|E
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More <b>importantly,</b> {{he laid out}} his belief in Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most <b>importantly,</b> the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' Army of the North and Kellermann's Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading towards them was Brunswick's coalition army of about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and the French royalist Army of Condé.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most <b>importantly,</b> {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|Many of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are {{important}} in theoretical physics. Representations appear {{in the description of}} fields in classical field theory, most <b>importantly</b> the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin. The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More <b>importantly,</b> they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>importantly</b> the operas {{themselves}} {{are now beginning}} to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>importantly,</b> the High Speed Photometer was {{replaced}} with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC {{was replaced}} with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added coprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.|$|E
