50|$|Giant Drop, an Intamin second-generation drop tower, and Dare Devil Dive, a skycoaster, {{were added}} in 1997. Giant Drop {{was placed on}} the {{southwest}} side of Southwest Territory, and Dare Devil Dive was added in Big Top's former location in County Fair. In August 1997, a <b>hitch</b> <b>bar</b> connecting the third and fourth cars on the blue side of the American Eagle roller coaster separated as the ride was braking, causing the rear two cars to bump into the front three cars. Several people were sent to local area hospitals. The ride re-opened in time for Fright Fest.|$|E
50|$|After 13 {{years of}} production, 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated {{exterior}} and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, {{as well as a}} new front header panel that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire was moved from a rear exterior bumper mount to an interior location due to de-contenting the rear bumper. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer <b>hitch</b> <b>bar</b> and a unique pivot bracket and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} trains that were {{distinguishable}} by color: Red, Blue, Yellow and Green. Each train had four three-bench Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters cars {{held together by}} <b>hitch</b> <b>bars.</b> Each car contained six seats. Each train held a maximum of 24 riders.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a Conastoga wagon {{built by}} John Studebaker in 1830, ca. 1900. A covered wagon {{stands on a}} neutral background, pictured in profile with an upward curve to the cabin. The wheels are spoked and the <b>hitching</b> <b>bar</b> for the horses appears to be broken off at the end. The picture file card reads: "An {{original}} pairie [prairie?] schooner"...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of tow hitch, {{including}} a ball <b>hitch,</b> tow <b>bar,</b> pintle and lunette ring, three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, and drawbar, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Hall {{was arrested}} on May 14, 2010 and charged with disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} a police officer. Police were called to the <b>Hitching</b> Post <b>Bar</b> in Chuluota, Florida after Hall (who had been [...] "drinking heavily", {{according to the police}} report), [...] "became aggressive". When they arrived, they found Hall yelling and cursing at amateur wrestling personalities and bar staff. Hall was told he was not allowed to return to the establishment. In his police statement, Hall described himself as an unemployed professional wrestler, despite having a job with TNA Wrestling (who would release him a month later).|$|R
50|$|Towing is {{coupling}} {{two or more}} objects {{together so}} that they may be pulled by a designated power source or sources. The towing source may be a motorized land vehicle, vessel, animal, or human, the load anything that can be pulled. These may be joined by a chain, rope, <b>bar,</b> <b>hitch,</b> three-point, fifth wheel, coupling, drawbar, integrated platform, or other means of keeping the objects together while in motion.|$|R
50|$|A tow <b>hitch</b> (or tow <b>bar)</b> is {{a device}} {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the trailer ball. This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull <b>hitches</b> and draw <b>bars</b> can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|R
