40|$|Menstruation {{is a large}} {{problem for}} females in {{development}} countries today. Studies have shown that around 40 percent of menstruating girls have been absent from school due to their menstruation. One of the challenges {{that need to be}} solved is the absence of <b>female</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> amongst women, especially in low income and developing countries due to the cost of commercial products. In countries where the national economy is unstable or poorly comes a problem with importing products, {{it would be better if}} they could produce their own products so that the national economy is supported. Small factories and production sites that produce <b>female</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> have started to form in some areas. This shows that it is possible to produce in the context where the product is going to be sold. One of the advantages of this system is from the environmental perspective, many of the local production sites use environmentally friendly materials and some products are up to 95 percent bio-degradable. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a concept for a sustainable female hygiene product that women in developing countries can afford to buy, this so that social effects can be enabled due to the security that a functioning protection can bring. To be able to do so a field study in Uganda has been conducted. During the study users and local producers were interviewed to find out what demands and prerequisites there are to create a female hygiene product that can be produced and used locally. The field study gave a deeper understanding and knowledge about both the subject as whole and the technical aspects to take into consideration when developing a female hygiene product. The study confirmed that <b>female</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products,</b> or rather the lack of them, are a big problem that needs to be solved quickly. It also revealed that the possibilities for producing in the context existed but was not developed enough. Through an analysis of the empirical findings as well as theories about, for example, material and production, six concepts were developed. The concepts and already existing products were evaluated and correlated to requirements collected in the field study. One concept was chosen for further development from this evaluation. This concept consists of a disposable napkin that is fastened by putting it in holders sewn in the panty. The panty can be bought as a product with existing holders or the holders can be sewn into the users own panties. The final concept has taken both technical aspects and social effects into account. Lists of requirements on material for the concept as well as the production of it are also included in the work. A prototype of the concept has been sewn and tested. The final concept in this work is not a finished product and needs further developing before being released as a product. More work need to be done on specifying the production and specific materials to implement the concept. For further developing, it is also important to have in mind in what context the product would be used due to the different possibilities and demands that the setting gives...|$|E
40|$|Feminine hygiene {{products}} and menstruation education have transformed {{the lives of}} women throughout the world. The P&G Feminine Care Clinical Innovation Research Program has played a key role by expanding scientific knowledge as well as developing technical insights and tools for the development of feminine hygiene products. The aim has been {{to meet the needs of}} women throughout their life stages, advancing their urogenital health beyond just menstruation, as well as helping to understand the role of sex hormones in various important health issues that women face. This review article highlights key contributions and research findings in <b>female</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products,</b> urogenital health research, and method development. The clinical research team focused on utilizing the results of clinical safety studies to advance the acceptance of feminine hygiene products world-wide. Key findings include that perception of skin sensitivity is not limited to the facial area, but is also relevant to the body and the genital area. Also, they shed light on the role of estrogen in autoimmune diseases as well as premenstrual syndrome. Efforts in the method development area focused on innovative tools that are reliable, predictive of clinical trial results and capable of measuring wear comfort, genital skin health, and the impact of product use on the consumer’s quality of life. A novel method, behind-the-knee (BTK) test, developed to model irritation under normal wear conditions, was the first to account for both chemical and mechanical sources o...|$|E

Sanitary napkins (American English) or sanitary towels (British English), tampons, menstrual cups, pantiliners, and period panties are the major categories of feminine <b>hygiene</b> <b>products.</b> Products meant to [...] "cleanse" [...] {{the area of the}} vulva or inside of the vagina, such as feminine deodorants, douche, feminine powders, feminine soaps, and feminine wipes are also considered [...] "feminine hygiene" [...] products.|$|R

40|$|The {{absorption}} cores in disposable nappies, incontinence {{pads and}} <b>female</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> are manufactured by a dry mat-forming process. Cellulose fibers and super-absorbing particles are suspended in air and blown onto a forming wheel {{on which the}} cores are formed. It is vital {{for the quality of}} the product that the fibres and particles are evenly distributed in the suspension. The purpose of this project has been to establish a platform of scientific knowledge from which the fluid mechanics aspect of the manufacturing process can be understood. To better understand the problems relevant to the process, air/particle flows and air/fiber flows have been studied separately. A two-fluid model with a modified &# 954;-&# 949; model for the gas phase has been used to simulate a horizontal air/particle flow. An optical probe and a calibration procedure for measuring the local particle volume fraction have been developed and used to verify the models. The probe uses two optical fibres, to emit infrared light and detect light reflected by the particles. The calibration procedure {{is based on the assumption}} that light paths including reflections on more than one particle do not make a significant contribution to the probe signal. Measurements of a horizontal air/particle flow have been made to verify the simulations. The agreement between simulations and experiments is good. For the air/fiber flow, it is suggested that a two-fluid model be used together with a turbulence model for the gas phase and a transport equation for a floc characterizing scalar. This scalar may be either flocculation intensity or floc size. A technique for characterizing the flow using optical probes has been developed. Measurements of floc velocity and size distributions have been made in a production-scale facility for process research. The shape of the measured floc size distribution indicates that the mechanism for aggregating fibres into flocs is strong compared to the mechanism for breaking up flocs...|$|E

The questionnaire comprised close- and open-ended questions designed to collect information on the housewives’ socio-econmic background, oral hygiene habits, and selection criteria for oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>products.</b> Results: A total of 340 housewives participated in this study. Most (59 %) of them had attended secondary school and only 4 % had attained tertiary education level. Nearly all (99. 7 %) of the housewives brushed their teeth with a toothbrush daily and most (82 %) brushed twice a day. However, the majority (88 %) of the housewives did not use interdental brush and only 6 % of them used dental floss daily. Only 12 % of the housewives used mouthrinse at least once a day. Regarding how their criteria for good oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>products,</b> only 5 % of the housewives considered both small brush head and soft bristle as the characteristics of a good toothbrush. Cleaning effectiveness, price, and band were the most important factors which affected the housewives’ purchase of oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: Most housewives in Hong Kong brush their teeth twice daily but proportionally few of them use interdental cleaning aids regularly. Only a small proportion of the housewives know how to choose oral <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> correctly...|$|R
