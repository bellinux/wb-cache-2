Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough {{that it is impossible to}} read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006. The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride. Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to dedicate to the project and who could focus exclusively on it.|$|E

Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering {{what it would be like}} to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive.

500|$|The {{development}} of Unorthodox Jukebox started when Mars {{wanted to create}} something unforeseen with the follow-up of his debut album. He began not only by not allowing himself to [...] "get boxed in to any one genre" [...] during the recording sessions for the album, but also by showing the influences of several other music styles [...] "by having the autonomy and luxury of walking into the studio and claim [...] like doing a hip-hop, R, soul or rock record". Due to the music variety, the singer refused to [...] "pick a lane" [...] for Unorthodox Jukebox. As Mars <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to create the album, something that didn't happen during his debut, he reportedly had the possibility to develop a musically outstanding product that displayed his music taste and completely revealed his artistry. Because {{he had been a}} composer of pop and radio-friendly songs for a long time, it ultimately influenced the style of his debut; however, he didn't have the chance to craft the [...] "sounds and sonics" [...] he wanted to. As a result, Mars hoped to [...] "let loose" [...] and discuss darker, more risqué subject matter, while drawing on the [...] "danger" [...] embraced by pop artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince.|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months {{and by the time they}} left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E

2500|$|.....I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for Norling as an {{international}} referee. The Welshman and New Zealander David Bishop {{would be the best}} I've seen during my years of Test match rugby. And the common factor linking Norling and Bishop was that both played the advantage rule very well, they had a real empathy for the game and its players, and they seemed to enjoy letting the game flow. Rarely could either official be accused of whistling for a stoppage prematurely... Norling {{was also one of the}} more flamboyant referees. The crowd always knew when he was out there. At the same time, he was a top drawer referee and perhaps could get away with a bit of the showmanship because his decisions were generally spot-on.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the failure}} of Operation Dove, Ryan {{remained}} in Berlin. Between Autumn 1940 and January 1943 {{he lived in a}} [...] "large gloomy flat" [...] in Berlin with an acquaintance from Ireland, Helmut Clissmann, and Hans Ritter, both of whom were Abwehr assets. Clissmann was married to Elizabeth [...] "Budge" [...] Mulcahy of Sligo, a friend of both Ryan and Leopold Kerney. As an exchange student in Dublin in the 1930s Clissmann had known Ryan and other republicans and socialists well; before Hitler came to power, he {{had been a member of}} a left-wing student organisation. Ryan was not in good health as a result of his wound and treatment in the Spanish prison, and at one stage he had a stroke, but he remained convivial and drew around him a small circle of friends. He had to remain incognito and in general did not discuss politics. He grew increasingly deaf (though his friends suggested that he sometimes feigned deafness to avoid uncomfortable conversations with the German authorities) so that he could not be left alone at night – he could not hear the anti-aircraft sirens. He later had to spend his days outdoors or in cafés (where he became friendly with Francis Stuart, whom he had known from Dublin) so that people could see him if the sirens sounded. He took Irish newspapers to Stuart and, being in a position to get extra rations, shared them generously with his friends. In return, Stuart took Ryan, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on his hands, on trips to the countryside and on outings with his students. Stephen Hayes, Chief of Staff of the IRA, claimed that Ryan and Stuart were carrying out propaganda work among Irish prisoners of war. This was untrue. They visited a camp for Irish prisoners, who signified their intent of joining an [...] "Irish Guard". Ryan and Clissmann also visited a camp containing some men who intended setting up this Guard. Ryan had nothing to do with this and the scheme came to nothing. Ryan regretted visiting the camp and told Stuart that the whole scheme disheartened him – he only had sympathy with men who were, like he and his comrades had been, in prison camps.|$|E
