The frequency is then compared to stored information to evaluate if the note is correct. Regular singing segments do not feature speech recognition, and so humming into the microphones at the correct pitch will also score points. Rap sections use a combination of speech recognition and rhythm detection.|$|E
25|$|One major {{disadvantage}} to the {{superheterodyne receiver}} {{is the problem}} of image frequency. In heterodyne receivers, an image frequency is an undesired input frequency equal to the station frequency plus twice the intermediate frequency. The image frequency results in two stations being received at the same time, thus producing interference. Image frequencies can be eliminated by sufficient attenuation on the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal</b> by the RF amplifier filter of the superheterodyne receiver.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the huff-duff {{system had}} largely {{displaced}} BTDF by about 1943. Huff-duff used balanced amplifiers that fed {{directly into a}} CRT to instantly display the direction directly from the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal,</b> requiring no mechanical movement of any sort. This allowed even the most fleeting signals to be captured and located. The display, in spite of operating on entirely different principles, was {{very similar to the}} US mechanical system. Huff-duff was a closely guarded secret, and did not become well known until {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
40|$|Estimation {{of arrival}} angles and <b>incoming</b> <b>signals</b> is a {{challenging}} problem for HF channels where the signals are correlated and {{the separation between}} the signals can be as low as a couple of degrees. In this paper, a new algorithm, Multipath Separation- Direction of Arrival (MS-DOA), is developed to estimate both the arrival angles in elevation and azimuth and the <b>incoming</b> <b>signals</b> at {{the output of the}} reference antenna with very high accuracy. The MS-DOA algorithm provides reliable angle and signal estimates even with small separation of arrival angles and for low SNRs. The minimum number of antennas that are required by the algorithm is only one more than the number of <b>incoming</b> <b>signals.</b> In a narrowed down region of interest and for a few <b>incoming</b> <b>signals,</b> the computational search time for MS-DOA is only a couple of minutes in a Standard PC...|$|R

25|$|The {{directional}} {{qualities of}} the radiogoniometer work in both directions; {{it can be used}} to determine the direction of an <b>incoming</b> <b>signal,</b> or change the direction of a transmission. During early experiments, this capability was used to produce a radio signal that swept the sky like a lighthouse beam, allowing conventional radio receivers to determine their location by timing the passage of the signal. A typical solution was to broadcast a specific start signal, often Morse code, to start the sweep, and the slowly sweep a steady signal after that. The operator timed from the end of the start signal to the maximum in the continuous tone, and then divided by the rotation rate to determine the angle.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the proposals of Motor Theory and Direct Realism about the relation between phonological features and articulatory gestures, Kenneth N. Stevens proposed another kind of relation: between phonological features and auditory properties. According to this view, listeners are inspecting the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal</b> for the so-called acoustic landmarks which are particular events in the spectrum carrying information about gestures which produced them. Since these gestures are limited by the capacities of humans' articulators and listeners are sensitive to their auditory correlates, the lack of invariance simply {{does not exist in}} this model. The acoustic properties of the landmarks constitute the basis for establishing the distinctive features. Bundles of them uniquely specify phonetic segments (phonemes, syllables, words).|$|E
25|$|Radio {{interferometry}} was pioneered in 1946, when Joseph Lade Pawsey, Ruby Payne-Scott and Lindsay McCready used {{a single}} antenna atop a sea cliff to observe 200MHz solar radiation. Two incident beams, one {{directly from the}} sun and the other reflected from the sea surface, generated the necessary interference. The first multi-receiver interferometer was built in the same year by Martin Ryle and Vonberg. In 1960, Ryle and Antony Hewish published the technique of aperture synthesis to analyze interferometer data. The aperture synthesis process, which involves autocorrelating and discrete Fourier transforming the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal,</b> recovers both the spatial and frequency variation in flux. The result is a 3D image whose third axis is frequency. For this work, Ryle and Hewish were jointly awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{point is that}} the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual - when an atom “lases” it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal.</b> There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser. [...] The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} a single-frequency network (SFN) is such that the {{transmitters}} in a network must broadcast the same signal at the same time. To achieve synchronization, the broadcaster must counter any differences in propagation time incurred by the different methods and distances involved in carrying the signal from the multiplexer to the different transmitters. This is done by applying a delay to the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal</b> at the transmitter based on a timestamp generated at the multiplexer, created {{taking into account the}} maximum likely propagation time, with a generous added margin for safety.

2500|$|A typical {{complete}} filter {{will consist of}} a number of Zobel sections for roll-off, frequency dips and temperature followed by a flat attenuator section to bring the level down to a standard attenuation. [...] This is followed by a fixed gain amplifier to bring the signal back up to a usable level, typically 0dBu. [...] The gain of the amplifier is usually no more than 45dB maximum. [...] Any more and the amplification of line noise will tend to cancel out the quality benefits of improved bandwidth. [...] This limit on amplification essentially limits how much the bandwidth can be increased by these techniques. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} no one part of the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal</b> band will be amplified by the full 45dB. [...] The 45dB is made up of the line loss in the flat part of its spectrum plus the basic loss of each section. [...] In general, each section will be minimum loss at a different frequency band, hence the amplification in that band will be limited to the basic loss of just that one filter section, assuming insignificant overlap. [...] A typical choice for R0 is 600Ω. [...] A good quality transformer (usually essential, but not shown on the diagram), known as a repeating coil, is at the beginning of the chain where the line terminates.|$|E
2500|$|To {{adequately}} reproduce a {{wide range}} of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher sound pressure level or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named subwoofers (for very low frequencies); woofers (low frequencies); mid-range speakers (middle frequencies); tweeters (high frequencies); and sometimes supertweeters, optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls upon the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation [...] "tweeter" [...] for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as [...] "HF" [...] or [...] "highs". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a [...] "filter network", called a crossover, separates the <b>incoming</b> <b>signal</b> into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with n separate frequency bands is described as [...] "n-way speakers": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker driver of the type pictured are termed [...] "dynamic" [...] (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., moving iron speaker), or speakers using piezoelectric or electrostatic systems, or any of several other sorts.|$|E
