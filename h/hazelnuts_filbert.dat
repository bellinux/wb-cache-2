40|$|Graduation date: 1990 A {{parasitic}} wasp, Trioxys pallidus Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) was {{imported from}} Europe and initially released against the filbert aphid Mvzocallis coryli (Goetze) in <b>hazelnut</b> (<b>filbert)</b> orchards of the Willamette Valley, Oregon beginning in 1984. In the present study, I investigated the establishment rates of this parasitoid. A total of 13 orchards in 1987 and 30 orchards in 1988 were sampled twice per year. Five to ten trees were selected at random in each orchard and these trees were sampled by collecting and examining ten twigs per tree and counting {{the number of}} aphids and aphid mummies on four leaves per twig. The rate of parasitization was calculated by Total No. of mummies / Total No. of aphids + mummies X 100. Data show that the parasitoid has established in many commercial orchards and out of the total of 3 0 orchards studied eleven had breeding population of Trioxys pallidus and that is rapidly moving to adjoining orchards. The parasitoid appears to have survived the standard insecticide applications in commercial orchards. The level of resistance of a field collected population of Trioxys pallidus to the most commonly used pesticides in the filbert system including Metasystox-R, Pydrin, Zolone, Diazinon, and Lorsban was determined. Adult parasitoid populations continuously exposed to Pydrin (2 sprays per year) and carbaryl (1 spray per year) since 1985, were collected near Corvallis, Benton County, Oregon and their response to various insecticides was assessed. Similar data were collected from a laboratory reared susceptible population which was never exposed to insecticides. Comparasion of LC 50 and LC 95 values showed no significant differences in the susceptibility of these two populations to test insecticides, although build up of some tolerance against Pydrin was evident. The field population required 1. 9 times higher rate than the laboratory population for 50...|$|R

The “Barcelona” variety remains the most widely planted in Oregon, which today produces 98 percent of the filbert crop in the United States. Ironically, filberts do not grow well in the Sierra foothills, where Gillet propagated them.|$|R

The city used to be sponsor an annual Filbert Festival in early August as a general summer celebration, featuring music, food, and family fun; it was canceled in 2007 due to withdrawal of a key sponsor, and the future for the festival is uncertain.

50|$|Jory soils {{generally}} support forest vegetation, dominantly Douglas fir and Oregon white oak. They {{are very}} productive forest soils. Many {{areas have been}} cleared and are used for agricultural crops. The Jory soils and the climate of the Willamette Valley provide an ideal setting {{for the production of}} many crops, including Christmas trees, various berries, <b>filberts</b> (<b>hazelnuts),</b> sweet corn, wheat, and many varieties of grass seed.

40|$|<b>Hazelnuts</b> or <b>filberts</b> can {{be useful}} crops for home food {{production}} or hobbyists in Utah. Several species have nuts with good flavor, with American, beaked and certain hybrid types most likely to produce consistently. Though European hazelnut with its large nuts is very common commercially, this species blossoms earlier than others and {{is more likely to}} have flowers damaged or destroyed by unseasonably cold weather. All hazelnut species benefit from being planted in frost protected areas to increase the likelihood of consistent nut production. In Utah, hazelnuts grown for nut production are usually maintained as shrubs, with an oval or round shape that grows to 15 feet in height and width. Hazelnuts thrive in well-drained, loamy soil but grow in many soil types as long as the soil is well-drained. Nut production is best when cross pollination occurs with another variety of the same species (see Tables 1 and 2) or with other seed grown plants of the same species...|$|R

Significantly greater densities of M. coryli were found in block 1 in the tree rows in both years (1993 & 1994).

The bearer plants which have this property came under the TAS 16 “Tangible” standards with the amendment. The study bring out the hazelnut farming which is a type of herbal production. As a biological asset hazelnut fruit is derived from the filbert and filberts fully comply with the all properties of the bearer plants which are defined in TAS 41. So filberts are described as bearer plants in the study. The aim of the study is to offer suggestions about which accounting transactions should be done coherently to the TAS from capitalization the multi-stemmed shrubs to end of term assessment and evaluation for manufacturing companies dealing with hazelnut cultivation. For this reason, it is carried out the case study method in the research and submitted samples for the practice based on real data of a hazelnut grove whose owner is Durak Hazelnut Corporation, one of the important companies in hazelnut industry in Turkey. In the study results, in general it is found that the filberts classified as bearer plants have a separate value which are on a plowed land, from this separate value in the initial recognition <b>hazelnut</b> <b>filberts</b> can be recorded in the account of other tangible assets where they are in the tangible asset group and since a value increase of hazelnut groves by years it is defined that it will be a better approach to use revaluation model rather than cost model as an endterm measuring method. ...|$|R
50|$|Felix Gillet (born March 25, 1835, Rochefort, Charente-Maritime, France; died January 27, 1908, Nevada City, California, United States) was a California pioneer nurseryman, horticulturist, sericulturist, {{and writer}} who made several {{important}} introductions of superior European deciduous fruit and nut trees to California and the northwestern United States. Beginning in 1869, in his Barren Hill Nursery in Nevada City, Gillet cultivated his own imported scion wood and home-grown nursery stock, experimented with grafting and hybridizing, and continually wrote articles on horticulture and his plant selections, while remaining active in Nevada City civic affairs. Publishing his own nursery catalog for 37 years and advertising widely, {{he sold his}} walnuts, <b>filberts</b> (<b>hazelnuts),</b> chestnuts, prunes, figs, strawberries, grapes, peaches, cherries, citrus {{and dozens of other}} fruit and nut varieties throughout California and the Pacific Northwest.

50|$|In midsummer {{a celebration}} known as 'Filly Loo' (or 'Filleigh Loo') takes place around Ashmore pond, with a Green Man, country dancing, morris dancers and live music. The event's ancient origins are mysterious but may have pagan influences; {{theories}} include that it celebrated either the pond's constancy as a water supply, the summer solstice, {{or the end}} of the cultivated <b>filbert</b> (<b>hazelnut)</b> harvest. The meaning of the name 'Filly Loo' has also attracted more than one explanation, including that it is West Country dialect for 'uproar', a corruption of the French 'La Fille de l'Eau', ('maiden of the water'), or a corruption of 'Filbert Louis', a nickname of Louis Rideout, one of the historical instigators of the event. The event was revived in 1956 as a folk dance festival, and takes place on the Friday night nearest to Midsummer Day or the Feast of St. John the Baptist.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Cydia latiferreana Wlshm. is {{recognized}} as the key insect pest of cultivated <b>filbert</b> (<b>hazelnut)</b> in Oregon. The {{purpose of this study}} was to obtain information on mating and oviposition behavior of the adult insect, to calculate the lower temperature threshold and degree-days required for egg development, and to develop an ovipositional model based on the information derived in this study. Field studies showed significant differences between the number of eggs deposited on the foliage of filbert varieties Daviana and Barcelona. Data showed that Daviana trees were preferred for oviposition over Barcelona. On both varieties, significantly greater numbers of eggs were deposited on leaves located within 15 cm. of a nut or nut cluster than on those located farther than 15 cm. No significant differences were found between numbers of eggs collected from two canopy heights. Oviposition was observed in the field at dusk, and mating was observed at night. The role of climatic conditions, particularly temperature, and time of day as major influences on initiation and frequency of oviposition was discussed. Laboratory studies using field-collected eggs indicated that ca. 77. 8 degree-days are required for egg hatch above a threshold of 10. 3 ° C...|$|R
