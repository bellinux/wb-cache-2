25|$|During {{the early}} {{phases of the}} Sangam period, people {{depended}} heavily on rains as {{the primary source of}} water for agriculture. But, increasing demand stemming from a growing population {{led to the development of}} better methods of irrigation. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, the primary goal was to procure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Tanks, lakes and dams were important water storage systems that were developed for this purpose. Sluices and shutters were constructed for regulating water for irrigation. Sometimes, buckets made of reeds were used for watering the lands. In order to control the flooding of rivers, sand mounds were raised so that water could be diverted for irrigation. Direct irrigation from canals was possible on the basins of the Kaveri, the Periyar and the Tamaraparani. Kallanai, a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, is considered the oldest water-regulation structure in the world. Kaveri, Pennai, Palaru, Vaigai and the Tamaraparani were the major rivers spreading their fertilizing water on the fields of Tamilakam. Water stored in tanks and reservoirs was delivered to the fields through channels. There is a considerable amount of spring channel irrigation in the Palar, Kaveri and Vaigai beds. To raise a second crop, well water was very useful. People of this era knew how to divine the spots where there was flow of underground water and dug wells there. Men and oxen were used to irrigate the lands from well water. When water supply was limited and demand was more, it became the duty of the village authorities to distribute the available water in a proper way. Day and night watchmen were employed to guard the tanks and reservoirs and regulate the water supply. Surface <b>irrigation,</b> <b>sprinkler</b> mechanism and drip irrigation methods were followed to prevent wastage of water.|$|E

Only the East Stand from 1978 was kept. In 2000, new grass was laid on the pitch, replacing the original grass from 1950. This included installation of under-soil heating and an automatic <b>irrigation</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system. The new pitch had the dimensions [...] Combined, this cost NOK12 million.

2500|$|The Tamils {{cultivated}} [...] paddy, sugarcane, millets, pepper, [...] various pulses, coconuts, beans, cotton, plantain, tamarind and sandalwood. Paddy was {{the main}} crop, with different varieties grown in the wetland of Marutam, such as Vennel, Sennel, Pudunel, Aivananel and Torai. The peasants lived in groves of trees close to the farmlands and each house had jack, coconut, palm, areca and plantain trees. Peasants grew turmeric plants {{in front of their}} houses and laid flower gardens in between the houses. Farmers believed that [...] ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and the protection of crops must be done according to a specific method in order to obtain a good yield. A wide range of tools needed for agriculture, from ploughing to harvesting, were manufactured. The basic tool was the plough also known as meli, nanchil and kalappai. Palliyadutal referred to the process of removing weeds using a toothed implement attached to a plank and drawn by oxen. Lower-class peasants used stone sling devices to scare animals and birds away from the standing crops. Sickles were used for harvesting mature rice paddies. Since the rivers of the region were not perennial, several irrigation techniques were developed to ensure an adequate and continuous supply of water. Farmers used a bullock-propelled device called Kapilai for bailing out water from deep wells and a manual setup called Erram, for shallow wells. Tanks, lakes and dams were used as water storage systems and the water regulated using sluices and shutters. Kallanai, a dam built on river Kaveri during this period, {{is one of the oldest}} water-regulation structure in the world.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{irrigated}} hectares in eastern Montana and western North Dakota {{continues to increase}} and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) producers are converting from flood to <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> This study provides needed information on the relative yield and quality of sugarbeet under fur-row-flood <b>irrigation</b> and low-pressure <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Sugarbeet was planted in a field with flood and <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> capability. Half of the planted area was irrigated using furrow flood irrigation and half was irrigated using a low-pressure overhead linear sprinkler system. Ground water was sampled {{during the growing season}} under both irrigation systems and analyzed for nitrate-N concentration. Nitrate-N concentration of irrigation water and run-off water was also measured. The type of irrigation did not affect stand, sucrose concentration, or root yield. Sodium (Na), potassium (K) and amino-N concentrations were significantly greater under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> than under flood irrigation. Because of higher impurities, sugarbeet produced under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> had greater sucrose loss to molasses (SLM) and lower extraction than sugarbeet produced under flood irrigation. Greater nitrate-N concen-tration was detected in ground water under flood <b>irrigation</b> than under <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and nitrate-N was detected in run-off water from flood irrigation. These data indicate that more leaching and run-off of available N occurs in a flood irrigation system than in a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>irrigation</b> system and that sprinkler irrigated sugarbeet probably needs less applied N than flood-irrigated sugarbeet because of reduced N losses to leaching and run-off.

40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} (ECV) is a direct, {{accurate and}} reliable micrometeorological mass transfer method for measuring evaporation and evapotranspiration (ET).
