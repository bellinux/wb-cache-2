5|$|In 1950, {{calculations}} by the Polish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and his collaborator Cornelius Everett, {{along with}} confirmations by Fermi, {{had shown that}} not only was Teller's earlier estimate of the quantity of tritium needed for the H-bomb a low one, but that even with higher amounts of tritium, the <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> in the fusion process would be too great to enable the fusion reaction to propagate. However, in 1951 Teller and Ulam made a breakthrough, and invented a new design, proposed in a classified March 1951 paper, On Heterocatalytic Detonations I: Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors, for a practical megaton-range H-bomb. The exact contribution provided respectively from Ulam and Teller to {{what became known as the}} Teller–Ulam design is not definitively known in the public domain, and the exact contributions of each and how the final idea was arrived upon has been a point of dispute in both public and classified discussions since the early 1950s.|$|E

On the contrary to this conventional idea, we examine the interrelation between the partial <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> and their primary energies of the muons and {{the correlation between the}} partial <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> and the corresponding Cherenkov light yields in stochastic manner and discuss the application limits to the conventional procedure...|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E
5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without <b>energy</b> <b>loss)</b> to the heavy particles.|$|E
5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} {{is the amount of}} energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E

A spatially 3 D version of the modulation model is subsequently used to calculate the propagation times and <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> of galactic electrons and protons in different drift cycles.

40|$|Stool <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> and {{the sources}} of energy within the stool were {{determined}} in 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with cystic fibrosis while on their habitual pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment. Stool <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> were equivalent to 3. 5 % of gross energy intake in healthy children (range 1. 3 - 5. 8 %). Despite a comparable gross energy intake, stool <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> were three times greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than controls averaging 10. 6 % of gross energy intake (range 4. 9 - 19. 7 %). Stool lipid could account for only 29 % and 41 % of the energy within the stool in controls and patients with cystic fibrosis respectively and was poorly related to stool energy. Approximately 30 % of the energy within the stool could be attributable to colonic bacteria in both the healthy children and patients with cystic fibrosis. These results suggest that stool <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in healthy children are relatively modest but that even when patients with cystic fibrosis are symptomatically well controlled on pancreatic enzyme replacement, raised stool <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> may continue to contribute towards an energy deficit sufficient to limit growth in cystic fibrosis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} strategy to minimize the non-technical electrical <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in an electrical distribution network. In order to develop the strategy, a model was constructed that simulates an electrical distribution network and includes different parameters that calculate the estimated technical losses in the electricity distribution network. The model was then used as the base to develop the strategy to minimize the electrical <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in an electrical distribution network. Increasing energy costs and environmentalists actions to protect the natural resources, force energy supply companies to conserve and reduce energy usage. Therefore the research focused on the reduction of electrical <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in distribution networks. The loss occurrences are divided into two categories: technical and non-technical losses. Reducing these losses ensure {{that the cost of}} electricity to customers will be reduced and in turn improve the efficiency of the distribution network. The model developed to calculate the non-technical losses in an electrical distribution network was tested at two different networks. Firstly at the University of Pretoria, where the network segment consisted of different network busses delivering electrical energy. Secondly results were obtained in a residential network of the Tshwane Metropolitan Council. In this network there was only one bus but various different time intervals were used to determine the time interval most suitable for determining the electrical <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in the electrical distribution network. The model was used primarily to quantify the technical losses as a base point towards determining the non-technical losses. Using the model one is able to forecast the technical <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> of a section in the electricity distribution network and this enabled one to develop {{a strategy to}} minimize the <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in the distribution network.
