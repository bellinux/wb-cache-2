6000|$|... "Save for {{the fact}} that father himself <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> should go, no one could force me to leave here," [...] Jacob said, after a long pause, and Sergeant Corney added, soothingly, saying that which I {{question}} if he himself really believed: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, between politeness and vanity, {{you will}} get deeper into the mud? Keep them both for {{something}} better. Remember, too, that I didn't want {{to introduce you to}} her: you <b>insisted.</b> <b>I</b> had a sort of uneasy feeling about it." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY MOGTON This {{is not a}} {{laughing}} matter. If I could think of any one to take Annys's place <b>I</b> should not <b>insist.</b> <b>I</b> cannot.|$|R

6000|$|Barrington {{looked at}} her steadily. [...] "If you <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> can at least hope for the best," [...] he said, with a gravity that brought a faint color to the listener's cheek.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} left me alone," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't want to come here, but when you <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> did it to oblige you. As you pointed out, {{considering}} what I took out of some of you on another occasion, it seemed the fair thing. Now I hope you're satisfied." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{notwithstanding}} this, she <b>insisted,</b> <b>I</b> say, upon it, {{and which}} was worse, the longer it lasted the more she began to drop Amy's ladyship, and would have it that the Lady Roxana was her mother, {{and that she had}} made some inquiries about it, and did not doubt but she should find her out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{leave that}} night as I decided on; but {{went back to}} see poor Bill, an' your mother <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> stay till mornin'. The sun wasn't up when I started out, an' a mighty blind hunt {{it proved to be}} till the first camp was struck. That kinder livened me a bit; but I couldn't get onto the trail, an' from then till Gus yelled I hadn't any idea which way to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|Chad's pride seemed {{none the}} less a little touched. [...] "I never WAS that--let me <b>insist.</b> <b>I</b> always {{had my own}} way." [...] With which he pursued: [...] "And I have it at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> imagine he's {{on board}} the Spanish boat," [...] Jake {{answered}} with a chuckle. [...] "As {{she seems to have}} her anchor up, I guess it's too late for us to interfere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{shooting}} {{away down}} the river to the dredging work--Carlson <b>insists</b> <b>I</b> must advise him--and then up in to Sacramento, running over the Teal Slough land on the way, to see Wing Fo Wong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That horse must {{be found}} at once," [...] I said. The clerks and {{operators}} wearily looked out of the window. The idea of any one being so concerned about a horse was to them insanity or worse. I <b>insisted.</b> <b>I</b> banged my fist on the table. At last {{one of the young}} men yawned languidly, looked at me with dim eyes, and as one brain-cell coalesced with another seemed to mature an idea. He said:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I confess I had not {{realized}} that I might stand {{in need of}} slumber, and would have put the lad off with an evasive reply; but he persisted with his question until I was forced to admit that since leaving the town of York to carry the Jerseyman's message, I had not closed my eyes in rest, whereupon he <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> go to the floor below, and seek the repose which he claimed I so sorely needed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{returned}} {{on board}} {{as he had}} <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> should do. I didn't want to intrude on his grief. Later, about five in the morning, some of my calashes came running to me, yelling {{that there was a}} fire ashore. I landed at once, of course. The principal bungalow was blazing. The heat drove us back. The other two houses caught one after another like kindling-wood. There was no going beyond the shore end of the jetty till the afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>insisted,</b> for <b>I</b> {{wanted to}} know, he ripped out: 'Yes, the damn fool got himself shot, and I'm sorry it's not worse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAREST VIVIETTE,--If you <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> will go. But letter-writing will [...] not do. I {{must have}} the command from your own two lips, {{otherwise}} I [...] shall not stir. I am here every evening at seven. Can you come?--S.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} to speak of it, Shank, as you knew nothing, and I had hoped would never know {{anything}} about it, but since you <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> must tell you that--that Mr Ritson, I'm afraid, loves me at least he--" ...|$|R
6000|$|At this he fairly laughed; and, the ice being broken, I {{was able}} to consult him as to my conduct. He <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> must return to the house--at least, for luncheon, {{and one of my}} walks with Mr. Loudon. [...] "For the evening I will furnish you with an excuse, if you please," [...] said he, [...] "by asking you to a {{bachelor}} dinner with myself. But the luncheon and the walk are unavoidable. He is an old man, and, I believe, really fond of you; he would naturally feel aggrieved if there were any appearance of avoiding him; and as for Mr. Adam, do you know, I think your delicacy out of place.... And now, Mr. Dodd, what are you to do with this money?" ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{my first}} meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious about himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had {{answered}} some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitiski portal. I noticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket {{when it came to}} paying for the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health was curious. In accordance with an arrangement we had made I applied that day for a life policy in the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum, and I was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week. Even that did not satisfy him, and he <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> must be re-examined by the great Doctor Henderson.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{simple one}} enough," [...] he answered. [...] "We got here all right, as {{we told you}} over the wire. Then Maqueda talked to you for a long while until you rang off, saying you wanted to speak to Japhet. After that, at ten o'clock precisely, we heard the thud of the explosion. Next, as we were {{preparing}} to go out to see what had happened, Joshua arrived alone, announced that the idol Harmac had been destroyed, and demanded that the Child of Kings, 'for State reasons,' should accompany him to his own castle. She declined and, as he <b>insisted,</b> <b>I</b> took it upon myself to kick him out of the place. He retired, and we saw no more of him, but a few minutes later there came a shower of arrows down the passage, and after them a rush of men, who called, 'Death to the Gentiles. Rescue the Rose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, Mr. Finsbury," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Judkin; [...] "and if you <b>insist</b> <b>I</b> {{will take}} it into consideration; but I hardly think--in short, Mr. Finsbury, {{if there had been}} nothing else, the signature seems hardly all that we could wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] said he, [...] "I must <b>insist.</b> <b>I</b> shall {{freeze to}} death if I don't warm myself by exercise." [...] So, {{reaching}} out his hand, he assisted Margery to the stern, and seating himself in her place, he took the oars, which she had drawn in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know," [...] she retorted, and {{the tears}} began to come. [...] "I don't wonder you didn't want to say much to me about that dinner at breakfast. I noticed it; but I thought you were just dull, and so <b>I</b> didn't <b>insist.</b> <b>I</b> wish I had, now. If you had told me what Lindau had said, I should have known what would have come of it, and I could have advised you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, down {{they came}} and we sat there on {{furniture}} cases and things and had a chat. Mrs. Jones wanted to make me some coffee. 'My dear girl,' I said (I knew them both when they were children) 'I absolutely refuse. Let ME make it.' They protested. I <b>insisted.</b> <b>I</b> went at it,--kitchen all upset--had to open at least twenty tins to get the coffee. However, I made it at last. 'Now,' I said, 'drink it.' They said they had some {{an hour or so}} ago. 'Nonsense,' I said, 'drink it.' Well, we sat and chatted away till midnight. They were dull at first and I had to do all the talking. But I set myself to it. I can talk, you know, when I try. Presently about midnight they seemed to brighten up a little. Jones looked at his watch. 'By Jove,' he said, in an animated way, 'it's after midnight.' I think he was pleased at the way the evening was going; after that we chatted away more comfortably. Every little while Jones would say, 'By Jove, it's half past twelve,' or 'it's one o'clock,' and so on.|$|E
6000|$|... "My first trouble {{came when}} I {{got a job}} with John Calder who has a farm on the {{outskirts}} of Omaha," [...] said Brassy. [...] "I had had a quarrel at home, and also a quarrel with my uncle here, and had made up my mind to get a place and support myself. But I couldn't get along with Calder, who was a very strict man, and one afternoon we had a lively quarrel, and I told him I'd leave, and I did so and went to Omaha. About a week after that Calder's barn burned down and a number of horses were caught in the fire. That was just after I had fallen in with Bud Haddon and his two chums, Jillson and Dusenbury. Haddon pretended to be quite friendly. But all at once he accused me of setting the fire and said that Jillson and Dusenbury, who had left the day before, could prove it. I protested my innocence, but he <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> was guilty and worked me up {{to such an extent that}} I gave him almost every dollar I had in my pocket to keep him quiet." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt that}} if I <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> should really stir up the old Long, the stolid coxcomb, capable of rudeness, with whose redemption, reabsorption, supersession--one {{scarcely}} knew what to call it--I had been so happily impressed. [...] "Oh, of course, if you haven't noticed, you haven't, and the matter I was going to speak of will have no point. You won't know what I mean." [...] With which I paused long enough to let his curiosity operate if his denial had been sincere. But it hadn't. His curiosity never operated. He only exclaimed, more indulgently, that he didn't know what I was talking about; and I recognised after a little that if I had made him, without intention, uncomfortable, this was exactly a proof of his being what Mrs. Briss, at the station, had called cleverer, and what I had so much remarked while, in the garden before dinner, he held our small company. Nobody, nothing could, {{in the time of}} his inanity, have made him turn a hair. It was the mark of his aggrandisement. But I spared him--so far as was consistent with my wish for absolute certainty; changed the subject, spoke of other things, took pains to sound disconnectedly, and only after reference to several of the other ladies, the name over which we had just felt friction. [...] "Mrs. Brissenden's quite fabulous." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain, {{taking a}} bundle from her: [...] "If {{this is another}} bath-robe, Clarence! It is, as I live. Now {{if it is a}} woman sending it--" [...] She picks up a card which falls out of the robe as she unfolds it. [...] "'Love the Giver,' indeed! Now, Clarence, <b>I</b> <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> demand--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he <b>insists,</b> <b>I</b> shall {{hate him}} always. Yet, {{it looks as}} if there was no use in rebelling. I feel as if I had been caught in a snare that {{tightens}} when I try to break loose. I understand why a rabbit screams and struggles until it chokes when it feels the wire. It's like that with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, gentlemen, if we must fight, we must, I suppose. But don't {{rush into}} danger {{and then say}} I gave you no warning. I am more than a match {{for all of you}} when I get started. I will give you proofs, and then if my friend here still <b>insists,</b> <b>I</b> will try to {{accommodate}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon sadly {{smiled at}} him. [...] "I haven't got over her yet!" [...] Then, however, as {{if not to}} look morbid, he took pains to be clear. [...] "The first wound was bad--but from that one always comes round. Your mother, dear woman, had known how to help me. Lady Julia {{was at that time}} her {{intimate}} friend--it was she who introduced me there. She couldn't help what happened--she did her best. What I meant just now was that in the aftertime, when opportunity occurred, she was the one person with whom I could always talk and who always understood." [...] He lost himself an instant in the deep memories to attest which he had survived alone; then he sighed out as if the taste of it all came back to him with a faint sweetness: [...] "I think they must both have been good to me. At the Malvern time, the particular time I just mentioned to you, Lady Julia was already married, and during those first years she had been whirled out of my ken. Then her own life took a quieter turn; we met again; I went for a good while often to her house. I think she rather liked the state to which she had reduced me, though she didn't, you know, in the least presume on it. The better a woman is--it has often struck me--the more she enjoys in a quiet way some fellow's having been rather bad, rather dark and desperate, about her--for her. I dare say, I mean, that though Lady Julia <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> ought to marry she wouldn't really have liked it much if I had. At any rate it was in those years I saw her daughter just cease to be a child--the little girl who was to be transformed by time into the so different person with whom we dined to-night. That comes back to me when I hear you speak of the growing up, in turn, of that person's own daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|February 11.--Court sat till half-past one. I had but {{a trifle}} to do, so {{wrote letters to}} Mrs. Maclean Clephane and nephew Walter. Sent the last, £40 in {{addition}} to £240 sent on the 6th, making his full equipment £280. A man, calling himself Charles Gray of Carse, wrote to me, expressing sympathy for my misfortunes, and offering me half the profits of what, if I understand him right, is a patent medicine, to which I suppose he expects me to stand trumpeter. He endeavours to get over my objections to accepting his liberality (supposing me to entertain them) by assuring me his conduct is founded on a sage selfishness. This is diverting enough. I suppose the Commissioners of, Police will next send me a letter of condolence, begging my acceptance of a broom, a shovel, and a scavenger's greatcoat, and assuring me that they had appointed me to all the emoluments of a well-frequented crossing. It would be doing more than they have done of late for the cleanliness of the streets, which, witness my shoes, are in a piteous pickle. I thanked the selfish sage with due decorum--for what purpose can anger serve? I remember once before, a mad woman, from about Alnwick, baited me with letters and plans--first for charity to herself or some protégé. I gave my guinea. Then {{she wanted to have}} half the profit of a novel which I was to publish under my name and auspices. She sent me the manuscript, and a moving tale it was, for some of the scenes lay in the cabinet à l'eau. I declined the partnership. Lastly, my fair correspondent <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> was a lover of speculation, and would be much profited by going shares in a patent medicine which she had invented for the benefit of little babies, I believe. I dreaded {{to have anything to do}} with such a Herod-like affair, and begged to decline the honour of her correspondence in future. I should have thought the thing a quiz, but that the novel was real and substantial. Anne goes to Ravelston to-day to remain to-morrow. Sir Alexander Don called, and we had a good laugh together.|$|E
6000|$|I was not surprised, knowing by what {{influences}} {{my brother}} was led, to find {{his name in the}} list of Virginia burgesses who declared that the sole right of imposing taxes on the inhabitants of this colony is now, and ever hath been, legally and constitutionally vested in the House of Burgesses, and called upon the other colonies to pray for the Royal interposition in favour of the violated rights of America. And it was now, after we had been some three years settled in our English home, that a correspondence between us and Madam Esmond began to take place. It was my wife who (upon some pretext such as women always know how to find) re-established the relations between us. Mr. Miles must need have the small-pox, from which he miraculously recovered without losing any portion of his beauty; and on his recovery the mother writes her prettiest little wheedling letter to the grandmother of the fortunate babe. She coaxes her with all sorts of modest phrases and humble offerings of respect and goodwill. She narrates anecdotes of the precocious genius of the lad (what hath subsequently happened, I wonder, to stop the growth of that gallant young officer's brains?), and she must have sent over to his grandmother a lock of the darling boy's hair, for the old lady, in her reply, acknowledged the receipt of some such present. I wonder, as it came from England, they allowed it to pass our custom-house at Williamsburg. In return for these peace-offerings and smuggled tokens of submission, comes a tolerably gracious letter from my Lady of Castlewood. She inveighs against the dangerous spirit pervading the colony: she laments to think that her unhappy son is consorting with people who, she fears, will be no better than rebels and traitors. She does not wonder, considering who his friends and advisers are. How can a wife taken from an almost menial situation be expected to sympathise with persons of rank and dignity who have the honour of the Crown at heart? If evil times were coming for the monarchy (for the folks in America appeared to be disinclined to pay taxes, and required that everything should be done for them without cost), she remembered how to monarchs in misfortune, the Esmonds--her father the Marquis especially--had ever been faithful. She knew not what opinions (though she might judge from my newfangled Lord Chatham) were in fashion in England. She prayed, at least, she might hear that one of her sons was not on the side of rebellion. When we came, in after days, to look over old family papers in Virginia, we found [...] "Letters from my daughter Lady Warrington," [...] neatly tied up with a ribbon. My Lady Theo <b>insisted</b> <b>I</b> should not open them; and the truth, I believe, is, that they were so full of praises of her husband that she thought my vanity would suffer from reading them.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "it {{is rather}} a painful subject with me just now. Yet since you <b>insist,</b> <b>I</b> will tell you. Something has come over your uncle which I do not understand. His party--no, {{it is his}} country that needs him. He prefers to stay here, and watch his roses blossom." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Deringham, [...] "if you <b>insist.</b> <b>I</b> am {{sincerely}} sorry I {{ever saw}} or heard of you. You, of course, remember the conditions on which I made {{that deal with}} you. I desired Mr. Alton kept away from Somasco--for a time, and now I want a definite promise from you {{that he will be}} free from any further molestation." ...|$|R
