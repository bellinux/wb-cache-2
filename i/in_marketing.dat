5|$|The Los Angeles Times {{estimated}} that nearly 5,000 Speed Racer film-related products were licensed by Warner Bros. The film {{was backed by}} multiple promotional partners with over $80 million <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> support. The partners include General Mills, McDonald's, Target, Topps, Esurance, Mattel, Lego, and Petrobras. The film also received support from companies outside of America {{in an attempt to}} attract international audiences. With early support before the film's release, the studio provided 3D computer models of the Speed Racer vehicle Mach 5 to the companies so they could accurately render the vehicle in their merchandise.|$|E
5|$|The {{required}} {{level of}} investment {{for the development}} of marketing, storage and cold storage infrastructure is estimated to be huge.

5|$|After {{she earned}} her degrees, Pritzker joined the Pritzker {{organization}} encouraged by her cousin Nick Pritzker. In 1987, she founded Classic Residence by Hyatt, later renamed Vi, upscale housing for seniors {{as an alternative}} to nursing homes. The project struggled at first, losing $40million in the first 18months, but turned around after changes <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> and management. In 1991, Jay Pritzker, Penny's uncle and head of the Pritzker family businesses, named Penny {{as the director of the}} Pritzkers' non-hotel landholdings. With that appointment, Penny created the Pritzker Realty Group, which developed apartment buildings, shopping centers, and the Baldwin Park neighborhood in Orlando, Florida.|$|E
30|$|In {{both the}} {{competition}} and cooperation cases, the cost-adjusted service quality is positively associated with the <b>market</b> share <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2. This is also applicable to <b>market</b> 3 <b>in</b> the cooperation case but not the competition case, because the HSR service is not provided <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3. Finally, <b>in</b> the cooperation case, if the variable cost c_ 2,r< c_ 2,a, then the optimal price of HSR is {{less than that of}} the air sector <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2. The air–rail itinerary <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3 is preferable to air only, if c_ 3,ar< c_ 3,a. Furthermore, the difference in the optimal price between air and rail <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 and air and air–rail <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3 is equal to the difference in the variable cost between the two sectors.|$|R
30|$|From this proposition, {{the fixed}} {{cost of the}} air–rail mode and non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 play an {{important}} role in determining the effectiveness of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 is high, the effect of cooperation on social welfare for the whole market depends on the welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3, because cooperation does not impact the welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 by Proposition  4.6. Thus, in this case, the fixed cost of the air–rail mode affects the social welfare for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 is relatively low, we need to consider the balance between the decrease in social welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 and the increase in social welfare <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 3. Since the amount of social welfare <b>in</b> each <b>market</b> depends largely on the number of potential customers, the social welfare will be increased by cooperation if the amount of social welfare <b>in</b> the connecting <b>market</b> is relatively large. We will demonstrate this with numerical examples.|$|R
30|$|Another {{example is}} two {{divisions}} operating <b>in</b> separate <b>markets.</b> One division {{is responsible for}} all the operations regarding selling {{the products of the}} company <b>in</b> <b>market</b> A and the other <b>in</b> <b>market</b> B. However, due to the known interdependence, the accounting system reports only one earnings number. For example, separate sales areas within a geographical area are often aggregated. The division manager <b>in</b> <b>market</b> A and the division manager <b>in</b> <b>market</b> B can privately learn how good their aspired division operations fit the market needs of market A and B, respectively. Clients who are attracted by the internationality of the company and the corresponding brand might purchase the company’s products <b>in</b> <b>market</b> A and market B.|$|R
5|$|Although {{marketers}} typically avoid promoting adult-oriented {{films to}} reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; {{this was the first}} time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released a series of Prometheus action figures in September 2012. A book, Prometheus: The Art of the Film, containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Edwards Baking {{provides}} Burger King with prepackaged {{pies and}} pie-style desserts while providing oversight and assistance with the chain's dessert products. BK {{is one of}} Edwards' major national contracts, where the company provides Burger King with assistance <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> programs, point-of-purchase advertising materials, market research, and other resources. Edwards has a full-time staff assigned to Burger King's headquarters in Miami. Before Edwards became Burger King's primary baked goods supplier, the chain had a contract with Awrey Bakeries of Livonia, Michigan, for its line of pre-packaged breakfast products. Burger King sold a line of Awrey products including danish, doughnuts, and birthday cakes.|$|E
5|$|Pathways was Bungie's fourth title (and third {{commercial}} title) {{after their}} previous game, Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete, sold around 2,500 copies. In {{the summer of}} 1992, Jones was living in dorms at the University of Chicago when he saw Wolfenstein 3D, a shooter game with three-dimensional (3D) graphics. Inspired, Jones created a rough 3D-graphics engine for the Mac that simulated walls with trapezoids and rectangles. Originally, Bungie intended Pathways to be a straightforward 3D version of Minotaur, but they quickly found that the top-down perspective of their previous game did not mesh with the 3D presentation. An additional consideration was that the developers {{wanted to create a}} game that did not rely on then-rare networks and modems, an issue <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> Minotaur. The rest of 1992 was spent tweaking the graphics engine.|$|E

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility <b>in</b> <b>marketing.</b> During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E
5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.|$|E
5|$|The Neighborhood Watch {{marketing}} campaign began on February 29, 2012 {{with the release}} of a teaser poster, trailer and the unveiling of the film's website, jointhewatch.com. The film's trailer was nominated for a Golden Trailer award, recognizing achievements <b>in</b> <b>marketing.</b> On March 27, 2012, it was reported that 20th Century Fox had the poster and trailer removed from Florida theaters in response to increasing controversy surrounding the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman. The trailer featured Hill imitating a gun with his hand pretending to shoot at teenagers, while the poster featured a bullet-ridden, alien-themed neighborhood-watch sign. According to insiders Fox intended to move into the next phase of the {{marketing campaign}} as soon as possible (focusing on the film's science-fiction aspects), while replacing previous posters with images of the cast. Fox maintained that the July 27, 2012, release date would remain unchanged by the Martin case or the marketing changes.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{indicates that}} bid-ask spreads are higher and depths are lower around earnings announcements than during non-announcement periods. This thesis investigates two {{important aspects of}} this drop <b>in</b> <b>market</b> liquidity, namely (a) the ability of management to mitigate the drop <b>in</b> <b>market</b> liquidity around earnings announcements by using their discretion to announce the earnings news during non-trading instead of trading hours and (b) the conjecture that the drop <b>in</b> <b>market</b> liquidity before earnings announcements relates to {{the richness of the}} information environment. The study confirms the idea that the intraday timing of earnings announcements affects the drop <b>in</b> <b>market</b> liquidity.

40|$|Using an {{empirical}} framework derived from models of nonlinear pricing, we estimate {{the degree of}} quality degradation <b>in</b> cable television <b>markets.</b> We find lower bounds on quality degradation ranging from 11 % to 45 % of observed service qualities. Furthermore, cable operators <b>in</b> <b>markets</b> with local regulatory oversight tend to offer significantly higher quality products, and engage in less quality degradation.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a situation in}} which n firms located <b>in</b> <b>market</b> l and m firms located <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 each sell a commodity which is homogeneous within each market but may differ between markets. All firms sell on both markets. Each market has its own currency. The market demand functions differ. We give some basic results on the effects of exchange-rate changes and then show the following. When these markets are independent on the cost side (constant marginal costs) and demands are linear, a {{reduction in the number of}} firms (which might result from a merger) <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 1 increases the pass-through (of an appreciation of currency 2) <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 1 and decreases the pass-through <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2. A similar occurrence <b>in</b> <b>market</b> 2 has the opposite effect. We give conditions under which, with identical economies of scope linking the markets, the sign of the price changes will be reversed when the number of foreign firms is small enough compared to the number of local firms. However, such sign reversals cannot occur <b>in</b> the two <b>markets</b> simultaneously...|$|R
5|$|The {{speaker is}} named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, who began working in the late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that better {{emulated}} a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that rotating the speaker gave the best sound effect. Hammond was not interested <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. Leslie made the first speaker in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speakers received national radio exposure across the US, {{and it became a}} commercial and critical success. It soon became an essential tool for most jazz organists. In 1965, Leslie sold his business to CBS who, in 1980, sold it to Hammond. Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation subsequently acquired the Hammond and Leslie brands.|$|E
5|$|Spectre grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 {{million of}} the takings were {{generated}} from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America. Worldwide, this made it the second highest-grossing James Bond film after Skyfall, and the sixth highest-grossing film of 2015. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $98.4 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film. Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to {{the same level of}} its predecessor. But since it earned 20 per cent less than Skyfall, the profit in actual was $24.6 million. Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for the film — which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives — but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. The studio also spent {{tens of millions of dollars}} <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from the studio's non-Bond films, including 22 Jump Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made <b>in</b> <b>marketing</b> Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E
