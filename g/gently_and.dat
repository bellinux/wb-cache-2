5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|The rigors {{and rewards}} of pioneer {{life on the}} prairie {{are the subject of}} Giants in the Earth by Ole Rolvaag and the Little House series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of the social insecurities and {{aspirations}} of the young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha was inspired by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
25|$|Backed by low dunes, {{the top of}} {{the beach}} {{comprises}} about 80m of dry, very loose sand, making it very popular with families. Lower down it is hard-packed. The beach slopes <b>gently,</b> <b>and</b> therefore the sea is shallow for quite a long way out. Even at high tide there is plenty of soft sand exposed.|$|E

25|$|They {{are natural}} hunters with an {{excellent}} {{ability to take}} training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, {{making the most of}} their natural instincts. However, they must be trained <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session.|$|E
25|$|At 06:45 on 6 November, LCAs landing Nos. 40 and 42 Commando {{touched down}} at Port Said. The water here was {{particularly}} shallow as the beach shelved <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> the Commandos, having {{to wade through}} such a wide water gap, were perhaps fortunate that LVT amphibians also participated in the landing. Still, the LCA crews had done exactly what was required of them - landing the assault force on target and on time. The weather and sea conditions had cooperated; north-easterly winds blew up over the next eight hours {{that would have made}} the landing less accurate (and by the next morning impossible).|$|E
25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: grasping the eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E

However, they must be trained <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty minutes to an hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992).|$|E
25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb {{made it hard to}} intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and throttle response was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flame out. The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> avoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem.|$|E
25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed {{and his head}} {{slightly}} lowered as he skates from right to left, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates <b>gently,</b> <b>and</b> a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the guests}} at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's husband), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastassya Filippovna's approval, {{plays the role of}} cynical buffoon. With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they will live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year Hawke again received critical acclaim, {{this time for}} his performance in Richard Linklater's 1995 drama Before Sunrise. The film follows a young American (Hawke) and a young French woman (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train and disembark in Vienna, spending the night exploring the city and getting to know one another. The San Francisco Chronicle praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: [...] " [...] interact so <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue. Each of them seems to have something personal at stake in their performances." ...|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke's {{most famous}} solo was on [...] "Singin' the Blues", {{recorded}} February 4, 1927. It has been hailed {{as an important}} example of the [...] "jazz ballad style"—"a slow or medium-tempo piece played <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> sweetly, but not cloyingly, with no loss of muscle." [...] The tune's laid-back emotions hinted at what would become, in the 1950s, the cool jazz style, personified by Chet Baker and Bill Evans. More than that, though, [...] "Singin' the Blues" [...] has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed, with each phrase building on the last in a logical fashion. Benny Green describes the solo's effect on practiced ears: ...|$|E

500|$|The art {{historian}} Ingo Walther detects Lochner's {{hand in the}} [...] "pious intimacy and soulfulness of the figures, always expressed so <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> elegantly, even in the extremely small format of the pictures". Chapuis agrees with the attribution, noting {{how many of the}} miniatures share thematic similarities to attributed panels. He writes that the illustrations [...] "are not a peripheral phenomenon. On the contrary, they address several of the concerns articulated in Lochner's paintings and formulate them anew. There is little doubt that these exquisite images stem from the same mind." [...] The text of the Darmstadt book is written in Cologne vernacular, the Berlin book in Latin.|$|E
500|$|Mark Kermode {{writing for}} The Observer awarded the film {{four out of}} five stars, lauding Thompson's {{performance}} as [...] "impeccable", elaborating that [...] "Thompson dances her way through Travers' conflicting emotions, giving us a fully rounded portrait of a person who is hard to like but impossible not to love." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, writing: [...] "Thompson's the show. Each withering put-down, every jaundiced utterance, lands with a little ping." [...] In regard to the screenplay, he wrote that [...] "screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> with the utmost respect." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three out of four stars and equally commended the performances of the cast.|$|E
500|$|Foley has {{praised the}} group's musical style on several occasions. He {{described}} the concept as innovative, {{as the music}} [...] "is not nursery rhyme, it actually has a top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids." [...] He suggested this musical appeal for all ages {{as a reason for}} the group having a large teenage and adult fanbase. He cited the Wiggles as an influence of Hi-5, however he said that the respective groups have different [...] "styles of music". Hi-5 has been successful internationally. Foley explained how kids are universal and [...] "love to hear music", suggesting that the music is part of how international audiences connect to the group. Robinson stated the cast were encouraged to write their own music for the group, which all of the original members did, and by 2015 said she still receives occasional royalty cheques for her work. Original member of the Wiggles, and classical musician, Phillip Wilcher declared that Hi-5 [...] "successfully explore the essential components that come together to make music"; he detailed how the educational appeal [...] "seems to happen <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> [...] seem so at one with their audience of young folk... They also seem to know the subtle difference between childlike and childish".|$|E

500|$|His wife, Jennifer, {{left him}} in October 1987 after he punched {{her in the face}} and kicked her down the stairs of the family home; this ended a {{difficult}} 15-year marriage blighted by frequent infidelity on his part. They had two children: Cara (born July 1976) and Dale (born January 1981). Former Liverpool teammate Ray Clemence recalled how Kennedy [...] "worked hard and played hard". Other teammates Steve Heighway and Phil Thompson noted that Kennedy was a [...] "quiet man", though [...] "women were always chasing after him" [...] and [...] "off the pitch he needed to be handled quite <b>gently,</b> <b>and</b> everything had to be organised just right otherwise there would be trouble". Completing a bad end to 1987, his licence at the Melton Constable was revoked. His prescribed L-DOPA medication also became less effective and he became increasingly isolated. His condition improved when he began injections of apomorphine. He was reliant on the Professional Footballers' Association to pay his medical expenses, and his divorce as well as business and tax problems wiped out his savings. A testimonial game was held between Arsenal and Liverpool in April 1991. A charity appeal was also set up to help pay his living costs. In late 1992 he began suffering from extreme paranoia, mostly due to the side effects of his medication, but regained his mental faculties following a short stay in hospital.|$|E
500|$|Lee shares writing credits {{with other}} members of the band on 11 of the standard-edition album's 12 songs. Evenescence first track and lead single, [...] "What You Want", was {{described}} as one of the band's most unusual songs with heavy guitar melodies, loud drums and a freedom theme. Opening with drums and a synchronized synthesizer, Lee sings [...] "Do what you, what you want / If you have a dream for better / Do what you, what you want / 'Til you don't want it anymore" [...] before the song's rhythmic, guitar-driven beat. Lyrically, the song explores a relationship which is not working out, despite present love. [...] "Made of Stone", one of the album's oldest songs, has heavy-metal influences. [...] "The Change" [...] (originally entitled [...] "Purple"), which begins <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> grows more insistent, has been compared to [...] "Digital Bath" [...] by the American alternative metal band Deftones. The fourth track (and second single), [...] "My Heart Is Broken", is a ballad written for harp and recorded with a piano. It begins with the piano and Lee's vocals, evolving into rhythmic guitars and strings. In the chorus Lee sings, [...] "I will never find a way to heal my soul/ And I will wander 'til the end of time/ Torn away from you/ My heart is broken".|$|E
500|$|The most typical {{cooking method}} of the Quakers was boiling, a method brought from ancestral {{northern}} England. Boiled breakfast and dinner were standard fare, {{as well as}} [...] "pop-robbins", balls of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Boiled dumplings and puddings were so common in Quaker homes that they were referred to by outsiders as [...] "Quaker food". Travelers noted apple dumplings as an almost daily dish in the Delaware Valley and cookbooks specialized in puddings and dumplings. Food was mostly preserved through boiling, simmering or standing. A popular genre of dishes made from this favored method of food preparation was [...] "cheese" [...] (or [...] "butter"), a generic term for dishes prepared by slow boiling or pressing. They could be made from ingredients as varying as apples (i.e., apple butter), plums and walnuts. Cream cheese had its origins in Quaker cooking, but was in colonial times not true cheese made with rennet or curds, but rather cream that was warmed <b>gently</b> <b>and</b> then allowed to stand wrapped in cloth until it became semi-solid. Dried beef was widely popular in the Delaware Valley and was eaten along with puddings and dumplings to add flavor. The use of dried beef was so widespread that it was often called [...] "Quaker gravy" [...] in the 18th century. Though the Quaker influence from the northern Midlands was the most dominant, there was some influence from German immigrants during the 18th century. Scrapple, a pot pudding made from meat scraps and grain, became {{a staple of the}} regional cuisine for many generations.|$|E
