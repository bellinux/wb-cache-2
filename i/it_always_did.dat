25|$|Baseball {{had been}} watched live {{since the mid}} 20th century. Television sports' arrival in the 1950s {{increased}} attention and revenue for all major league clubs at first. The television programming was extremely regional. It hurt the minor and independent leagues most. People stayed home to watch Maury Wills rather than watch unknowns at their local baseball park. Major League Baseball, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> made sure that it controlled rights and fees charged for the broadcasts of all games, {{just as it did}} on radio. It brought additional revenues and attention both from the broadcast itself, and from the increases in attendance and merchandise sales that expanded audiences allowed.|$|E
6000|$|But, as a guinea {{will not}} pass [...] At {{market for a}} farthing more, Shown through a {{multiplying}} glass, [...] Than what <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> before: ...|$|E
6000|$|Her lips had quivered; and Winton's heart softened, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{when he saw}} her moved. He put {{his hand}} out, covered one of hers, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|And so Christmas, just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> {{turned out}} all right after all.|$|R
60|$|But {{the next}} day, {{in the course}} of Christmas morning, the {{situation}} straightened itself out, just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Better, dear boy, better"--("That's it, cheer up!" [...] from Slidder)--"and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me a {{world of}} good to see your {{handsome}} face." ...|$|R
60|$|Little Joe Otter {{looked over}} at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn't see {{anything}} unusual. It looked just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> He told Jerry Muskrat so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neighbours!" [...] said Meg, her wrath {{beginning}} to arise, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> upon any allusion to this sore subject--"Ye may ca' them neighbours, if ye like--but the deil flee awa wi' the neighbourhood for Meg Dods!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{garden is}} different," [...] he declared. [...] "The earth changes from {{generation}} to generation, just as the flowers here throw out fresh blossoms and the weeds come and go. But my rooftree stands where <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> Wait." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (3) Guaranteed Results: [...] "Whatever {{it is that}} an {{algorithm}} <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> <b>it,</b> if it is executed without misstep. An {{algorithm is}} a foolproof recipe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} lively, always going about with you. <b>It's</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> you love me, {{do you love}} me, till I just get about sick of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear Norland," [...] said Elinor, [...] "probably {{looks much}} as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> {{at this time}} of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves." ...|$|R
6000|$|The anger {{died out}} of it as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> within the minute, and she laughed. [...] "It would be fun, wouldn't it. I wonder what I should do with him? It makes you feel very serious being in love, doesn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sight of}} her, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> sent a thrill through him, {{but he was}} {{conscious}} of an ache behind it. He had hoped so much that Hank would pass, {{and he knew that}} he had not. Why was it that two people so completely one as Ruth and himself could not see Hank with the same eyes? ...|$|E
60|$|His father {{stood with}} his back to the fireplace, looking down upon the floor with his blind eyes, his brows drawn moodily together, and the scar of the great wound that he had {{received}} at the tournament at York--the wound that had made him blind--showing red across his forehead, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when he was angered or troubled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} this gentleman {{to see your}} dairy, Hannah," [...] said Miss Halcombe. [...] "It {{is one of the}} sights of the house, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> you credit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. Don't say that. I {{know all}} this Indian talk will blow over, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> and you will come back and {{everything}} will be all right again." ...|$|R
30|$|Hence, using {{a shorter}} {{reshaping}} filter than conventionally used in equalization techniques can result (and based on simulations, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does)</b> {{in a lower}} condition number of the matrix being inverted.|$|R
60|$|One {{evening in}} early harvest Estella was {{lingering}} by the lane gate at twilight. She had worked slavishly {{all day and}} was very tired, but she was loath {{to go into the}} house, where her trouble always seemed to weigh on her more heavily. The dusk, sweet night seemed to soothe her as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{have a bit}} of {{corned beef}} and cabbage for dinner," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll make David that pudding he's so fond of. After all, it's kind of nice to have someone to plan and think for. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> seem like a waste of energy to fuss over cooking things when there was nobody but myself to eat them." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{heard the}} sharp bell-peal {{which we all}} knew; then the rapid step {{familiar}} to each ear: the words [...] "Voilà Monsieur!" [...] had scarcely broken simultaneously from every lip, when the two-leaved door split (as split <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> for his admission--such a slow word as [...] "open" [...] is inefficient to describe his movements), and {{he stood in the}} midst of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{pleasant}} girls! I {{wish you}} knew them, Fan. So clever, and energetic, and kind, and happy, <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me {{good to see}} them," [...] cried Polly, with a face full of enthusiasm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} will come to that. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> if the man is in earnest. Girls will accept men simply {{because they think it}} ill-natured to return the {{compliment}} of an offer with a hearty 'No.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{he replied}} to this question. [...] "The {{war is not}} yet over. But it soon will be, and it will end, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> with the Westenders running away. We, the Eastenders, are always victorious." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{need not}} trouble {{the reader with}} a {{detailed}} account of the means by which Jim Welton accomplished his object. Love prevailed--as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> always does, and always will--and ere many days had passed Billy Towler was once more a member of the drunkard's family, with the sweet presence of Nora ever near him, like an angel's wing overshadowing and protecting him from evil.|$|E
60|$|That gentleman himself came in {{from the}} harvest field looking as courtly as usual, even in his rough working clothes. He shook hands heartily, told her he was glad to see her, and began talking about the weather. Esther was not to be turned from her object thus, {{although}} she felt her courage ebbing away from her as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{in the presence of the}} Cropper imperviousness.|$|E
60|$|The tea-table {{was drawn}} {{up near the}} sofa, with a small {{interval}} between it and Mrs Clennam's own particular table. Mr Blandois in his gallantry had risen to hand that lady her tea (her dish of toast was already there), {{and it was in}} placing the cup conveniently within her reach that the watch, lying before her as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> attracted his attention. Mrs Clennam looked suddenly up at him.|$|E
6000|$|Kea's {{face grew}} pale with terror. [...] "You are," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{can see it}} rise. The bubbles are bursting; the steam's crackling. <b>It</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> so before <b>it</b> begins to flow out upon {{the slopes of the}} mountain." ...|$|R
50|$|She has a {{hard time}} {{watching}} her mouth; for some reason, whenever she says something bad will happen <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> causing everyone around to feel fearful and uneasy whenever she voices her opinions. Others often refer to this as Crow's Mouth (烏鴉嘴).|$|R
6000|$|Her mother {{forced herself}} to speak cheerfully. [...] "Aunt Geoffrey is a capital nurse," [...] said she; [...] "there is {{something}} so decided about her that <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> one good. <b>It</b> saves all the trouble and perplexity of thinking for oneself." ...|$|R
60|$|However, he kept right on, and as {{he reached}} the foot of the hill where Prickly Porky lives, he looked sharply in every {{direction}} and listened with all his might for strange sounds. But there was nothing unusual to be seen. The Green Forest looked just as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> It was very still and quiet there save for the cheerful voice of Redeye the Vireo telling over and over how happy he was.|$|E
60|$|Sol Gills {{pulled down}} his {{spectacles}} {{from his forehead}} to his eyes, and looked at Toodle Junior standing upright in the corner: his head presenting the appearance (which <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did)</b> of having been newly drawn out of a bucket of cold water; his small waistcoat rising and falling quickly in the play of his emotions; and his eyes intently fixed on Mr Carker, without the least reference to his proposed master.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then there}} was a sharp hiss, a very fierce hiss. Johnny Chuck felt the hair on his neck rise as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> when he heard that hiss, and he wasn't at all surprised, when he turned his head, to find Mr. Blacksnake close by. Mr. Blacksnake glided swiftly up to the old log and coiled himself in front of the opening. Then he raised his head and ran out his tongue in the most impudent way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} {{necessary}} myself, but Aunt Lora <b>does,</b> so <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> humours her, {{and it really}} isn't any trouble. Besides, {{it may be necessary}} after all. One never knows, and it's best {{to be on the safe}} side." ...|$|R
50|$|The only effort made to {{interlink}} {{the separate}} {{parts of the}} game is as follows: reality has somehow been altered around the town of Punster. Idioms and clichés are suddenly manifesting themselves quite literally, and it falls to the player, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does,</b> to sort things out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Since he is {{safe with}} Fanny, I may venture to walk where I like. It 's such a lovely day, all the babies will be out, and <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>does</b> me {{good to see}} them," [...] thought Polly, turning into the wide, sunny street, where West End-dom promenaded at that hour.|$|R
