50|$|Only a {{few other}} insects and related organisms (such as mites) that feed on {{tamarack}} are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) can severely damage tamarack. The larch-bud moth (Zeiraphera improbana) has had occasional short epidemics, and the spruce spider mite (Oligonychus ununguis) is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The larch-shoot moth (Argyresthia laricella) is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual.

40|$|International audienceMany {{bark beetles}} {{belonging}} to the Dendroctonus genus carry bacterial and fungal microbiota, forming a symbiotic complex that helps the insect to colonize the subcortical environment of the host tree. However, the biodiversity of those bacteria at {{the surface of the}} cuticle or inside the body parts of bark beetles is not well established. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the bacterial microbiome associated with the <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dendroctonus simplex, using bacterial 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The ecto- and endomicrobiome and the subcortical galleries were investigated. Several bacterial genera were identified, among which Pseudomonas, Serratia and Yersinia are associated with the surface of the beetle cuticle, and genera belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Gammaproteobacteria with the interior of the insect body. The index of dissimilarity indicates that the bacterial microbiome associated with each environment constitutes exclusive groups. These results suggest the presence of distinct bacterial microbiota on the surface of the cuticle and the interior of D. simplex body. Additionally, the bacterial diversity identified in the galleries is substantially different from the ectomicrobiome, which could indicate a selection by the insect. This study reports for the first time the identification of the <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetle</b> microbiome...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of Hypocreales fungi against {{bark beetles}} is an {{attractive}} alternative strategy for biological control in forestry. However, fungal inoculation methods remain a major challenge due to the cryptic behaviour of these beetles. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of adult <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetles,</b> Dendroctonus simplex, to different isolates of Hypocreales fungi and to assess the efficiency of direct inoculation of fungal conidia using an assisted autodissemination device. Among the nine fungal isolates tested, Beauveria bassiana INRS- 242 {{was selected as the}} utmost isolate causing a mortality rate of 64. 4 % of D. simplex adults within 10 days and having a high conidial viability of 81. 7 %. Using an assisted autodissemination device, a fungal-coated pouch was a promising contamination chamber. Once it had fallen onto the fungal-coated pouch, each D. simplex adult loaded an average lethal dose of 2. 1 × 109 conidia, which induced a mortality rate of 98. 0 %. Our results demonstrated the fungal pathogenicity of B. bassiana INRS- 242 against the <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetles</b> and pointed out the potential of the assisted autodissemination device as an effective method of conidia inoculation.

The {{range of the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dendroctonus simplex LeConte (Coleoptera: Scolytinae), is concomitant with its primary host, eastern larch (tamarack), Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch, throughout the North American boreal forest. Since 2000, an ongoing outbreak of eastern larch beetles in the south-central part of tamarack’s range throughout the Great Lakes region has caused extensive mortality to mature tamaracks, affecting over 86, 500 hectares of tamarack forest in Minnesota. Extended outbreaks in live trees are atypical of this insect, so the eastern larch beetle’s biology and ecology were studied under laboratory and field conditions in Minnesota from 2011 – 2014 to decipher the factors contributing to this ongoing outbreak. In the laboratory, the minimum and optimal developmental temperatures for eastern larch beetles were determined to be 7. 5 and 27. 9 °C, respectively. Some progeny were able to reproduce {{in the absence of}} an overwintering period, suggesting that a reproductive diapause may not be obligate in all individuals. This was confirmed by field studies, which found that a second generation of eastern larch beetles successfully completed development during the summer and fall of 2012. Confirmation of two generations instead of three sibling broods established by re-emerging parents in one year was established by detailed phenological and physiological methods. As beetle infestations progressed through tamarack stands, beetles initially preferred to attack the largest tamaracks before killing smaller hosts at random in successive years. Reproductive success of females increased in larger and older tamaracks, and those “challenged” by unsuccessful attacks in the recent past. Higher concentrations of resin pockets within the phloem consistently reduced beetle reproduction. The size of male and female beetle offspring, as well as the total lipid content of female offspring, increased with tamarack size and phloem thickness. Development within “challenged” tamaracks reduced both the total and proportional lipid contents of all beetle offspring. New understandings of the population dynamics of eastern larch beetles are discussed. Expanding growing seasons, for example, may facilitate fractional voltinism, or, two generations in one year, among a portion of the population. Synchronous beetle emergence the following spring – shown in phenological studies – would enhance host procurement, especially of the largest and most preferred hosts that produce the most vigorous offspring, thus exacerbating the outbreak...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecology of}} the <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> <b>beetle,</b> Dendroctonus simplex LeConte, was studied in Newfoundland. Overwintered beetles emerged in May. One {{generation}} and two broods were produced in both 1983 and 1984. Females initiated attacks and males arrived up to two days later. One to four pairs of beetles used each entrance hole but each pair constructed a different gallery. [...] Egg galleries were vertical, slightly sinuous and averaged 41 cm in length. Females laid zero to four eggs per niche averaging 1. 4. The average number of eggs per gallery and per cm of gallery was 39 and 1. 0, respectively. Mean brood density was 49 individuals per 100 cm². [...] About 90 % of all parents reemerged and {{a small proportion of}} them attacked a second group of trees and produced a second brood. Galleries in second brood trees averaged 26 cm in length and 27 eggs per gallery. Mean brood density averaged 23 individuals per 100 cm². Following brood production 61 % of parents reemerged and likely died. [...] Development from egg to adult averaged 60 to 70 days for first and second broods, respectively. [...] During egg gallery construction and oviposition D. simplex flight muscles degenerated. Flight muscles were completely regenerated in only 17 % of 96 reemerged beetles in 1984. No reemerged beetles were observed to fly. [...] Emergence, host attack and reemergence occurred between 10 : 30 and 17 : 00 hours and at temperatures of 4 ﾟC or higher. Peaks of attack, which reflects flight peaks, occurred at temperatures of 10 ﾟC or higher. [...] Only adults overwintered. Freezing temperatures caused high mortality among immature stages of the second brood. [...] Thirty-four percent of new brood adults emerged in the fall and reentered galleries at the base of trees for hibernation. [...] The fourth larval instar had the highest mortality, at 29. 2 %, and pupae the lowest, at 7. 6 %. Total mortality was 79 % and 82 % for first and second broods, respectively. Pathogens caused the largest proportion of mortality among eggs, second instar larvae and pupae, resinosis among first instar larvae and parasitoids among third and fourth instar larvae. Overwintering mortality was 7. 8 %. [...] Fifty-two species of insects, spiders, mites and nematodes were associated with D. simplex in 1983...|$|E

40|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> (Larix laricina) {{and black}} spruce (Picea mariana) {{are the most}} {{dominant}} tree species in peatlands in Canada, however interactions between peatland hydrology and species-specific radial growth are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the relationships between the}} growth/hydrological response of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> and black spruce across a topographical gradient within a peatland in Saskatchewan. Tree-ring analysis revealed that peatland hydrology is the main factor driving radial-tree growth. Black spruce {{on the edge of the}} fen showed a positive relationship to increased water-table level, while <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> in the fen revealed a negative correlation to water-table level rise. Further analysis illustrated that radial-tree growth response to hydrology is dependent on specific water-table levels according to species and micro-site. Identified thresholds indicated that only 8 cm of variability in water-table level can greatly affect the fen forest dynamics. Once the relationship between tree ring and hydrology was established, a multiple- species regression equation was derived from tree-ring data to reconstruct past water-table levels. Results indicated that <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> and black spruce are suitable proxies to reconstruct hydrological variability at the site. <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> ring widths are not only subjected to change by hydrology, but they can also be altered by exposure to larch sawfly outbreaks (Pristiphora erichsonii). Researchers have often been limited in their ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding the history of sawfly outbreaks in peatlands. Water-table level suppressions result in similar radial-growth patterns as when trees are defoliated by larch sawfly, making accurate diagnoses of larch sawfly outbreak a challenge. In this study I investigated the relationship between sawfly outbreaks and peatland hydrology. Five outbreaks where identified using traditional dendroecological analysis. The last outbreak identified was found to be a result of hydrological growth suppression and not sawfly defoliation. Observations indicated that periods of low water-table level may lead to increased populations of larch sawfly in northern Saskatchewan. I stress the necessity of using long-term hydrological analyses to accurately infer outbreak periods to distinguish them from water-table suppression...|$|R
30|$|Tree drought-response {{is partly}} plastic and {{phenotypic}} plasticity results from environmental factors should be another explanation of our findings. <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is from NB, {{where it is}} characterised by mixture of continental climate and maritime climate. Species from these areas are likely to have high tolerance to changing weather conditions (Islam and Macdonald 2004; Lukkarinen et al. 2009; Dufour-Tremblay et al. 2012). Effective spring drought avoidance by <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> partially explains why it dominates eastern Siberian forests with their cold, dry continental winter climate (Berg and Chapin 1994). Larger natural range of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> contributes to its higher adaptation to the temporally and spatially variable soil conditions, including water availability. Prince Rupprecht’s larch is native to the mountainous regions of 1400 – 2800  m elevation, distributed in a scattered manner, with a smaller area in Shanxi and Hebei provinces of northern China. It has been well known that temperature and water supply (especially precipitation) were critical drivers for seedling germination (Walck et al. 2011; Xiang et al. 2016). So, we deduced that frequently occurring spring drought in northern China is the limiting factor to the tree recruitment, which in turn resulted in the narrower distribution of Prince Rupprecht’s larch, and lower adaptation to water deficits compared to <b>eastern</b> <b>larch.</b> Similarly, paper birch has a wide range. It is found in interior and south-central Alaska and in all provinces and territories of Canada, as well as the northern continental USA, south to Pennsylvania and Washington. White birch is mainly distributed in East Asia, native to China, Korea and Japan. Wider distribution of paper birch also resulted in higher adaptation to water deficits compared to white birch.|$|R

30|$|Larches are {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} tree genus in China, accounting for 6.5 % {{of the forest}} area and 6.8 % of the forest volume in this country (Lei et al. 2016). Prince Rupprecht’s larch (L. gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii (Mayr) Pilg.) is one of dominant species of cold temperate coniferous forests in northern China, mainly distributed at mountainous regions with elevations of 1400 — 2800  m (Di et al. 2014). The species plays significant ecological roles in water conservation, ecotourism and biodiversity, {{and it is also}} relatively fast growing with good-quality timber (Li et al. 1997; Zhang and Meng 2004). <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is native to North America. It has a continuous distribution in Canada from the Yukon in the west to Newfoundland in the east and south to the northern and north-eastern USA (Berg and Chapin 1994). It is a commercial species, particularly for short-rotation pulpwood plantations. Prince Rupprecht’s <b>larch</b> and <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> are both of ecological and commercial importance but responses of seedlings of these species to water deficits are still unknown. Populations of Prince Rupprecht’s larch have experienced serious drought since the 1990 s (Qian and Zhu 2001). <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is mainly confined to hydric sites in Canada, so is tolerant to spring flooding in wetlands (Islam and Macdonald 2004).|$|R

In low-watered conditions, survival rate, biomass, shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area, total root area and chlorophyll concentration of birch seedlings were significantly decreased. The response of seedlings to water deficits also differed according to the seed origins. Xeric origin of Prince Rupprecht’s larch was more affected than mesic origin of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch,</b> mainly because Prince Rupprecht’s larch originated in a narrower range of mountainous regions, resulting in lower adaptation of this species to water deficits, whereas <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> was distributed widely along coastal regions, contributing to higher phenotypic plasticity to variable soil conditions.

Larch species are commonly found to be mixed with birch species in natural forest (Cai et al. 2013; Di et al. 2014; Kozyr 2014; Anenkhonov et al. 2015; Xiang et al. 2016; Jansons et al. 2016; Schaedel et al. 2017; Hiranoa et al. 2017). Larch and birch species {{have been reported to}} respond differently to climate change. For example, in Southern Transbaikalia, Russia, the habitats of the subalpine belt had also become drier, particularly in the upper parts of the slopes where populations of larch (L. dahurica L.) was consequently less stable and was in a declining state; while {{at the foot of the}} slopes, dwarf birch (Betula nana L.) showed an increase in height due to increased soil moisture (Kozyr 2014). In a study of plasticity comparisons of climate-growth relationships of seven tree species, European larch was sensitive to the temperature in the dormant period and silver birch (B. pendula Roth) appeared to be the most robust against fluctuations in weather (Jansons et al. 2016). In northeastern China, increases in the severity and frequency of fires due to climate change may prompt shifts from a larch-dominated forest to an increasingly birch-dominated landscape (Cai et al. 2013). Water crises are expected to occur as a consequence of warmer temperatures and lower levels of precipitation in northern China (Zhang et al. 2014), so may affect species pair of Prince Rupprecht’s larch and white birch (B. platyphylla Sukaczev) in mountainous forests of northern China.
