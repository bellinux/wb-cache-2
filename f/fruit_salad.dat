5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of <b>fruit,</b> <b>salad</b> and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
25|$|In Mexico and Central America, {{avocados}} {{are served}} mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, {{or on the}} side of chicken and meat. In Peru, they are consumed with tequeños as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with parrillas, used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In Chile, it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, hamburgers, and hot dogs; and in slices for celery or lettuce salads. The Chilean version of Caesar salad contains large slices of mature avocado. In Kenya and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit eaten alone or mixed with other fruits in a <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> or as part of a vegetable salad.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>salads</b> {{were stored}} for {{increasing}} time up to 10 days and submitted to emotion analysis by using 300 Italian mother language consumers. Samples were assessed for their quality level by analyzing fruit browning, microbiological count, and overall visual acceptability. Less liked or disliked <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> changed the emotional {{status of the}} participants. Participants felt significantly less peaceful, friendly and eager but more aggressive, sad and disgusted {{in the presence of}} the spoiled <b>fruit</b> <b>salads.</b> The correlation between food quality and elicited emotions suggests their potential use as indicators in shelf life testing...|$|R

500|$|Her morning ablutions {{included}} washing herself unassisted with a flannel {{rather than}} taking a shower ("an odd invention"), and applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed daube (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she smoked a Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank {{a small amount of}} Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> based on banana slices and squeezed orange.|$|E
2500|$|In South Africa, <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> {{refers to}} male {{genitals}} while elsewhere it {{can refer to}} a group of gay men, a set of military medals and badges or a selection of drugs (because of the various colors) or even a mixture of marijuana and hashish called a <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> bowl referring to the pipe used to smoke the mixture, the later two [...] in the context of gay men partaking of them.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, the country's [...] of Chenin blanc {{is mostly}} grown as a {{blending}} variety often used with Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, and Semillon. Australian Chenin plantings {{can be found}} in Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, as well as the Swan Valley and Margaret River area of Western Australia. Wine expert James Halliday describes the style of Australia Chenin blanc as [...] "tutti-frutti" [...] with pronounced <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> notes.

40|$|An {{increase}} in the consumption of fruit juices and minimally processed <b>fruits</b> <b>salads</b> has been observed in recent years all over the world. In this work, the microbiological quality of artisan <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> was analysed. Faecal coliforms, Salmonella spp, Shigella spp, Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 were not detected; nevertheless, eleven strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated. By multiplex PCR, all isolates showed positive results for S. aureus 16 S rRNA gene and 63. 6 % of them were positive for sea gene. Furthermore, PCR sea positive strains were able to produce the corresponding enterotoxin. Finally, the inactivation of these strains in <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> by nisin, lysozyme and EDTA, was studied. EDTA produced a total S. aureus growth inhibition after 60 h of incubation at a concentration of 250 mg/L. The presence of S. aureus might indicate inadequate hygiene conditions during salad elaboration; however, the enterotoxigenicity of the strains isolated in this study, highlights the risk of consumers' intoxication. EDTA {{could be used to}} inhibit the growth of S. aureus in artisan <b>fruit</b> <b>salads</b> and extend the shelf life of these products...|$|R

2500|$|In Washington State, {{the first}} {{experimental}} plantings of Roussanne were planted by White Heron Cellars in 1990. In recent years, plantings have increased as more Washington winemakers experiment with Rhone varietals with grapes from Ciel du Cheval, Alder Ridge and Destiny Ridge. Washington Roussanne is often blended with Viognier and {{is characterized by}} its <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> profile of notes that range from apple, lime, peach and citrus to cream and honey. The Texas High Plains {{is proving to be}} well suited for growing high quality Roussanne. In New Jersey, [...] grows Roussanne, Marsanne, and other Rhone varieties. Unionville Vineyards plans to release their first Marsanne-Roussanne in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{brief period}} around 1971, Leyland Australia {{produced}} a variant referred to in Leyland literature as [...] "Moke, special export", but commonly called a [...] "Californian", which had a 1,275cc engine and was fitted with side marker lamps and different rear lights to conform to US FMVSS standards. The fuel tank from the Austin Sprite or MG Midget was fitted beneath the rear load area, replacing the standard tank mounted in the left sidebox. The export Californian was readily recognisable by its roof and seats, trimmed in [...] "Op-pop verve" [...] black and white tiger striped vinyl or [...] "Orange Bali" [...] vinyl, which looked rather like a <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> and was briefly marketed to the [...] "flower power" [...] culture in the United States.|$|E
60|$|The Sausage Chappie did it again. He {{took up a}} <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> poised it for a moment, then {{decanted}} it over Mr. Gossett's bald head.

60|$|The {{refreshment}} alcove, {{which was}} really a good-sized room, a sort of chapel-of-ease to the larger drawing-room, was already packed with a crowd who felt that they could best discuss Ronnie's triumph between mouthfuls of <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> and iced draughts of hock-cup. So brief is human glory that two or three independent souls had even now drifted from {{the theme of the}} moment on to other more personally interesting topics.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{of those}} long silences. Pregnant, I believe, is what they're {{generally}} called. Aunt looked at butler. Butler looked at aunt. I looked at both of them. An eerie stillness seemed to envelop the room like a linseed poultice. I happened to be biting on a slice of apple in my <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> at the moment, and it sounded as if Carnera had jumped {{off the top of the}} Eiffel Tower on to a cucumber frame.|$|E
60|$|But {{on arrival}} at the room, it transpired that Tuppy, if anywhere, was infesting some other portion of the house. Gussie shot in, and I heard the key turn. And feeling {{that there was no}} more that I could do in that quarter, I {{returned}} to the dining-room for further <b>fruit</b> <b>salad</b> and a quiet think. And I had barely filled my plate when the door opened and Aunt Dahlia came in. She sank into a chair, looking a bit shopworn.|$|E

60|$|By {{way of a}} start, I {{read the}} note again. Not that I had any hope that a second perusal would enable me to place a {{different}} construction on its contents, but it helped to fill in while the brain was limbering up. I then, to assist thought, had another go at the <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> and in addition ate a slice of sponge cake. And it was as I {{passed on to the}} cheese that the machinery started working. I saw what had to be done.|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} Aunt Dahlia's bearing and {{demeanour}} {{did nothing to}} assist toward a restored composure. Of the amiability which she had exhibited when discussing this unhappy chump's activities with me over the <b>fruit</b> <b>salad,</b> no trace remained, and I was not surprised that speech more or less froze on the Fink-Nottle lips. It isn't often that Aunt Dahlia, normally as genial a bird as ever encouraged a gaggle of hounds to get their noses down to it, lets her angry passions rise, but when she does, strong men climb trees and pull them up after them.|$|E

50|$|In 1947, Rossi {{settled in}} Palmetto, Florida and began packing fruit gift boxes and jars of {{sectioned}} <b>fruit</b> for <b>salads</b> {{under the name}} Manatee River Packing Company. As the fruit segment business grew, the company moved to a larger location in east Bradenton, Florida and {{changed its name to}} Fruit Industries.
