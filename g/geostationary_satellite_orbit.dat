Through careful selection of the predetermined arc (PDA) for each administration, flexibility can be increased in terms of choice of system technical characteristics and specific orbit location while reducing the need for coordination among administrations. The NASARC software determines pairwise compatibility between all possible service areas at discrete arc locations. NASARC then exhaustively enumerates groups of administrations whose satellites can be closely located in orbit, and finds the arc segment over which each such compatible group exists. From the set of all possible compatible groupings, groups and their associated arc segments are selected using a heuristic procedure such that a PDA is identified for each administration.

40|$|NASARC was {{developed}} from the general planning principles and decisions of both sessions of the World Administrative Radio Conference on the Use of the <b>Geostationary</b> <b>Satellite</b> <b>Orbit</b> and on the Planning of Space Services Utilizing It (WARC- 85, WARC- 88). NASARC was written to help countries satisfy requirements for nation-wide Fixed Satellite services from at least one orbital position within a predetermined arc. The NASARC-generated predetermined arcs are each based on a common arc segment visible {{to a group of}} compatible service areas, and provide a means of generating a highly flexible allotment plan with a reduced need for coordination among administrations. The selection of particular groupings of service areas and their associated predetermined arcs is made according to a heuristic approach using several figures of merit designed to confront the most difficult allotment problems. NASARC attempts to select groupings and predetermined arc sizes so that the requirements of all administrations are met before the available orbital arc is exhausted. The predetermined arcs allow considerable freedom of choice in the positioning of space stations for all members of any grouping. The approach to allotment planning for which NASARC was designed consists of two phases. The first is the use of NASARC to identify predetermined arc segments common to groups of administrations. Those administrations within a group and sharing a common predetermined arc segment would be able to position their individual space stations at any {{one of a number of}} orbital positions within the predetermined arc. The second phase involves the use of a plan synthesis program (such as the ORBIT program resident at the International Frequency Registration Board in Geneva, Switzerland) to identify example scenarios of specific space station placements. NASARC software is modular, and consists of several programs to be run in sequence. The grouping module, NASARC 1, identifies compatible groups of several service areas that are sufficiently separated geographically so that co-location or near co-location of their space stations will permit a user-specified downlink performance criterion to be satisfied. Pairwise compatibility between systems is assessed on the basis of the satellite separation required to meet this criterion. NASARC 2 examines all groups of compatible administrations with their corresponding arc segments and computes a common predetermined arc. After an orbital slot of sufficient size has been found, NASARC 2 calculates the required orbital separation between the critical group and its potential east and west neighbors and determines predetermined arc placement accordingly. NASARC 3 updates and extends the feasible orbital locations for predetermined arcs associated with compatible groups of service areas to provide flexibility for rearrangement if necessary. NASARC 4 performs rearrangement of predetermined arc segments where rearrangement will provide increased total arc available for subsequent placement of additional predetermined arcs and produces the final output report of the NASARC package. In addition to planning assumed homogeneous systems, NASARC can take into account such factors as rain attenuation, individual antenna parameters, power calculation options, minimum power values, different required carrier-to-interface ratios, variable grouping criteria, and affiliated sets of service areas. The modules allow the baseline assumptions to be modified, some on an individual service area basis. NASARC array dimensions have been structured to fit within the currently available 12 MB memory capacity of the International Frequency Registration Board computer facility. NASARC was written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77 and developed on an AMDAHL 5860 running under the IBM VM operating system. The package requires 8. 1 MB of central memory.

They provide constant monitoring of specific areas of the globe. NOAA currently operates four geostationary satellites: GOES- 10, GOES- 11, GOES- 12, and GOES- 13. GOES stands for <b>Geostationary</b> Operational Environmental <b>Satellites.</b> These satellites provide constant coverage of the western hemisphere, taking images every 15 minutes. They also have sensors that can detect cloud, land, and ocean temperatures, as well as features of the sun.

It takes approximately 1. 5 hours to make one orbit, so in 24 hours, the 14 orbits of each polar satellite provide global coverage of the earth.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two main arguments: the first is a {{satellite}} study of a planetary atmosphere and the second is a study of the propagation properties of photons in the atmosphere. The study of the atmosphere is made through the analysis of satellite data. The satellites are divided into two main groups: polar <b>satellites</b> and <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellites.</b> Polar <b>satellites</b> have an <b>orbit</b> around the Earth at an altitude of about 800 km, they pass over the same site twice every 24 hours and have a field of view that looks at the entire globe of the Earth. <b>Geostationary</b> <b>satellites</b> <b>orbit</b> above a fixed point at an altitude of about 35000 km, they have a temporal resolution of the order of minutes, and they have a field of view of a single hemisphere. For this reason the geostationary systems are composed of a pair of satellites so as to cover the entire globe. In this thesis the satellite data analysis of Earth's atmosphere has the main purpose of the site testing. We base the analysis on the study of data from the <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> GOES 12. In particular, we describe a new model for a complete study of the Earth's atmosphere. This model studies the cloud cover, but for some selected sites it includes also some indications on atmospheric phenomena such as winds, fog, dust and high humidity. It also allows a short and long term statistical forecast of the observing conditions of the site and a qualitative analysis of the seeing. We correlate the cloud cover data with the data from the MODIS polar satellite. This allows a mutual assessment of the results obtained from the two satellites belonging to the two main satellite groups. The combined analysis of a <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> and a polar satellite allows us to fill the respective limits of the two satellite groups. In the second part we analyze the photon propagation properties in the free atmosphere: we see in detail how the photon propagation time changes in a medium. We also analyze the geometrical and physical distortions of these photon paths. In particular, we describe a new model for the photon delay time in the atmosphere and to derive the seeing from this delay time fluctuations. Finally, we describe the design of a new tool for the ground layer seeing analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{new family}} of non-Keplerian orbits for solar sail spacecraft displaced above or below the Earth’s equatorial plane. The work aims to prove the assertion in the literature that displaced geostationary orbits exist, possibly {{to increase the number}} of available slots for <b>geostationary</b> communications <b>satellites.</b> The existence of displaced non-Keplerian periodic orbits is first shown analytically by linearization of the solar sail dynamics around a geostationary point. The full displaced periodic solution of the nonlinear equations of motion is then obtained using a Hermite–Simpson collocation method with inequality path constraints. The initial guess to the collocation method is given by the linearized solution, and the inequality path constraints are enforced as a box around the linearized solution. The linear and nonlinear displaced periodic orbits are also obtained for the worst-case sun-sail orientation at the solstices. Near-term and high-performance sails can be displaced between 10 and 25 km above the Earth’s equatorial plane during the summer solstice, and a perforated sail can be displaced above the usual station-keeping box (75 � 75 km) of nominal <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellites.</b> Light-levitated <b>orbit</b> applications to space solar power are also considered...|$|R

40|$|Solar sailing is a {{propulsion}} method using sunlight {{as energy}} source, meaning {{it does not}} make use of propellants as conventional methods do. The principle of solar sailing is simple: a large lightweight sail acts as a mirror reflecting impinging light. According to the wave-particle duality light can be interpreted as a stream of photons travelling at the speed of light. As these photons impinge upon a solar sail, they transfer their momentum on the sail and thus the spacecraft. This energy transferred is the propulsive force in solar sailing. The achievable force is in the order of mN and thus not very large, but in the frictionless environment that space is it can have considerable effects. Since this force works continuously, the energy input can rise to vast levels over time. One of the possible applications for using a solar sail on a space mission is a displaced <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> A <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> remains at a fixed position with respect to Earth's surface due to its orbital characteristics. A natural geostationary orbit can only be achieved at a specific altitude, eccentricity and inclination, meaning all <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellites</b> <b>orbit</b> the Earth in exactly the same orbital plane. This limitation causes the geostationary band to get more crowded every year and this is why the concept of displaced <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellites</b> is interesting. For this concept, a satellite is put in an orbit that is altered in order to lay outside the standard geostationary band while the relevant orbital properties remain constant and its position thus stays fixed above the Earth' surface. In this thesis a spacecraft equipped with a solar sail is used to achieve such a displaced orbit. Even though the thrust levels possible using a solar sail are limited, the fact that it allows for continuous thrust and does not rely on any propellant make it a promising candidate for this concept. This thesis investigates the feasibility of this idea. A differential evolutionary algorithm is used to search for orbital trajectories that fulfil the set requirements. Promising results were found considering increasing vertical displacement of the orbital plane above the equatorial plane. Using a sail performance of 1 mm/s 2 and a trajectory of three revolutions, a displaced orbit with an average offset of 3 km with respect to the desired position throughout the trajectory was found. These results were found considering the most favourable conditions valid around the winter solstice. During other periods of the year, the direction of the sunline has changed and the performance of the solutions found decreases to approximately 20 km average offset. With a desired displacement of 25 km, this is clearly unacceptable high. It can therefore be concluded that achieving a displaced geostationary orbit is possible, although only for a limited time. The solutions found only hold for the conditions valid around December 21, the winter solstice. Throughout the year, the conditions change considerably and become less favourable. As a result no valid solution trajectories were found during March-September. The concept of a displaced <b>geostationary</b> <b>satellite</b> solely using solar sailing as a propulsion method thus unfortunately seems infeasible.
