5|$|The {{congregation}} initially {{consisted of}} only ten families and met in several temporary locations {{before moving to}} a permanent building. These locations included a house on 24th Avenue and 9th Street, a room above Carney's Grocery Store, and Sheehan Hall. In this interim period, the congregation grew to include 50 members by 1878, with David Burgheim serving as rabbi. The Middle Eastern style building {{at the corner of}} 8th Street and 22nd Avenue, constructed by the growing congregation in 1879, was the first building in the city with gas-powered lighting. Rabbi Burgheim was succeeded by Rabbi W. Weinstein, then Rabbi Jacobs, and then Rabbi Judah Wechsler. Wechsler, who became rabbi in 1887, led a movement to provide public schools for blacks, which culminated in a bond issue to construct the first brick public school building for African Americans in the state. The Wechsler School was named after him and has since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Mississippi Landmark. The congregation stayed in this building for several years, before eventually being forced to move due to complaints of flies attracted by <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> outside of a nearby retail store.|$|E
2500|$|Crossing {{sweepers}} were {{a common}} sight {{on the streets of}} large cities during much of the 19th century. The predominance of horse-drawn vehiclesand the general uncleanliness of urban streetsentailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> (among other forms of refuse). Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person crossing the street and creating a path that was referred to as a [...] "broom walk," [...] thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent.|$|E
2500|$|The Connecticut Court {{found the}} {{argument}} of the defendant-respondent to be exceptionally weak {{in terms of the}} law. [...] The idea that <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> abandoned along the road became a part of the real estate in fee is an interesting argument. But it was soundly rejected by the court. [...] Even following this theory, the borough of Stamford, Connecticut would have been the new best owners of the manure. [...] When the plaintiff-appellate began to rake the manure into neat piles for reclamation, he did it in clear sight of {{one or more of the}} officials of Stamford. [...] Also, presumably, any citizen of the town could have observed him. [...] No one objected to his activity, or came forward to claim superior rights to the manure. [...] The plaintiff had [...] "improved" [...] what was otherwise a nuisance to the town. [...] In this act, he also had some legal standing to claim a superior ownership to anyone else. [...] The existing laws allowing persons who piled up seaweed to have a legitimate claim of possession for 24 hours was invoked. [...] The court had nothing good to say about the defendant-respondent, stating he had not placed himself in an enviable light.|$|E
5000|$|Professional dancers do {{not wish}} each other good luck by saying [...] "break a leg"; instead they say [...] "Merde!", the French word for [...] "shit". In turn, theater people have picked up this usage and may wish each other [...] "merde", alone or in {{combination}} with [...] "break a leg". In Spanish, the phrase is [...] "mucha mierda", or [...] "lots of shit". This term may have arisen {{in response to the}} audience's shoes inadvertently dragging <b>horse</b> and dog <b>droppings</b> from city streets into theater lobbies during the days of horse-drawn transportation ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the effect of biofumigation using fresh organic matter on typical weeds present in strawberry fields of southern Spain. Field experiments consisted of biofumigation (BF) treatment over 45 days, at two locations, with hen <b>droppings</b> or <b>horse</b> manure at a dose of 3 kg m- 2, alone or in combination with solarization (BF+S) in an experimental randomized block design. Results showed good control of the main weed species, Poa annua, Portulaca oleracea and Lolium rigidum, with comparative populations of the three species under BF/BF+S of 42 / 4 / 8, 18 / 9 / 12, and 15 / 0 / 1 plants m- 2 respectively. In addition, 20 seeds each of several weeds were sown inside cloth bags and were submitted to the treatment. The efficiency of biofumigation combined with solarization in the control of P. oleracea, Cynodon dactilon and Echinochloa crus-galli was 77 / 0, 50 / 15, and 30 / 2, {{as a percentage of}} germination of control/BF+S. Laboratory experiments consisted of simulating field conditions using a mix of soil, water and different fresh organic matter in a plastic bag, into which different seeds were sown and kept under controlled conditions over 30 days at 27 ºC. Fresh organic matter used was whole strawberry plants, <b>horse</b> manure, hen <b>droppings,</b> and combinations of these. Best results were obtained with hen droppings, which showed effective control of Malva parviflora, Medicago sp., E. crus-galli, Amaranthus retroflesuxus, Chenopodium album and P. oleracea, while strawberry residues and horse manure were not useful as herbicides, sometimes even less so than the solarization treatment. Biofumigation with fresh hen droppings and solarization showed promising results in preliminary experiments...|$|R

50|$|Most of Mauve's work depicts {{people and}} animals in outdoor settings. In his Morning Ride in the Rijksmuseum, for example, fashionable equestrians at the seacoast are seen riding {{away from the}} viewer. An {{unconventional}} detail, <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> in the foreground, attests his commitment to realism.|$|E
50|$|It was {{interesting}} to note that on Anzac Day 2005, as on previous similar commemorations, mounted members of the Australian Army or commemoration teams were at the memorial, as was obvious from copious amounts of <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> around the memorial; some {{can be seen in the}} photograph.|$|E
50|$|The ingenious use {{of light}} in the {{painting}} was proven to be more skillful than previously thought after a restoration of the painting was completed in 1991. The restoration removed the yellowish tinge that had permeated the work, and revealed another surprising thing. In his commitment to realism, the artist had depicted <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> in the scene, which one of the previous owners must have deemed sufficiently indecent to warrant a covering up.|$|E
50|$|Almería {{province}} was a favoured {{location for}} filming spaghetti Westerns. But, when Shalako was in production, Harry Saltzman's Second World War film, Play Dirty, {{set in the}} Libyan Desert, was being filmed on the same locations. One film crew had {{to wipe out the}} tyre tracks in the sand before filming the Old West, whilst the other had to pick up the <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> before shooting the Second World War battles. Once the gypsy Apaches, mounted on horseback, rode by mistake headlong into an attack on a Long Range Desert Group.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} during this era that long {{distance}} rail travel became quite popular. The High Street line faced delays {{of up to}} seven hours per day due to the grade level crossing of 10 tracks across High Street at Union Station. To remedy the problem, subway tunnels were built under the tracks. They were dark, and the smell from the <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> made the trip unpleasant. From the period of 1863-1892, {{more than a dozen}} horsecar companies set up shop in the city, and total trackage was expanded to 34.5 mi prior to electrification.|$|E

50|$|The town of Bury St Edmunds was {{designed}} by the monks in a grid pattern. The monks charged tariffs on every economic activity, including the collecting of <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> in the streets. The Abbey even ran the Royal Mint. During the 13th century general prosperity blunted the resistance of burghers and peasants; in the 14th century, however, the monks encountered hostility from the local populace. Throughout 1327, the monastery suffered extensively, as several monks {{lost their lives in}} riots, and many buildings were destroyed. The townspeople attacked in January, forcing a charter of liberties on them. When the monks reneged on this they attacked again in February and May. The hated charters and debtors' accounts were seized and triumphantly torn to shreds.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-two {{species of}} {{thermophilic}} fungi were isolated from mushroom compost. Scytalidium thermophilum {{was present in}} the compost ingredients, fresh straw, <b>horse</b> <b>droppings,</b> and drainage from compost and dominated the fungal biota of compost after preparation. Of 34 species of thermophilic fungi tested, 9 promoted mycelial growth of Agaricus bisporus on sterilized compost: Chaetomium thermophilum, an unidentified Chaetomium sp., Malbranchea sulfurea, Myriococcum thermophilum, S. thermophilum, Stilbella thermophila, Thielavia terrestris, and two unidentified basidiomycetes. These species will be considered for future experiments on inoculation and more controlled preparation of compost...|$|E

40|$|Photograph of the Don Lopez Geronimo adobe ranch house, San Fernando Valley, 1898. The one-story adobe {{is shown}} at center, with several people {{positioned}} around the picket fence that runs horizontally across the image. The adobe features a wrap-around porch which {{is covered by}} a wooden overhang, and a shingled roof which sports two brick chimneys {{as well as a}} metal stovepipe. The road {{in front of the house}} is unpaved and appears to be littered by <b>horse</b> <b>droppings.</b> A tree stands in front of the fence to the left. Mountains are partially visible in the right background. The ranch was build by Valintine Lopez and afterward bought by Geronimo's son, Stephen Lopez. Photoprint reads: "Lange(?) adobe house built by Geronimo Lopez, became famous as the Lopez Station"...|$|E
40|$|Dog shit, {{cigarette}} butts and pizza boxes The garbage found on city streets reflects the consumption patterns {{of a city}} and its street life. At one time, <b>horse</b> <b>droppings</b> were left {{in the streets of}} Copenhagen, and no one seemed to take any notice. The waste from the horses was considered to be an unavoidable part of city life. The malodorous stench coming from the filthy gutters and the sewage created by craftsmen and shopkeepers, however, were cause for complaint. Today, a few greasy discarded pizza boxes can lead to major campaigns, and fag butts have become more and more visible as garbage, despite the fact that fewer of them are being tossed on the streets. The garbage on Copenhagen’s streets and the municipality’s different strategies to handle it suggest that the concept of “street garbage” is difficult to grasp. There is no obvious connection between the street garbage that a citizen finds problematic and the amount of the garbage that is actually found on the street. Some types of street garbage are considered to be more disgusting or morally troublesome than others. The city’s campaigns against street garbage and the way that garbage is categorised also contribute to people’s opinions. The Clean City campaigns (Ren By kampagnerne) that took place in 1987 are particularly interesting to analyse because, on the one hand, they reflect the city’s ongoing efforts to utilise new strategies to keep the city clean; on the other hand, these campaigns demonstrate how difficult it can be to manoeuvre between divergent political positions and ways of analyzing the problem while also considering economic priorities and changing cultural values. The city’s street garbage – no matter how practical and simple a problem it may seem to be – proves difficult for a city like Copenhagen to manage and find effective solutions for because the concept of “street garbage” is constantly changing, just like the everyday routines of the city’s residents and the city’s technological capabilities. </p...|$|E
