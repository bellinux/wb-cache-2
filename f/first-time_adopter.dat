40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effect of the {{mandatory}} introduction of IFRS standards on earnings quality, and more precisely on earnings management. We concentrate on three IFRS <b>first-time</b> <b>adopter</b> countries, namely Australia, France, and the UK. We find that the pervasiveness of earnings management did not decline after the introduction of IFRS, and in fact increased in France. Our findings confirm that sharing rules is not a sufficient condition to create a common business language, and that management incentives and national institutional factors {{play an important role in}} framing financial reporting characteristics. We suggest that the IASB, the SEC and the European Commission should now devote their efforts to harmonizing incentives and institutional factors rather than harmonizing accounting standards.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple Unix-based repository that supports programming intensive courses. Initially {{motivated by the}} need to capture sample artifacts for the capstone course sequence, the repository has evolved to support program submission, on-line testing, and automated program grading. Repository features enforce naming conventions, assignment due dates, while supporting the use of Unix in programming classes. The repository also facilitates consistent on-line program grading along with detailed capture of program compilation and execution. Repository utilities are provided to support first-time adoption, for archiving repositories from past terms, and for establishing repositories for a new academic term. Results from the transfer of the technology to <b>first-time</b> <b>adopters</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the quantitative impact of mandatory IFRS adoption on financial reporting issued by <b>first-time</b> <b>adopters.</b> It analyses whether relevance of financial information is higher under IFRS than {{the information provided}} in financial statements prepared under local GAAP when investors {{have to make decisions}} in the capital markets. Both studies comparing results in Spain and in the United Kingdom, whose accounting systems have been traditionally considered in opposite groups. The results of the research reveal that the quantitative impact is significant in both countries and, against we expected, it is higher in the United Kingdom. We also observe that IFRS have affected negatively to the relevance of financial reporting in both countries, although this effect has only been significant in Spain...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{application}} lifecycle management (ALM) platforms offer {{many benefits}} that enable the software development team to smoothly plan, execute and monitor its development activities. However, to <b>first-time</b> <b>adopters</b> of ALM platforms, the initial adoption presents three challenges that often prevent a successful adoption: to correctly define the team’s current software development activities, to correctly configure the ALM platform accordingly {{to support these}} activities, {{and to ensure that}} the team follows the decreed discipline throughout the lifecycle. To take on the three challenges effectively and efficiently, we propose a new approach called Rapid Application Lifecycle Management (RALM). RALM features a reference model that is described by a number of activity templates, which allows the adopter to customize, review, discuss, and revise ALM activities in rapid cycles. All customized activity templates are machine-translated to the target ALM platform: activity definitions are translated into process templates and configuration guide and the decreed discipline into engineering practice guidance for the team. An experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RALM is presented...|$|R
40|$|Many healthy {{adult cats}} are euthanised {{annually}} in shelters, and novel approaches {{are required to}} reduce euthanasia rates. Waiving adoption fees is one such approach. However, concerns that less responsible owners will be attracted to free events persist among welfare groups. We evaluated evidence for differences in cat fate, health, and adherence to husbandry legislation via a case-study of a free adoption-drive for cats ≥ 1 year at a Western Australian shelter. Post-adoption outcomes were compared between free adopters and a control group of normal-fee adopters. The free adoption-drive rehomed 137 cats, increasing average weekly adoptions by 533 %. <b>First-time</b> <b>adopters</b> were a significantly larger portion of the free cohort, {{as a result of}} mixed-media promotions. Both adopter groups selected cats of similar age; sex and pelage. Post-adoption, both groups retained > 90 % cats, reporting near identical incidences of medical and behavioural problems. Adopters did not differ in legislative compliance regarding fitting collars, registering cats, or allowing cats to roam. The shelter reported satisfaction with the adoption-drive, because in addition to relieving crowding of healthy adults, adoption of full-fee kittens increased 381 %. Overall, we found no evidence for adverse outcomes associated with free adoptions. Shelters should not be dissuaded from occasional free adoption-drives during overflow periods...|$|R
40|$|To address {{increasing}} {{concerns for}} improved food safety, quality, and appropriate environmental practices of on-farm operations, governments {{and private sector}} are increasingly promoting standards for good agricultural practices. In Thailand, voluntary and free of charge Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) certification program was implemented by the government. It aims at mobilising farmers to improve on-farm operations to produce safe products and preserve the environment while reducing the costs of production. This study is a three-stage investigation into the factors and patterns of GAP adoption and continued adoption by rice farmers using successively probit for first adoption patterns, probit with selection models for continued participation, and comparison of practices among non-adopters, one-time only adopters, and continued adopters. The analyses {{are based on a}} survey of 250 farmers from Ayutthaya Province in the Central Plains of Thailand. Results demonstrate that adoption and dis-adoption are highly related to household labour constraints, land ownership, and initial high expectations regarding the market opportunities of the GAP produced rice. We found several encouraging differences between non-adopters and <b>first-time</b> <b>adopters,</b> indicating better pest and nutrient management. Although we observed an important rate of dis-adoption, we also determined that farmers are maintaining those better practices even after abandoning the program. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The IFRS {{mandatory}} {{adoption in}} European countries {{is an excellent}} context from which to assess the validity of accounting choice theory, which postulates that information asymmetry, contractual efficiency (agency costs) and managerial opportunism reasons could drive the choice. With this aim, we test {{the impact of these}} factors to explain the adoption of fair value for investment properties (IAS 40) in the real estate industry, taking into account the ‘revaluation’ option offered by IFRS 1 and using historical cost without revaluations as a baseline category for comparison purposes. We select a sample of European real estate companies from Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden, all <b>first-time</b> <b>adopters</b> of the IFRS. Using a multinomial logistic model, we show that information asymmetry, contractual efficiency and managerial opportunism could account for the fair value choice. Particularly, the most significant findings are that size as a proxy of political costs reduces the likelihood of using fair value while market-to-book ratio is negatively associated with the fair value choice. On the other hand, leverage, another typical proxy of contracting costs, seems not to influence the choice. This evidence confirms the current validity of traditional accounting choice theory even if it reveals, in such a context, the irrelevance of the usual relations between accounting choice and leverag...|$|R

This thesis focuses on goodwill impairment implemented and practised {{in the first three}} years after Hong Kong's adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Three issues - compliance, discount rate and audit quality with respect to goodwill impairment testing - are the focus of analytical and empirical attention. Understandably, {{one of the most controversial}} issues that has been discussed in financial reporting is goodwill. Goodwill impairment is argued to be one of the most difficult issues in practice. This thesis commences with a review of literature relating to goodwill with regard to its conceptualisation, techniques to avoid or alter its recognition, ways to measure and adjust it, and a description of key technical requirements of goodwill impairment in the context of Hong Kong. These issues are demonstrably reviewed in this thesis. This study focuses on filling the gap in knowledge of compliance, discount rate and audit quality in relation to goodwill impairment. To do so, detailed annual reports of listed firms collected from the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the period from 2005 to 2007, were drawn upon. Employing analytical procedures and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the study provides persuasive evidence on the issues of compliance, discount rate and audit quality with respect to goodwill impairment. The thesis concludes that the rates of non-compliance and poor quality of disclosure pertaining to goodwill impairment conducted by Hong Kong firms reduced in the first three years after Hong Kong's adoption of IFRS. However, non-compliance levels and poor disclosure quality were still high. The sample firms had a tendency to understate discount rates in comparison with independently estimated discount rates in all three years of the investigation. In addition, audit quality among the Big 4 auditors is proved to be heterogeneous rather than homogeneous. The thesis concludes that a big gap exists between the standard requirements of goodwill impairment and practice. In the context of Hong Kong, this research demonstrates that the efficacy of this standard is low. It is therefore likely that the application of goodwill impairment in practice will continue to cause concern for policy makers and standard setters. Mode of access: World Wide Web. xii, 280...|$|R
