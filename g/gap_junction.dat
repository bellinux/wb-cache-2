Frequency, size and position of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in developing neural retina are different at each stage of development. In 3 -day-old embryos, some cells adhere to each other by <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> immediately below the outer limiting membrane of neural retinae. The size and number of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> increase remarkably during 5 - 6 days of incubation. In this period of development, well developed <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> consisting of subcompartments of intramembrane particles are found between cell surfaces at both the outer limiting membrane region and the deeper portion of the neural retina. <b>Gap</b> <b>junctions</b> disappear thereafter, and at 7 5 days of incubation, small <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are predominant between cell surfaces at the outer limiting membrane region, while the frequency of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in the deeper portion is very low. At 9 days of incubation, <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are rarely found.

40|$|Abstract [...] Oblique thin {{sections}} of the goldfish inner plexiform layer (IPL) were examined to characterize the processes engaging in <b>gap</b> <b>junctions.</b> Omission of en bloc uranyl acetate staining enhanced the relative visibility of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions,</b> thus facilitating surveys. Three general categories were identified: (1) extensive <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> between large caliber amacrine cell dendrites presynaptic to ganglion cells and other amacrine cells in distal and proximal IPL; (2) moderate to small <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> between amacrine cell synaptic terminals or small amacrine cell-like processes of similar cytoplasmic appearance; and (3) <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> between the telodendria/terminals of bipolar cells. Most instances of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in the goldfish IPL seem to represent cases of homologous coupling. We have not found unambiguous cases of heterologous coupling as in the mammalian retina, nor have we yet found mixed synapses. Taken together with previous physiological and anatomical findings, homologous coupling occurs between pairs of rods, cones, horizontal cells, bipolar cells and amacrine cells in the goldfish retina, and this in turn implies that direct intercellular communication among like cell types is a common theme in retinal circuitry.

25|$|A <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> {{located in}} neurons is often {{referred}} to as an electrical synapse. The electrical synapse was discovered using electrical measurements before the <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> structure was described. Electrical synapses are present throughout the central nervous system and have been studied specifically in the neocortex, hippocampus, vestibular nucleus, thalamic reticular nucleus, locus coeruleus, inferior olivary nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, ventral tegmental area, olfactory bulb, retina and spinal cord of vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|Gap {{junctions}} {{are particularly}} important in cardiac muscle: the signal to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in unison. Gap junctions are expressed in virtually all tissues of the body, {{with the exception of}} adult fully developed skeletal muscle and mobile cell types such as sperm or erythrocytes. Several human genetic disorders are associated with mutations in <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> genes. Many of those affect the skin because this tissue is heavily dependent upon <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> communication for the regulation of differentiation and proliferation. Cardiac gap junctions can pharmacologically be opened with rotigaptide.|$|E
40|$|Guinea-pig liver <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are {{constructed}} from approximately {{equal amounts of}} connexins 26 and 32. The assembly of these connexins into connexon hemichannels and <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> was studied using antibodies specific to each connexin. Intracellular membranes were shown to contain low amounts of connexin 26 relative to connexin 32 {{in contrast to the}} equal connexin ratios detected in lateral plasma membranes and <b>gap</b> <b>junctions.</b> Assembly of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> requires oligomerization of connexins into connexons that may be homomeric or heteromeric. Immunoprecipitation using antibodies to connexins 26 and 32 showed that liver <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> were heteromeric. A chemical cross-linking procedure showed that connexons solubilized from guinea-pig liver <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> were constructed of hexameric assemblies of connexin subunits. The intracellular site of oligomerization of connexins was investigated by velocity sedimentation in sucrose–detergent gradients. Oligomers of connexins 26 and 32 were extensively present in Golgi membranes and oligomeric intermediates, especially of connexin 26, were detected in the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate subcellular fraction. Two intracellular trafficking pathways that may account for the delivery of connexin 26 to the plasma membrane and explain the heteromeric nature of liver <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> {{in the human}} gastric mucosa has been examined {{to see if there}} is any relation to gastric ulcer. Freeze fracture replicas were prepared from the endoscopic biopsy specimens of 20 patients with gastric ulcer (15 men and five women, aged 49 (13) years) and seven healthy volunteers (four men and three women, aged 41 (19) years). Large fractured areas of lateral cell membranes of surface mucous cells were observed randomly at a direct magnification of 15, 000 using electron microscopy. Small <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> were observed between gastric surface mucous cells in all healthy volunteers. <b>Gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in the patients with gastric ulcer were significantly fewer than in the healthy volunteers. In addition, <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in patients with recurrent ulcer were significantly fewer than in those with first onset ulcer. There was no obvious relationship between age and the {{development of}} <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in patients with gastric ulcer or in healthy volunteers. In areas of intestinal metaplasia, <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> were occasionally seen between absorptive cells of the villi, but not in the lateral membranes of goblet cells.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> {{was investigated in}} mammalian cells expressing connexin (Cx) 26, 32 and 43 fused to green, yellow or cyan fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, CFP). Targeting of Cx 32 -CFP and 43 -GFP to <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> and <b>gap</b> junctional communication was inhibited in cells treated with Brefeldin A, a drug that disassembles the Golgi. However <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> constructed of Cx 26 -GFP were only minimally affected by Brefeldin A. Nocodazole, a microtubule disruptor, {{had little effect on}} the {{assembly of}} Cx 43 -GFP <b>gap</b> <b>junctions,</b> but perturbed assembly of Cx 26 -GFP <b>gap</b> <b>junctions.</b> Co-expression of Cx 26 -YFP and Cx 32 -CFP in cells treated with Brefeldin A resulted in assembly of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> constructed of Cx 26 -YFP. Two amino acids that distinguish Cx 26 from Cx 32 in transmembrane domains were mutated in Cx 32 to investigate underlying mechanisms determining trafficking routes to <b>gap</b> <b>junctions.</b> One mutation, Cx 32 I 28 L, conferred on it partial Cx 26 -like trafficking properties as well the post-translational membrane insertion characteristics of Cx 26, suggesting that a key determinant regulating trafficking was present in the first transmembrane domain. The results provide a protein trafficking basis for specifying and regulating connexin composition of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> and thus selectivity of intercellular signaling, with Cx 32 and 43 trafficking through the secretory pathway and Cx 26 also following an alternative pathway...|$|R

The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs could perhaps be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> plaques.

40|$|ABSTRACT We report here rapid {{assembly}} of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in prostate epithelial cells in vitro. Assembly of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> can be induced by incubation at 0 °C followed by incubation at 37 °C.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the role of <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> in Caenorhabditis elegans oocyte maturation and fertilization. <b>Gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are observed between oocytes and the surrounding ovarian sheath cells in wild-type gonads. The sheath transcription factor CEH- 18 is required to negatively regulate oocyte maturation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and ovulation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that sheath/oocyte <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> are rare or absent in ceh- 18 (mg 57) null mutant gonads. To test the hypothesis that <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> negatively regulate oocyte maturation, we performed an RNAi screen of innexin genes, which encode channel-forming proteins. Here we show that INX- 14 and INX- 22 are required in the female germ line to inhibit oocyte maturation, MAPK activation, and ovulation. Genetic analysis and TEM are consistent with INX- 14 and INX- 22 being components of sheath/oocyte <b>gap</b> <b>junctions.</b> Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} <b>gap</b> <b>junctions</b> maintain oocytes in meiotic prophase I when sperm are absent.

25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight PAHs, with 2 to 4 aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (i.e., a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation {{in a key}} gene related to cell replication) is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate. Low {{molecular weight}} PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> channels, interfering with intercellular communication, and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. Closure of <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate.

Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.|$|E
25|$|In a {{heart with}} AF, the {{increased}} calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased calcium sensitivity {{can lead to}} accumulation of intra-cellular calcium and causes down regulation of L-type calcium channels. This reduces the duration of action potential and refractory period, thus favourable for the conduction of re-entrant waves. Increased expression of inward-rectifier potassium ion channels can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> proteins such as GJA1 (also known as Connexin 43), and GJA5 (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, <b>gap</b> <b>junction</b> hemichannels are {{primarily}} homo- or hetero-hexamers of connexin proteins. Invertebrate gap junctions comprise proteins from the innexin family.
