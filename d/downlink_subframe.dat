The uplink contention subframe is also used by the mobiles for establishing their connections. This frame structure supposes a perfect time and frequency synchronization between the mobiles and the access point as described in [21]. Therefore, each frame starts with a preamble used for synchronization purposes. Additional preambles may also be used in the frame.|$|R

In this paper, an efficient routing tree algorithm is proposed with combined uplink and downlink slot allocation on the centralized scheduling scheme which can abate interferences in the network. This algorithm allows more subscriber stations to transmit concurrently and so improves spatial reuse in the network. Also, the algorithm uses multi-channel and single channel systems and considers relay model, smoothing switching frequently between transmitting and receiving in successive time slots and fairness in the network.

30|$|Subchannelization in WiMAX {{involves}} three operations: interleaving, randomization of subcarriers {{according to}} some permutation scheme, and pilot insertion. This structure is specified in the DL-MAP and UL-MAP messages sent by the BS in each frame. As described in Section 2, the DL-MAP message is always mapped {{on the first two}} symbols of the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe,</b> hence providing a complete description of the permutation schemes used and bursts contained inside the subframe. At the receiver, the task of decoding DL-MAP messages showed itself as a critical one since most of the processing of the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> at the receiver cannot start until this message is completely decoded. On the other hand, the randomization of subcarriers in the uplink cannot be applied to the ranging bursts. As a consequence, this process depends entirely on the uplink burst scheme defined by the BS.|$|E

The numbers of subchannels and symbols for a <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> were set to 60 and 24, respectively. Thus, 1 subchannel had 12 downlink slots, and 1 downlink slot occupied 2 symbols. According to the received SNR, various MCSs were used, including QPSK 1 / 2, QPSK 3 / 4, 16 QAM 1 / 2, 16 QAM 3 / 4, 64 AQM 2 / 3, and 64 QAM 3 / 4 [1].|$|E
30|$|Although the {{requested}} bandwidth increases, the throughput should become stable when most slots are used (requested bandwidth exceeds 700 kbps for BCO). However, in this case, {{the situation is}} not actually saturated and their throughputs slightly increase, because, although most slots are used, the burst generally satisfies its requested bandwidth by fewer slots when using an optimal MCS and leaves the unused free slots of the allocated slots to other bursts that use inferior MCSs, i.e., the minority of slots in the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> use optimal MCSs, and the majority use inferior MCSs. The area of the burst using an optimal MCS increases {{in conjunction with the}} bandwidth to satisfy {{the requested}} bandwidth, and the unused slots, which are left to other bursts with lower MCSs, decrease. Consequently, more slots in the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> use optimal MCSs and fewer slots use inferior MCSs. Therefore, the throughput slightly increases. However, a saturated condition is eventually achieved when most slots are efficiently used. Some of the bandwidth area with inferior channel quality remains unused (approximately 10 %) even when the traffic load is heavy, as shown in Figure 7 d, because BCO shrinks the bursts to prevent throughput anomaly and achieves higher overall throughput, as explained in Section 4.2.|$|E

We focus on the mandatory parts of the standard for both the BS and the MS, i.e., OFDMA frame structure, PUSC permutation scheme in <b>downlink</b> and uplink <b>subframes,</b> ranging, and channel coding with tail-biting convolutional codes (TBCC).|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} {{available}} channels (and thus users) {{is limited by}} the available channel bandwidth. S-OFDMA allows for flexible allocation of bandwidth depending on licensed bandwidth and allocation schemes. The four main bandwidth sizes described in IEEE 802.16 are 1.25, 5, 10, and 20 MHz[3]. S-OFDMA allows for a variety of bandwidth configurations, while all other system parameters (frame length, symbol length, etc.) remain the same. This was a design decision made to simplify the hardware in mobile devices, which were not anticipated to be very powerful. Mobile WiMAX uses Time Division Duplexing, dividing the frame into <b>downlink</b> and uplink <b>subframes.</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> {{must follow}} some {{constraints}} regarding the permutation zone and burst definitions. First of all, bursts must be time-frequency rectangular-shaped and should always span {{a multiple of}} two symbols in time and a multiple of a subchannel size in frequency (this is the so-called slot unit according to WiMAX terminology). Moreover, several users can be grouped into a single burst to reduce overhead in the DL-MAP definition and {{to speed up the}} generation of bursts. Finally, the BS has to distribute the available resources between users taking into account their QoS parameters.|$|E
30|$|The flow {{scheduling}} used in {{the simulation}} was the algorithm with channel quality awareness and QoS guarantee (CQQ) [12], which is reportedly superior to other approaches. The CQQ applies a weighted fair queuing (WFQ) strategy to allocate total number of slots in the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> to each connection according to its assigned weight. The connection with higher average transmission rate and larger requested bandwidth is assigned a higher weight. The following discussion refers only to the results using CQQ because we conducted several previous simulations using various flow scheduling approaches and obtained similar results.|$|E
30|$|Since ADCs are not {{equipped}} with a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), normalization of the received signal is performed after the DDC stage. This is done by first computing the average power of the received signal and then applying the resulting value as a constant scale factor during the whole <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe</b> after synchronization. This normalization strategy has been selected because it provides a good compromise between clipping and quantization errors. The frame detection time is also fed to an uplink transmission control block which schedules the emission of the uplink subframe {{taking into account the}} subframes size and the transmit/receive transition gap (TTG) and receive/transmit transition gap (RTG) guard intervals.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} make the simulator’s {{architecture}} to have the extensibility, we proposed to use the design patterns as the norm of system architecture design and implement. We surveyed the six most used simulators, i.e., J-Sim [1], network simulator- 2 (NS- 2) [2], network simulator- 3 (NS- 3) [3], OMNeT++ [4], optimized network engineering tool (OPNET) [5], and QualNet [6], to ponder their system architectures and design concepts from their source codes and the related literatures of the modular functions. We propose a network simulator architecture, named as CCGns, based on the IEEE 802.16 - 2009 standard. CCGns is a discrete-event virtual network simulator coded by Java language [7] and uses Eclipse as develop tool, which obeys the object-oriented design (OOD) principles to design the function modules. CCGns uses design paradigm to design system architecture and comprises of eight packages: physical (PHY) layer, medium access control (MAC) layer, network (NET) layer, devices (DEV), topology (TPY), events (EVT), scheduler (SCH), and report (RPT) packages. The main contribution of CCGns is to propose three aspects: a scalable MAC message management and processing architecture (SM 3 PA), an applicable for multi-hop relay network architecture (AMRNA), and a two-stage minimum variance bandwidth allocation (TSMVBA) algorithm. SM 3 PA includes three design concepts: firstly, it contains event class, event processing procedure, and event owners having individual architecture with the independent growing scale; secondly, it uses command flow to accomplish a series of events; and thirdly, the event owner certainly has the ability to handle event. In SM 3 PA, users can arbitrarily define the management message types to focus on the interested messages and save the needed real simulation time. In AMRNA architecture, we can use a unified interface to simulate four different network topology architectures. TSMVBA is responsible to provide the optimal frame structure for the uplink (UL) and <b>downlink</b> (DL) <b>subframe</b> using the different subcarrier permutation mode.|$|R
30|$|The uplink {{scheduling}} is {{more complex}} than downlink scheduling. In the downlink scheduling, the BS has complete knowledge of the queue status and the BS {{is the only one that}} transmits during the <b>downlink</b> <b>subframe.</b> The data packets are broadcasted to all SSs and an SS only picks up the packets destined to it. In the uplink scheduling, the input queues are located in the SSs and are hence separated from the BS. So, the BS does not have any information about the arrived time of packets in the SSs queues. Moreover, the uplink medium access is based on request/grant mechanisms. The SSs need to send bandwidth request messages to the BS, which then decides how many slots are granted to each subsequent uplink subframes.|$|E

The boundary between access and relay link intervals must be determined dynamically upon the traffic load. In our analysis, however, the boundary is statically determined to maximize the average system throughput for the MSs uniformly distributed subject to the traffic model of a full buffer.|$|E
