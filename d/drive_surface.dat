5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño events may warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecological}} cycle at Cordell Bank can {{be divided}} into three oceanographic seasons. During the spring, strong northwestern winds push the water southward along the California coast. Gale winds and the Earth's rotation <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> water away from the shore, only to be replaced by an upwelling of more nutrient-rich waters from offshore. this contributes to the growth in numbers of phytoplankton, which are the foundation of the marine food web, in turn leading to a rise in the food supply, and thus numbers, of the organisms higher up the chain.|$|E

50|$|Most of the time, {{the trade}} winds <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> waters {{offshore}} near the equator, driving the Humboldt Current {{from the tip}} of southern Chile to northern Peru. This current is associated with upwelling of deep, nutrient-rich water off the coast of Peru. El Nino disrupts the usual wind pattern and lessens the upwelling. The consequent loss of nutrient causes fish kills.|$|E

At the same time a decline in temperature and a rise in salinity is observed (from the longterm ecological observatory in the seas at Kiel Fjord, Germany). New approaches of long-term monitoring of oxygen regime in the ocean observe online the behavior of fish and zooplankton, which changes drastically under reduced oxygen saturations (ecoSCOPE) and already at very low levels of water pollution.|$|E

40|$|Sources and {{mechanisms}} of nutrient transport in lawn irrigation <b>driven</b> <b>surface</b> runoff are largely unknown. We investigated {{the transport of}} nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in lawn irrigation <b>driven</b> <b>surface</b> runoff from a residential neighborhood (28 ha) of 56 % impervious and 44 % pervious areas. Pervious areas encompassing turfgrass (lawns) in the neighborhood were irrigated with the reclaimed water in common areas during the evening to late night and with the municipal water in homeowner's lawns during the morning. The stormwater outlet pipe draining the residential neighborhood was instrumented with a flow meter and Hach autosampler. Water samples were collected every 1 -h and triple composite samples were obtained at 3 -h intervals during an intensive sampling period of 1 -week. Mean concentrations, over 56 sampling events, of total N (TN) and total P (TP) in surface runoff at the outlet pipe were 10. 9 ± 6. 34 and 1. 3 ± 1. 03 mg L- 1, respectively. Of TN, the proportion of nitrate-N was 58 % and other-N was 42 %, whereas of TP, orthophosphate-P was 75 % and other-P was 25 %. Flow and nutrient (N and P) concentrations were lowest from 6 : 00 a. m. to noon, which corresponded {{with the use of}} municipal water and highest from 6 : 00 p. m. to midnight, which corresponded with the use of reclaimed water. This data suggests that N and P originating in lawn irrigation <b>driven</b> <b>surface</b> runoff from residential catchments is an important contributor of nutrients in surface waters...|$|R
5000|$|A multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt {{is made up}} of usually between 3 and 24 [...] "V" [...] shaped {{sections}} alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for {{the same}} <b>drive</b> <b>surface,</b> thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56 mm is commonly used for automotive applications.|$|E
50|$|Wind {{patterns}} {{associated with}} these circulation cells <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> currents which push the surface water to the higher latitudes where the air is colder. This cools the water down enough to where {{it is capable of}} dissolving more gasses and minerals, causing it to become very dense in relation to lower latitude waters, which in turn causes it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean, forming what is known as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) in the north and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in the south. Driven by this sinking and the upwelling that occurs in lower latitudes, as well as the driving force of the winds on surface water, the ocean currents act to circulate water throughout the entire ocean.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{extensive}} upwelling of colder sub-surface waters occurs, {{caused by}} the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> water {{to the right of}} the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current. This is the mechanism that produces California's characteristic coastal fog and cool ocean waters. As a result, ocean surf temperatures much colder along the Pacific coast than the Atlantic coast. For example, the average July SST (sea surface temperature) at New York City at 40.7 degrees latitude is 73 F, while at the same latitude in Eureka, CA is 57 F. As such, ocean surf temperatures are rarely above 66 F during the summer along the California coast south to San Diego, while they are often above 80 F on the east coast from North Carolina southward.|$|E

50|$|In the Red Sea {{detailed}} current data is lacking, {{partially because}} they are weak and variable both spatially and temporally. Temporal and spatial currents variation is as low as 0.5 m and are governed all by wind. During the summer, NW winds <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> water south for about four months at a velocity of 15-20 cm/s (6 - 8 in/s), whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow {{of water from the}} Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to {{the north end of the}} Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is between 50-60 cm/s (20 - 23.6 in/s) with a maximum of 1 m/s at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is 8-29 cm/s (3 - 11.4 in/s).|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study of electric field induced surface diffusion is presented. A stability analysis of conductive surfaces subjected to a normal uniform electric field shows that sufficiently strong electric fields can destabilize a flat surface, similar to strain induced surface evolution in strain mismatched semiconductor thin films. Further, electric field gradients such as those under a sharp electrode or in the fringe field in a capacitor can <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> diffusion, leading to nano-scale and micro-scale surface structure growth. Experiments are conducted on gold surfaces at elevated temperatures around 250 – 350 °C, subjected to electric fields {{of the order of}} 108 – 109 V/m.

30|$|Although {{sugar pine}} cones do not {{necessarily}} <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> fire dynamics throughout the forest, at small spatial scales they are locally abundant (Figure 1) and likely influence fire behavior and effects at such scales. Microtopography, down coarse woody debris, and the spatial arrangement of large diameter coneproducing trees cause the abundance of sugar pine cones {{on the forest floor}} to vary spatially. Accumulations of sugar pine cones that may increase the severity of surface fire locally could, for example, contribute to the small-scale (15 m to 20 m) spatial heterogeneity observed in these mixed-conifer forests (e.g., Larson and Churchill 2012, Lutz et al. 2012) through increased mortality of smaller trees. Fonda and Varner (2004) advanced a similar hypothesis, noting that cones of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine are frequently aggregated around tree bases and therefore may contribute to maintenance of a low-competition environment in the immediate tree neighborhood when they burn. Further study is warranted, given the vigorous burning characteristics of individual sugar pine cones in the laboratory, of spatial patterns of cone accumulation on the forest floor and the burning characteristics of aggregations of cones.|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric {{actuators}} {{are commonly}} used to drive high-precision stages. In this paper, a walking piezo actuator containing four piezoelectric legs is used to drive a high-precision nanomotion stage with constant velocity and point-to-point reference signals. The gain {{of the system is}} dependent on the momentary orientation of the piezo legs during the walking movement. The aim {{of this paper is to}} design a feedback controller that employs knowledge of the varying gain of the drive legs over one drive cycle. The gain variation is determined by a combination of local and global identification and modeling techniques. The excitation signal for the local frequency response function measurements at different positions of the legs in the drive cycle is designed to avoid stick [...] slip effects between the drive legs and the <b>drive</b> <b>surface</b> of the stage. Using the knowledge of the system variations, a linear parameter-varying model and a gain scheduling feedback controller are designed for the nanomotion stage.
