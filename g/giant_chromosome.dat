These chromosomes contain neocentromeres, which are able to bind the kinetochore proteins and to ensure a stable mitotic transmission although they do not show detectable alpha-satellite sequences. WDLPS is the sole solid tumor for which the presence of a neocentromere is a consistent and specific feature. By immunostaining with anti-centromere antibodies in combination with FISH analysis (immunoFISH) in four cases of WDLPS, we have shown that sequences from the region 12 q 14 - 21 region were not located at the neocentromere site. In addition, we have microdissected the neocentromeric region from a giant supernumerary chromosome in the 94 T 778 WDLPS cell line. By using immunoFISH and positional cloning we have shown that the neocentromere of this cell line originated from a region at 4 p 16. 1, rich in AT sequences and in long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) 1, that was co-amplified with 12 q 14 - 15.

40|$|The {{extremely}} {{rapid growth}} of feeding larvae of Calliphora is achieved with a hypertrophy of larval epidermal cells and concomitant polytene specialization of their nuclei. Within the epidermis of each abdominal segment are differentiated sense organs of the campaniform and a more complex- possibly chemosensory- kind in a constant pattern; there is no post-embryonic differentiation of new sense organs before metamorphosis, while the cuticle-secreting cell of these sense organs also becomes polytene. The polytene organization of epidermal nuclei differs from the classical <b>giant</b> <b>chromosome</b> structures of lower dipteran larval cells. Calliphora epidermal polytene chromosomes irregu-larly fragment into oligotene or smaller fibrils which, through apparently non-specific reasso-ciations, form a nuclear reticulum of which the banded polytene regions are a part. This loose reticular organization is unlikely to reflect a condition of genetic activity. Photometric densitometry shows the period of polytene DNA replication in general epidermal nuclei is closely correlated with the period of larval growth. At hatching, epidermal nuclei are diploid, with the 2 C DNA content. Through a series of endoreduplications, such that at any stage nuclei tend to fall {{into a series of}} DNA classes with a percentage falling in between, the largest polytene nuclei reach about 256 C {{by the end of the}} feeding stage. During the feeding stage, whole mount autoradiography shows a very slow continuation of DNA synthesis in some epidermal nuclei; that is, after cessation of larval growth. DNA synthesis in cupologen nuclei of the campaniform organs ceases after secretion of the third instar cuticle at the end of the second instar. The polytene cycle responsible for nuclear DNA increase is discussed in the context of these data, and a functional correlation drawn for the rate of polytene increase in the epidermal nuclei and the cupologen nuclei. This correlation suggests active control of the cycle, and raises the question of the significance of the polytene cell cycle...|$|E

40|$|Background: Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT), well {{differentiated}} liposarcoma (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) are cytogenetically {{characterized by}} near-diploid karyotypes with no or few other aberrations than supernumerary ring or <b>giant</b> marker <b>chromosomes,</b> although DDLS {{tend to have}} somewhat more complex rearrangements. In contrast, pleomorphic liposarcomas (PLS) have highly aberrant and heterogeneous karyotypes. The ring and <b>giant</b> marker <b>chromosomes</b> contain discontinuous amplicons, in particular including multiple copies of the target genes CDK 4, HMGA 2 and MDM 2 from 12 q, but often also sequences from other chromosomes. Results: The present study presents a DDLS with an atypical hypertriploid karyotype without any ring or <b>giant</b> marker <b>chromosomes.</b> SNP array analyses revealed amplification of almost the entire 5 p and discontinuous amplicons of 12 q including the classical target genes, in particular CDK 4. In addition, amplicons from 1 q, 3 q, 7 p, 9 p, 11 q and 20 q, covering from 2 to 14 Mb, were present. FISH analyses showed that sequences from 5 p and 12 q were scattered, separately or together, over more than 10 chromosomes of varying size. At RNA sequencing, significantly elevated expression, compared to myxoid liposarcomas, was seen for TRIO and AMACR in 5 p and of CDK 4, HMGA 2 and MDM 2 in 12 q. Conclusions: The observed pattern of scattered amplification does not show the characteristics of chromothripsis, but is novel and differs from the well known cytogenetic manifestations of amplification, i. e., double minutes, homogeneously staining regions and ring chromosomes. Possible explanations for this unusual distribution of amplified sequences might be the mechanism of alternative lengthening of telomeres that is frequently active in DDLS and events associated with telomere crisis...|$|R

Using high-speed laser microscopy, we followed the intranuclear trajectories of single mRNPs and characterized their motion within the nucleoplasm. The Balbiani ring (BR) mRNPs moved randomly, but unexpectedly, in a discontinuous manner. When mobile, they diffused with a diffusion coefficient corresponding to their size. Between mobile phases, the mRNPs were slowed down 10 -to 250 -fold but were never completely immobile.
