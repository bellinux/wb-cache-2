40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to offer some {{coordinates}} {{for the analysis of}} the impact of <b>film</b> <b>festivals</b> on cinema historiography. Although <b>film</b> <b>festivals</b> have had a pivotal role in film studies since the 1940 s in determining various aspects of research interests, both on a critical and theoretical level, it is only in recent years that they have gathered academic attention as an autonomous research field.

Therefore, this essay is conceived as a provisional contribution (which, obviously, doesn???t aim to fully cover the entire field) standing out as a first attempt at outlining the topic???s boundaries to try and set the parameters of further research.

To exemplify our theoretical statements, we refer to different kinds of <b>film</b> <b>festivals</b> and, more particularly, we make a few remarks about a very particular case, Il cinema ritrovato in Bologna...|$|R
