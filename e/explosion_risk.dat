25|$|Many gas-fed heating {{appliances}} such as ovens and water heaters {{make use of}} a pilot flame to ignite the main gas burner when required. If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an <b>explosion</b> <b>risk</b> and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a fail-safe circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple {{is placed in the}} pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.|$|E

50|$|As a refrigerant, {{isobutane}} has an <b>explosion</b> <b>risk</b> {{in addition}} to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Reports surfaced in late 2009 suggesting the use of isobutane as a refrigerant in domestic refrigerators was potentially dangerous. One refrigerator explosion reported in the United Kingdom was suspected to have been caused as a result of isobutane leaking into the refrigerator cabinet and being ignited by sparks in the electrical system. Although unclear how serious this could be, at the time this report came out it was estimated 300 million refrigerators worldwide use isobutane as a refrigerant.|$|E

Off-board regeneration is not suitable for on-road vehicles, except in situations where the vehicles are parked in a central depot when not in use. Off-board regeneration is mainly used in industrial and mining applications.

We propose the system-level design of a bias and readout system that directly measures the heat produced by the catalytic combustion. The proposed solution operates the sensor at a constant temperature via a feedback scheme that contains two thermal feedback loops. We chose a feedback control that uses pulse-density modulation, thus the proposed system implements a direct analog-to-digital conversion of the heat produced by the catalytic combustion. In practice, this mixed-signal front-end for pellistors is expected to extend the functionality and precision of the sensor while providing with a simple implementation...|$|R
3000|$|... 30 % H 2 O 2 is a {{compromise}} between efficiency and safety. In principle, a higher concentration of H 2 O 2 would of course be more efficient, since in heterogeneous catalysis the H 2 O diluent can compete with H 2 O 2 for active sites on the catalyst surface, and in homogeneous catalysis {{the rate of the}} oxidation step involving H 2 O 2 is proportional to its concentration. However, in concentrations higher than 30 % H 2 O 2 is unstable, even at refrigerator temperatures, which is why almost all suppliers limit the concentration to 30 %. Stability is not the only reason for this: at higher concentrations H 2 O 2 becomes a hazardous substance because of the <b>explosion</b> <b>risks</b> when mixed with organics. Below 30 %, the > 70 % water keeps the temperature increase upon an exothermal reaction with an organic within bounds and so lessens the risk of a thermal runaway.|$|R
