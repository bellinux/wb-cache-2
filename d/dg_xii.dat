The loss in flexural strength and the increase of water absorption has been evaluated on set of 5 specimens for each step of ageing. In the second test the tendency to expansion of the marbles placed in a water tank heated until 80 °C has been measured. The results show the influence of humidity on the loss of mechanical resistance of marble, but the different resistance to ageing among the same kind of stone (all calcite made) is strictly related to the habit of the crystals.

This paper gives {{a description of the}} project's experimental approach and an overview of the main results regarding the effects of agricultural practices (i. e. conventional, CT, versus reduced tillage, RT) on surface conditions affecting wind erosion, the mobilisation of soil particles in the saltation layer and the atmospheric emission of fine dust into the suspension layer. The characterisation of the soil surface showed that soil erodibility by wind under RT was lower than that under CT. Though strong Cierzo wind events occurred during the experimental period, only a limited amount of material was available for wind erosion mainly due to soil crusting, a common feature in the area. In spite of this, saltation transport flux was measured at CT plots for different erosion episodes. Also, significant vertical emission of dust was observed only in the CT plot. Finally, the sandblasting efficiency calculated in the present experiment could be interpreted {{as the result of a}} higher binding energy for the particles of the silt loam experimental soil compared to soils with a lighter texture.

In recent years interest in the checking and verification of the effectiveness of publicly supported research and development (R&D) has grown. At the same time, the evaluation of R&D programmes has frequently become more difficult, as the goals are increasingly becoming qualitative, objectives may be altered in the course of the programme, and possible results - e. g. in basic research, - may not be foreseeable in advance. The study has the following aims: an overview of the use of verifiable objectives in publicly supported R&D in the USA, Japan, selected countries in the EC and in Eastern Europe; an ex ante, ongoing and ex post analysis of their use; a classification and various approaches, their application and an evaluation of their possible usefulness for R&D programmes of the EC Commission.

The palaeoflood record, with more than 80 flood events, shows clusters of floods at specific periods from 9440 to 9210 14 Cyr BP (8540 – 8110 BC), 8500 to 8000 14 Cyr BP (7500 – 7000 BC), 6750 14 Cyr BP (5000 BC), 1200 to 950 14 Cyr BP (AD 785 – 1205), 410 14 Cyr BP (AD 1450 – 1500), 170 to 80 14 Cyr BP (AD 1670 – 1950). The largest flood(s) occurred during the periods 9440 to 9210 14 Cyr BP, 6750 14 Cyr BP and 1200 to 950 14 Cyr BP reaching minimum discharge estimates of between 4000 and 4100 m 3 s− 1 in the El Puente del Arzobispo reach and 13, 700 – 15, 000 m 3 s− 1 in the Alcántara reach. These periods with increased flood magnitude and/or frequency in the Tagus River are strongly related to increased moisture influx and winter precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula, especially in the western zone. Proxy records sensitive to winter precipitation such as lake levels and vegetation changes (indicated by pollen records) are in good agreement with the clusters of floods found in the Tagus River. This flood variability seems to correspond to changes in the prevailing atmospheric circulation pattern affecting the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|LIM {{homeodomain}} genes {{have been}} involved in patterning in a variety of organisms. I have analyzed the expression of lmx 1 during early ear development and explored its regulation by the neuroectoderm. Experiments were carried out on chick embryos. During early somitic stages (4 - 6 somites), lmx 1 was expressed in the neural tube and in a stripe of the dorsal ectoderm. The ectodermal expression domain was then restricted to the otic placode (7 - 10 somites). At otic cup stages, lmx 1 was downregulated in ventral and medial aspects of the otic epithelium facing the neural tube. This resulted in a dorsal and lateral restriction of lmx 1 that persisted until the otic vesicle stage. The dependence of lmx 1 on interactions with the neuroectoderm was explored by carrying out ablations of the neural tube in organotypic explants containing the otic presumptive ectoderm. Both the formation of the otic vesicle and expression of lmx 1 were dependent on the presence of the neural ectoderm during stages preceding placode formation (4 - 6 somites). Thereafter, the formation of the otic vesicle was progressively autonomous, and by the stage of 10 somites the otic ectoderm developed into otic vesicles and expressed lmx 1 in foreign environments. Dorsal and ventral neuroectoderms displayed differential effects on lmx 1 expression. Ablation of the dorsal neural tube resulted in a reduced expression of lmx 1, which was more dramatic during early placode and preplacode stages (5 - 7 somites). Removal of the ventral aspect of the neural tube (including the notochord) had opposite effects, expression of lmx 1 increased, and its domain expanded. The formation of the otic vesicle, however, was supported by either the dorsal or ventral neuroectoderm. The experiments suggest that lmx 1 is involved in early patterning of the otic vesicle, and they provide evidence for the regional segregation of organizing activities within the neural tube.

It is shown that the contribution of large target photon virtualities is significant. The data presented can serve as a cross-check of the photon structure function F 2 γ analyses and help in refining existing parameterizations.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{sedimentology}} of high-stage flood deposits, with {{the definition of}} sedimentary environments and their characteristic sequences, along two bedrock reaches of the Tagus River (Central Spain). High-stage flood deposits accumulated in bedrock canyons include slackwater flood deposits (SWD) {{and other types of}} deposits located at flow separation zones and associated with slow-moving flow (< 1 m s− 1). These flood deposits are common indirect indicators of flood stages used in palaeoflood studies for estimating the discharges associated with Quaternary floods. Depositional environments of flood deposits include (1) channel widening, (2) canyon expansion, (3) bedrock obstacles, and (4) backflooded areas along tributary streams. These flood deposits can be found associated with other non-fluvial environments, namely aeolian reworked and slope washflow facies. Channel widening, due to flood stage variations, comprises internal and external zones of the channel margins, and their characteristic sequences contain similar facies to those of alluvial floodplains. Canyon expansion environments favour vertical accretion of slackwater units and the development of flood deposit benches, which contain four sequences related to bench elevation and distance from the channel's main thread of flow. At the lee side of bedrock obstacles, characteristic sedimentary sequences are dominated by reverse flow structures (e. g. climbing ripples migrating upstream) due to eddies with a high sand concentration. Flood deposits located within tributary mouths contain typical sequences of reworked floodplain deposits. Backflooding of tributaries during flood stages produces deposition from suspension of sand, silt and clay within three sequences characterised by non-structure or parallel lamination and intense bioturbation. A better understanding of the flood deposit sequences may contribute to the characterisation of flood magnitudes and flood hydraulics and can also be applied to some ancient depositional environments.

40|$|In {{the frame}} of the joint project, financed by the Commission of the European Union <b>DG</b> <b>XII,</b> the German Ministry of Research and Technology and the Portuguese Ministry of Industry and Energy, a PV plant of 15 kWp has been {{constructed}} and set up {{on the site of the}} University Lisbon for demonstration and testing of different supply concepts. The BMFT programme has included the extension of the PV stand-alone plant by a 5 kWp solar generator and the setting up of the whole system for research and experimental purposes. Such a test and experimentation facility allows the performance of different PV systems to be examined in every detail. Reliable systems for typical PV applications have been designed and installed, such as the formation of AC stand-alone grids, the supply of general purpose drives and water systems, all of which are very well-suited for Third World countries. Furthermore, concepts for operational control systems have been developed to achieve the optimum use of PV energy and to control the power flow in an efficient way. By considering the current trends in industrial automation, hardware concepts have been used, which are tailor-made for the power units. In conclusion the Multi-Purpose-Plant is an all-round technical solution, which may be applied in various PV supply situations to meet the power-performance requirements of different consumers.

SCI 01 30 -C (SMA). The purpose of this Symposium will be the presentation of both the results obtained during this project (papers of the Science program), and other selected relevant research that contributes to a European approach to road pavement design (papers outside the Science program). AIMS OF THE SCIENCE PROJECT The enormous increase of heavy traffic on roads, the need to economically use local materials {{and the availability of}} new road construction techniques all require the development of more effective pavement design methods than are available using current empirical techniques. Such methods require a rational study of the mechanical behaviour of the constituent materiais and sou, more rigorous structural analysis, and appropriate analysis to match the actual pavement behaviout The construction and maintenance of flexible pavements of light and moderately trafficked roads in Europe and in developing countries are often uneconomical owing to defective understanding of the mechanical properties of pavement materiais and foundation soils. This may lead to either overdesign, or underdesign and hence to early failure of the pavement. As the European Community member countries are the largest importers of bitumen in the world, improved knowledge about unbound granular materiais and sou subgrade will provide a marked reduction in the construction and maintenance cost of bituminous pavements. In Europe {{there is a need for}} cooperation between different laboratories in this work. This Science project aims to coordinate and harmonize the activities of the different laboratories working in this field. The reliability of a structural method of road design depends on a mathematical model and on the quality of data with respect to the mechanical properties of the pavement materiais and subgrade. Such properties (resilient and plastic) need to be detennined by laboratory means and this has traditionally been through cyclic loading triaxial tests that can closely simuiate structure. The suitability and/or limitations of the testing approach require investigation as the reliability of the pavement design depends upon it. THE SYMPOSIUM The Symposium embraced a wide scope of experimental and analytical research with respect to foundation and pavement design. For this purpose the Symposium has been divided nito five sessions: Sessions 1 and 2 have been devoted to the experimental detennination and mathematical modelling of stress-strain behaviour of subgrade soils and unbound granular materiais; Sessions 3 and 4 covered the non-linear pavement analysis and the pavement design. An emphasis is done to the harmonization of experimental methods. In addition to these sessions related with the Science program a Session 5 about monitoring and performance of flexible pavements was inciuded, which contains only papers outside the Science program. These contributions wili greatly assist with the worldwide improvement iii standards for testing subgrade soils and unbound granular materiais and for flexible pavement design. The future chailenge will be implementing this experience to a larger cooperation between European research organizations...|$|E
40|$|Senior {{livestock}} policy {{advisers and}} experts {{as well as}} scientists {{in the field of}} animal production and livestock services in 21 Eastern and Southern African countries, as well as representatives of European and international livestock institutions, research organizations and donor agencies took part in a seminar on Livestock development policies in Eastern and Southern Africa from 28 July to 1 August 1997 in Mbabane, Swaziland. The seminar was organized by CTA in collaboration with the OAU/IBAR (Organization of African Unity/Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives of Swaziland, with scientific support from the European Commission (DG VII and <b>DG</b> <b>XII)</b> and the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR). This was CTA's second seminar on livestock development policies, and built on the experience gained during a similar seminar held in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, in February 1996. The focus then was on the humid and sub-humid zones of West and Central Africa, while the Mbabane seminar looked at Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA). The results of the week-long seminar were summarized in 52 recommendations to strengthen the policy dialogue and promote livestock development in ESA. The seminar highlighted the lack of specific livestock policies in some countries of the region as the major constraint to development. Accordingly, the highest priority was given to building capacity in each country to develop appropriate policies, formulate strategies and evaluate their impacts. The main recommendation for each government was that clearly defined livestock policies be formulated, as well as detailed national strategies and investment plans {{for the development of the}} livestock sector. At the same time, it was recommended that each country review all existing policies that may have negative effects on agricultural development such as inappropriate subsidies, taxation on agricultural inputs, price controls that favoured consumers, non-sustainable services like free dipping, liberal importation of livestock and livestock products and communal land ownership. Participants decided that in general governments should reduce their participation in production and marketing of livestock and livestock products, and should support the trend towards privatization in animal health delivery systems, as well as private land ownership and investment. Delegates also emphasized as a matter of urgency, the need to implement livestock development programmes which give specific attention to the identification, characterization and documentation of existing Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR), as well as programmes, including research, for their improvement, increased use and conservation, and impact assessments to ensure that the importation of foreign germplasm did not adversely affect indigenous AnGR. To promote trade at regional level, it was recommended that countries harmonize import and export regulations, as well as policies on standards. In addition, regional policies need to be established to allow for effective free flow of quality information among countries, not only to promote trade but also break the isolation of professionals in various countries. In this connection, delegates felt that international policies should be established to stimulate North-South professional linkages. After the seminar, the recommendations of the Mbabane and Côte d'Ivoire seminars were consolidated into one set of recommendations for an environment more conducive to livestock development in Sub-Saharan African. This was submitted to the OAU Fifth Conference of Ministers Responsible for Animal Resources, which met in Mbabane in the week following the ESA seminar. seminar on Livestock development policies in Eastern and Southern Africa from 28 July to 1 August 1997 in Mbabane, Swazilan...|$|E

Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} identified 32 loci influencing body mass index, but this measure does not distinguish lean from fat mass. To identify adiposity loci, we meta-analyzed associations between 2. 5 million SNPs and {{body fat percentage}} from 36, 626 individuals and followed up the 14 most significant (P < 10 − 6) independent loci in 39, 576 individuals. We confirmed a previously established adiposity locus in FTO (P = 3 × 10 − 26) and identified two new loci associated with body fat percentage, one near IRS 1 (P = 4 × 10 − 11) and one near SPRY 2 (P = 3 × 10 − 8). Both loci contain genes with potential links to adipocyte physiology. Notably, the body-fat–decreasing allele near IRS 1 is associated with decreased IRS 1 expression and with an impaired metabolic profile, including an increased visceral to subcutaneous fat ratio, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease and decreased adiponectin levels. Our findings provide new insights into adiposity and insulin resistance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs), {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs), and thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) {{all have}} a familial predisposition. Given that aneurysm types are known to co-occur, we hypothesized {{that there may be}} shared genetic risk factors for IAs, AAAs, and TAAs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a mega-analysis of 1000 Genomes Project-imputed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of 4 previously published aneurysm cohorts: 2 IA cohorts (in total 1516 cases, 4305 controls), 1 AAA cohort (818 cases, 3004 controls), and 1 TAA cohort (760 cases, 2212 controls), and observed associations of 4 known IA, AAA, and/or TAA risk loci (9 p 21, 18 q 11, 15 q 21, and 2 q 33) with consistent effect directions in all 4 cohorts. We calculated polygenic scores based on IA-, AAA-, and TAA-associated SNPs and tested these scores for association to case-control status in the other aneurysm cohorts; this revealed no shared polygenic effects. Similarly, linkage disequilibrium-score regression analyses did not show significant correlations between any pair of aneurysm subtypes. Last, we evaluated the evidence for 14 previously published aneurysm risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms through collaboration in extended aneurysm cohorts, with a total of 6548 cases and 16   843 controls (IA) and 4391 cases and 37   904 controls (AAA), and found nominally significant associations for IA risk locus 18 q 11 near RBBP 8 to AAA (odds ratio [OR]= 1. 11; P= 4. 1 × 10 (- 5)) and for TAA risk locus 15 q 21 near FBN 1 to AAA (OR= 1. 07; P= 1. 1 × 10 (- 3)). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no evidence for polygenic overlap between IAs, AAAs, and TAAs, we found nominally significant effects of two established risk loci for IAs and TAAs in AAAs. These two loci will require further replication. van ’t Hof is supported by a grant of the Dutch Heart Foundation (NHS; Project No. 2008 B 004).
