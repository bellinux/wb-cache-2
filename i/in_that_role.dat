40|$|Global {{software}} development surfaces various challenges and benefits {{that are not}} always present in co-located teams. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore a set of propositions that address the suitability of four different {{software development}} roles to Global software development (GSD). A qualitative research approach was applied to collaborations undertaken between remote counterparts playing the same development role in various GSD projects. Specific development roles were considered: business analyst, designer, developer and development-support. A framework that details the benefits and challenges of GSD was used as a basis for this research. Suitability of a role to GSD is based upon the balance of challenges and benefits discovered <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>role’s</b> case. Finally, opportunities for future research are presented...|$|R
