Winter spent the {{majority}} of her childhood in England, but returned to Calcutta in 1858 {{at the age of}} sixteen to work for the Union Society for the Propagation of Gospel (USPG). She was sent to Calcutta to spread the word of the Gospel amongst the Indian women. This work was known as zenana work, where the missionaries went to the home of native women in order to convert them to Christianity. While working on Zenana missions, Winter wrote that, [...] "Women in India get no relief from suffering... because the medicine man takes them in hand and his remedies are the crudest." [...] Winter attempted to mediate the medical issues in Calcutta by [...] "distributing simple remedies to all classes of Hindu women," [...] who she described as [...] "confined to the purdah." [...] While in Calcutta, Winter realized that the local women's only time out of the purdah was when they went to the river to pray, a concept that she would later use to advance her <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> to females. In 1863, Winter married Reverend Robert Winter, the head of the USPG operation in Delhi, and moved to Delhi with him. In Delhi, Winter began medical work on the Yamuna river with a [...] "box" [...] of medical samples. Winter was not a trained doctor or nurse but rather described herself as a person responding to the needs of women in the area. In 1864, cholera epidemics broke out in Delhi. During this time, Winter was able to observe the dramatic effect that illness had on the population of Delhi, specifically the tole it took on women.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a qualitative study in which the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) was used to analyze deregulation of the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> in Denmark in October 2001. The study is based on qualitative methods, and it examines the policy process between 1996 and 2001. Data sources were documents and qualitative interviews. The results show that minor modifications of the ACF are needed to make it fully applicable {{to the case of}} pharmacy policy, especially when the policy process proceeds in a predominantly corporatist state. We found that the policy process was framed by two coalitions advocating different belief systems. One coalition wanted the pharmacy sector to be controlled by the state, the other wanted a full-scale liberalization. Throughout the process there was a general shift in policy core beliefs among the actors involved [...] moving from positively disposed towards a market-oriented reform to being more negatively disposed towards such a reform. We argue that two factors contributed to this. First, as the discussions about a reform became more specific, technical matters began to influence the actors. Second, the legitimacy of a solution which did not alter the regulation of the pharmacy sector radically, was reinforced by institutionalized norms that made politicians take onboard pharmacy professionals' concerns.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 29). Opsonin Pharma Limited is a private limited company. Opsonin is committed to improve its position continuously as a Leading Pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh and strengthen its global presence. Opsonin creates value for its customers and other stakeholders by providing highest quality health care solutions through appropriate application and development of resources and processes.. Its main market is in Southeast Asia Africa Eastern Asia. It is involved with manufacturing, distributing and wholesaling. Main products of Opsonin Pharma includes Antihistamines, vitamins and minerals, NSAIDS, Antispasmodics, Corticosteroids, Laxatives, Expectorants, Analgesics, Antiprotozoals, and Anti-diarrhoeals. Opsonin Pharma Limited is renowned for its outstanding product quality, world class manufacturing facilities, product development capabilities and unparalleled services. Environment, health and safety {{are an integral part}} of Opsonin’s corporate responsibility. As a pharmaceutical company, they improve health not only through the production and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>medicine</b> to our consumers, but also through our commitment to protect the environment, health and safety of our co workers and the communities where they operate. My internship report on Opsonin Pharma Limited is to study performance evaluation practice of the company finding lacking and corrective actions. In this consideration I have presented the existing practice. Base on Key result area performance of employees is evaluated by the departmental heads. Performance evaluation form is circulated at the end of the year. Form is filled up both the apprise and appraiser. There is a scoring where A (90 and above) stands for outstanding performance. All functional head forward performance appraisal form to HRD. Then HRD summaries the evaluation and make a promotion and upgradation committee. The committee decides the employees entitled for promotion and upgradation. In the performance evaluation of Opsonin Pharma Ltd. I have the following findings:  Though Opsonin Pharma Limited has well-structured policies and procedures for performance evaluation but there are some lacking in the area of setting KRA (Key result area) and properly evaluating employees by the departmental heads.  Though there is a provision for weightage in key performance areas but it is not being implemented due to lack of coordination. Say for example, commercial departments tasks is delayed by non-cooperation of other functional areas. As a result they are not interested to set fix any time frame base on which performance can be evaluated.  Within the fixed time frame performance evaluation is not done due to lack of coordination from other departments that should be improved.  Opsonin Pharma has no formal (written) vision, mission and goals and Organizational Objectives that is a serious issue to be defined. In this regard I have the following recommendation: For evaluating performance properly Opsonin Pharma Should take initiative to redesign job structure as well as Job description, Specification. Opsonin should introduce vision, mission, goals and organization objectives of the organization. After setting organizational objectives we should introduce departmental objectives which will help us to define Key result area. After setting KRA weight should be given and then proper monitoring of an incumbents responsibility should be done through the departmental Heads. Departmental Head should properly introduce with the performance evaluation, setting KPI aligned with the organizational objectives. Md. Samauz ZohaM. Business Administratio...|$|E
