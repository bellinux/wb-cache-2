Pyrolysis experiments were performed using a plug flow reactor at 170 kPa, over the temperature range 913 - 1133 K at residence times of approximately 0. 5 and 0. 2 s, with 90 % and 96 % N- 2 dilution, respectively. THP combustion was investigated in two premixed <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burners</b> and in a shock tube. The first premixed flame burner was operated at 6. 7 kPa and was used to study detailed flame structures. Two equivalence ratios (1. 0 and 1. 3) were investigated with a 78 % argon dilution. Ethylene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde, and acrolein {{were the most important}} intermediates at both pyrolysis and combustion conditions, while the yield of aromatic species was negligible under flame conditions. Laminar burning velocities of THP-air mixtures using the heat flux method were measured at 298, 358 and 398 K and equivalence ratios from 0. 55 to 1. 50. Finally, ignition delay times of THP-oxygen-argon mixtures were measured behind reflected shock waves at temperatures from 1350 to 1613 K, pressures from 885 to 914 kPa and mixtures containing 0. 15 - 1 % fuel at equivalence ratios between 0. 5 and 2. 0. A new detailed kinetic model for the THP pyrolysis/combustion was developed by EX-GAS, complemented with theoretical calculations for the determining reactions. Good agreements between simulations and acquired experimental data were observed. Reaction path analysis shows that THP is mainly consumed by H-abstractions at both pyrolysis and combustion conditions. The pyrolysis simulations are very sensitive to the unimolecular initiations involving C-C and C-O bond fissions, whereas these reactions play only a very minor role under combustion conditions...|$|E

40|$|A premixed, staged, down-fired, {{pulverized}} coal reactor and a <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> {{were used to}} study the evolution of nitrogen in coal contrasting differences in air and oxy-combustion. In the premixed reactor, the oxidizer was staged to produce a fuel rich zone followed by a burnout zone. The initial nominal fuel rich zone stoichiometric ratio (S. R.) of 0. 85 selected produced higher NO reductions in the fuel rich region under oxy-combustion conditions. Air {{was found to be}} capable of similar NO reductions when the fuel rich zone was at a much lower S. R. of 0. 65. At a S. R. of 0. 85, oxy-combustion was measured to have higher CO, unburned hydrocarbons, HCN and NH{sub 3 } in the fuel rich region than air at the same S. R. There was no measured difference in the initial formation of NO. The data suggest devolatilization and initial NO formation is similar for the two oxidizers when flame temperatures are the same, but the higher CO{sub 2 } leads to higher concentrations of CO and nitrogen reducing intermediates at a given equivalence ratio which increases the ability of the gas phase to reduce NO. These results are supported by <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> experiments which show devolatilization of nitrogen from the coal and char to be similar for air and oxy-flame conditions at a given temperature. A model of premixed combustion containing devolatilization, char oxidation and detailed kinetics captures most of the trends seen in the data. The model suggests CO is high in oxy-combustion because of dissociation of CO{sub 2 }. The model also predicts a fraction (up to 20 %, dependent on S. R.) of NO in air combustion can be formed via thermal processes with the source being nitrogen from the air while in oxy-combustion equilibrium drives a reduction in NO of similar magnitude. The data confirm oxy-combustion is a superior oxidizer to air for NO control because NO reduction can be achieved at higher S.

40|$|The {{production}} of syngas from hydrocarbons {{is an important}} part of the hydrogen infrastructure. Previous experimental studies have shown that rich mixtures of methane, heptane, and ethanol are successfully converted to syngas in non-catalytic heat recirculating reactors but existing models fail to predict the efficiency of the conversion. Although the reactor designs vary, the primary feature is the recirculation of exhaust heat to preheat the reactants such that the flammability limits are extended and the burning rate is increased. Detailed modeling of these reactors, however, is complicated by the complex heat transfer processes. To understand modeling deficiencies, we are beginning an investigation of the conversion of rich mixtures of methane in a relatively simple <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> with externally preheated reactants. The goal of this initial investigation with methane is to determine the similarity between the two burners that we use (an actively cooled McKenna burner and a ceramic matrix burner) and the computational model and to determine the effect of preheating on the expansion of the operating conditions of the ceramic burner.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of the rate of release of alkalis from coal/coal blends as they are burnt in Utility Boilers with the aim of {{evolving}} better models of the effect of given fuel blends on slagging and fouling in real boiler situations. Although numerous slagging and fouling indices have been evolved over many years to describe the behaviour of coals in given boiler situations they often fail to give the required results and prove to be of little use when co-firing blends of coal with biomass materials. In this work we have constructed a natural gas <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> with associated furnace and viewing ports so we can use a PLIF system to look at the evolution of sodium from burning coal/coal blend particles and relate this to the condition of the ash in the burning coal particle as the ash particle reaches the region of the superheater tubes in a boiler. By appropriate adjustment of the air fuel ratio we can produce temperature/residence time distributions downstream of the <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner</b> and in the furnace section which closely parallel those found in Utility Boilers. Pulverised coal particles as produced for boiler firing are sieved into two fractions, those in the size range 67 to 37 microns and above 67 microns (virtually no residue was found below 37 microns). This was to ensure that the finer fraction had a narrow size distribution, which devolatilised and burnt in a time frame commensurate with that of our system Particle velocities could be readily measured by streak velocity using the available PLIF camera via their radiation signal produced from their combustion process. The camera was aligned such that the initial devolatilisation process was not observed as the associated radiation could mask the PLIF image; this proved to be satisfactory as significant sodium evolution did not occur until {{after the end of the}} devolatilisation process. PLIF images of the sodium evolution were generated via excitation of the D₂ line at 16960. 95 cm⁻¹ with collection via a gated intensified CCD camera (Princeton Instruments ICCD- 576). Four groups of images (500 images per set) were generated and collected at each setting to ensure accuracy of results, with a polarisation filter to minimize interference from Mie scattering with the sodium fluorescence. Novel results have thus been produced which will allow the evolution of better models for predicting slagging and fouling, especially when the work is extended to other volatile species in coal ash.

40|$|Planar laser induced {{fluorescence}} (PLIF) {{is used by}} the Combustion Branch at the NASA Glenn Research Center (NASA Glenn) {{to assess}} the characteristics of the flowfield produced by aircraft fuel injectors. To improve and expand the capabilities of the PLIF system new equipment was installed. The new capabilities of the modified PLIF system are assessed by collecting OH PLIF in a methane/air flame produced by a <b>flat</b> <b>flame</b> <b>burner.</b> Specifically, the modifications characterized are the addition of an injection seeder to a Nd:YAG laser pumping an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and the use of a new camera with an interline CCD. OH fluorescence results using the injection seeded OPO laser are compared to results using a Nd:YAG pumped dye laser with ultraviolet extender (UVX). Best settings of the new camera for maximum detection of PLIF signal are reported for the controller gain and microchannel plate (MCP) bracket pulsing. Results are also reported from tests of the Dual Image Feature (DIF) mode of the new camera which allows image pairs to be acquired in rapid succession. This allows acquisition of a PLIF image and a background signal almost simultaneously. Saturation effects in the new camera were also investigated and are reported...|$|R
