The leakage inductanceand resistance of the rotor parts are different from normal values because of the oxidation process. The impedance variations modify the current density and magnetic flux which pass through the oxidized parts. Consequently, it causes the rotor asymmetry which induces abnormal harmonics in the stator current spectra of the faulty machine. The leakage inductances of the oxidation models are derived by the Ampere's law. Using the proposed oxidation models, the rotor bar and end ring faults in progress can be modeled and simulated with the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). In addition, the oxidation process of the rotor bar and end ring segment can motivate the rotor asymmetry, which is induced by electromagnetic imbalances, {{and it is one}} of the major motor faults.

40|$|Insulated gate bipolar {{transistors}} (IGBT) have evolved significantly and become exceedingly fast. Today, their typical switching speeds {{are of the}} order of 100 ns. The resulting dv/dt is considerably large and when employed in a variable speed motor <b>drive</b> <b>inverter,</b> ringing over-voltages occur at the motor terminals even with cable as short as 1 meter in length. In any such power converter system, protection of IGBT {{in the event of a}} fault is an essential requirement. An effective way of protection is by detecting IGBT de-saturation, which occurs during device over-current or short-circuit, using sensed collector-emitter voltage (V-CE). Several commercial isolated gate-driver ICs are available today in the market with integrated V-CE de-saturation protection feature. Such a protection scheme when employed in a modern IGBT based power converter and used for motor drive applications can lead to spurious trips. This paper investigates and reports the reasons for such spurious fault sensing by IGBT gate-drivers employed in two-level inverters. The circuit conditions are analyzed and it is shown that the IGBTs essentially act as capacitors while switching low currents. This behavior in combination with other factors such as fast device switching times, load power factor, and dead-time, is shown to cause spurious V-CE fault trips. Two simple and cost-effective circuit modifications are suggested which ensure that such spurious fault sensing is avoided in power converters...|$|E
