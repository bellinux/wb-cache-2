40|$|A {{new method}} of random data {{analysis}} {{has been developed}} with special implications for membrane noise. The integral spectrometer uses overlapping broad-band filters of simple design, whose bandwidth increases linearly with center frequency. A random two-state process, which has a Lorentzian-shaped spectral density, results in an <b>integral</b> <b>spectrum</b> whose maximum value occurs at the mean frequency of the events, and which is symmetric about that frequency on a semilog plot. 1 /f noise is flat and does not distort the symmetry on the frequency axis. The <b>integral</b> <b>spectrum</b> exchanges resolution on the frequency axis for accuracy in the amplitude. The expected statistical error in amplitude has been calculated for three types of membrane noise assuming finite data. The <b>integral</b> <b>spectrum</b> compares favorably with conventional spectral densities and may be a reasonable alternative for random data analysis...|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} Bieberbach {{conjecture}} {{in the framework}} of SLE processes and, more generally, Lévy processes. The study of their unbounded whole-plane versions leads to a discrete series of exact results for the expectations of coefficients and their variances, and, more generally, for the derivative moments of some prescribed order p. These results are generalized to the m-fold conformal maps of whole-plane SLEs or Lévy-Loewner Evolutions (LLEs). We also study the (averaged) <b>integral</b> means multifractal <b>spectra</b> of these unbounded whole-plane SLE curves. We prove the existence of a phase transition at a certain moment order, at which one goes from the bulk SLE expected <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum,</b> as established by Beliaev and Smirnov, to a new <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum.</b> The latter is furthermore shown to be intimately related, via the associated packing spectrum, to radial SLE derivative exponents, and to local SLE tip multifractal exponents obtained from quantum gravity.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of an {{observation}} of Cygnus X- 1 with INTEGRAL, that we combine with simultaneous radio observations with the Ryle telescope. Both spectral and variability properties of the source indicate that Cygnus X- 1 was in an Intermediate State. The <b>INTEGRAL</b> <b>spectrum</b> shows a high-energy cut-off or break around 100 keV. The shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermal Comptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higher energies. The average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonisation models. During the 4 day long observation the source showed an important spectral and flux variability. A principal component analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2 independent modes. The first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosity on time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikingly uncorrelated with the variable radio flux. We interpret this variability mode as variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. The second variability mode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts on a longer time-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens {{in the first part of}} the observation and then softens again. This pivoting pattern is strongly correlated with the radio (15 GHz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when the <b>INTEGRAL</b> <b>spectrum</b> is harder. We propose that the pivoting mode represents a 'mini' state transition from a nearly High Soft State to a nearly Low Hard State, and back. This mini-transition would be caused by changes in the soft cooling photons flux in the hot Comptonising plasma associated with an increase of the temperature of the accretion disc. The jet power then appears to be anti-correlated with the disc luminosity and unrelated to the coronal power.

Above 20 keV with IBIS/ISGRI, we find that the source is point-like, and the cluster could be detected up to 120 keV. From the broad-band ISGRI/JEM-X spectrum, although we detect a non-thermal component, we find that the high-energy flux is variable and is consistent with the extrapolation of the 2 - 10 keV flux of the central AGN, NGC 1275.

The interval of fi-variations (0 : 47 ! fi ! 1) is characteristic of UV-Cet stars. The maximum energy of the X-ray flares does not exceed 10 32 erg. Solar flares are the process of rapid release of significant energy. In recent years similar flare processes were observed for red dwarfs (UV-Cet stars) (Krasnobabtsev and Gershberg, 1976). The investigations carried out for the UV Cet type stars during the 70 -ies made it possible to suggest the similarity of the flare activity mechanisms for the red dwarf stars (RDS) and for the Sun.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{consists of two}} parts. The main subject {{of the first three}} chapters is the <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum</b> of a conformal function f mapping the unit disc onto any bounded domain of the complex plain. The <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum</b> of f is defined by          betaf(p) = limsup log (int |f'(z) |p |dz|) / -log(1 -r) with a limes for r going to 1 and the integral for |z|=r. It measures the average growth of the derivative of f aproaching the boundary. The course of the universal <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum</b> B(p) defined as the supremum of betaf over all bounded univalent functions is not entirely known. The author conjectured in [Complex Variables 31 (1996) ] that B(p) = p 2 / 4 for |p| < 2. The first three chapters introduce conformal maps constructed by using complex dynamics, the theory of lacunary series as well as geometric fractals as given by the snowflake. These functions are considered to have fast growing integral means. Numerical results are presented. The objective is to obtain lower bounds for the conjectured course of the universal <b>integral</b> means <b>spectrum.</b> Best results are achieved with functions having an image domain bounded by the Julia set of a quadratic polynomial. The fourth chapter deals with an other issue. We consider the trajectories of quadratic differentials and first give some well known results of their local behaviour. After that we develop an algorithm to compute precisely the trajectories for rational quadratic differentials. The regularisation of a quadratic differential near poles and zeroes of the function {{plays a key role in}} the algorithm.
