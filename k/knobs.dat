5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal <b>knobs</b> may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal <b>knobs</b> were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal <b>knobs,</b> and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E

5|$|The gandingan {{is usually}} played while {{standing}} behind the instrument with the gandingan player holding two wooden mallets. The mallets, called balu, are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber {{at one end and}} are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing <b>knobs</b> of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the <b>knobs</b> to achieve a sound.|$|E

5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill <b>knobs</b> on the ulna. Quill <b>knobs</b> are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with <b>knobs</b> called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E
5|$|More recently, the {{discovery}} of Zhenyuanlong established {{the presence of a}} full feathered coat in relatively large dromaeosaurs. Additionally, the animal displays proportionally large, aerodynamic wing feathers, as well as a tail-spanning fan, both of which are unexpected traits that may offer an understanding of the integument of large dromaeosaurs. Dakotaraptor is an even larger dromaeosaur species with evidence of feathers, albeit indirect in the form of quill <b>knobs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the <b>knobs</b> on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and <b>knobs</b> are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, Mayor Cornelius Devennel {{ordered all}} closet doors be {{equipped}} with special <b>knobs</b> that can open easily from both inside and outside. This order was made mandatory for all new home constructions or reconstructions. A ceremony in her memory {{was held at the}} St. Francis de Sales Church that same day.

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating <b>knobs</b> positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} 'Pachycephalosaurus' is poorly known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony <b>knobs</b> and short bony spikes projected upwards from the snout. The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} dromaeosaurid with {{definitive}} evidence of feathers was Sinornithosaurus, reported from China by Xu et al. in 1999. Many other dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been found}} with feathers covering their bodies, some with fully developed feathered wings. Microraptor even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs. While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence of feathers {{by the presence of}} quill <b>knobs,</b> the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill <b>knobs,</b> showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found. In light of this, it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore feathers, since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like Velociraptor, are known to have retained pennaceous feathers. Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery of feathers in Velociraptor specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained feathers.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the gongs {{themselves}} are still disputed by scholars. It is likely, as observed by Thomas Forrest, a British explorer, that gongs without <b>knobs</b> on them (like the gandingan) came from China. However, other sources suggest the gandingan came to the Philippines via Indonesia or Malaysian Sarawak due to similar gandingan-type instruments found among the Tausug of Sulu.|$|E

40|$|A simple, effective, easy-to-use device locks {{a control}} <b>knob</b> {{in a set}} position. In the initial {{application}} for which this device was conceived, the control <b>knob</b> to be locked {{is that of a}} needle valve.

After attachment of the wire, it was still possible to turn the <b>knob</b> somewhat. In contrast, a single technician using the present device can secure the <b>knob</b> in the desired position. in about 30 seconds, and the <b>knob</b> cannot thereafter be turned, even in the presence of harsh vibrations, which occur during space shuttle launch. The device includes a special-purpose clamp that fits around the control <b>knob</b> and its shaft and that can be tightened onto the <b>knob,</b> without turning the <b>knob,</b> by means of two thumbscrews. The end of the device opposite the clamp is a tang that contains a slot that, in turn, engages a bolt that protrudes from the panel on which the control <b>knob</b> and its shaft are mounted...|$|R
