5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 1969. Plutonium, {{used to construct}} the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate pondcrete vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.|$|E
5|$|Pub – The White Horse in {{the village}} centre is a popular pub across the island.

Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to augment the current {{knowledge}} base for lightning-caused <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the southern Appalachian region with recent experience from GSMNP. The park’s WFU program has provided a valuable and unparalleled opportunity to observe fires persisting without traditional suppression actions and to document their characteristics in a modern landscape. The park currently has the largest dataset for unsuppressed <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the region, as the U.S. Forest Service implemented WFU <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> eastern National Forest System lands for the first time in 2006. Because the dataset from the ten fires managed thus far is too small for meaningful statistical analysis, this paper focuses on the qualitative information collected from case studies that demonstrate patterns <b>in</b> lightning-caused <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the southern Appalachians. Fire monitoring and report data were analyzed to identify patterns that enhance our understanding of <b>fire</b> regimes <b>in</b> these forests.|$|R
