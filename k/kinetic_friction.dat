5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction.</b> In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The frictional force {{is directly related}} to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction.</b>|$|E
25|$|New {{models are}} {{beginning}} to show how <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> can be greater than static friction. <b>Kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> is now understood, in many cases, to be primarily caused by chemical bonding between the surfaces, rather than interlocking asperities; however, in many other cases roughness effects are dominant, for example in rubber to road friction. Surface roughness and contact area affect <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.|$|E
40|$|Debris {{strength}} {{is a key}} factor in the initiation of debris flows. Therefore debris strength must be measured to assess the initiation conditions of debris flows. It is difficult to test the strength of coarse debris in the laboratory, as large quantities of material are needed to eliminate single-particle ffects. Therefore in-situ strength tests have been conducted on scree slopes in the southern French Alps to measure the strength of dry, coarse, matrixless debris. The test method consisted of bringing a debris mass into movement parallel to the slope surface on slopes at or near the critical slope angle. As dry, coarse, matrixless debris is essentially cohesionless, its strength can be characterized by its internal <b>friction</b> angle. Mean <b>kinetic</b> internal <b>friction</b> angles vary from 36. 0 ° to 38. 7 ° for five debris types with mean stone sizes ranging from 33 - 50 mm. Stone size sorting is the most important cause of variations in <b>kinetic</b> internal <b>friction</b> angle. Stone shape also influences the <b>kinetic</b> intemal <b>friction</b> angle, but it is less important. Stone size, stone shape sorting and rock type have no influence. However, rock type may indirectly influence <b>kinetic</b> internal <b>friction</b> angle through stone size sorting and stone shape. 1.

Introducing bulk rolling friction effects, through the contact planes and considering viscoelastic rollers, we find that the inverse of the square of the oscillation frequency of the bar has a linear relationship with the center to center distance.

40|$|Split Hopkinson {{pressure}} bar (SHPB) {{has become a}} frequently used technique to measure the uniaxial compressive stress- strain relation of various engineering materials at high strain-rates. The accuracy of an SHPB test {{is based on the}} assumption of uniaxial and uniform stress distribution within the specimen, which, however, is not always satisfied in an actual SHPB test due to the existence of some unavoidable negative factors, e. g., interface friction constrains. Ki netic interface friction tests based on a simple device for engineering materials testing on SHPB tests are performed. A <b>kinetic</b> interface <b>friction</b> model is proposed and validated by implementing it into a numerical model.

5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static <b>friction.</b> <b>Kinetic</b> (or dynamic) <b>friction</b> occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|R
25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E
25|$|Rolling {{resistance}} is {{the force that}} resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling {{resistance is}} less than that associated with <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction.</b> Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> at {{nanoscale}} {{can be explained}} by thermodynamics. Upon sliding, new surface forms at the back of a sliding true contact, and existing surface disappears at the front of it. Since all surfaces involve the thermodynamic surface energy, work must be spent in creating the new surface, and energy is released as heat in removing the surface. Thus, a force is required to move the back of the contact, and frictional heat is released at the front.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction)</b> or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|In {{slippery}} conditions some riders {{prefer to}} ride fixed {{because they believe}} the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, {{there is also an}} increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction</b> (see below).|$|E
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of <b>kinetic</b> <b>friction.</b> Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E

25|$|Most bicycle {{brake systems}} consist of three main {{components:}} {{a mechanism for}} the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via <b>friction,</b> <b>kinetic</b> energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.|$|R

In particular, this hysteresis exists even in extremely overdamped junctions, which agrees with recent unusual experimental findings.
