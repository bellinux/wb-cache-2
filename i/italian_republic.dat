5|$|The Cisalpine Republic, a North <b>Italian</b> <b>republic</b> {{set up by}} Napoleon in 1797 {{with its}} capital at Milan first adopted a {{modified}} form of the metric system based in the braccio cisalpino (Cisalpine cubit) which was defined to be half a metre. In 1802 the Cisalpine Republic was renamed the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic,</b> with Napoleon as its head of state.

The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic,</b> on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field was solid blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic</b> was {{replaced}} by the Kingdom of Italy with Napoleon as its emperor.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, after Napoleon had crowned himself first French Emperor, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic</b> was {{transformed}} into the first Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, or Italico, under his direct rule. The flag of the Kingdom of Italy {{was that of the}} Republic in rectangular form, charged with the golden Napoleonic eagle. This remained in use until the abdication of Napoleon in 1814.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1861, {{the flag}} of the Kingdom of Sardinia was {{declared}} {{the flag of}} the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. This Italian tricolour, with the armorial bearings of the former Royal House of Savoy was the first national flag and lasted in that form for 85 years until the birth of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1946.|$|E

5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), <b>Italian</b> (<b>Republic</b> of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German units. From {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E

5|$|Dąbrowski, meanwhile, {{spent the}} first few years of the new century as a general in the service of the <b>Italian</b> <b>republic.</b> In 1804 he {{received}} the Officer cross of Legion of Honour, and the next year, the Italian Order of the Iron Crown. Together with Józef Wybicki he was summoned again by Napoleon in fall of 1806 and tasked with recreating the Polish formation, which Napoleon wanted to use to recapture Greater Poland from Prussia. The ensuing conflict was known as the Greater Poland Uprising, and Dabrowski was the chief leader of Polish insurgent forces in it. Dąbrowski distinguished himself at siege of Tczew, siege of Gdańsk and at Battle of Friedland.|$|E

5|$|The Order of Merit of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic</b> {{effectively}} replaced {{as national}} orders the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (1362), the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (1572) and the Order of the Crown of Italy (1868), which the sovereign, as fons honorum, did not abdicate. Today these continue merely as dynastic {{orders of the}} Royal House in Exile. While their bestowal is suppressed by law in Italy, the use of those decorations conferred prior to 1951 is recognised, exclusive of any right of precedence in official ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{weight of}} an apothecaries' pound ranged {{generally}} between 300g and 320g, {{slightly less than}} that of a pound in the Roman Empire. An important exception to this rule is that the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia was under rule of the Habsburg monarchy 1814–1859 and therefore had the extremely large Habsburg apothecaries' pound of 420g. (See below under Habsburg standard.) E.g. in the large city of Milan the apothecaries' system based on a pound of 326.8g was officially replaced by the metric system as early as 1803, because Milan was part of the Napoleonic <b>Italian</b> <b>Republic.</b> Since the successor of this little state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, fell to Habsburg in 1814 (at a time when even in France the système usuel had been introduced because the metric system was not accepted by the population), an apothecaries' system was officially introduced again, but now based on the Habsburg apothecaries' pound, which weighed almost 30% more.|$|E
50|$|Between 1991 and 1993, {{resulting}} from two referendums and legislation, Italian electoral law was altered substantially.
