500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He ought to give you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. It is not my opinion that you have ever been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect <b>it,</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{style of}} underplaying before the camera {{surprised}} {{many of his}} directors and fellow actors. Even in his earliest feature films, he recognized the camera's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements. Commenting on Cooper's performance in Sergeant York, director Howard Hawks observed, [...] "He worked very hard and yet he didn't seem to be working. He was a strange actor because you'd look at him during a scene and you'd think ... this isn't {{going to be any}} good. But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he'd been thinking." [...] Sam Wood, who directed Cooper in four films, had similar observations about Cooper's performance in Pride of the Yankees, noting, [...] "What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach. On the screen he's perfect, yet on the set you'd swear it's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures." [...] His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor. Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper, actress Ingrid Bergman concluded, [...] "The personality of this man was so enormous, so overpowering—and that expression in his eyes and his face, it was so delicate and so underplayed. You just didn't notice <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> saw it on the screen. I thought he was marvelous; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Beaumont of NME gave it {{a rating}} of six out of ten, a higher score than the {{original}} album version review by the same publication, claiming that [...] "the Aussie rapper offers a slight improvement on her debut LP with this reissue." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator gave the album a 4/5 rating calling it [...] "as good an opportunity as any {{to acknowledge that the}} femcee's debut is actually relentlessly enjoyable," [...] adding that [...] "there isn't a dud track" [...] and [...] "of the other new cuts, [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] stands out as another future hit". Rory Cashin of State gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "the new additions are mostly winners," [...] but [...] "just like her first time out with this album, Iggy has a problem; trying too hard to please herself and please commercial radio." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic, who had also reviewed The New Classic, gave it three and a half out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, Reclassified is a better effort than The New Classic and offers more bang for the buck, but this [...] "release <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> get it right" [...] blueprint is concerning for consumers, who now have a choice between rebuying it all or seeking out the new numbers on their own." ...|$|E
