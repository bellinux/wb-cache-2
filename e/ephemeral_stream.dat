500|$|The {{burrowing}} frogs of Australia have {{a rather}} different lifestyle. The western spotted frog (Heleioporus albopunctatus) digs a burrow beside a river {{or in the}} bed of an <b>ephemeral</b> <b>stream</b> and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development. Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these, the green burrowing frog (Scaphiophryne marmorata), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes. [...] It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> are {{waterways}} with poorly defined {{channels and}} episodic flow. Globally, {{the occurrence of}} <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> appears to be increasing due to drying trends driven by climate change, {{as well as a}} result of increased water abstraction. Simultaneously, these pressures result in increased vulnerability of <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams,</b> as flow rates decline from intermittent to entirely absent. Despite this, ephemeral waterways are broadly neglected by ecologists, and no tailored measures are available to study the health of these systems. Traditional assessment methods applied to lotic or lentic environments include physicochemical analyses, often paired with the use of biological indicators. Due to abundance and diversity, sensitivity to changes in flow, water quality and toxicity aquatic macroinvertebrates are widely used as indicators of ecological condition. However, the theoretical base underpinning the use of macroinvertebrate protocols to assess waterway condition has generally been developed from studies of temperate, permanent waterways with few studies specific to tropical or subtropical ephemeral environments. To address the knowledge gap, this review examines the current state of knowledge regarding the health of ephemeral systems, focussing on Australian freshwaters. It also examines the applicable ecosystem health measures that may be transferable to ephemeral systems, with a focus on macroinvertbrates as bioindicator species...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} {{hydrology}} are important factors influencing abiotic conditions and subsequently the biota. Although these effects {{have been studied}} in tropical catchments and in central arid Australia, subtropical <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> have largely been ignored. In the present study, three <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> in Central Queensland were monitored over 15 months. We hypothesised that macroinvertebrate abundance would increase gradually following the initial flow pulse and that abundance would increase until the pools began drying, with sensitive taxa only present during higher flow. In all, 69 families from 14 orders were collected in 128 samples. Significant relationships were not detected between low flow conditions and taxa richness (P > 0. 05). Principal component analysis showed that the macroinvertebrate communities did not change {{in response to the}} drying of pools. Significant differences were not observed between taxa richness, abundance nor tolerant taxa during varied periods of flow (P > 0. 05). Sensitive taxa were most abundant during high-flow periods with comparatively less abundance during no flow and drying periods. This study provides novel information on the flow-linked succession of macroinvertebrate communities in subtropical <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> and the results are important in informing the development of riverine indices and models used to manage subtropical environments...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> {{in western}} North America flowed over smooth valley floors before {{transformation}} from shallow discontinuous channels into deep arroyos. These inherently unstable streams of semiarid regions {{are sensitive to}} short-term climatic changes, and t’o human impacts, because hillslopes supply abundant sediment to infrequent large streamflow events. Discontinuous <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> appear to be constantly changing as they alternate between two primary modes of operation; either aggradation or degradation may become dominant. Attainment of equilibrium conditions is brief. Disequilibrium is promoted by channel entrenchment that causes the fall of local base level, and by deposition of channel fans that causes the rise of local base level. These opposing base-level processes in adjacent reaches are maintained by self-enhancing feedback mechanisms. The threshold between erosion and deposition is crossed when aggradational or degradational reaches shift upstream or downstream. Extension of entrenched reaches into channel fans tends to create continuous arroyos. Upvalley migration of fan apexes tends to create depositional valley floors with few stream channels. Less than 100 years is required for arroyo cutting, but more than 500 years is required for complete aggradation of entrenched stream channels and valley floors. Discontinuous <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> have a repetitive sequence of streamflow characteristics that is as distinctive as sequences of meander bends or braided gravel bars in perennial rivers. The sequence changes from degradation t...|$|R

The {{combination}} of the basin physical characteristics steep slopes, sparse vegetation, thin soils and permeable rock. and intense, heavy and irregularly distributed rain, generates flash floods. Runoff generation is sudden, giving rise to flash floods with sharp, narrow hydrographs with short time lags.

Refracted waves and changing water level over the irregular bottom can complicate further the patterns of asymmetric ripple marks and other directional structures.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} channel-scale morphodynamics of <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> in the onshore Carnarvon basin in arid west-central Western Australia. The rivers {{in this region}} have low gradients, the landscape has low relief, and the rates of climatically and tectonically driven geomorphic processes also are low. As a result, the rivers in the Carnarvon alluvial plain are highly sensitive to minor perturbations in base level, channel slope, and fluvial energy. We use channel planform adjustments, stream gradient changes, and floodplain profiles across multiple <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> within a variety of catchments and flow regimes to determine if tectonically driven land level changes are affecting channel form and fluvial processes. Growth of individual fold segments is shown to have altered stream and floodplain gradients and triggered repeated avulsions at structurally controlled nodes. Aligned perturbations in channel form across multiple channel-fold intersections provide systematic geomorphic evidence for the location and orientation of neotectonic structures in the region. These features occur as a belt of low relief anticlines in the Carnarvon alluvial plain...|$|R
40|$|In January 2001, the U. S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers {{exceeded}} its statutory authority by asserting Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction over non-navigable, isolated, intrastate waters based solely on their use by migratory birds. The Supreme Court’s majority opinion addressed broader issues of CWA jurisdiction by implying that the CWA intended some “connection” to navigability and that isolated waters need a “significant nexus” to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision (SWANCC), {{there have been many}} lawsuits challenging CWA jurisdiction, many of which are focused on headwater, intermittent, and <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams.</b> To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> throughout the U. S., summarize major findings from the scientific literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientific information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53 % (2, 900, 000 km) of the total stream length in the U. S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> comprise approximately 59 % (3, 200, 000 km) of the total stream length and approximately 50 % (1, 460, 000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U. S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological connectivity, headwater, intermittent and <b>ephemeral</b> <b>streams</b> cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they {{are a part of the}} tributary system. As this debate continues, scientific input from multiple fields will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local levels and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made. Strengthening the interface between science, policy, and public participation is critical if we are going to achieve effective water resource management...|$|R
