5|$|Before the Protestant Reformation, the {{crucifix}} was common in Western Christianity. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> {{of the cross}} with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.|$|E
5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} a contribution to art history, is more about epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a picture <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of reality.|$|E

5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Also {{featured}} are Jason Stevens and Chloe Maxwell. Stevens is {{a former}} prop for the St. George Dragons and Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks rugby teams, known for his Christian faith and clean image. Chloe Maxwell <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model,</b> {{best known for her}} appearance in a series of advertisements for Jeans West. She is the wife of rugby player Mat Rogers. Sonia Kruger has also co-hosted.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> {{of all that is}} best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E

5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, {{the action of}} a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
5|$|Insects play {{important}} roles in biological research. For example, because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> organism for studies in the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been {{an essential part of}} studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, development, behavior and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies can help to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the organism's important role in biological research. It was found that 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the evolution theory.|$|E
5|$|The core {{concept of}} general-relativistic {{model-building}} {{is that of}} a solution of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
