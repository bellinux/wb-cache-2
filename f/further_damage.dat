5|$|A {{significant}} portion of {{the eastern side of the}} acropolis has been eroded away by the Copán River, although the river has since been diverted in order to protect the site from <b>further</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage <b>further</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Second Assault Unit {{approached}} Guadalcanal through Indispensable Strait, it {{was attacked}} by five CAF SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers. Bomb hits caused heavy damage to Yura, and the unit reversed course to try to escape. More CAF air attacks on Yura throughout the day caused <b>further</b> <b>damage,</b> and the cruiser was abandoned and scuttled at 21:00 that night.|$|E

5|$|By July9, 11municipalities across Quebec were {{declared}} disaster {{areas and}} made eligible for federal funding. Ten more municipalities were placed under this declaration on July11 following <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> assessments. The Canadian Red Cross provided residents in Marsoui {{with food and}} aid. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard allocated C$100,000 in aid for the affected areas and promised further funding.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the destroyers Arashio (bombed; 35) and Asashio (strafed by aircraft; 21) {{were both}} damaged during the air attacks which sank Mikuma and caused <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to Mogami. Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers Chikuma (3) and Tone (2). Dead aboard the destroyers Tanikaze (11), Arashi (1), Kazagumo (1) and the fleet oiler Akebono Maru (10) {{made up the}} {{remaining}} 23 casualties.|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to discourage <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to the resting place of 1,016 men. Mount Indefatigable in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917. The wreck was identified by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001, when it was found to have been heavily salvaged sometime in the past.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the town}} was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. <b>Further</b> <b>damage</b> to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town.|$|E
5|$|The inscriptions, {{particularly}} {{the names of}} those killed, suffered from exposure to the elements. Restoration work, including re-carving, was carried out in the 1980s, funded by donations from the British Railways Engineers Ex-Servicemen's Association match-funded by British Rail. Erosion continued in the years following and in lieu of re-carving them and causing <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to the memorial, the names were recorded in a book which is held by the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E

5|$|Considerable damage {{occurred}} as the tornado moved through Cordova. Buildings in downtown {{had already been}} damaged by an EF3 tornado earlier that morning and received <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> from this tornado. East of Cordova, the tornado crossed the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River three times (along with the Sipsey Fork once, just north of its confluence with the Mulberry Fork). It intensified further into a violent EF4 in northeastern Walker County, as it completely leveled a site-built home and obliterated two nearby mobile homes. South of Sipsey, additional homes and mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 to EF3 strength.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. <b>Further</b> <b>damage</b> occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.|$|E
50|$|Numbers {{probably}} {{reduced in}} the seventeenth century and organisation deteriorated. The aftermath of the failed Jacobite risings in 1715 and 1745 <b>further</b> <b>damaged</b> the Catholic cause in Scotland.|$|R

5|$|Friedrich's {{reputation}} suffered <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> {{when his}} imagery {{was adopted by}} a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.|$|E
5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the adeno-associated virus) to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from <b>further</b> <b>damage.</b> In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|McLeansboro in {{particular}} experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its {{local high school}} reported 19broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The facade of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to <b>further</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

5|$|November 21, 1985- Hurricane Kate makes {{landfall}} near Apalachicola as a Category 2 hurricane, producing up to 8.32inches (147mm) {{of rainfall}} in Panama City. Tides of over 10feet (3m) above normal result in further beach erosion near the coast. Just {{two months after}} Hurricane Elena affected the area, the passage of Hurricane Kate causes <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> to oyster beds, leaving many people without employment. Kate causes $300million (1985USD, $600million 2008USD) in damage and three deaths in the state.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and <b>further</b> <b>damage.</b> OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 8 May, both sides spotted each other {{about the same time}} and began {{launching}} their aircraft about 09:00. The Japanese carriers launched a total of 18 Zeros, 33 D3As and 18 B5Ns. Yorktown was the first American carrier to launch her aircraft and Lexington began launching hers seven minutes later. These totaled 9 Wildcats, 15 Dauntlesses and 12 Devastators. Yorktowns dive bombers disabled Shōkakus flight deck with two hits and Lexingtons aircraft were only able to <b>further</b> <b>damage</b> her with another bomb hit. None of the torpedo bombers from either carrier hit anything. The Japanese CAP was effective and shot down 3 Wildcats and 2 Dauntlesses for the loss of 2 Zeros.|$|E
