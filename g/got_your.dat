5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the <b>Got</b> <b>Your</b> 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

25|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1980 song Enola Gay {{depicts the}} events of the 1945 {{deployment}} of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima {{from the point of view}} of the crew of the B29 Superfortress Bomber Enola Gay. Clear references are made to the exact time the bomb detonated ("It's eight fifteen, and that's the time that it's always been"), and questions are asked as to whether the action was necessary. The song also references a supposed radio message in which the crew detail no anomalies as a result of nuclear detonation ("We <b>got</b> <b>your</b> message on the radio - conditions normal and you're coming home"); the American government denied any rumours of radiation sickness associated with the dropping of the bombs.|$|E

50|$|You <b>Got</b> <b>Yours!</b> East Bay Garage 1965-1967 is a {{compilation}} album featuring American garage rock bands that {{were active in}} the San Francisco Bay area between 1965 and 1967. It was released on September 18, 2007 on Big Beat Records and is the twenty-third installment of the Nuggets from the Golden State album series. Generally overshadowed by the garage scenes located in Los Angeles and San Jose, the San Francisco scene was uniquely influenced by the surplus of folk rock, which would eventually develop into psychedelic rock. For the most part, the groups presented on You <b>Got</b> <b>Yours!</b> do not exemplify the teenage-angst and rawness associated with the garage rock genre, but rather display a level of professionalism not expected from an adolescent band.|$|R

500|$|Many {{fans were}} unhappy with Doggett's condescension towards Scully during her apology.

We're partners now.' And you give that {{the weight of a}} marine saying to someone, 'I'll jump on a grenade for you, so you can trust me.' The idea was to really assure the fans that the show was continuing on." ...|$|E
