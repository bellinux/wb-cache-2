5|$|Although young, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E

5|$|He {{struggled}} at {{the start}} of the 1972–73 season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over 14 stone. Captain Frank McLintock remarked to the management that <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> only operating at 60% capacity, and <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> fined £200 before he began to shed weight and rediscover his form. Arsenal finished the season in second place, and he scored just nine league goals throughout the campaign. Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten by Sunderland.|$|E

5|$|John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> assassinated at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> {{fatally shot}} while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> {{raised in}} the small Ontario town of Humberstone, now Port Colborne. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>was</b> born just eleven days after his father {{was killed in a}} hunting accident.

However, after some disappointing experiences with Montreal management he signed shortly afterward with the Maple Leafs.|$|E

He further claims that he and <b>Kennedy</b> <b>were</b> arrested and later released. This appears to be another case of an exaggerated encounter. Hardin and <b>Kennedy</b> <b>were</b> simply arrested and driven {{out of town for}} cheating at cards. Again Hardin's version does not fit with contemporary records.|$|R
