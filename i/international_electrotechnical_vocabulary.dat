50|$|Remus Răduleţ (1904-1984) was a Romanian {{electrical}} engineer, {{who contributed}} {{to the development of}} the <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> and theoretical electrotechnology.

50|$|In 1938, it {{published}} a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical, electronic and related technologies. This effort continues, and the <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> (the on-line version {{of which is}} known as the Electropedia) remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> (IEV) {{serves to}} promote the global {{unification}} of terminology {{in the field of}} electrotechnology, electronics and telecommunications. It is developed by IEC Technical Committee 1 (Terminology), and published as both the IEC 60050 series of standards and online as the Electropedia. The Electropedia database contains English and French definitions for more than 20 000 concepts, and provides terms in up to 16 other languages.|$|E

5000|$|The terms used to {{describe}} electrical connectors and their parts are normally those included in IEC 60050, the <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Vocabulary,</b> published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (of which the US is a full member). IEC 60050 is also available (no charge) as IEV Online. [...] However, NEMA, the NFPA National Electrical Code, the National Electrical Contractors Association's NECA 130 Standard for Installing and Maintaining Wiring Devices and this article use some terminology which is not covered in IEC 60050 {{and may not be}} familiar to non-residents of North America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{terminology}} standardization proper - if one excludes earlier attempts {{in the field}} of metrology - started in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which was founded in London in 1906 following a recommendation passed at the International Electrical Congress, held in St. Louis, United States, on 15 September 1904, to the extent that: [...] "...steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the nomenclature and ratings of electrical apparatus and machinery". From the very beginning, IEC considered it its foremost task to standardize the terminology of electrotechnology {{for the sake of the}} quality of its subject standards, and soon embarked upon the <b>International</b> <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Vocabulary</b> (IEV), whose first edition, based on many individual terminology standards, was published in 1938. The IEV is still being continued today, covering 77 chapters as parts of the International Standard series IEC 60050. The IEV Online Database can be accessed on Electropedia ...|$|E

Generally the plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins (referred to as male) that fit into matching apertures (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords, a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment' defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts.|$|E

Generally the plug is the movable connector attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure and connected to an energised electrical circuit.

This paper is aimed at presenting a step towards an innovative Flickermeter which is able to account a larger variety of luminous sources. In particular, the goal {{of this study is to}} find a new method to define the human annoyance under flicker condition, based on the measurement of the pupil size in presence of different flicker stimuli. The design and characterization of an automatic system able to generate flicker and measure the pupil size will be presented. In addition, the results obtained on human subject will be illustrated...|$|E
