BACKGROUNDAlthough the sarcolemmal NHE has {{been implicated in}} various physiological and pathophysiological phenomena in animal studies, its activity and expression in human myocardium have not been studied. METHODSVentricular myocardium was obtained from unused <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> with acute myocardial dysfunction (n = 5) and recipient hearts with chronic end stage heart failure (n = 11) through a transplantation program. Intracellular pH (pHi) was monitored in enzymatically isolated single ventricular myocytes by microepifluorescence. As the index of sarcolemmal NHE activity, the rate of H+ efflux at a pHi of 6. 90 (JH 6. 9) was determined after the induction of intracellular acidosis in bicarbonate-free medium. Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE 1) expression in ventricular myocardium was determined by immunoblot analysis. RESULTSHuman ventricular myocytes exhibited readily detectable sarcolemmal NHE activity after the induction of intracellular acidosis, and this activity was suppressed by the NHE 1 -selective inhibitor HOE- 642 (cariporide) at 1 μmol/L. Sarcolemmal NHE activity of myocytes was significantly greater in recipient hearts (JH 6. 9 = 1. 95 ± 0. 18 mmol/L/min) {{than it was in}} unused <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> (JH 6. 9 = 1. 06 ± 0. 15 mmol/L/min). In contrast, NHE 1 protein was expressed in similar abundance in ventricular myocardium from both recipient and unused <b>donor</b> <b>hearts.</b> CONCLUSIONSSarcolemmal NHE activity of human ventricular myocytes arises from the NHE 1 isoform and is inhibited by HOE- 642. Sarcolemmal NHE activity is significantly greater in recipient hearts with chronic end-stage heart failure than it is in unused <b>donor</b> <b>hearts,</b> and this difference is likely to arise from altered posttranslational regulation...|$|R

We used both major histocompatibility complex class I mismatched and major histocompatibility complex class II mismatched models of cardiac allograft vasculopathy to characterize the role of CD 8 + lymphocytes {{in the development of}} cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Methods: <b>Donor</b> <b>hearts</b> from B 10. A mice were transplanted into B 10. BR recipients (major histocompatibility complex class I mismatched). <b>Donor</b> <b>hearts</b> were harvested at 1, 7, 14, and 30 days after transplantation and (1) quantitated morphometrically for lesion development, (2) stained immunohistochemically, or (3) digested for isolation of graft-infiltrating cells. The cytotoxic phenotype of graft-infiltrating CD 8 + lymphocytes was determined with flow cytometry. Intracellular cytokine staining of CD 8 + and CD 4 + lymphocytes for interleukin 2, interferon g, interleukin 4, and interleukin 10 was performed with 2 -color flow cytometry. Finally, B 6. C-H 2 bm 12 <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> were transplanted into either C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type (major histocompatibility complex class II mismatched) or CD 8 −/− knockout recipients and examined for the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Results: In the major histocompatibility complex class I mismatched model, CD 8 + lymphocytes were the predominant T-lymphocyte subset that infiltrated the allografts and demonstrated markers of activation. The intracellular cytokine-staining assay demonstrated that CD 8 + lymphocytes were the primary sources of allograft interleukin 2 and interferon γ. Intimal lesions developed in the allografts by day 14 (12. 0 % ± 4. 0 %) and further increased by day 30 (44. 0 % ± 5. 0 %). In the major histocompatibility complex class II mismatched model, the <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> in the CD 8 −/− knockout recipients had substantially less severe intimal lesions when compared with the <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> in wild-type recipients (19. 0 % ± 6. 0 % vs 50. 0 % ± 7. 0 %, respectively; P <. 05). Conclusions: In both major histocompatibility complex class I and II mismatched models, CD 8 + lymphocytes contribute significantly to chronic rejection.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The present <b>donor</b> criteria for <b>heart</b> and lung transplantation are very strict and result in exclusion of many potential thoracic organ donors. Due to a limited donor pool, 20 - 30 % of patients die waiting for transplantation. METHODS: The authors have performed a prospective study of personally inspecting marginal donor organs that previously would have been rejected by standard donor criteria. RESULTS: Fourteen marginal hearts and eleven marginal lungs were inspected. All 14 marginal hearts and 10 of the marginal lungs were transplanted. All cardiac transplant patients did well. The mean ejection fraction of the <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> preoperatively was 39 +/- 11 % (range 15 - 50 %). Postoperatively, the ejection fraction of the <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> improved significantly to 55 +/- 3 % (p < 0. 002).

To study whether liposome-mediated transfection could be accomplished during transplantation, we used a liposome-reporter gene system in a rabbit model of allograft cardiac transplantation. Methods: After aortic crossclamping, Stauffland <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> were injected with 10 ml Stanford cardioplegic solution; then a 1. 3 to 2. 0 mg/kg dose of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in 1 : 1 deoxyribonucleic acid–liposome complexes was injected proximal to the aortic crossclamp for coronary artery perfusion. The hearts were transplanted into New Zealand White rabbit recipients in the heterotopic cervical position (n = 11 transplants). Recipients were sacrificed at 24 hours. Myocardial specimens (right and left ventricles) and vascular specimens (epicardial coronary artery, aortic root, and coronary sinus) from both the transplanted and native hearts were analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase protein {{by means of the}} enzymatic liquid scintillation assay (counts per minute per milligram of total protein). Results: In the recipient, myocardial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity was significantly greater in treated <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> (mean 4. 6 × 105 cpm/mg ± 1. 1 × 105 [standard error]) than in native hearts (mean 4. 1 × 102 cpm/mg ± 72 [standard error], p < 0. 01, Mann-Whitney U test). In treated <b>donor</b> <b>hearts,</b> right and left ventricular specimens, as well as apical and basal myocardial specimens, were transfected equally. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in vascular specimens also indicated transfection (mean 5. 4 × 105 cpm/mg ± 2. 5 × 105 [standard error]). Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in the coronary sinus was comparable with that in the coronary arteries, which suggests that liposomes can traverse the coronary capillary beds. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ex vivo transfection of <b>donor</b> <b>hearts</b> with a liposome-reporter gene system results in significant in vivo expression of the transfected gene product after cardiac transplantation. Genetic alteration of myocardium and cardiac vasculature has potential clinical applications in the prevention of posttransplantation rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and both transplant and nontransplant coronary artery disease.

The influence of our current legal system on organ donation, which requires (prior) permission from donor and relatives, is probably limited.

Lack of consent to a request for donation. The potential donor pool is remarkably small in the Netherlands, due to relatively low numbers of (traffic) accidents, with an almost equal number of CVA-related brain dead patients compared with neighbouring countries.
