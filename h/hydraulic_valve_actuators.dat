5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with exhaust valves operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two exhaust valves through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four exhaust valves. Rocker arms are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|E
40|$|Attaining a {{controlled}} output strain and utilizing a full potential of active material are the significant factors to design Terfenol-D actuator devises such as active damping devices, high speed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuators,</b> large-force linear motors and large torque rotating motors. To achieve this, a high magnetic biasing field {{is required in}} an actuator. The present work attempts to propose a suitable layout in a Terfenol-D actuator based on numerical magnetic field analysis. Three configurations namely single coil, coaxial coils and coil with permanent magnet combinations that surrounds the Terfenol-D material are considered in the present study. Ansoft package magnetic flux density is {{used to evaluate the}} distribution of magnetic flux density of the layouts used in an actuator. Further, the magnetic flux density is evaluated and compared among them to decide the best configuration to be used in a Terfenol-D actuator. Structure and layout of a proposed actuator is outlined. With this, the number of turns required for coaxial coils is computed using Ampere’s law and in turn verified the same using the reluctance approach. Finally, it appears that all these results work as well as anticipated and has their individual advantages...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: To design {{successfully}} magnetostrictive devices (sonar, large-force linear motors, large-torque rotating motors, high-speed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuators,</b> or {{active damping}} devices), {{it is crucial}} to control the largest dynamic strain amplitude as much as possible in order to use the full potential of Terfenol-D. To get these giant strains, a high magnetic bias is required. The object {{of this article is to}} present the results of a comparative study, including modelling and prototypes, on the different means to generate a high bias field in Terfenol-D. The aim of the research was to get bias field higher or equal to 80 kA/m. Among all the possible types of bias, only three types appear able to produce a high enough field. This has led to three different prototypes. To design them, an extensive effort of modelling has been required. FLUX 2 D and FLUX 3 D soft-wares have been used for the bias design; ATILA code has been used for the electromechanical design. A first prototype has a bias done by DC current in the coil surrounding the rods. A second prototype has a 100 kA/m bias done by a permanent magnet configuration of the series type. The third prototype is equipped with a new magnet configuration, providing about 90 kA/m bias. Finally, it appears that all these solutions work as well as expected and have their own advantages...|$|E
40|$|An automated, pre-programmed, {{multiplexed}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> is described. The valve is membrane-based {{and normally}} open. In {{contrast to the}} membrane-based pneumatic <b>valve,</b> the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> uses <b>hydraulic</b> liquid to exert the control pressure. The line pressure is controlled with a roller moving over a prefabricated topology. Multiple rollers, each traversing its own track, are assembled into a single carriage, which can be actuated either manually or with a single computer-controlled motor. A valve manifold and roller actuators are designed, fabricated, and tested to demonstrate three-way valve actuation in a pre-determined sequence. The performance of the valve is evaluated and {{the utility of the}} valve in the operation of a micro thermal cycler was demonstrated. Hydraulic controllers of the type described here can be operated either manually or under computer control and provide an inexpensive means of controlling flow in lab-on-a-chip devices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Camless Engine Valve Actuation (CEVA) {{technologies}} {{have been known}} for improving fuel efficiency, enhancing power output, and reducing emissions of Internal Combustion(IC) engine. Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the valve timing of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator.</b> Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator’s</b> main function is to provide fully variable open/close valve timing. The Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system has been modeled {{by means of a}} powerful hydraulic simulation tool, AMESim, which is useful for the dynamic simulations and analysis of hydraulic systems. The designed model has been validated through comparison with mathematical model and experimental results obtained in a prototype test bench. This research is focused on Adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system. A proposed valve timing control in this paper is used to robustly control opening timing, duration, closing timing regardless of fluid temperature variations without high-cost sensors. Test bench data and simulation results indicate that a Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system would verify the effectiveness and feasibility of a fully variable valve timing technology...|$|R

40|$|This book {{deals with}} the {{development}} and testing of high-response piezo-servovalves for improved performance of electrohydraulic cylinder drives. Performance improvement means {{in the context of}} this work an enhancement of reference and disturbance response of the drive in a closed-loop pressure and position control. Reference and disturbance responses determine the precision of the drive which influences product quality and motion accuracy in stationary and mobile applications. This thesis shows by means of linearised mathematical models that the drive performance can be significantly improved by high dynamics of the control valve. The increase in valve dynamics can be achieved by the use of piezoelectric actuators, which outmatch the response of common electromechanical <b>valve</b> <b>actuators.</b> Within the scope of this work two different novel high-response piezo-servovalves are prototyped. These are four-way directional flow control valves with linear spools. The book presents different steps of the design and development process of the valves such as conceptual design, calculation, dimensioning, manufacturing, design of internal valve control, testing according to the internationally standardized procedures and comparison to the performance of common servovalves. The achieved dynamics of the piezo-servovalves surpasses the response of the conventional valves. Exemplary investigations of an electrohydraulic cylinder drive show an improved reference response of pressure control by 50 % and an enhanced disturbance response of position control by 40 % due to the use of the piezo-servovalve at the drive. This work demonstrates that the commercially available piezo-actuators can be successfully implemented in industrial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valves,</b> bringing advantages for the overall drive performance. The high reliability and endurance of the piezo-actuators have already been proven by the use in common rail fuel injectors in the automobile industry since 2002. Taking into account falling costs of the actuators due to the mass production for the automobile industry they can become a very attractive alternative or supplement for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>valve</b> technology...|$|R
