5|$|In India, Fairley {{continued}} his research into schistosomiasis. The disease was unknown in India but snails were abundant {{and there was}} danger that troops returning from Egypt might introduce it. In the absence of human schistosoma, Fairley investigated bovine schistosoma, which infected water buffalo and other domesticated animals in the Bombay area. Experiments with monkeys proved that daily intravenous doses of tartaric acid were an effective treatment. Fairley also carried out pioneering work on <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm</b> disease (dracunculiasis). However, his main interest was Tropical sprue. But {{he was unable to}} determine its cause or discover a cure; in spite of contracting the disease himself and making some advances in its treatment. He was invalided out of India, travelling to the United Kingdom to recuperate in 1925. While in India he had met Mary Evelyn Greaves, and they were married at the Presbyterian Church, Marylebone, on 28 October 1925.|$|E

25|$|Dracunculiasis, {{also called}} Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an {{infection}} by the <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm.</b> A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> larvae. Initially {{there are no}} symptoms. About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. The worm then emerges from the skin {{over the course of}} a few weeks. During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.|$|E
5000|$|The church {{claims that}} Peter Anim Newman began a healing {{ministry}} in 1917 {{under the name}} Faith Tabernacle {{as a result of}} healing received from acute stomach upset and <b>guinea</b> <b>worms</b> infections after he had read a magazine published by Faith Tabernacle USA called [...] "Sword of Spirit".|$|R
30|$|Developing worms do {{not usually}} cause symptoms, but as <b>Guinea</b> <b>worms</b> emerge, they cause burning pain and may provoke {{allergic}} responses including urticaria or even asthma. Abscess formation due to bacterial superinfection is common. It usually affects legs and feet. Worms migrating near a joint sometimes cause arthritis with joint effusion [109, 124].|$|R

Since 1986, the Carter Foundation has sought to eliminate <b>Guinea</b> <b>worms</b> and the disease they cause by breaking their reproductive cycle.

25|$|The {{second group}} {{contains}} the threadworms, roundworms, and hookworms. This phylum is called Nematoda. Threadworms may be microscopic, {{such as the}} vinegar eelworm, or more than 1 metre (3feet) long. They are found in damp earth, moss, decaying substances, fresh water, or salt water. Some roundworms are also parasites. The <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm,</b> for example, gets under {{the skin of the}} feet and legs of people living in tropical countries.|$|E
25|$|UNICEF. UNICEF is {{particularly}} active in school {{water supply and}} sanitation, {{as well as in}} hygiene education through schools. It has helped to provide schools with 170 wells and rehabilitate 50 water pumps. This has contributed to reducing the prevalence of <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> infection from 1,956 cases in 2000 to 30 cases in 2005 and also to increasing water access in schools from 39% to 82% over the same period. Sanitation and hygiene education was intensified, using primary schools as an entry point: 139 schools were equipped with special latrines, teacher and students were trained in hygiene education, and children participated in activities targeting behavior change in families.|$|E

The outbreak investigation, which was still incomplete, was triggered when technical assistants in adjoining Nanumba District (Northern Region) followed up when patients from Nwanta District began to appear at a case containment center in Nanumba District to receive treatment for their emerging <b>Guinea</b> <b>worms.</b> Following the review meeting, the program made plans to complete the search of Nkwanta District villages immediately, and to begin trainings and implementation of Worm Weeks and other interventions there with the help of U. S. Peace Corps on March 22 - 28, 2003...|$|R

25|$|Copepods are {{sometimes}} found in public main water supplies, especially systems {{where the water}} is not filtered, such as New York City, Boston, and San Francisco. This is not usually a problem in treated water supplies. In some tropical countries, such as Peru and Bangladesh, a correlation has been found between copepods' presence and cholera in untreated water, because the cholera bacteria attach to the surfaces of planktonic animals. The larvae of the <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> must develop within a copepod's digestive tract before being transmitted to humans. The risk of infection with these diseases can be reduced by filtering out the copepods (and other matter), for example with a cloth filter.|$|E
25|$|The copepods can {{be added}} to water-storage {{containers}} where the mosquitoes breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera Mesocyclops and Macrocyclops (such as Macrocyclops albidus), can survive for periods of months in the containers, if the containers are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of the mosquitoes. This biological control method is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from uncontaminated sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> is endemic.|$|E

2500|$|Human parasites {{including}} roundworms, the <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm,</b> threadworms and tapeworms {{are mentioned}} in Egyptian papyrus records from 3000 BC onwards; the Ebers papyrus describes hookworm.

2500|$|Ibn Sina, more {{commonly}} known in west as Avicenna was a Persian polymath and physician of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He {{was known for}} his scientific works, but especially his writing on medicine. He has been described as the [...] "Father of Early Modern Medicine". Ibn Sina is credited with many varied medical observations and discoveries, such as recognizing the potential of airborne transmission of disease, providing insight into many psychiatric conditions, recommending use of forceps in deliveries complicated by fetal distress, distinguishing central from peripheral facial paralysis and describing <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> infection and trigeminal neuralgia. He is credited for writing two books in particular: his most famous, al-Canon fi al Tibb (The Canon of Medicine), and also The Book of Healing. His other works cover subjects including angelology, heart medicines, and treatment of kidney diseases.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 {{there were}} 22 {{reported}} cases of the disease while in 2016 there were 25. This is down from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 1986. In 2016 the disease occurred in three countries, all in Africa, down from 20 countries in the 1980s. It will likely be the first parasitic disease to be globally eradicated. <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm</b> disease has been known since ancient times. It is mentioned in the Egyptian medical Ebers Papyrus, dating from 1550BC. The name dracunculiasis {{is derived from the}} Latin [...] "affliction with little dragons", while the name [...] "guinea worm" [...] appeared after Europeans saw the disease on the Guinea coast of West Africa in the 17th century. Other Dracunculus species are known to infect various mammals, but do not appear to infect humans. Dracunculiasis is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Because dogs may also become infected, the eradication program is monitoring and treating dogs as well.|$|E
60|$|The Commandant {{said that}} this was {{unfortunately}} not the case. Two of his carriers had dysentery, and another a <b>guinea</b> <b>worm</b> in his leg; and there was only the little twinkle in Ormsgill's eyes to show that he did not believe him.|$|E

There was, however, no remedy, and they continued to tend the sick, setting those who had recovered to work as the pestilence slackened its grip. So, while groups of naked tribesmen whose tongue nobody therein could understand traveled southward past the camp, the days went by until Maxwell was supplied with one missing portion of his mosaic. One morning a seaboard negro, whose leg had been rendered useless by the horrible <b>Guinea</b> <b>worm</b> which had burrowed from knee to ankle, crawled into camp, and told a story which roused both listeners to suppressed fury.
