25|$|As {{water is}} pumped out, the bladder's walls are sucked inwards by the partial vacuum created, and any <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> inside the bladder becomes more concentrated. The {{sides of the}} bladder bend inwards, storing {{potential}} energy like a spring. Eventually, no more water can be extracted, and the bladder trap is 'fully set' (technically, osmotic pressure rather than physical pressure is the limiting factor).|$|E
25|$|When {{sedimentation}} continues, {{an older}} rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic {{pressure in the}} rock increases due to {{the weight of the}} overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this interstitial water is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by pressure solution. The <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching, increases pore space in the rock.|$|E

500|$|All animals need to {{keep the}} {{concentration}} of dissolved substances in their body fluids at a fairly constant level. Internal parasites and free-living marine animals live in environments with high concentrations of <b>dissolved</b> <b>material,</b> and generally let their tissues have the same level of concentration as the environment, while freshwater animals need to prevent their body fluids from becoming too dilute. Despite this difference in environments, most platyhelminths use the same system to control the concentration of their body fluids.

50|$|Sediment in rivers is transported {{as either}} bedload (the coarser {{fragments}} which move {{close to the}} bed) or suspended load (finer fragments carried in the water). There is also a component carried as <b>dissolved</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
50|$|Denudation {{incorporates}} the mechanical, {{biological and chemical}} processes of erosion, weathering and mass wasting. Denudation can involve the removal of both solid particles and <b>dissolved</b> <b>material.</b> These include sub-processes of cryofracture, insolation weathering, slaking, salt weathering, bioturbation and anthropogenic impacts.|$|E

5000|$|Solid waste means any garbage or refuse, sludge from a {{wastewater}} treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or an {{air pollution control}} facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities. Solid waste does not include solid or <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> in domestic sewage, solid or <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> in irrigation return flows, or industrial discharges. The large scope of the term [...] "solid waste" [...] means {{that it must be}} managed in a variety of different ways and that various levels of government employ different policy instruments in order to accomplish this task.|$|R

50|$|In 1906 {{he stated}} the von Weymarn law: Colloidal dispersions are {{obtained}} from very dilute or very concentrated solutions {{but not from}} intermediate solutions. The relativesupersaturation ratio herein is defined by S=(Q-L)/L (where Q {{is the amount of}} the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> and L is its solubility).|$|E
50|$|Supersaturation is a {{state of}} a {{solution}} that contains more of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> than could be dissolved by the solvent under normal circumstances.

50|$|The {{lake was}} first {{discovered}} by climbers in 1953. The lake {{is at the}} bottom of the crater of Licancabur, at a depth of 150 ft beneath the crater rim. A low content of <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> renders its waters clear. It is one of the highest lakes in the world.|$|E
50|$|Kipp {{generators}} {{only work}} properly in the described manner if the solid material is insoluble in the acid, as otherwise the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> {{would continue to}} evolve gas even after the level dropped. The produced gas often requires further purification and/or drying, due to content of water vapor and possibly mist if the reaction is vigorous.|$|E
5000|$|Pressure {{solution}} {{operates at}} moderate homologous temperatures and relatively low strain-rates and requires {{the presence of}} a pore fluid. The process of pressure solution {{is similar to that of}} Coble creep (grain-boundary diffusion), but involves {{the presence of a}} fluid film along the grain boundaries. Pressure solution is localized along a grain where the stress in the grain is high, often where the grains are in contact along surfaces that are at high angle to the instantaneous shortening direction. The solubility of a mineral in an aqueous fluid is higher where the crystal lattice is under high stress than where the stress is lower, and a locally higher density of crystal defects near high-stress sites may also enhance the solubility. The material at the high-stress sites is dissolved and will be redeposited at sites of low differential stress, changing the shape of the grains without internal deformation. The <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> can travel down a stress-induced chemical gradient to nearby sites of low solubility, called solution transfer, where the redeposition of the material can occur along free grain boundaries that are in contact with the fluid; newly precipitated material may be of a different mineral composition or phase than the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material,</b> known as incongruent pressure solution. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>material</b> may also flow over a large distance and deposit in sites such as veins or strain shadows, or migrate out of the deforming rock volume.|$|E
50|$|The {{free energy}} of the overall, {{isolated}} process of dissolution must be negative for it to occur, where the component free energies contributing include those describing {{the disintegration of the}} associations holding the original solute components together, the original associations of the bulk solvent, and the old and new associations between the undissolved and <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>materials</b> on turbid-water optical {{properties}} are assessed, {{by means of}} field measurements and laboratory simulations in which upwelled reflectance, attenuation, absorption, and backscatter spectral properties at wavelengths from 450 to 800 nm are examined in relation to water chemistry. The data show that <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>materials</b> decrease upwelled reflectance from turbid waters, and that the decrease in reflectance is a nonlinear function of concentration with the largest gradients at low carbon concentrations, depending on wavelength. Upwelled reflectance {{is found to be}} highly correlated with two backscatter-absorption parameters used in some optical models, which are nonlinear with <b>dissolved</b> organic <b>material</b> concentration change...|$|R
50|$|Brine mining is the {{extraction}} of useful materials (elements or compounds) which are naturally dissolved in brine. The brine may be seawater, other surface water, or groundwater. It differs from solution mining or in-situ leaching in that those methods inject water or chemicals to <b>dissolve</b> <b>materials</b> which are in a solid state; in brine mining, the <b>materials</b> are already <b>dissolved.</b>|$|R
50|$|Freeze {{distillation}} is a misnomer, {{since it}} is not distillation but rather a process of enriching a solution by partially freezing it and removing frozen material that is poorer in the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> than is the liquid portion left behind. Such enrichment parallels enrichment by true distillation, where the evaporated and re-condensed portion is richer than the liquid portion left behind.|$|E

5000|$|Undersaturation is a {{state of}} a {{solution}} that contains less of a <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> than could be dissolved by that quantity of solvent under normal circumstances. It can also refer to a vapor of a compound that has a lower (partial) pressure than the compound's vapor pressure. Undersaturation is often followed by ingassing of the solvate until saturation is reached. [...] Most states of solution involve undersaturation.|$|E
50|$|During its operations, the Sillamäe plant {{dumped the}} {{processing}} wastes into a tailing pond at the north-western part of Sillamäe near the Baltic Sea shoreline. By the 1990s, the pond presented a serious ecological hazard due to leaching of radioactive and other harmful particulates and <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> into Baltic Sea. In the 2000s, measures were undertaken {{to secure the}} containment of the wastes at Sillamäe.|$|R
50|$|Some Cooksonia species bore stomata, {{which had}} a role in gas exchange; this was {{probably}} to assist in transpiration-driven transport of <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> in the xylem, rather than primarily in photosynthesis, as suggested by their concentration at the tips of the axes. These clusterings of stomata are typically associated with a bulging in the axis at the neck of the sporangium, which may have contained photosynthetic tissue, reminiscent of some mosses.|$|R
5000|$|Several other water {{characteristics}} {{result from}} <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> {{in the water}} and are important to the proper simulation of natural environments. Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH of fresh water varies. [...] "Hardness" [...] measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.|$|R
5000|$|İnsuyu Cave is a {{good example}} of the {{dissolution}} of calcium bicarbonate inside the limestone structure. The dissolution typically causes cracks along the weak veins. [...] <b>Dissolved</b> <b>material</b> is transported by underground water. The limestone rock of the cave has a color ranging from white to light grey, and is composed of middle-sized crystals. The limestone rocks are overlaid as cliffs and reefs. Twisted layers and rugged surfaces are crisscrossed by calcite veins of about 2 - 3 cm thickness.|$|E
50|$|Two {{compounds}} {{used for}} such purposes are Epsom salts and EDTA. Epsom salts reduces the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow {{a small amount of}} extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the sulfate deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy. Residual EDTA in the lead-acid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal connectors.|$|E
50|$|In April 2011, the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant began operating, serving {{customers}} {{north of}} Des Moines. First, oxidation precipitates dissolved iron and manganese in shallow groundwater. Ultrafiltration (UF) membranes filter out particulate i.e. undissolved {{material in the}} water. Thereafter, part of the water will go through the reverse osmosis membranes, which have smaller pores than the UF membranes and filter out <b>dissolved</b> <b>material</b> in the water, targeting calcium and magnesium ions (water hardness) and for nitrate reduction.In July 2012, a new monthly pumpage record was set at 2,544.12 million gallons and a new record for daily pumpage at million gallons.|$|E
25|$|Water {{preferentially}} absorbs red light, and to {{a lesser}} extent, yellow, green and violet light, so the color that is least absorbed by water is blue light. Particulates and <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> may absorb different frequencies, and this will affect the color at depth, with results such as the typically green color in many coastal waters, and the dark red-brown color of many fresh water rivers and lakes due to dissolved organic matter.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{contamination}} in UPW is <b>dissolved</b> inorganic <b>material,</b> primarily silica. Silica {{is one of}} the most abundant mineral on the planet and is found in all water supplies. Any <b>dissolved</b> inorganic <b>material</b> has the potential to remain on the wafer as the UPW dries. Once again this can lead to a significant loss in yield. To detect trace amounts of <b>dissolved</b> inorganic <b>material</b> a measurement of non-volatile residue is commonly used. This technique involves using a nebulizer to create droplets of UPW suspended in a stream of air. These droplets are dried at a high temperature to produce an aerosol of non-volatile residue particles. A measurement device called a condensation particle counter then counts the residue particles to give a reading in parts per trillion (ppt) by weight.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{performance}} limitations the water discharged from API type separators usually requires several further processing stages before the treated {{water can be}} discharged or reused. Further water treatment is designed to remove oil droplets smaller than 150 micron, <b>dissolved</b> <b>materials</b> and hydrocarbons, heavier oils or other contaminants not removed by the API. Secondary treatment technologies include dissolved air flotation (DAF), Anaerobic and Aerobic biological treatment, Parallel Plate Separators, Hydrocyclone, Walnut Shell Filters and Media filters.|$|R
