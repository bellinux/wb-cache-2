5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto {{exposed to}} {{him during his}} visit to Peru in the late 1970s. He understood this instrument, which he saw as a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E

It held two public hearings in 2008, but by March 2009, {{although it was}} not formally disbanded, the {{commission was}} effectively dissolved when the majority of its members resigned. A number of factors have been cited as contributing to its failure, such as the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commander of the Batković concentration camp in its delegation, its limited legal standing, disputes over the commission's scope, and poor funding.|$|E
5|$|Maine's new {{attorney}} general, Richard S. Cohen (no {{relation to}} the senator) took over negotiations for the state; soon, each side made new concessions. In March 1980, draft legislation {{was approved by the}} tribes' joint negotiating committee and ratified by an advisory referendum of the tribes' membership. This vote also permitted the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in the settlement.

40|$|The system CaMgSi_ 2 O_ 6 -CaAl_ 2 SiO_ 6 -CaTiAl_ 2 O_ 6 {{was found}} to be {{significant}} for elucidating <b>the</b> crystallization <b>of</b> Ca-Al-rich <b>inclusions</b> in carbonaceous chondrites. Two clinopyroxenes (ss) (ss : solid solution) were found in the present system : One is Ti-bearing diopside (ss) and the other is Ti-pyroxene (ss) containing TiO_ 2 up to 8. 7 wt. %. <b>The</b> chemical composition <b>of</b> this Ti-pyroxene (ss) is very close to that of clinopyroxene found in Ca-Al-rich <b>inclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allende meteorite.

These data show that the films are always harder than the silicon, even when the films are thin (<b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 1000 A). Vacuum arc films were found to contain black carbon <b>inclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> a few microns in size, and clusters <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> tens of microns.

5|$|Written by Brian Hayles, {{this was}} {{submitted}} to the production office {{during the spring of}} 1971. The story involved an Ice Warrior plan to invade the Earth using a 'Z' beam which freezes things it strikes to absolute zero. When used on humans, it turns them into zombie-like slaves. Script editor Dicks rejected the storyline, but the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ice Warriors inspired the development of The Curse of Peladon.|$|E

5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding insisted on the removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E

5|$|Chad {{participated in}} 12 Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, Japan, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. The first boycott {{was because of the}} <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Chad joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to jokes that Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only be abolished by an amendment ratified by popular vote.

5|$|In 1931, the County Board of Supervisors {{agreed to}} submit the Campo road for {{consideration}} as a secondary state highway. The state considered the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Campo road {{into the system}} in 1932. The California State Legislature defined Route200 in 1933 as a route from San Diego to west of Jacumba, going through the town of Campo. The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935, and the road was paved that year. The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare the road a military highway to receive federal assistance for its improvement. Signs were posted for SR94 in 1937, and by 1938, SR94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard (later Federal Boulevard) before continuing east to Campo.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the <b>inclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
