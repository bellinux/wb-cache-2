25|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 2001, Columbia House Television began {{releasing}} I Love Lucy on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and would not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail order subscribers. All these DVDs have the identical features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets in retail.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{features}} of the Saint Petersburg Metro make it stand out amongst others, even those in the former USSR. It is customary to have stations in the centre of a city built very deep, not only to minimise disruption, but also, because of the Cold War threat, they were built to double as bomb shelters, and many old stations do feature provisions such as blast doors and air filters. In most cities, the lines become shallow or <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> run above ground as they reach the city's outer residential districts. However, {{this is not the case}} in Saint Petersburg. The difficult geology means that 56 out of 63 stations are at a deep level. The design and architecture went through numerous phases. The original stations were predominantly of the pylon type, of which there are 15 stations. Also popular was the column layout, and there are 16 such stations in the system.|$|E
25|$|After the 1952 season, Veeck {{suggested}} that the American League clubs share radio and television revenue with visiting clubs. Outvoted, he refused to allow the Browns' opponents to broadcast games played against his team on the road. The league responded by eliminating the lucrative Friday night games in St. Louis. A year later, Cardinals owner Fred Saigh was convicted of tax evasion. Facing certain banishment from baseball, {{he was forced to}} put the Cardinals up for sale. Most of the bids came from out-of-town interests, and it appeared that Veeck would succeed in driving the Cardinals out of town. However, just as Saigh was about to sell the Cardinals to interests who would have moved them to Houston, Texas, he instead accepted a much lower bid from St. Louis-based brewing giant Anheuser-Busch, who entered the picture with the specific intent of keeping the Cardinals in town. Veeck quickly realized that the Cardinals now had more resources than he could <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> match, especially since he had no other source of income. Reluctantly, he decided to leave St. Louis and find another place to play. As a preliminary step, he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals.|$|E

Hay secured a Georgian house on Carlton House Terrace, overlooking Horse Guards Parade, with 11 servants. He brought with him Clara, their own silver, two carriages, and five horses. Hay's salary of $17,000 [...] "did not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> cover the cost of their extravagant lifestyle".|$|E

500|$|Nintendo {{is often}} criticized for Mother 3 {{lack of an}} {{international}} release. IGN referred to the Mother series as [...] "neglected" [...] in regards to EarthBound being the only game to be released outside Japan.

500|$|Even {{prior to}} the Browns' announcement, rumors of the NFL's {{impending}} return had been enough to impair the Stallions' marketing efforts, and attendance for the team's semi-final against Winnipeg (played {{two days before the}} Browns' announcement) was a franchise low of 21,040. Once the Browns' move became official, what remained of local support for the Stallions dried up almost overnight. The team responded with desperate measures, essentially giving away thousands of tickets for what would become the final CFL game played in the United States, and announced a respectable attendance of 30,217 for their victory over San Antonio. Nevertheless, Speros quickly realized that as successful as the Stallions had been, they could not <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> compete with an NFL team; years later, he said that the Stallions would have effectively been [...] "minor league" [...] and faced great logistical problems with Memorial Stadium had they stayed in Baltimore.|$|E

500|$|The series, and {{specifically}} EarthBound, {{is known for}} having a cult following that developed over time well after its release. Colin Campbell of Polygon wrote that [...] "few gaming communities are as passionate and active" [...] as EarthBound, and 1UP.com Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following. Starmen.net hosted a Mother 25th Anniversary Fanfest in 2014 with a livestream {{of the game and}} plans for a remixed soundtrack. Later that year, fans released a 25th Anniversary Edition ROM hack that updated the game's graphics, script, and gameplay balance. The Verge cited the two-year-long Mother 3 fan translation as proof of the fan base's dedication, and Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell called it [...] "undoubtably one of the best known fan translations in existence", with active retranslations into other languages. Frank Caron of Ars Technica said that the fan translation's [...] "massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success", and that [...] "one cannot <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> fathom" [...] why Nintendo would not release their own English localization.|$|E

[...] At the fourth Nokia Music Connect video conference, Chopra said that the commercial numbers for [...] "In My City" [...] were all the more surprising, since the music sales in the Indian market is not that much. Universal Music MD, India, Saarc Devraj Sanyal said that the label was surprised with the instant sales of the song. [...] "We have been in the non-film music business for a while and I must admit to mounting engines across all platforms that have been fired like never before on Priyanka's global single debut.

In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may <b>even</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> decline.
