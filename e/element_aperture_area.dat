The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the interplay between age-related changes in the ability to perceive translational global motion (up vs. down) and important factors such as the spatial extent (size) over which movement occurs and how cluttered the moving elements are (density). We used random dot kinematograms (RDKs) and measured motion coherence thresholds (% signal elements required to reliably discriminate global direction) for young and older adults. We did so as a function of the number and density of local signal <b>elements,</b> and the <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> in which they were displayed. We found that older adults' performance was relatively unaffected by changes in aperture size, the number and density of local elements in the display. In young adults, performance was also insensitive to element number and density but was modulated markedly by display size, such that motion coherence thresholds decreased as <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> increased (participants required fewer local elements to move coherently to determine the overall image direction). With the smallest apertures tested, young participants' motion coherence thresholds were considerably higher (~ 1. 5 times worse) than those of their older counterparts. Therefore, when RDK size is relatively small, older participants were actually better than young participants at processing global motion. These findings suggest that the normal (disease-free) aging process does not lead to a general decline in perceptual ability and in some cases may be visually advantageous.

40|$|AbstractIn a Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR) field, rows of reflectors {{direct the}} {{incident}} sun rays towards a linear receiver. Some portion of reflector <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> gets shaded and blocked by neighboring reflector-rows. Thus, complete utilization of reflector <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> is hampered.

40|$|Wideband Multi-static radar {{provides}} scattering observations over frequency, time, and space, {{thus allowing}} for measurements in delay, Doppler, and angle-of–arrival (i. e., spatial frequency). Stationary targets ambiguous in delay and/or Doppler cannot be physically collocated, {{so that their}} spatial responses will not generally be ambiguous or even significantly correlated. As a result, a multi-static radar can be designed such that the sensor space-time-frequency ambiguity function produces no large (e. g., grating) lobes over a large illuminated area. The size of this “unambiguous” imaging area {{is dependent on the}} number of spatial apertures implemented in the wide band design, increasing in size as the number of spatial elements is increased. The constraint on this design is the value of the measurement clutter rank, as compared to the sensor measurement dimension. Essentially, the number of illuminated resolution cells cannot exceed the number of independent measured samples. Additional spatial <b>elements</b> (<b>apertures)</b> can increase the measurement dimension without affecting clutter rank. If a sufficient number of spatial elements are available, a SAR image can be formed for a distributed target of any clutter rank (i. e., resolution and image area). It can be shown that a necessary condition is that the total <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> must exceed the minimum <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> condition imposed on traditional (single aperture) SAR. However, in a multiaperture design, this total area does not determine, or limit, the extent of the illuminated area. The size of each individual element sets the illumination area, and thus adding spatial elements to a multi-static SAR design wil...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{individualized}} anatomic {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACL-R) is to reproduce each patient's native insertion site as closely as possible. The amount of the native insertion site that is recreated by the tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> is currently unknown, as {{are the implications of}} the degree of coverage. As such, the goals of this study are to determine whether individualized anatomic ACL-R techniques can maximally fill the native insertion site and to attempt to establish a crude measure to evaluate the percentage of reconstructed area as a first step towards elucidating the implications of complete footprint restoration. This is a prospective pilot study of 45 patients who underwent primary single-bundle anatomic ACL-R from May 2011 to April 2012. Length and width of the native insertion site were measured intraoperatively. Using published guidelines, reconstruction technique and graft choice were determined to maximize the percentage of reconstructed area. Native femoral and tibial insertion site area and femoral tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> were calculated using the formula for area of an ellipse. On the tibial side, tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> was calculated with respect to drill diameter and drill guide angle. Percentage of reconstructed area was calculated by dividing total tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> by the native insertion site area. The mean areas for the native femoral and tibial insertion sites were 83 ± 20 and 125 ± 20 mm(2), respectively. The mean tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> for the femoral side was 65 ± 17, and 86 ± 17 mm(2) for the tibial tunnel <b>aperture</b> <b>area.</b> On average, percentage of reconstructed area was 79 ± 13 % for the femoral side, and 70 ± 12 % for the tibial side. Anatomic ACL-R does not restore the native insertion site in its entirety.

40|$|A useful {{measure of}} sensor {{performance}} is the transceiver system efficiency n (sub sys). Which {{consists of the}} antenna efficiency n (sub a) and optical and electronic losses. Typically, the lidar equation and the antenna efficiency are {{defined in terms of}} the telescope <b>aperture</b> <b>area.</b> However, during the assembly of a coherent transceiver, it is important to measure the system efficiency before the installation of the beamexpanding telescope (i. e., the untruncated-beam system efficiency). Therefore, to accommodate both truncated and untruncated beam efficiency measurements, we define the lidar equation and the antenna efficiency in terms of the beam area rather than the commonly used <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> referenced definition. With a well-designed Gaussian-beam lidar, <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> referenced system efficiencies of 15 to 20 % (23 - 31 % relative to the beam area) are readily achievable.

50|$|In photography, {{reciprocity}} {{refers to}} the relationship whereby the total light energy - proportional to the total exposure, {{the product of the}} light intensity and exposure time, controlled by aperture and shutter speed, respectively - determines the effect of the light on the film. That is, an increase of brightness by a certain factor is exactly compensated by a decrease of exposure time by the same factor, and vice versa. In other words, there is under normal circumstances a reciprocal proportion between <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> and shutter speed for a given photographic result, with a wider aperture requiring a faster shutter speed for the same effect. For example, an EV of 10 may be achieved with an aperture (f-number) of 2.8 and a shutter speed of 1/125 s. The same exposure is achieved by doubling the <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> to 2 and halving the exposure time to 1/250 s, or by halving the <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> to 4 and doubling the exposure time to 1/60 s; in each case the response of the film {{is expected to be the}} same.|$|R

30|$|We also {{calculated}} the transmitted {{power of a}} horizontal nanoslit and a slanted nanoslit formed in a 150 -nm-thick film with {{the same amount of}} aperture opening (slit width of 60  nm). At 633  nm wavelength, the total transmitted power of the slanted nanoslit is found to be ~[*] 45 % of the horizontal nanoslit’s. This difference is partly ascribed to a smaller effective-aperture-area of a slanted nanoslit seen by an incident beam. The transmission efficiency of the horizontal nanoslit is estimated to be 120 %. Here the transmission efficiency is defined as the ratio of total transmitted power to the incident power that falls on the <b>aperture</b> <b>area,</b> that is, the throughput power is normalized by the <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> seen from the incident beam direction. It {{is interesting to note that}} the transmission efficiency is greater than 100 %. This implies the nanoslit transmission involves a funneling effect occurring at aperture edges on the incident side [34]. In the case of the 8 slanted nanoslit array lens (Fig.  3 a), the transmission efficiency is estimated to be 4.8 %. In this estimation, the total transmitted power is normalized by the input power that falls on the entire slit array, that is, 5.6  µm wide area. Considering the relatively large spacing between nanoslits, the reduction of overall transmission is explained by the fact that the total, effective <b>aperture</b> <b>areas</b> of 8 slits account for a small portion of the total lens area.|$|R
