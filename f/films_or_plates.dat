50|$|Microthermoforming is the {{abbreviation}} for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have {{structures in the}} micrometre range and have their technical function provided by {{the shape of the}} microstructure 1. Thermoforming 2 in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} use of Ilfochrome was for image capture directly {{inside a}} large format or ultra large format camera. This created a unique original positive photograph, {{in which the}} subject is reversed left-right unless a mirror or prism was used {{in front of the}} camera lens. A much longer exposure was required than with sheet <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> designed for use in a camera.

40|$|Summary. This paper investigates surface {{instability}} of a functionally graded and layered elastic film interacting with another flat rigid body [or interacting with another functionally graded and layered elastic <b>film</b> (<b>or</b> simply-supported elastic <b>plate)</b> ] through surface van der Waals forces under plane strain conditions. The shear modulus in each functionally graded layer {{is assumed to}} be exponentially varied in the thickness direction. A homogeneous elastic layer, which is the focus of this research, can be considered as a special case of the functionally graded layer by taking the magnitude of the gradient parameter to be very small. The solution for any functionally graded layer is obtained in terms of the pseudo-Stroh formalism; then the solution for the multilayered system is derived based on the transfer-matrix method. As a result the displacement and traction vectors at the top surface of the layered <b>film</b> (<b>or</b> <b>plate)</b> can be expressed in terms of those at the bottom surface of the layered <b>film</b> (<b>or</b> <b>plate).</b> We can thus obtain simple relationships between the surface normal traction and surface deflection. Expressions for the interaction coefficient {{as a function of the}} wave number of the instability mode are therefore obtained. The critical value of the interaction coefficient for {{surface instability}} and the associated instability mode can be determined easily by identifying the minimum of the interaction coefficient. An advantage of the present method lies in that it is very convenient to address a <b>film</b> (<b>or</b> a <b>plate)</b> with an arbitrary number of layers. The correctness of the present approach is verified by comparison with know...|$|R

40|$|Digital {{printing}} technologies {{introduced in}} 1994 opened new possibilities for printing high quality low quantity four color documents. Documents could be manufactured faster {{and at a}} more affordable cost than ever before. Along {{with the introduction of}} digital presses such as the Xeikon DCP- 1 and Indigo E-Print 1000 came the expectation that this new printing technology would grow at a highly accelerated rate. To the disappointment of many companies that invested in this technology, growth has been much slower than anticipated. Lack of market growth is attributed to an uninformed client base, one unable to understand how this technology can service its needs. When clients require only 50 to 1000 copies of a document, the issue of profitability exists. Digital presses are certainly more efficient with run lengths that are shorter since there are no <b>films</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates.</b> They require minimal make ready such as mounting plates and running the press until optimal inking of the substrate. Unlike conventional printing workflow, proofs are generated on the digital press when required. The inefficiencies in digital printing reside in the prepress function since the workflow is the same as traditional prepress {{with the exception of the}} proofing process. This is due to the high apportioned cost of prepress in relation to the short run length when compared to traditional printing. The purpose of this paper was to develop and show how an operational model predicts the profitability of prepress operations when digital printing with a Xeikon engine. Experience indicates that digital printing can be worthwhile despite the cost of prepress. The initial model assumed that all documents introduced into the work flow were press ready. Due to the variety of difficulties encountered in prepress production, a more accurate model could only be created after recording and analyzing relevant prepress data. The revised model provided better insight into prepress efficiency and profitability of digital printing using a Xeikon engine with some interesting results. Prepress operations including printing is responsible for about 25 % of the selling cost well under the typical 40 % goal set by industry standard. Since the average impressions run was over 550, additional time required to insure jobs submitted are press ready that even doubled the prepress time has little impact on the final cost of a job. This is due to the efficiency of the tools used to prepare jobs. The average length of time to prepare a job is 20 minutes, therefore, the use of 40 minutes would typically add less than seven dollars to the manufacturing cost of production. When prepress requires corrections the cost of prepress increases by less than half a percent, therefore, prepress is efficient since the cost of typical additional labor do not dramatically effect profitability...|$|E
40|$|Autoradiography uses a {{photographic}} <b>film</b> <b>or</b> imaging <b>plate</b> which {{are placed in}} direct contact with a painting after irradiation by slow neutrons. The pigments become radioactive after the interaction with the neutron beam and the emitted radiation gammas, X rays and electrons, so called beta rays is registered in the <b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate.</b> The blackening of the film is mainly due to the beta rays because the gamma rays are high energetic and hardly interact with the film. In this way the obtained picture can be called beta radiography, but since the radioactive elements in the painting itself are the source of beta rays, the technique is called autoradiography. In addition gamma spectrometry can be applied for detecting the emitted radiation from activated elements and by analysis of the position of the energy peaks and their intensity information about the chemical composition and the amount of the pigments can be obtained.

50|$|For the {{photographic}} process, a large-format glass plate negative is contact-copied onto a low contrast <b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate</b> {{to create a}} positive image. However, the positive copy is made with the copy material {{in contact with the}} back of the original, rather than emulsion-to-emulsion, so it is blurred. After processing this blurred positive is replaced in contact with the back of the original negative. When light is passed through both negative and in-register positive (in an enlarger for example), the positive partially cancels some of the information in the negative.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{instance}} of film holder is the sheet film holder. Also {{referred to as}} a dark slide or double dark slide, they are flat devices, slightly larger than the films they hold, which commonly hold one sheet of film on each side. The plate holder, which is a very similar device, holds glass plates instead of sheet film. A dark slide, from which the device derives its alternate name, is simply a dark cover that slides into a recess in the holder to protect the <b>film</b> (<b>or</b> <b>plate)</b> from exposure to light. Many dark slides have differently colored bands or handles on each side, one usually light and the other dark, so the photographer can distinguish between exposed and unexposed film.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of photometers which {{accurately}} measure the brightness of astronomical objects, the apparent magnitude of an object was obtained by taking {{a picture of it}} with a camera. These images, made on orthochromatic photoemulsive <b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates,</b> were more sensitive to the blue end of the visual spectrum than the human eye or modern photometers. As a result, bluer stars have a lower (i.e. brighter) photographic magnitude than their modern visual magnitude, because they appear brighter on the photograph than they do to modern photometers. Conversely, redder stars have a higher (i.e. fainter) photographic magnitude than visual magnitude, because they appear dimmer. For example, the red supergiant star KW Sagittarii has a photographic magnitude of 11.0 to 13.2 but a visual magnitude of about 8.5 to 11. It is also common for star charts to list a blue magnitude (B) such as with S Doradus and WZ Sagittae.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the product}} of tube current and {{exposure}} time, measured in milliampere-seconds (mA·s), is the primary controlling factor of radiographic density, kVp also affects the radiographic density indirectly. As the energy (which {{is proportional to the}} peak voltage) of the stream of electrons in the x-ray tube increases, the x-ray photons created from those electrons are more likely to penetrate the cells of the body and reach the image receptor (<b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate),</b> resulting in increased radiographic density (compared to lower energy beams that may be absorbed in the body {{on their way to the}} image receptor). However, scattered x-rays also contribute to increased radiographic density: the higher the kVp of the beam, the more scatter will be produced. Scatter is unwanted density (that is, density created without bringing any pertinent information to the image receptor). This is why kVp is not primarily used to control density - as the density resulting from increasing kVp passes what is needed to penetrate a part, it will only add useless information to the image.|$|R
40|$|The {{photographic}} camera uses a {{converging lens}} {{to form a}} real, inverted image of an object. The image is focused on a <b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate</b> which is coated with an emulsion containing silver bromide crystals.

When the plate is 2 ̆ 2 fixed, 2 ̆ 2 the remaining emulsion {{is removed from the}} plate, so that the image is made permanent. In most cameras the converging lens consists of several elements designed and arranged to reduce objectionable aberrations to a minimum. In general, the lens is designed for a particular arrangement of image and object, as in a camera, where the object is usually much farther from the lens than is the image. A camera lens designed to minimize aberrations for an infinitely distant object may not be well corrected for 2 ̆ 2 close-ups. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|First {{examples}} of processes coming near {{to something that}} could be called ‘microthermoforming’ originate from {{the second half of the}} nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated 9. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated 10. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned <b>film</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate</b> made from an easily deformable, e.g. elastomeric material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called ‘rubber-assisted hot embossing process’ 11.|$|R
