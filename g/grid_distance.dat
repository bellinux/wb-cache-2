The distance of the mid-latitude convection becomes larger than four grids in Δ 1.7 and Δ 0.87. Interestingly, the distance to the mid-latitude convection in the coarse resolution has another peak around one grid. This indicates the convections occur close to one another. When the convection core is resolved with multiple grid points in Δ 1.7 and Δ 0.87, the number of convections with one <b>grid</b> <b>distance</b> is dramatically decreased and the number of convections with larger <b>grid</b> <b>distance</b> is increased as well. This also supports that convections in the mid-latitudes are resolved and have a realistic distance to the nearest convection cores in the simulation of less than 2  km. In contrast, the <b>grid</b> <b>distance</b> between convections over the tropics is distributed widely, with the peak at four to five grids. Since the increasing ratio of the convection number does not change significantly around Δ 1.7 and Δ 3.5, the <b>grid</b> <b>distance</b> also does not change drastically. However, the distance becomes larger than four grid points in Δ 0.87. Meanwhile, the change of <b>grid</b> <b>distance</b> between convection cores can be seen from Δ 1.7 to Δ 0.87 in the whole area. It also supports that most of the convections would be resolved with multiple grid points in Δ 0.87. In short, the resolution dependence of the convection shows different trends in the tropics and the mid-latitude area.|$|E

30|$|Realizing {{accurate}} {{detection of}} an unknown radio transmitter (URT) has become a challenging problem due to its unknown parameter information. A method based on received signal strength difference (RSSD) fingerprint positioning technique and using factor graph (FG) for 2 -D scenario has been developed. However, the URT positioning under 3 -D scenario is more difficult with {{the large number of}} unknown parameters and has greater practical significance. In addition, the previous RSSD-based FG model is not accurate enough to express the relationship between the RSSD and corresponding location coordinates since the RSSD variances of reference points are different in practice. This paper proposes a more accurate 3 -D FG model to reduce the influence of difference of RSSD measurement variances on positioning accuracy effectively by utilizing weighted least square (WLS). With the proposed RSSD-based 3 -D WLSFG model and sum-product rule, positioning process of the proposed 3 -D RSSD-WLSFG algorithm is derived. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we also explores the effects of different signal receiver numbers and <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> on positioning accuracy. The simulation experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain the best positioning performance compared with the conventional K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and RSSD-FG algorithm under different <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> and signal receiver numbers.|$|R
40|$|Registration {{algorithms}} {{often require}} {{the estimation of}} grey values at image locations that do not coincide with image grid points. Because of the intrinsic uncertainty, the estimation process will invariably {{be a source of}} error in the registration process. For measures based on entropy, such as mutual information, an interpolation method that changes the amount of dispersion in the probability distributions of the grey values of the images will influence the registration measure. With two images that have equal <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> in one or more corresponding dimensions, a large number of grid points can be aligned for certain geometric transformations. As a result, the level of interpolation is dependent on the image transformation and hence, so is the interpolation-induced change in dispersion of the histograms. When an entropy based registration measure is plotted as a function of transformation, it will show sudden changes in value for the grid-aligning transformations. Such patterns of local extrema impede the optimization process. More importantly, they rule out subvoxel accuracy. Interpolation-induced artefacts are shown to occur in registration of clinical images, both for trilinear and partial volume interpolation. Furthermore, the results suggest that improved registration accuracy for scale-corrected MR images may be partly accounted for by the inequality of <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> that is a result of scale correction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: With the {{increased}} use of RTK GPS, local ground-based coordinate systems are increasingly being used to represent ground distances on plans. Through their use, the incorrect representation of ground distances on plans can be minimised. However, many of the users of such systems do not know the limitations of these systems. This dissertation developed and analysed two local ground-based coordinate systems based on Transverse Mercator and Tangent Plane projections. The method involved establishing local ground-based coordinate systems at an average project height at which <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> approximately equalled ground distances over small areas. The testing focused on distance and angular errors caused purely by the process of projection. Other site dependent variables have also been assessed, including the effect of site height above and below projection level and the effect that the longitude of the site has on the distance accuracy of a site. It was concluded that the major limiting factor, when using local ground-based coordinate systems, is the error in <b>grid</b> <b>distances</b> when compared to measured ground distances. The results obtained show a variation in error distribution between the coordinate systems, depending on the method of projection used. The results illustrate a number of accurate areas within which a number of defined measurement accuracies and magnitudes are not exceeded. The limits of the systems were found to be approximately 3 km east/west in a Transverse Mercator projection and 19 km in any direction in a plane system, from the central point of the site, before RTK GPS measurement accuracy is exceeded by projection distortion. The need for quantification of errors in local ground-based coordinate systems is significant as they are used to produce plan distances when using RTK GPS. If used outside the limits defined in this dissertation, errors will occur in the plan distances resulting from the use of such systems...|$|R
