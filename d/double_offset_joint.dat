40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>offset</b> {{calibration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important methods to improve the positioning accuracy for industrial robots. This paper presents an efficient method to calibrate industrial robot <b>joint</b> <b>offset.</b> The proposed method mainly relies on a laser pointer mounted on the robot end-effector and a position sensitive device (PSD) located in the work space arbitrarily. A vision based control was employed to aid the laser beam shooting at the center of PSD surface from several initial robot postures. For each shoot, the laser beam was a line in space which can be determined by the robot joint angles and their offsets which were recorded when the laser beam was brought to the center of the PSD surface. Therefore, there are several lines in space parameterized by robot <b>joint</b> <b>offsets</b> only and all these lines were constrained by the same point, that is, the center of the PSD surface. Consequently, an optimization model was formulated and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm was employed to identify the <b>joint</b> <b>offsets.</b> The developed calibration system was implemented on an ABB industrial robot IRB 1600 successfully.

In this study, we have experimented {{on the nature}} snake and analyzed the link-type structure&# 39;s character in detail, {{and then we have}} proposed a novel link-type shape shifting modular robot. The key advantage of this design over other link-type vehicle is their adaptability and flexibility for its various configurations. Robot in such link type can change its configuration to adapt to the environment and mission by reconfiguring and shape shifting. A standard module is mainly composed of a link arm, a link handle, an <b>offset</b> Pitch <b>joint,</b> an <b>offset</b> Yaw <b>joint,</b> and the track driven system.

Finite element code SAP 2000 was used to study the stresses distribution within the specimens. Four-nodded isoperimetric plain strain element with two degree of freedom per node, and the three-nodded constant strain triangular element with two degree of freedom per node were used in the present study. The {{results of the present study}} explained the formation of wing cracks at the tip of the joints for low confining stress as well as the formation of wing cracks at the middle of the joint for the higher confining stress. High shear stresses found in the numerical study at the tip of the joints explained the formation of secondary cracks at the tip of the joints in the experimental study. The study results coincide with the experimental observations which showed that for bridge inclination of 0 o, the coalescence occurred due to shear failure and for bridge inclination of 90 o the coalescence occurred due to tensile failure while for the other bridge inclinations coalescence occurred due to mixed tensile and shear failure.

50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance <b>double</b> <b>offset</b> butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of groundwater in bedrock is largely determined by interconnected fractures and their apertures. The conditions by which fractures become interconnected are thus of primary importance in understanding permeability and groundwater yield.

We present boundary-element models on the formation of interconnected fracture pathways with application to the coastal areas of West Norway. In the models, we use external tensile stress and internal fluid overpressure; loading conditions {{that are likely to}} have been operative in large parts of Norway during the Holocene. The external tensile stress results indicate that many fracture pathways form by the linking up of <b>offset</b> <b>joints</b> through transverse shear fractures. Other pathways, however, are formed by linking up of joints and contacts through tensile stresses associated with the tips of propagating hydrofractures. How the fracture pathways form may affect the subsequent permeability. In particular, transverse shear fractures are likely to have relatively small apertures and limit the groundwater transport...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The term “competition {{for space}} ” occurs often in {{ecological}} literature, {{but there has}} never been a direct demonstration of this competition. In fact it has been shown that plant canopies are mainly empty of plant organs. F. E. Clements recognized this. He suggested that one of the few situations in which competition for space would occur was in an unthinned row of radishes. Even this has never been demonstrated. We sowed radishes (Raphanus sativa) in a dense row and let them grow to maximum size in favourable conditions. For comparison, the same number of radish seeds were sown in a <b>double,</b> <b>offset</b> row. Squeezing the radish plants into one row was largely compensated by sideways movement of their hypocotyl/taproots, but total plant mass was reduced by 7. 5 %. Even this cannot be definitely attributed to competition for space. We conclude that competition for space, if it exists at all, is only a small effect even in conditions very favourable for it.

In this experimental study, the scale effect on failure mechanisms and compressive strength of rock blocks was investigated. Samples of rock with non-persistent <b>offset</b> <b>joints</b> were subjected to uniaxial loading. The angle of orientation of the rock bridge {{with respect to the}} applied axial load {{and the size of the}} block were studied. Two different block sizes, having dimensions of (63. 5 × 28 × 20. 3) cm and (30. 5 × 15. 24 × 10) cm, were tested. The joint inclination angle was maintained at 22. 5 ° in both cases. Also, degree of persistence was kept constant at 0. 3 for all tested blocks. However, the offset angle which connects the inner tips of the joints was changed from 30 °- 90 ° with an increment of 15 °. The results showed a reduction in strength with increasing the size of the sample. This reduction is becoming more significant as the bridge inclination angle increases. This behavior is due to the fact that as the bridge inclination angle increases the mode of failure shifted from shear to tension mode which is more dependent on the size of sample due to the presence of more micro flaws. No effect of block size was noticed on mode of failure for the tested blocks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{industrial}} robot has high repeatability but low accuracy. With the {{industrial robot}} being {{widely used in}} complicated tasks, e. g. arc welding, offline programming and surgery, accuracy of the robot {{is more and more}} important. Robot calibration is an efficient way to improve the accuracy. Previous methods such as using coordinate measurement machines, laser trackers or cameras are limited by the cost, complex operation or the resolution. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose an approach and calibration equipment to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method relies mainly upon a laser pointer attached on the end-effector and single position-sensitive devices (PSD) arbitrarily located on the workcell. The automated calibration procedure (about three minutes) involves aiming the laser lines loaded by the robot towards the center of the PSD surface from various robot positions and orientations. The localization is guaranteed by precise PSD feedback servoing control, which means physically the intersections of each pair of laser lines (virtual lines) are on the same point. Based on the untouched single-point constraint, the robot <b>joint</b> <b>offset</b> calibration is implemented. Using the authors' proposed approach, a portable, low-cost, battery-powered, wireless and automated calibration system was implemented. Error analysis was conducted on the system. Findings - The localization error of the developed calibration system is within 2 ?m. The errors in joint space are magnified in PSD plane, and consequently the resolution in the joint space is improved. The standard deviation of the identified parameters was small (10 - 2), indicating the stability of the calibration method. Both simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate the developed calibration system can identify <b>joint</b> <b>offset</b> with uncalibrated laser tool parameters. Originality/value - The paper shows how a portable calibration system for <b>joint</b> <b>offset</b> of industrial robots was developed and how the goal of fast, automated, low-cost, portable, and high precision calibration methods for <b>joint</b> <b>offset</b> was achieved. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Robot calibration {{is the process of}} identifying certain parameters in the kinematic structure of an industrial robot, such as the relative position of robot links.

Level-1 calibration only models differences between actual and reported joint displacement values, (also known as mastering). Level-2 calibration, also known as kinematic calibration, concerns the entire geometric robot calibration which includes angle <b>offsets</b> and <b>joint</b> lengths. Level-3 calibration, also called a non-kinematic calibration, models errors other than geometric defaults such as stiffness, joint compliance and friction.

40|$|Observation {{of human}} {{movements}} provides {{a rich source}} of information about the physical and internal states of those around us. The thesis examines behavioural and brain responses to movement observation. The thesis starts by examining how observers' visual perception of point-light displays of human arm movements is influenced when the movements are perturbed by the introduction of temporal offsets into position data. From this it extends the technique of movement perturbation to whole-body ballet movements and examines, in novices and experts, the effect of temporal offsets put into position and joint-angle representations of movement. Finally, it measures event-related brain potentials (ERP) in response to viewing these original and perturbed ballet movements. Chapter 2 describes four experiments investigating the visual perception of point-light human movement when increasing levels of temporal offset are introduced to position and joint angle representations of movement. Temporal offsets into position preserve local motion of elements but cause displays to become less coherent in form and motion with increasing offsets. Temporal <b>offsets</b> into <b>joint</b> angles preserve the piecewise rigid structure of the body regardless of offset, but show less of the natural coordination for increasing offsets. Res~lts showed that at high noise levels the effects of temporal offsets were much' less when introduced into joint angles than position. In addition, an effect of expertise was only evident at low levels of offset. Chapter 3 examined stimulus relevant ERP elicited from posterior cortical areas in response to the ballet movements with and without temporal <b>offsets</b> into <b>joint</b> angles. An early negative response (N 150 - 170) over bilateral inferior parietotemporal region was found to be modulated by temporal offset.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) can be {{used for}} joining weld lands that vary in {{thickness}} {{along the length of the}} weld. An adjustable pin tool mechanism {{can be used}} to accomplish this in a single-pass, full-penetration weld by providing for precise changes in the pin length relative to the shoulder face during the weld process. The difficulty with this approach is in accurately adjusting the pin length to provide a consistent penetration ligament throughout the weld. The weld technique, control system, and instrumentation must account for mechanical and thermal compliances of the tooling system to conduct tapered welds successfully. In this study, a combination of static and in-situ measurements, as well as active control, is used to locate the pin accurately and maintain the desired penetration ligament. Frictional forces at the pin/shoulder interface were a source of error that affected accurate pin position. A traditional FSW pin tool design that requires a lead angle was used to join butt weld configurations that included both constant thickness and tapered sections. The pitch axis of the tooling was fixed throughout the weld; therefore, the effective lead angle in the tapered sections was restricted to within the tolerances allowed by the pin tool design. The sensitivity of the FSW process to factors such as thickness <b>offset,</b> <b>joint</b> gap, centerline <b>offset,</b> and taper transition offset were also studied. The joint gap and the thickness offset demonstrated the most adverse affects on the weld quality. Two separate tooling configurations were used to conduct tapered thickness welds successfully.

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of hip reconstruction {{has been and}} continues to be a perplexing problem with restoring leg length, femoral <b>offset,</b> <b>joint</b> stability and overall hip implant fixation. These were contributing factors that lead {{to the development of a}} novel proximal femoral component design “Apex Modular Stem” (Omni, Raynham, MA). The basic stem geometry features a straight stem with a metaphyseal fit and fill cone, a medial triangle and a modular neck junction that allows for version and offset adjustment. In recent years, there has been great concern with the use of modularity in total hip arthroplasty. The goals of this study are (1) to identify complications with the use of a proximal modular design and (2) demonstrated factors that have eliminated those complications. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a single surgeon series (Design A and Design B) of using the same cementless stem and proximal modular neck body (Apex Modular Stem and Omni Mod Hip Stem) from 2000 to 2016 totaling 2, 125 stems. 483 stems were the Design A and 1, 642 stems, were of the Design B style. Results: Design A, 483 stems were implanted between 2000 and 2004. 31 alignment pins sheared resulting in a revision rate of 6. 4 %. Design B, 1, 642 stems have been implanted between 2004 and 2016 all by the same surgeon, with no failures of the modular junction. Conclusion: All implant devices entail a multitude of risks and benefits. The Apex Modular Stem (Design A), provided excellent fixation, minimal risk of modular junction  corrosion, and simple control of anteversion and femoral offset. The limitation was found to be the risk of the alignment pin shearing (6. 4 %). The pin was enlarged to make it 225 % stronger in torsional resistance, and in a subsequent series of over 1, 600 femoral stems in a single surgeon series, there were no pin failures over a  12 year duration...|$|R
