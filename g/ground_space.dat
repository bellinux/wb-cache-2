5|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} the western (1875) train shed roof should be retained in new development; consequently it was repaired and reinforced between 1982 and 1984, followed by repairs {{to the main}} roof completed in 1987. Initial plans included the widening of the stations' exit by two tracks to make eight, with 22 platforms in a layout {{similar to that of}} Waterloo station; the combined Broad Street and Liverpool Street station was to be {{at the level of the}} latter, with relatively low-rise office developments. Poor use of land value caused the development to be reassessed in 1983/4, when it was decided to retain the existing six-road exit throat and 18-platform layout, in combination with resignalling; this resulted in a station confined to the Liverpool Street site, with <b>ground</b> <b>space</b> released for development. In 1985 British Railways signed an agreement with developers Rosehaugh Stanhope and work on the office development, known as Broadgate, began.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — On-chip {{transmission}} lines in silicon technologies {{suffer from the}} low-resistivity substrate and geometry limitations imposed by layout and metal density design rules. In this paper, we demonstrate that multilayer coplanar waveguide (MCPW) {{transmission lines}} can be utilized to overcome both problems {{by taking advantage of}} multiple metal layers available. We studied the effects of <b>ground</b> <b>spacing</b> on MCPW characteristics using electromagnetic simulations, based on process parameters from a 0. 18 �m standard digital CMOS technology with 0. 01 Å-cm P+ substrate. Simulation results show that by adjusting the <b>ground</b> <b>spacing,</b> we can control the characteristics impedance, effective dielectric constant, and attenuation of MCPW lines. A test chip was designed and fabricated with MCPW, regular CPW, and microstrip lines. Measurement results verified the analysis and simulation results. I...|$|R

25|$|The André Labarrère Intercommunal Library, on Place Marguerite Laborde, is {{the work}} of {{architect}} Daniel Rubin, and opened its doors in June 2012.

Originally laid down on a section of Beaumont Park as part of a project by architect Zaha Hadid (Priktzer 2004 Award winner), financial and technical constraints changed the views of the mayor in early 2007 and finally brought the media library to a part of the site occupied by the Henry-IV School.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a fast {{geometric}} rectification {{method for}} space-borne SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) digital image in slant range with no ground control point is introduced, {{which is based}} on the imaging principle of SAR and the law of geometric distortion in slant range image. The main idea is at first to resample a slant range SAR image to a ground range image with a definite <b>ground</b> <b>spacing</b> because the <b>ground</b> <b>spacing</b> corresponding to each pixel in slant is different caused by the different view angle. The coordinate system of the resampled image can be recognized as a plane rectangular coordinate system formed by the flight direction and the ground range direction. For the plain areas, the ground range image can be transformed into the image in a projected geographic coordinate system by four corner points whose ground coordinates can be calculated by the imaging equation. The rectified image is obtained with high accuracy; While for the areas with fluctuation topography, a higher precision rectification can be made based on the ground range image for it maintains the information of the original SAR slant range image(ground range and flight height) ...|$|R
