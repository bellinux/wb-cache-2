40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a visual psychophysical investigation of the relationship between two important printer parameters: addressability (expressed in terms of <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> or <b>DPI)</b> and grayscale capability (expressed {{in terms of the number}} of graylevels per pixel). The photographic image quality of print output increases with both the printer DPI and the number of graylevels per pixel. The experiments described in this paper address the following ques-tions: At what point is there no longer a perceptual advantage of DPI or graylevels, and how do these two parameters tradeoff? The design of imaging peripherals is an optimization problem bounded by the information content in the signal, the tech-nology of the transmitter and the capabilities of the receiver. When designing a printer or a display, we must consider whether we want to optimize the quality of text, graphics or images. We are constrained by the capabilities of the imaging device (displays and printers) and the capabilities of the receiver (our human consumers) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Advent {{of digital}} imaging {{technology}} revolutionized radiology science, {{one aspect of}} which is indirect digital imaging technique. In this technique scanners or digital cameras are used to digitize radiographs. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare diagnostic quality of conventional periapical radiographs digitized with scanners and cameras. Materials and methods: In this in vitro study 40 radiographs were digitized with two scanners and two cameras in the six following methods: 3 - and 5 -Megapixel Fuji digital cameras, 5 -MP Canon digital camera, 450 <b>dot</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> and 600 <b>dpi</b> Epson scanners and 600 dpi HP scanners. A total of 240 images were prepared. Four specialists and general dental practitioners were asked to observe 4 anatomic landmarks (periodontal ligament, root apex, lamina dura and cancellous bone) on the conventional and digitized radiographs, score the qualities from 1 to 3 and record them in a check list. SPSS software was used for data analysis by ANOVA and Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. (α = 0. 05) Results: Analog radiographs received higher scores compared to the two digitization techniques (p value < 0. 001), with higher diagnostic value scores for the images of the digital cameras (p value < 0. 001). Conclusion: Analog images were superior to digital images in the present study. It appears the habitual and repeated visualization of conventional radiographs and the quality and age of the cameras, scanners and monitors used in this study all had an influence on the results.

(A4 = 210 × 297 mm) However, the term <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>dpi)</b> is still used when printing images.

5000|$|The {{measures}} <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>dpi)</b> and pixels {{per inch}} (ppi) are sometimes used interchangeably, but have distinct meanings, especially for printer devices, where dpi {{is a measure}} of the printer's density of dot (e.g. ink droplet) placement. [...] For example, a high-quality photographic image may be printed with 600 ppi on a 1200 dpi inkjet printer. [...] Even higher dpi numbers, such as the 4800 dpi quoted by printer manufacturers since 2002, do not mean much in terms of achievable resolution.|$|E

5000|$|Pixelation is {{a problem}} unique to bitmaps. Alternatives such as vector {{graphics}} or purely geometric polygon models can scale to any level of detail. This is one reason vector graphics are popular for printing [...] - [...] most modern computer monitors have a resolution of about 100 <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch,</b> and at 300 <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> printed documents have about 9 times as many pixels per unit of area as a screen.

50|$|Printing at 1,200 <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>DPI)</b> {{leads to}} a {{theoretical}} maximum of 1,440,000 colored dots per square inch. If a scanner can reliably distinguish between 256 unique colors (thus encoding one byte per dot), the maximum possible storage is approximately 140 megabytes for a sheet of A4 paper - much lower when the necessary error correction is employed. If the scanner were able to accurately distinguish between 16,777,216 colors (24 bits, or 3 bytes per dot), the capacity would triple, but it still falls well below the media stories' claims of several hundred gigabytes.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{implementation of a}} laser printer was the IBM 3800 in 1976. It was designed for data centers, where it replaced line printers attached to mainframe computers. The IBM 3800 was used for high-volume printing on continuous stationery, and achieved speeds of 215 pages per minute (ppm), at a resolution of 240 <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>dpi).</b> Over 8,000 of these printers were sold. The Xerox 9700 was brought to market in 1977. Unlike the IBM 3800, the Xerox 9700 was not targeted to replace any particular existing printers; but, it did have limited support for the loading of fonts. The Xerox 9700 excelled at printing high-value documents on cut-sheet paper with varying content (e.g. insurance policies).|$|E
50|$|Raster {{graphics}} are resolution dependent, {{meaning they}} cannot scale {{up to an}} arbitrary resolution without loss of apparent quality. This property contrasts with the capabilities of vector graphics, which easily scale up {{to the quality of}} the device rendering them. Raster graphics deal more practically than vector graphics with photographs and photo-realistic images, while vector graphics often serve better for typesetting or for graphic design. Modern computer-monitors typically display about 72 to 130 pixels per inch (PPI), and some modern consumer printers can resolve 2400 <b>dots</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>DPI)</b> or more; determining the most appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can pose difficulties, since printed output may have a greater level of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor. Typically, a resolution of 150 to 300 PPI works well for 4-color process (CMYK) printing.|$|E

Line arts can be either traced over scanned drawings or hand drawn on the computer itself by the use of a mouse or a graphics tablet and are often shared among other pixel artists in diverse websites in order to receive some feedback. Other techniques, some resembling painting, also exist, such as knowledge of the color theory. The limited palette often implemented into pixel art usually promotes the use of dithering in order to achieve different shades and colors (when necessary); hand-made anti-aliasing is also used for smoother purposes. A pixel artist will exponentially increase the zoom of whatever they are working on to make adjustments as needed and then view the results until desired changes are achieved.|$|E
