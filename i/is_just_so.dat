And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

I did do a couple scenes with him that I was really proud of, and they were right before the two of them make love for the first time. There were two scenes where Genevieve bares her soul to him.

500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "I {{loved this}} episode for... its careful {{layering}} {{and expansion of}} the series’ key themes, and for the way it’s setting us up for a truly superb, universe-shaking episode when Fringe returns Dec. 2." [...] The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining he enjoyed the episode more than the previous visit to the parallel universe because [...] "the last five minutes or so of 'The Abducted' were more compelling than the case-of-the-week. But not far more. The Candy Man <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> creepy—and his crime so powerfully symbolic—that I felt better about this episode overall than I did about 'Amber." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Sting" [...] was {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show.

Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show, later telling IGN that filming both [...] "The Sting" [...] and his scenes for other episodes was [...] "a blast" [...] and [...] "a kick to do" [...] because The Office is [...] "such a fun show, {{the nature of the}} whole thing.

I started doing pretty much half of that riff you hear on Rock n Roll and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> exciting that we thought, [...] "let’s just work on this". The riff and the sequence was really immediate to those 12-bar patterns that you had in those old rock songs like Little Richard, etc, and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> spur-of-the-moment {{the way that it}} just came together more or less out of nowhere.|$|R

500|$|Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine {{described}} the anime as [...] "delightfully witty {{and even an}} educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like." [...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E
500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{generally}} well received, being praised by many critics for its writing. In a 2009 review for Slate, Josh Levin wrote that [...] "The greatness of 'Stark Raving Dad' {{has a lot}} more to do with The Simpsons writing staff than with Jackson's voice-over talents. The show's scripters came up with a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." [...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that [...] "This episode is vintage Simpsons, crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> weird anyway that he fits right in." [...] Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune commented that [...] "throwaway lines on The Simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [...] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," [...] singling out jokes like the America's Funniest Home Video parody. [...] "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." [...] In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what [...] "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments", and further elaborates that while [...] "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." [...] He concluded that the episode [...] "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" ...|$|E

500|$|The Futon Critic {{placed the}} episode {{first in the}} site's annual [...] "50 Best Episodes" [...] list. [...] E! said that [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was {{possibly}} [...] "the best episode ever of the entire series." [...] TV Guide described [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as [...] "a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling [...] spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted." [...] IGN gave the double episode a perfect 10/10 – the best review of the season – saying it was [...] "nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative." [...] IGN would conclude that the flashforward was the [...] "Biggest Shock" [...] in 2007 television. Both IGN and The Los Angeles Times would later declare [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as the second best Lost episode, behind [...] "The Constant". BuddyTV praised the unpredictability, saying that [...] "no other show can even attempt to do what Lost does." [...] BuddyTV would later call [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] the best finale of 2007 and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007. [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was TV.coms [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] for [...] "Best Episode" [...] of 2007. [...] AOLs TV Squad gave the episode a 7/7, noting that [...] "the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer." [...] Television Without Pity gave the third season finale an [...] "A". [...] The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Lost [...] "may have unjumped [...] with [...] flashforward." [...] Entertainment Weekly ranked {{it as one of}} the top ten episodes of 2007, saying that the cliffhanger [...] " [...] new dimensions to [...] creative world." [...] Zap2It questioned [...] "whether to be deeply frustrated (again), really, really confused (a distinct possibility) or just in awe of the incredible mind-(ahem) show runners… have pulled off." [...] The writing for Locke was criticized, and one IGN writer said that [...] "it seems irrational that he would go and [...] in the back without explaining himself." [...] Lindelof stated [...] "that we might be willing to give [...] the benefit of the doubt for any action he took in response to , even if considered slightly 'out of character'."

2500|$|Seasons {{three and}} four had an equally harsh reception. Los Angeles Times said [...] "Even just a half-hour in, it's {{difficult}} not to wish everyone would just lighten the heck up.

[...] New York Post said [...] "This show, which was once so thrilling and fun, has become full of itself, its characters spouting crazy nonsense." ...|$|E

[...] Sacramone added: [...] "I don't think she necessarily gets enough credit for how well she competes. At the last two world championships, I don't think she's made any mistakes. She's the backbone. If you want her to go and do something, do a solid routine, she's going to do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The filming {{captured}} them at {{the height}} of their early days, when all three women had hair either naturally or dyed blonde.

2500|$|After unveilling her {{new record}} deal in August 2011, Norwood finally {{revealed}} {{that she had}} found her sound for Two Eleven, stating: [...] "What I'm truly excited about is how the album is all about R and figuring out the new sound of R, {{and that was the}} challenge for me. I wanted to do something different – I didn't want to just sing about love over regular beats". Norwood also stated how Frank Ocean inspired her on this album: [...] "We've always had that great chemistry, and we both understand music in the same ways, to work with him on this album was great as well, and I hope I can get in [...] with him some more because his music <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> moving; I'm inspired by him.

[...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one.

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Hannigan used her own experiences in high school—which she called [...] "overwhelmingly depressing"—to guide her portrayal of Willow: [...] "My theory on high school was, get in, get out and hopefully I won't get hurt. Basically it was a miserable experience, because you're a walking hormone in this place that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>so</b> cruel. There were times that were OK, but it's not the little myth that high school is the best years of your life. No way." [...] Whedon intended Willow to be realistically introverted, saying, [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E
