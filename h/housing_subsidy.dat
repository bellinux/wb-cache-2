500|$|The main {{objective}} of this compliance requirement is that only eligible individuals or organizations participate in federal assistance programs. While the criterion for determining eligibility may vary from program to program, the objective that only eligible individuals or organizations participate is consistent across all federal programs, which forms {{the basis of this}} compliance requirement. To comply with this objective, recipients must first assure that proper eligibility determinations are made, which means that the recipient must determine the parameters and limitations to define eligibility for a specific program in accordance with the program’s purpose. Many federal programs already contain eligibility requirements based on laws, agency regulations, grant agreements, etc., and recipients must assure that their eligibility determination complies with such requirements. An example includes federal programs that offer HIV/Aids treatment and require that the participants be victims of such diseases. It is usually the recipient’s responsibility to determine how to determine such eligibility, such as establishing policy that requires an in-house doctor or laboratory to diagnose each prospective participant, accepting diagnoses from third-party doctors or laboratories, etc. However, certain agencies have included specific parameters for which the recipient should follow, {{as in the case of}} the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which states in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that recipients of certain HUD <b>housing</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs must obtain specific income verification documents to prove participant [...] eligibility, such as W-2 payroll forms, a federal income tax return, etc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{research}} has shown an association between homelessness and unstable housing and HIV risk but most has relied on relatively narrow definitions of housing status that preclude {{a deeper understanding of}} this relationship. Fewer studies have examined access to <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> and supportive <b>housing</b> programs among low-income populations with different personal characteristics. This paper explores personal characteristics associated with access to <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> and supportive <b>housing,</b> the relationship between personal characteristics and housing status, and the relationship between housing status and sexual risk behaviors among low-income urban residents. Methods Surveys were conducted with 392 low-income residents from Hartford and East Harford, Connecticut through a targeted sampling plan. We measured personal characteristics (income, education, use of crack, heroin, or cocaine in the last 6 months, receipt of welfare benefits, mental illness diagnosis, arrest, criminal conviction, longest prison term served, and self-reported HIV diagnosis); access to <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> or supportive <b>housing</b> programs; current housing status; and sexual risk behaviors. To answer the aims above, we performed univariate analyses using Chi-square or 2 -sided ANOVA's. Those with significance levels above (0. 10) were included in multivariate analyses. We performed 2 separate multiple regressions {{to determine the effects of}} personal characteristics on access to <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> and access to supportive housing respectively. We used multinomial main effects logistic regression to determine the effects of housing status on sexual risk behavior. Results Being HIV positive or having a mental illness predicted access to <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> and supportive <b>housing,</b> while having a criminal conviction was not related to access to either <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> or supportive <b>housing.</b> Drug use was associated with poorer housing statuses such as living on the street or in a shelter, or temporarily doubling up with friends, acquaintances or sex partners. Living with friends, acquaintances or sex partners was associated with greater sexual risk than those living on the street or in other stable housing situations. Conclusions Results suggest that providing low-income and supportive housing may be an effective structural HIV prevention intervention, but that the availability and accessibility of these programs must be increased. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks at}} the affordability of housing and the distributional impact of <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies,</b> in Flanders and the Netherlands. We analyze housing affordability according to income groups and tenure type. Furthermore, we explore how <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> are distributed over these groups, {{and to what extent}} they affect income inequality and poverty. Additionally, the aim is to demonstrate the value of a comprehensive conceptual approach in a comparative analysis. In both the affordability and subsidy analysis two methodological approaches are used: a cash-flow (short-term) and a user cost (long-term) approach. Flanders and the Netherlands are interesting cases for comparison since the tenure structure and <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> largely differ, as a result of different policy choices in the past. The analyses are based on survey data for the period 2005 / 2006 and administrative data of <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> in 2008. The study reveals that in both Flanders and the Netherlands, about 14 % of households are confronted with unaffordable housing, according to the budget method (cash-flow approach). In both cases, the group with an affordability problem is relatively larger for tenants than for owner-occupiers and the largest in the lowest income quintile. The user cost analysis points out that owner-occupiers  in a period of rising house prices  also have a significantly lower user cost of housing than tenants. For both Flanders and the Netherlands in 2005 / 2006 the expected value increase of owner-occupied dwellings exceeded all the costs involved. Furthermore, for Flanders, the results point at a clear duality between private and social housing with regard to income composition, actual rent and subsidy impact. The Flemish social housing is rather small and, compared to the private rented sector, rents are relatively low and strongly subsidized. Due to a weak income profile of social tenants in Flanders, affordability based on the budget method turns out worse for this group than for private tenants. In the Netherlands, the differences between private and social renting in terms of actual rent, affordability and subsidy impact are far more limited. Rent in social housing is subsidized to the same extent as in Flanders (half of the market rent) whereas subsidization in the private rental market is considerable. While tenants in the Flemish private rented sector are hardly subsidized, in the Netherlands the discussed <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> are received by both private and social tenants. In Flanders social housing is the measure that targets the poor, while housing allowances fulfill this role in the Netherlands. With regard to the owner-occupied sector, the heavily debated mortgage tax relief is found to increase income inequality, more so in the Netherlands than in Flanders. In the Netherlands, overall, <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> are relatively more directed at tenants and lower income groups. In contrast, in Flanders overall housing subsidization is disproportionally received by higher incomes groups and owner-occupiers. This means that in Flanders <b>housing</b> <b>subsidies</b> are generally not directed at the groups with the most affordability problems. nrpages: 173 status: publishe...|$|R
