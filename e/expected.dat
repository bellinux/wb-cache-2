5|$|On May 22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC (CPC) {{released}} their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific {{season was}} <b>expected</b> to be hindered by the decades-long cycle {{that began in}} 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal level of activity in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16named storms, of which 6–8 were <b>expected</b> to become hurricanes, and 1–3 <b>expected</b> to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility was also <b>expected</b> to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones <b>expected</b> to form or cross into the area.

40|$|Many {{programs}} {{demand to}} be run interactively. Word-processors are good examples, but many network applications (e. g., ftp, telnet) share the same fault. They cannot be run non-interactively. <b>Expect</b> is a software tool designed to control interactive programs. <b>Expect</b> reads a script that resembles the dialogue itself but which may include multiple paths through it. <b>Expect</b> can run any program locally or remotely in order to automate a task. <b>Expect</b> successfully deals with interactive programs and is particularly useful in a networked environment in which dissimilar machines must communicate. <b>Expect</b> solves the problem of "stick the password in the script " {{as well as several}} other long-standing problems with traditional work-arounds in these areas. <b>Expect</b> also provides the needed support for regression testing, network and computer load generation, and conformance testing in a networked environment. In practice, <b>Expect</b> has entirely relieved numerous computer scientists and network managers of tasks that previously had to be performed by hand. The investment in writing <b>Expect</b> scripts is a minimal one-time cost. <b>Expect</b> is free and in the public domain. <b>Expect</b> is in use in hundreds of companies and universities in the U.

Complexation of dubnium is <b>expected</b> to follow group 5 trends in its richness.

5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium is not <b>expected</b> to behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is <b>expected</b> to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are <b>expected</b> to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are <b>expected</b> {{to be similar to}} lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be <b>expected</b> from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is <b>expected</b> to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
