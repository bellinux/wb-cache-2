50|$|The above table {{illustrates}} two commonly discussed {{important differences}} between the PCE deflator and CPI-U. The first is {{the relative importance of}} housing, which {{is due in part to}} the difference in scope mentioned above. CPI contains a large component of owner-equivalent rent, which by definition is an imputed value and not a real <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The second major difference in weight is healthcare. This again stems from the definition of the index and the surveys used. CPI measures only the out-of-pocket healthcare costs of households where PCE includes healthcare purchased on behalf of households by third parties, including employer-provided health insurance. In the United States, employer health insurance is a large component and accounts for much of the difference in weights.|$|E

50|$|For {{determination}} of membrane potentials, {{the two most}} important types of membrane ion transport proteins are ion channels and ion transporters. Ion channel proteins create paths across cell membranes through which ions can passively diffuse without <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure</b> of metabolic energy. They have selectivity for certain ions, thus, there are potassium-, chloride-, and sodium-selective ion channels. Different cells and even different parts of one cell (dendrites, cell bodies, nodes of Ranvier) will have different amounts of various ion transport proteins. Typically, the amount of certain potassium channels is most important for control of the resting potential (see below). Some ion pumps such as the Na+/K+-ATPase are electrogenic, that is, they produce charge imbalance across the cell membrane and can also contribute directly to the membrane potential. Most pumps use metabolic energy (ATP) to function.|$|E

The car chase, the sex scene, the nudity... and of course the music themes.... We were naive. The approach to enticing great performances from actors, or the passionate need to tell an important story was not an underlying rationale. None of the parameters of current day movie-making prevailed. I don't really remember the driving force except for that of the Aussie film industry's need for a serious contemporary picture...we tried for that.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} {{the findings from}} ex ante and ex post economic impact appraisals of six major sports events. The ultimate aim of the paper is to identify the factors that cause differences between forecasts of <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure</b> and figures based on primary research. Design/methodology/approach - A <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure</b> forecast for each event was derived based on analysis of event documentation and informed assumptions applied from previous studies. Subsequently, a comprehensive study was undertaken involving primary data collection and associated desk research. Findings - Of the forecasts, three were inflated and three were conservative relative to the ex post figures. Two potential sources of variance are examined – visitor spending and organisational expenditure. The former {{was found to be}} more unpredictable when compiling a pre-event forecast. The group for which <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure</b> is most difficult to predict is spectators, with the most exaggerated forecasts associated with free-to-view events. Research limitations/implications - Neither input-output nor computable general equilibrium models were used to analyse secondary, indirect or induced impacts. Nonetheless, <b>direct</b> <b>expenditure</b> is the basis for modelling wider impacts and is therefore worthy of consideration in its own right. Practical implications - The findings of this study should enable public sector agencies to better understand the reliability of projected figures presented to them by organisers in exchange for securing financial support for their events. Originality/value - Economic impact forecasts are rarely subjected to post-event scrutiny. This research bridges the gap between ex ante and ex post figures and identifies areas where forecast accuracy can be improved. </p...|$|E

40|$|Cooperatives are an {{important}} form of business organization in North Dakota; 405 cooperatives were operating {{in the state in}} 2004, with most (224) related to agriculture (farm supply, agricultural processing, and grain handling). In addition, 33 utility, 66 financial, and 82 cooperatives classified as "other" were operating in the state in 2004. Cooperatives exist to enhance sale price, reduce costs, or provide a service or product for their member-owners, but they also contribute significantly to the state's economy. This report will provide estimates of the contribution North Dakota cooperatives make to the state economy measured in terms of such key economic indicators as retail trade, personal income, total business activity, employment, and tax revenue. North Dakota cooperatives' in-state <b>direct</b> <b>expenditures</b> totaled $ 2. 0 billion in 2004. The largest expenditure category was the household sector ($ 802. 0 million) which was comprised of payroll, patronage refunds, and stock retirement. The <b>direct</b> <b>expenditures</b> were applied to an input-output model to estimate total economic impacts. Total economic contribution resulting from cooperatives' <b>direct</b> <b>expenditures</b> was $ 6. 1 billion in 2004, including $ 2. 2 billion in personal income, and $ 1. 5 billion in retail trade activity.
