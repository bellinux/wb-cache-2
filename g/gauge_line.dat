5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail line from the existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect this narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Haridwar {{station is}} {{situated}} on the Delhi–Dehradun and Howrah–Dehradun railway lines. One of the main railheads of the Northern Railways, Haridwar Junction Railway Station is connected by broad <b>gauge</b> <b>line.</b> Roorkee comes under Northern Railway region of Indian Railways on the main Punjab – Mughal Sarai trunk route and is connected to major Indian cities.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the Automatic Block System, Automatic and Track Control (ATC) has since been introduced, which {{provides}} the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> to Albury, {{and then on the}} main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2007 Network Statement, {{the total}} {{length of the}} {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> was approximately 1665 km, while {{the length of the}} metre <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> (excluding Krioneri-Missolonghi-Agrinio line) is about 725 km. In addition, about 150 km of new standard <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> towards Athens Airport and to replace metre <b>gauge</b> <b>lines,</b> became fully operational in July 2007.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the few}} {{existing}} narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> of the Satpura narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines,</b> the Nainpur-Chhindwara-Itwari line terminates here.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s {{the break}} of gauge at Albury was eliminated, {{with the opening}} of the North East {{standard}} <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> in 1962. The new line aided freight traffic between the state capitals, and enabled though passenger trains, such as the Southern Aurora and the Intercapital Daylight. At the same time the sixties was also the end of steam, with the demolition of the massive North Melbourne Locomotive Depot on 20 January 1961.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and intermodal trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|Victoria's first railway was a 4km Victorian broad <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> {{between the}} Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on {{the site of}} modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), {{constructed}} by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. Today, Melbourne's suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines, the central City Loop subway, and 200 stations, with a total length of 372km of the electrified lines, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria.|$|E
50|$|Most {{railways}} are {{operated by}} RENFE; narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> are operated by FEVE and other carriers in individual autonomous communities. It is proposed to build or convert more standard <b>gauge</b> <b>lines,</b> including some dual gauging of broad <b>gauge</b> <b>lines,</b> especially where these lines link to adjacent countries.|$|R

5000|$|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad - Standard <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> {{completed}} dieselisation in September 1956; narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> ended revenue {{operation in}} 1968, never dieselizing ...|$|R
5|$|As over 86% of Uttarakhand's terrain {{consists}} of hills, railway services are very limited {{in the state}} and are largely confined to the plains. In 2011, the total length of railway tracks was about 345km. Rail, being the cheapest mode of transport, is most popular. The most important railway station in Kumaun Division of Uttarakhand is at Kathgodam, 35 kilometres away from Nainital. Kathgodam is the last terminus of the broad <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> of North East Railways that connects Nainital with Delhi, Dehradun, and Howrah. Other notable railway stations are at Pantnagar, Lalkuan and Haldwani.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|Mysore {{railway station}} has three lines, {{connecting}} it to Bengaluru, Mangalore and Chamarajanagar. The first railway line {{established in the}} city was the Bengaluru–Mysuru Junction metre <b>gauge</b> <b>line,</b> which was commissioned in 1882. All railway lines that serve the city are single track at some points {{and the rest of}} the stretch is double track, impeding faster connections to the city. All trains that connect to Mysuru are operated by South Western Railway Zone, Hubli of Indian Railways. The fastest train to serve the city is the Shatabdi Express.|$|E
5000|$|Metre and [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> {{are found}} in South America. Some of the [...] <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> cross {{international}} borders, though not as efficiently as they might.|$|R
5000|$|Lighter weight railways, notably narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> with no {{need for}} interchange, {{sometimes}} use smaller (three-quarter- or half-size) versions of the Janney MCB coupler. [...] Such as Victorian narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From the 1890s, narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> (...) {{were built}} to {{complement}} the broad <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> (...) [...] Most of the narrow-gauge railways were later converted to broad gauge, but then dismantled {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|R
5|$|When {{parliament}} {{passed the}} building of the Bergen Line in 1894, the Roa–Hønefoss branch line was made part of the plans; but the line was given a separate name indicating that the Bergen Line would continue from Hønefoss to Oslo in a more direct route. But after the finish of the Bergen Line, other important mainline routes, in particular the Dovre Line, Sørland Line and Nordland Line, combined with the effort to convert narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>line,</b> took precedence. Ideas for the additional construction of the Ringerike Line were pressed by commercial interests in Ringerike in both 1890 and 1906, but failed both times.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 Colonial Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act, which {{authorised}} fifty-nine {{new lines}} to almost {{every corner of}} the colony, and thus became known as the Octopus Act. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was also this decade that the first narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three other lines following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s the majority of the colony was now covered in railways, {{with the exception of the}} Mallee country in the north west of the colony which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.|$|E
5|$|The railway line {{connecting}} Tiruchirappalli Junction {{railway station}} to Chennai Egmore via Thanjavur, the Main Line {{is a historical}} line established by South Indian Railway Company in 1879. The Great South Indian Railway Company (GSIR) operated a broad gauge rail service between Nagapattinam and Tiruchirapalli via Thanjavur between 1861 and 1875. During 1875 it was converted to a meter <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> (MG line). Modern day Thanjavur railway junction has three rail heads leading to Tiruchirapalli, Kumbakonam and Thiruvarur. Thanjavur is connected by rail with most important cities and towns in India. There are daily express trains to Chennai, Mysore, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur, Tiruchirapalli, Salem, Karur, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Rameswaram, Tiruchendur, Cuddalore, Dharmapuri, Viluppuram, Chengalpattu, Mannargudi, Bengaluru, Dindigul, Pudukkottai, Karaikudi, Sivagangai Manamadurai and weekly trains to Tirupati, Nellore, Itarsi, Visakhapatnam, Hubli, Vasco da Gama, Goa, Vijayawada, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Satna, Katni, Allahabad, Varanasi and Bhubaneswar. There are frequent passenger trains from the city to towns like Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Tiruchirapalli, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai and Nagore.|$|E
50|$|By the 1930s, road {{competition}} {{began to take}} its toll on the railways, and the rail network needed pruning. The narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> suffered most severely from {{road competition}}; many {{thousands of miles of}} narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> closed during the 1930s. By the 1950s the once extensive narrow gauge system had practically become extinct. Many minor standard <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> also closed. The French railway system today has around 40,000 km of track.|$|R

Costed at £44.3 million.|$|R
50|$|On narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines,</b> Rollbocks or {{transporter}} wagons are used: {{standard gauge}} wagons are carried on narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>lines</b> on these special vehicles, generally with rails {{of the wider}} gauge to enable those vehicles to roll on and off at transfer points.|$|R
25|$|The metre <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> between Guingamp and Paimpol was {{converted}} to dual gauge in 1924. With {{the removal of}} the metre gauge third rail in 1953, the line became standard gauge only between Guingamp and Paimpol. The conversion of the metre <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> to standard gauge between Carhaix and Guingamp was completed on 3 July 1967.|$|E
25|$|A set of replica white wooden {{crossing}} gates {{separate the}} narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>line</b> {{from the standard}} gauge track and continue the Network Rail boundary fencing. They are left open when a crossing controller is present.
