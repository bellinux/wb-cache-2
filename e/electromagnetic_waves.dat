5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|Since photons {{contribute}} to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a gravitational attraction on other objects, according {{to the theory of}} general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity; their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in gravitational lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would be predicted for classical <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E

The analyzer passes the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> through a Fresnel biprism that produces a probe pulse and a gated pulse. The probe pulse and the gated pulse intersect and interact in a nonlinear optical medium, such as a second harmonic generating (SHG) crystal. The nonlinear optical medium then time gates and frequency filters the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> producing an input pulse gated signal.

5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, {{it can take}} minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E
5|$|The {{number and}} value of {{contracts}} coming to the station significantly increased during World War II; the 1943–1944 budget {{was the first in}} which industry and government contracts exceeded the station's other income, most notably, its state appropriation. Director Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the Georgia General Assembly had cut the station's appropriation by 40%, but increased support from industry and government eventually compensated for lower state funding. World War II is credited with GTRI's entry into electronics, especially telecommunications and electronic warfare; the electronics and communications work that Director Rosselot attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research. Two of the larger projects were a study on the propagation of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> and United States Navy–sponsored radar research.|$|E

40|$|Phoxonic crystal as a {{means of}} guiding and {{confining}} <b>electromagnetic</b> and elastic <b>waves</b> has already attracted attentions. Lack of exact knowledge on how these two types of waves interact inside this crystal and how <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> evolves through this interaction has increased this field complexity. Here we explain how an elastic <b>wave</b> affects an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> through photo-elasticity and interface displacement mechanisms in a phoxonic crystal slab waveguide. We obtain a master equation which can describe <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> evolution. In this equation we define a coupling parameter and calculate its value for different modes of <b>electromagnetic</b> and elastic <b>waves</b> and show it vanishes for some types of modes.

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{characteristic of}} plasma antenna is investigated {{by using the}} finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach in this paper. Through using FDTD method, we study the propagation of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> in free space in stretched coordinate. And the iterative equations of Maxwell equation are derived. In order to validate the correctness of this method, we simulate the process of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagating in free space. Results show that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> spreads out around the signal source and can be absorbed by the perfectly matched layer (PML). Otherwise, we study the propagation of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> in plasma by using the Boltzmann-Maxwell theory. In order to verify this theory, {{the whole process of}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagating in plasma under one-dimension case is simulated. Results show that Boltzmann-Maxwell theory can be used to explain the phenomenon of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagating in plasma. Finally, the two-dimensional simulation model of plasma antenna is established under the cylindrical coordinate. And the near-field and far-field radiation pattern of plasma antenna are obtained. The experiments show that the variation of electron density can introduce the change of radiation characteristic...|$|R
5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted low state support.

5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic field acted {{as a source of}} an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Boyd {{returned}} to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, {{where he worked}} as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an Army Air Corps-sponsored project studying microwave propagation. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia Tech and Mount Oglethorpe in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled Propagation Studies of <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Waves,</b> {{which resulted in a}} series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on radar-directed fire control. Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia Tech and the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.|$|E

40|$|Disclosed herein is an {{apparatus}} and method for detecting a selected material that change an {{effective dielectric constant}} of a circular resonator. An example of the apparatus includes an input waveguide, an output waveguide and a circular resonator. The input waveguide receives <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> from an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> source. The circular resonator is located adjacent to the input and output waveguides, which enables the resonator to receive <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> from the input waveguide. The circular resonator bonds to a selected material, e. g. chemical gas, chemical liquid, and bio-agent. The selected material can change the effective dielectric constant of the circular resonator, which in turn causes {{a change in the}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> intensity of the circular resonator.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scattering}} of ultrarelativistic electrons {{by a strong}} plane <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> of a low (optical) frequency and linear polarization is solved in the semiclassical approximation, when the electron wave packet size is {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave.</b> The exit momenta of ultrarelativistic electrons scattered are found using the exact solutions to the equations of motion with radiation reaction included (the Landau-Lifshitz equation). It is found that the momentum components of electrons traversed the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> depend weakly on the initial values of momenta. These electrons are mostly scattered at small angles to the propagation direction of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave.</b> The maximum Lorentz factor of electrons crossed the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is proportional to the work done by the electromagnetic field and is independent of the initial momentum. The momentum component parallel to the electric field vector of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is determined solely by the laser beam diameter measured in the units of the classical electron radius.

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays in 1895, just as {{the studies}} of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain {{of the nature of}} X-rays, but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation, in other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of light—specifically, the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation—was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, X-rays are composed of photons, and thus are not only waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X-rays from electrons. Therefore, these particle-like properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were not electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that X-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
