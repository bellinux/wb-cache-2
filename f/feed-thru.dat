50|$|Seaboard International is {{a privately}} held {{manufacturer}} of highly engineered {{oil and gas}} pressure control equipment providing services for worldwide onshore and offshore oil & gas exploration, drilling and production operations. Seaboard began development of wellhead and electric <b>feed-thru</b> connector product lines in 1974 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas, United States.|$|E
40|$|The three boxes being {{reviewed}} all {{operate at}} a pressure {{of less than}} 15 psig. Since they are relieved at 13 psig, they fall outside the scopes of the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Fermilab Engineering Standard SD- 37 B, and Chapter 5031 of the Fermilab Safety Manual, therefore a Pressure Vessel Engineering Note showing compliance with SD- 37 B is not required. In calculating the design stresses, only {{the largest of the}} three boxes, the signal board <b>feed-thru</b> box, was analyzed. This box had the largest spans and areas and would experience the largest pressure-related forces. The thinnest walls of each box were found to be in the top plates and they were also the side of the box which exposed the largest amount of area to internal pressure. The signal board <b>feed-thru</b> box top plate had at least twice the pressure area than either the instrumentation or hi-voltage boxes' top plates. This large disparity overshadows the slight difference in top plate thicknesses between the three boxes (0. 56 -inch vs. 0. 25 -inch and 0. 3125 -inch, respectively). Therefore, we felt the analysis of the larger signal board feedthru box would justify the design of the smaller instrumentation and hi-voltage boxes. Appended to the end of this engineering note are the weld procedure, assembly report and the pressure test procedure & results for the signal <b>feed-thru</b> box. Also, included as a reference is a list of the drawing numbers for the parts and assembly of the signal board <b>feed-thru,</b> instrumentation and hi-voltage boxes...|$|E
40|$|A novel package, which {{consists}} of a carrier housing, has been developed for monolithic-millimeter wave Integrated Circuit amplifiers which operate at 30 giga-Hz. The carrier has coplanar waveguide (CPW) interconnects and provides heat-sinking, tuning, and cascading capabilities. The housing provides electrical isolation, mechanical protection and a <b>feed-thru</b> for biasing...|$|E
40|$|The `Full Chip' module of an ASIC {{is made up}} {{of various}} {{partitions}} and similar to individual partitions, it also goes through various stages of the physical design. The initial design-planning works on the existing pins of a partition, adds <b>feed-thru</b> pins and performs custom placement and routing on signal and clock nets. Near tape-in, ECO (Engineering Change Order) forces manual changes to design as opposed to taking it through full implementation cycle. At the final stages, when layout database of each partition meets the requirements, a bottom up integration is carried out to create full chip layout. All these stages can create logical differences between layout and RTL of the top level interface. In order to verify that no unintentional logical change has happened to full chip, a robust formal verification strategy with numerous practical considerations is necessary. Designers also make use of 100 % or partial shell models at the floor-planning phase which does bring advantages but also creates challenges for the formal verification flow. This article documents these challenges by explaining the formal verification approach taken on Intel's next generation network processing chip...|$|E
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic <b>feed-thru</b> connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|E
