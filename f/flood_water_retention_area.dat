40|$|The {{essential}} {{processes and}} mechanisms of {{the transport of}} contaminants from a river to a well field via a <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>area</b> are presented. The transport is conceptualized as a succession of three phases: (1) contaminant entry into the retention area, (2) passage through the soil zone and (3) transport with the groundwater flow. Depending on the conditions of a given location and on {{the properties of the}} contaminants of interest, processes within each transport phase may reduce the concentration of the contaminants at the well field. For the Kastenwoert-Rappenwoert study area, the results of the described processes are shown by chemical and ecotoxicological analyses as well as by numerical modelling. Based on the results of the analyses, it is predicted that some contaminants in the study area will be completely detained along the transport path, while others will be transported as far as the well field, although in significantly reduced concentrations...|$|E

50|$|The Upper Rhine plays a {{key role}} in flood control on the Middle and Lower Rhine. As a result of the {{straightening}} of the Upper Rhine, floods from the Alps now reach the Middle Rhine much faster than in the past. Thus, the risk of such a peak coinciding with a flood peak of Neckar, Moselle or Main has increased. About 123 km2 of flood plain have been lost. Authorities in riparian states of France, Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate have launched the Integrated Rhine Programme, a framework for designating <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>areas.</b> to combat downstream flooding. A French-German treaty was concluded in 1982, in which the parties agreed to restore the retention capacity on the stretch below Iffezheim to the level it had before the area was developed.|$|R

40|$|Wetlands are {{transitional}} lands between terrestrial {{and aquatic}} systems that provide many goods and services, including <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> <b>retention,</b> <b>water</b> quality maintenance, wildlife habitat, and soil erosion control. Wetlands in Iowa have decreased over 95 % {{in the last}} 200 years. The loss of these resources and benefits shows a need to map and monitor wetlands in Iowa, especially where current wetland maps are outdated, {{as is the case}} in Black Hawk County. Traditional wetland ground surveys are too time consuming and expensive though, and remote sensing imagery can provide time and cost-effective solutions. This study tests the feasibility of using high resolution airborne Color Infrared (CIR) imagery, multi-spectral hybrid data, and high resolution hyper-spectral imagery to map and monitor wetlands in Iowa. In addition, this project compares traditional classifiers with an object-oriented (OO) classification technique to improve wetland mapping accuracy. Wetlands in Black Hawk County showed a slight decrease of roughly 1500 acres (+/- an error margin of 375 acres) from 1983 - 2003. In general, the OO classifier performed better than traditional pixel-based techniques (Maximum Likelihood and ISODATA) for the CIR and Landsat imagery and better than the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) technique for the hyperspectral image.

50|$|The first rain gardens {{were created}} to mimic the natural <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>areas</b> that {{occurred}} naturally before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in Prince George's County, Maryland, when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing subdivision had the idea to replace the traditional best management practices (BMP) pond with a bioretention area. He approached Larry Coffman, the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea. The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a 300 - 400 sq ft rain garden on each house’s property. This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead {{of a system of}} curbs, sidewalks, and gutters, which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install. This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events. Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75-80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.|$|R

Large amount of nutrient and soil leach arable land, both causing surface water euthrophication and a bigger sedimentation in fishponds. Is it possible to moderate these harmful effects? 3.

This article studies the role of individual agency in sociotechnical niches by using Kingdon’s agenda-setting model. Although strategic niche management is commonly used to study processes of urban innovation, the process of niche formation {{and the role of}} individual agency has been understudied. We will introduce the notion of the ‘niche entrepreneur’ as an actor who, analogous to Kingdon’s policy entrepreneur, connects the elements that are needed to develop a successful niche that allows learning for sustainability transitions. We will study the process of niche formation and the role of individual entrepreneurship therein, and identify the strategies that have been used by individuals to create a successful niche. This will be done for three cases in urban systems integration: the development of Eva Lanxmeer, a residential district in a drinking <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>area</b> in Culemborg, the Netherlands; the transformation of the waste management practices of Lille Métropole Urban Community, France; and the development of the urban district Hammarby Sjöstad, Sweden.

In response, the IRMA-SPONGE research programme was established, consisting of 13 research projects, in which over 30 organizations from six countries co-operated. The aim of IRMA-SPONGE was the development of methods and tools {{to assess the impact}} of flood risk reduction measures and of land-use and climate change scenarios, in order to support the spatial planning process for the Rhine and Meuse River Basins. Several important conclusions were agreed upon by participants in the programme; they emphasize the role of spatial planning, especially in areas at risk of flooding, as an important component of flood risk management: 1 Flood risk, defined as a function of both flood probability and potential damage, is increasing not only due to climate change (likely to cause an increase in the probability of extreme discharges) but also due to continued investment in areas at risk of flooding (resulting in an increase in potential damage). 2 <b>Water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>areas</b> and land-use adaptations far upstream may be useful in lowering the frequency of floods in small basins. However, extreme floods far downstream in the lower Rhine and Meuse basins, where the probability of design discharges is less than 1 / 200 per year, cannot be prevented by such upstream measures. 3 The most effective and sustainable reduction of flood risks could be achieved by reducing the potential damage (vulnerability) in flood-prone areas through adapted land use and spatial planning. 4 Flood risk management organizations should not only aim at a reduction of flood risk but should also seek to enhance the ecological quality of rivers and floodplains...|$|R

40|$|Dhaka {{is one of}} the world’s largest megacities with a {{high rate}} of urbanization. Due to the setting of greater Dhaka in a deltaic plain, it is {{extremely}} prone to detrimental flooding. Risks associated with flood are expected to increase in the coming years because of the global climate change impacts as well as the high rate of urbanization the city is facing. The low lying part of Dhaka (Dhaka East) faces most severe risk of flooding. Traditionally, this part has been efficiently storing the excess water caused by excessive rainfall and the canals connected to the rivers gradually drained the water to the rivers. But the alarmingly increasing population of Dhaka is leading towards the encroachment of these <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>areas</b> because of the land scarcity. The natural drainage for the city is not performing well and the area is still unprotected from flooding, which causes major threats to its inhabitants. This situation increases the urgency to effectively adapt to current floods caused by climate variability and to the impacts of future climate changes. The government is planning several adaptive measures to protect the area whereas a systematic framework to analyze and assess them is lacking. The objective of the paper is to develop an integrated framework for the assessment of various (current and potential) adaptation measures aimed at protecting vulnerable areas from flooding. The study firstly assesses current and future risks from flooding in the most sensitive region of the city. Subsequently, the study identifies, analyses and assesses adaptive initiatives and measures to address flood risks in the Eastern fringe area. Adaptation assessment is conducted within the framework of Multi Criteria Analysis methodology which allows both normative judgment and technical expertise in the assessment process. Based on the assessment and analysis, adaptive measures are prioritized to enable more effective action. Such a participatory integrated assessment of adaptation options is a new approach in flood management in least developed countries and in Bangladesh in particular. A framework for prioritization of adaptation measures is lacking in the decision making process in Bangladesh which could immensely assist in informed and structured decisions while developing adaptation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Pericglacial cover-beds are {{widespread}} in Central European subdued mountains. Structure, texture, and thickness of these pleistocene gelifluctional slope deposits are important factors concerning pedogenesis, metabolism {{as well as}} infiltration, interflow, ground water renewal, and discharge. These cover-beds can be divided {{in two to three}} different layers. The upper layer is characterized by a low bulk density and consists of a mixture of local debris and loess. The lowermost layer consists of local debris, in this case mainly clay. In some regions a third layer in-between has been observed, but this intermediate layer was not detected in the catchment of the Wüstebach. During rainfall events, the upper layer enables water to infiltrate relative fast, thus increasing soil moisture. Due to its higher density, the lower layer reduces vertical velocity of interflow and redirects the interflow to the next river. The lower layer reacts delayed but can serve as preferred flow path for already infiltrated water, thus affecting discharge. The Wüstebach-catchment was chosen to investigate whether this model can be adapted to this area as well or not. To answer this question, soil moisture, precipitation, and discharge were measured for a period of two years. Additional data concerning infiltration rate, density, penetration resistance, and conductivity were collected to analyse the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological parameters of the soils. Mapping of soils and a geomorphological mapping support the spatial distribution and structure of periglacial cover-beds. The results reveal a fast reaction of the upper layer and a delayed and less intense reaction of the lowermost layer during rainfall, especially in the summer season. High precipitation does not necessarily lead to high discharge. During the winter season, when soils are saturated, even small precipitation can lead to high discharge. Furthermore, snow can lead to a delayed flow at the beginning of spring when temperatures rise, thus affecting statistical results. Statistical analyses indicate a strong correlation between precipitation and discharge. However, relief and periglacial cover-beds of the Wüstebach-area do not seem to {{have a significant impact on}} discharge. The spatial heterogeneity of relevant hydrological parameters combined with <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> <b>areas</b> resulting in cascade effects as well as the strong human impact may lead to a less significant importance of cover-beds.

30|$|The {{creation}} of local farm <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> systems, designed {{to capture and}} store surface water, may be a viable adaptation strategy (Pavelic et al. 2012). Local farm <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> systems allow for the detainment of water captured during spring runoff as well as during precipitation events, either directly or due to transport by surface runoff. This provides water storage that can be drawn on when groundwater supplies become depleted (Vorogushyn et al. 2012; Pavelic et al. 2012). They also serve to reduce downstream peak flow and aid in retaining <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> which reduces associated flood risks downstream (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2012; Pavelic et al. 2012). If water is released from the reservoir, they serve to replenish groundwater stores downstream (Pavelic et al. 2012). Under drought conditions, these systems enable farmers to draw water from the reservoirs to support crop irrigation (Pavelic et al. 2012). These systems have been effective for increasing and stabilizing crop yields via irrigation in locations such as Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, India, and Thailand (Arnold and Stockle 1991).|$|R

40|$|EXECUTUVE SUMMARY High {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus quantities in stormwater runoff {{have the potential to}} impact ecosystem integrity and human health. Nitrate may be toxic and can cause human health problems such as methemoglobinemia, liver damage and even cancers. Phosphorus may trigger eutrophication issues in fresh water bodies, which could result in toxic algae and endanger the source of drinking waters. The objective of this research is to conduct material characterization of particular types of sorption media that are functionalized for nutrient removal. The term sorption media is used as a qualifier for the media because the pollutant removal is by surface bonding to the media or incorporation within the media. A sorption media which is formulated and tested for specific pollutant removal in a specific stormwater installation is designated as a functionalized sorption media. To predict the nutrient removal value, mathematical equations for nutrient removal (called Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms) are used. Sorption media with mixes containing recycled materials, such as sawdust and tire crumb, combined with sand/silt and limestone are recommended for nutrient removal in stormwater management ponds and <b>retention</b> <b>areas.</b> The ponds are typically called retention ponds because the stormwater infiltrates into the ground and is not discharged to surface <b>waters.</b> Other <b>retention</b> <b>areas,</b> such as those defined as bio retention can also use the sorption media. The life time of the media based on orthophosphorus (OP) removal is calculated from the isotherms and is shown to be a reasonable application. Also, the capital cost is reasonable and there is minimal operating cost. Pollutants of concern include ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate, total dissolved phosphorus, etc. Application potential in stormwater management facilities, such as dry and wet ponds, is emphasized. As compared to a natural soil that is selected as the control case in the testing, the functionalized sorption media proposed here is proved relatively more effective in terms of removing most of the target nutrien...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} of soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> at 1 / 3 and 15 bar and available water content with soil physicochemical properties were studied in 147 soil samples collected from 21 profiles from rainfed {{regions of the}} country. In general Vertisols and Vertic sub-groups showed higher <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> at 1 / 3 and 15 bars, and available water content. A number of profiles showed an increasing trend in <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> with increase in soil depth. Reduction in <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> from 1 / 3 bar to 15 bar was greater in Inceptisols/Entisols, Alfisols/Oxisols and Aridisols than in Vertisols. Amount of clay and CEC showed significant positive correlation, while sand showed negative correlation with soil <b>water</b> <b>retention.</b> The relationships between organic carbon and <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> in surface soils were non¬significant. Multiple regression analysis for pooled soils (n= 147) showed that EC, CaCO-, sand, clay and CEC contributed to the variations in available water in soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} study {{explores the}} prediction of soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> and its variability from soil texture and bulk density measurements, using a physically-based scaling technique. Specifically, the Arya-Paris (AP) physico-empirical model is applied to two soil datasets that are collected from two catchments located in different areas of Southern Italy. Laboratory-measured soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> functions are scaled to characterize soil variability. The laboratory-measured and AP-predicted reference <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> functions are compared by evaluating the lognormal distribution of derived scaling factors, relative to the mean reference retention function. Since the scaling theory assumes geometric similitude for the investigated soils, successful application of using particle-size distribution to estimate soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> requires separation of soils with different textures, using variance analysis. We conclude that variability in soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> can be determined from limited soil <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> data using the scaling approach when combined with particle-size distribution measurements. This method can potentially {{be used as an}} effective tool for identifying soil hydrologic response at catchment scales...|$|R
