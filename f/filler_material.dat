5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an electric arc between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> is sometimes used as well.|$|E

40|$|Vertebral {{compression}} fracture Abstract Osteoporosis is {{the most}} common metabolic bone disease and {{the most common cause of}} fractures in older adults. Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) {{is the most}} common complication in patients with osteoporosis. At present, vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are two minimally invasive techniques used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. In clinical use, KP and VP have stable and reliable therapeutic effects. However, there are still some complications and issues surrounding KP and VP application, and for long-term clinical follow-up. Thus, it is important to continue to improve the technology of the <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> used in KP and VP in order to evolve the biomechanical characteristics of the postoperative vertebra, and to reduce the incidence of complications. The <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> used for both techniques require good biocompatibility, good biomechanical strength and stiffness, and good radiopacity for the fluoroscopy guided procedures. PMMA and new <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> (calcium phosphate cement, calcium sulfate cement, composite materials) are now available for clinical use. In this review paper, we will focus on the issues and characteristics of these <b>filler</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} heat, or by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a <b>filler</b> <b>material.</b> High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of <b>filler</b> <b>material,</b> and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E

25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} {{has recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBI) caused by shock waves have attracted increased attention {{due to the}} large percentage of combat troops that have sustained such injuries in recent wars. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to ballistic impacts after explosions, increasing the percentage of observed non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from blast waves. A new design concept for a combat helmet liner is proposed that introduces solid and fluid <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> inside channels in the foam liner to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches at the filler/foam material interface, viscous energy dissipation via fluid filler motion, and multiple reflection interfaces in granular <b>filler</b> <b>materials.</b> Both shock tube experiments and numerical studies using ABAQUS ® are carried out. Intricacies of the numerical model developed in ABAQUS ® to model the shock response of structures are discussed. Preliminary results show that use of high density <b>filler</b> <b>materials</b> results in higher levels of blast attenuation than those observed with low density materials, when compared to solid foam control samples.

500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the <b>filler</b> <b>material</b> and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended. Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E
