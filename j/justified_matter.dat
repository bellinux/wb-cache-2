According to one prominent view in the literature, namely Jennifer Lackey's justificationist position, the answer is yes so long as one also has personal information that provides a symmetry-breaker. In this article, I raise a problem for the justificationist view. On the most straightforward reading of the justificationist position, personal information always provides a symmetry-breaker in a peer dispute over a belief in which one has high justified confidence. However, this position is implausibly strong because it renders epistemically permissible a dogmatic attitude in a relevant set of peer disagreements. Alternatively, weaker readings of the view fail to provide a perspicuous account of when high <b>justified</b> confidence <b>matters</b> in a disagreement...|$|R

A natural suggestion is: maybe there is no fundamental reason why exactly 4 dimensions should remain, maybe when we go to even larger scales, some of the 4 dimensions will be compactified as well? In this paper, we explore the consequences of the compactification suggestion, and we show that – on the qualitative level – these consequences have actually been already observed: as superclusters and as evidence that is usually interpreted as <b>justifying</b> dark <b>matter.</b> Thus, we get a new possible explanation of both superclusters and dark matter evidence – via dimension compactification...|$|R

40|$|Just as {{the present}} moment finds the {{institution}} of marriage hotly debated, the advocates of its 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 meaning and those of its 2 ̆ 2 redefinition 2 ̆ 2 each proposing new and different links between sexuality and sociality, so the late 18 th century saw marriage and the sexual relationship become debatable and definable in ways hitherto unimagined. This had less to do with actual marital practice, and more with new attempts at grounding that practice: The Enlightenment had demanded a justification of all social institutions, turning marriage from a sacrament into a component of civil society or civic religion, and the more highly integrated constitutional monarchies that sprang up in Germany in the late 18 th century had subsumed the power to consecrate marriage under its aegis (Preußisches Landrecht). But even if it was de facto the king who now had the power to marry couples, the bases of this power were still very much in contention: Was he acting as an agent of social stability or utility? Was he acting as a quasi-religious authority? Or was he the representative of human reason, wholly divested of any arbitrary power that may otherwise accrue to his person? ^ The early German Romantics turned to love and marriage to anchor their social utopian aspirations, and they sought in turn to transform the institutionalization of marriage as well. This dissertation argues that they did so by decisively emancipating marriage from concerns of morality or religion in any but the widest sense, relying instead on a metaphysical justification of the marital union. For a German philosopher writing in the wake of Kant, a metaphysics of marriage, as opposed to any other theory of marriage, had to provide a justification for the institution from the resources furnished by reason alone. And for those followers of Kant who criticized a number of 2 ̆ 2 dualisms 2 ̆ 2 within the critical philosophy, and who subsequently began experimenting with monistic reinterpretations of Kant 2 ̆ 7 s project, this 2 ̆ 2 reason 2 ̆ 2 could not be either theoretical or practical, but had to be rather one single unifying principle. In other words, these thinkers were forced to <b>justify</b> <b>matters</b> both of theoretical and practical philosophy from a single monolithic principle derived primarily from their respective theories of consciousness. ...|$|R
50|$|The Italian Niccolò Machiavelli is {{heralded as}} the {{founding}} {{father of the}} political ethics. He believed that a political leader {{may be required to}} commit acts that would be wrong if done by private. In contemporary democracies, this idea has been reframed as the problem of dirty hands, described most influentially by Michael Walzer, who argues that the problem creates a paradox: the politician must sometimes do “wrong to do right”. The politician uses violence to prevent greater violence, but his act is still wrong even if justified. Walzer’s view has been criticized. Some critics object that either the politician is justified or not. If justified, there is nothing wrong, though he may feel guilty. Others say that some of the acts of violence that Walzer would allow are never <b>justified,</b> no <b>matter</b> what the ends. Dennis Thompson has argued that in a democracy citizens should hold the leader responsible, and therefore if the act is unjustified their hands are dirty too. He also shows that in large political organizations it is often not possible to tell who is actually responsible for the outcomes—a problem known as the problem of many hands.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION As one {{indicator}} of economic performance and well-being, {{balance of payments}} statistics are deemed to provide signals about likely directions of economic policy. In the Australian context the sensitivity of o#cial reactions to newly released balance of payments data is particularly acute {{in view of the}} prominence in public debate of the current account deficit and the foreign debt. Whether such prominence is <b>justified</b> is a <b>matter</b> for debate. Nonetheless, the fact of political prominence reinforces legitimate concern about the fundamental reliability of the information assembled in the balance of payments accounts. Di#culties and pitfalls associated with data collection and processing are well-known. A particularly instructive illustration of their impact is the reported global trade surplus of some $ 80 billion. Balance of payments outcomes are the aggregate consequence of individual choice. As such, they provide no cause for policy activism and intervention (for example...|$|R
50|$|One {{recent case}} on using force against a burglar is Anthony Martin v R (2001) EWCA 2245, which {{resulted}} in the householder being convicted. As the law currently stands, a person in possession can use no more force than they reasonably believe necessary to remove a trespasser from the premises. Further, where the threat to the land or its possession is not immediate, and other measures could be taken that would make force unnecessary (e.g., calling the police or seeking remedies through the courts) the defence will normally be lost. But in Chamberlain v Lindon (1998) 1 WLR 1252 Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right-of-way, honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of protecting his property (and, incidentally, avoiding litigation). It was held that it was not necessary to decide whether Lindon’s action was <b>justified</b> as a <b>matter</b> of civil law.|$|R

The method {{has been applied to}} the determination of the fatty acids of phosphoglycerides in human brain from the early fetal stage to old age. The study shows changes in the distribution and fatty acid composition of each phosphoglyceride in normal brain, although they are quite small after early childhood.

Besides this, the pronounced differences between fatty acids of the lipids from the cerebral cortex and from the adjacent white <b>matter</b> <b>justify</b> speaking of a tissue-specijic. fatty acid pattern for brain phosphoglycerides. The phospholipids of cerebral white matter contained more monoenoic acid but much less polyunsaturated fatty acid than those of cerebral cortex.

With increasing age the concentration of the fatty acids of the linoleate family diminished while that of the linolenate family increased. Brain inositol phosphoglycerides, the fatty acid composition of which has not been studied systematically before, were characterized by a large concentration of arachidonate which was nearly as high for white as for gray matter and showed only small changes with age...|$|R

The motive then, may be held to <b>justify</b> the <b>matter</b> of the work; but this preface, which is simply an avowal of endeavour, cannot end here--for the avowal is not yet complete. Fiction--if it at all aspires to be art--appeals to temperament. And in truth it must be, like painting, like music, like all art, the appeal of one temperament to all the other innumerable temperaments whose subtle and resistless power endows passing events with their true meaning, and creates the moral, the emotional atmosphere of the place and time. Such an appeal to be effective must be an impression conveyed through the senses; and, in fact, it cannot be made in any other way, because temperament, whether individual or collective, is not amenable to persuasion. All art, therefore, appeals primarily to the senses, and the artistic aim when expressing itself in written words must also make its appeal through the senses, if its highest desire is to reach the secret spring of responsive emotions. It must strenuously aspire to the plasticity of sculpture, to the colour of painting, and to the magic suggestiveness of music--which is the art of arts. And it is only through complete, unswerving devotion to the perfect blending of form and substance; it is only through an unremitting never-discouraged care for the shape and ring of sentences that an approach can be made to plasticity, to colour, and that the light of magic suggestiveness may be brought to play for an evanescent instant over the commonplace surface of words: of the old, old words, worn thin, defaced by ages of careless usage.|$|R

I showed, first, why anthropological {{students}} of mythology, finding the philological school occupying the ground, were obliged in England to challenge Mr. Max Muller. I then discoursed of some inconveniences attending his method in controversy. Next, I gave a practical example, the affair of Tuna and Daphne. This {{led to a}} comparison of the philological and the anthropological ways of treating the Daphne myth. The question of our allies then coming up, I stated my reasons for regarding Prof. Tiele 'rather as an ally than an adversary,' the reason being his own statement. Presently, I replied to Prof. Tiele's criticism of my treatment of the myth of Cronos. After a skirmish on Italian fields, I gave my reasons for disagreeing with Mr. Max Muller's view of Mannhardt's position. His theory of Demeter Erinnys was contrasted with that of Mr. Max Muller. Totemism occupied us next, and the views of Mr. Max Muller and Mr. J. G. Frazer were criticised. Then I defended anthropological and criticised philological evidence.
