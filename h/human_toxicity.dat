5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although <b>human</b> <b>toxicity</b> data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of <b>human</b> <b>toxicity</b> related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

25|$|Biocides {{need not}} be {{poisonous}} to humans, because they can target metabolic pathways absent in humans, leaving only incidental toxicity. For instance, the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a mimic of a plant growth hormone, which causes uncontrollable growth leading {{to the death of}} the plant. Humans and animals, lacking this hormone and its receptor, are unaffected by this, and need to ingest relatively large doses before any toxicity appears. <b>Human</b> <b>toxicity</b> is, however, hard to avoid with pesticides targeting mammals, such as rodenticides.|$|E

Considerations for halon replacement include <b>human</b> <b>toxicity</b> when used in confined spaces, ozone depleting potential, and greenhouse warming potential.

Specifically, they require two to three times the concentration to extinguish a fire compared with Halon 1211. They are heavier than halon, require a larger bottle because they are less effective, and have greenhouse gas potential. Research continues to find better alternatives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluates the}} life cycle {{environmental}} sustainability of micro-wind turbines in the UK in comparison with grid electricity and solar PV (photovoltaics). The results suggests that per kWh electricity generated, the majority of environmental impacts from the wind turbines are lower than from grid electricity, ranging from 26 % lower terrestrial toxicity to 92 % lower global warming. However, depletion of abiotic elements, fresh-water and <b>human</b> <b>toxicities</b> are 82 %, 74 % and 53 % higher than for grid electricity, respectively. The wind turbines are more environmentally sustainable than solar PV for seven out of 11 impacts, ranging from 7. 5 % lower eutrophication to 85 % lower ozone layer depletion. However, depletion of fossil resources, fresh-water, <b>human</b> and terrestrial <b>toxicities</b> are higher for the wind turbine than for the PV, ranging from 5 % for the former to 87 % for the latter. UK-wide deployment of micro-wind turbines would save between 0. 6 and 1 % of GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions on 2009 levels. Therefore, the potential of micro-wind turbines to contribute towards UK's climate change targets is limited...|$|R

40|$|Summary — The {{impetus to}} develop useful models of <b>human</b> disease and <b>toxicity</b> has {{resulted}} in a number of large-scale mouse mutagenesis programmes. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable concern regarding the scientific validity and welfare of genetically altered mice, and the large numbers of mice that are required by such programmes. In this paper, the scientific advantages and limitations of genetically altered mice as models of several human diseases are discussed. We conclude that, while the use of some such mouse models has contributed considerably to an understanding of <b>human</b> disease and <b>toxicity,</b> other genetically altered mouse models have limited scientific relevance, and fewer have positively contributed to the development of novel human medicines.
