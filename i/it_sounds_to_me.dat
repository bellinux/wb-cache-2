[...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

Lehrer {{wrote in a letter to}} the producer Per–Anders Boquist that [...] "not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs", along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.|$|E
2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a very disagreeable speech; but {{the grey}} man laughed--I {{had not heard}} him laugh till then--and my mother ran to my aunt and kissed her; and somehow the room seemed to become lighter.|$|R

2500|$|Roger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod {{is not a}} racist, {{that she}} did {{everything}} she could for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends. [...] The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: [...] "If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do", Roger Spooner said. [...] "She led us right to our success." [...] His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that [...] "after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some tomatoes out of her garden, {{and they had a}} good visit." [...] Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as [...] "nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person." [...] The couple were surprised by the controversy. [...] "I don't know what brought up the racist mess", Roger Spooner said. [...] "They just want to stir up some trouble, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my opinion." [...] Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, [...] "I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I confess I {{doubt the}} Homeric genuineness of [Greek: dakruoen gelaschsa]. [1] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{much more like}} a prettiness of Bion or Moschus.|$|E
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like notoriety rather than fame. This poor child {{has a right to}} herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{same idea}} struck <b>me</b> that {{occurred}} <b>to</b> Hampton,' Danvers said, 'but I {{suppose it was}} fancy. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as if he had}} already paid, to some extent, the debt he spoke of, or as if he had no doubt whatever that he should do so in the future.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{very much}} like the moan of a man in pain," [...] I explained, looking half fearfully around.

I answered, partly from habit and partly to be understood, [...] if possible. 'It may be so,' said Lewis, 'but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like [...] talking with a 'brogue' to an Irishman.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a word {{more to be}} spoken!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "There's more {{behind this}} scheme of Maraton's than he's willing to have us understand! It looks to me and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{like a piece of}} dirty, underhand business. I'll ask you a question, Maraton. Were you at the Ritz Hotel one night about two months ago, with the {{ambassador}} of a foreign a country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{the name}} of this {{supposed}} predecessor of Edgar's? Where she may have been married, or how? How she parted from him, or how she knows he was alive? <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a bogus notion, got up to put the screw on you, by surprise. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go down to the shop tomorrow morning, see the woman, and extract the truth if possible, and I fully expect that the story will shrink up to nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{settling}} the Dissenters, were you? Was Malone {{settling the}} Dissenters? <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{much more like}} settling his co-apostles. You were quarrelling together, making almost as much noise--you three alone--as Moses Barraclough, the preaching tailor, and all his hearers are making in the Methodist chapel down yonder, where {{they are in the}} thick of a revival. I know whose fault it is.--It is yours, Malone." ...|$|R
60|$|An ear {{for music}} is a very {{different}} thing from a taste for music. I have no ear whatever; I could not sing an air to save my life; but I have the intensest delight in music, and can detect good from bad. Naldi, a good fellow, remarked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once at a concert, that I did not seem much interested with a piece of Rossini's which had just been performed. I said, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like nonsense verses. But I could scarcely contain myself when a thing of Beethoven's followed.|$|R
60|$|It {{has been}} {{explained}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{over and over}} again, and I never did more than understand it for one moment, and if I did recollect all about it, like a scientific dialogue, nobody would thank me for putting it in here, {{so it will be}} enough <b>to</b> say that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> very bewildering and horribly dangerous, not so much to the body as to the pocket, and I thought the Hydriot bade fair to devour Boola Boola and Harold, if not Arghouse and Eustace into the bargain.|$|R
6000|$|LESLIE. Past ten? Ah, there's a {{long night}} before you and me, watchmen. Heavens, what a trade! But it will be {{something}} to laugh over with Mary and ... with him! Damn it, the delusion is too strong for me. It's a thing to be ashamed of. [...] "We Brodies": how she says it! [...] "We Brodies and our Deacon": what a pride she takes in it, and how good <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> [...] "Deacon of his craft, sir, Deacon of the ..." [...] (BRODIE, masked, appears without at the window, which he proceeds to force.) Ha! I knew he'd come. I was sure of it. (He crouches near and nearer to the window, keeping in the shade.)

6000|$|WISE MAN [turning {{over the}} pages of a book]. Where is that passage I am to explain to my pupils to-day? Here it is, and the book says that it was written by a beggar on the walls of Babylon: [...] "There are two living countries, the one visible and the one invisible; and when it is winter with us it is summer in that country; and when the November winds are up among us it is lambing-time there." [...] I wish that my pupils had asked me to explain any other passage, for this is a hard passage. [The FOOL comes in and stands at the door, holding out his hat. He has a pair of shears in the other hand.] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like foolishness; and yet that cannot be, for the writer of this book, where I have found so much knowledge, would not have set it by itself on this page, and {{surrounded}} it with so many images and so many deep colors and so much fine gilding, if it had been foolishness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hark, do you {{not hear}} it, Paul?" [...] he asked. [...] "It is the music of Humanity. All human notes are needful to its making: the faint wail of the new-born, the cry of the dying thief; the beating of the hammers, the merry trip of dancers; the clatter of the teacups, the roaring of the streets; the crooning of the mother to her babe, the scream of the {{tortured}} child; the meeting kiss of lovers, the sob of those that part. Listen! prayers and curses, sighs and laughter; the soft breathing of the sleeping, the fretful feet of pain; voices of pity, voices of hate; the glad song of the strong, the foolish complaining of the weak. Listen to it, Paul! Right and wrong, good and evil, hope and despair, it is but one voice--a single note, drawn by the sweep of the Player's hand across the quivering strings of man. What {{is the meaning of}} it, Paul? Can you read it? Sometimes it seems to me a note of joy, so full, so endless, so complete, that I cry: 'Blessed be the Lord whose hammers have beaten upon us, whose fires have shaped us to His ends!' And sometimes <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a dying note, so that I could curse Him who in wantonness has wrung it from the anguish of His creatures--till I would that I could fling myself, Prometheus like, between Him and His victims, calling: 'My darkness, but their light; my agony, O God; their hope!'" ...|$|E

60|$|Long ago, when I was a boy, I {{heard it}} with fury; and never since have I {{been able to}} {{understand}} any free man hearing it without fury. I heard it when Bloch, and the old prophets of pacifism by panic, preached that war would become too horrible for patriots <b>to</b> endure. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like saying that an instrument of torture was being prepared by my dentist, that would finally cure me of loving my dog.

Seven jerseys were placed on his coffin to {{recognize}} his rugby career - the Clovelly Sea Eagles, Waverley College, the Roosters, Randwick, the Melbourne Rebels, the Australian Sevens and the Brumbies.

5000|$|The Swiss theologian Emil Brunner, who had {{frequently}} acknowledged {{his debt}} to Buchman, {{also tried to}} dissuade Buchman from his efforts to convert the Nazi leadership {{on the basis that}} he was endangering the reputation of himself and his work.

Just think of your sentence, 'Unfortunately this hopeless fellow Hossenfelder has damaged the reputation of the Groups.' <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like associating with 'publicans and sinners.'

The next record will redeem the sound I believe was lost during the Violence/Skeletons cycle. Too many cooks in the kitchen can sometimes create a mediocre meal. Especially when the cooks come from different schools." [...] The album is considered the band's most diverse release to date, with its music drawing elements from genres such as hardcore and thrash metal. The album's lyrics are also more political than previous Nothingface releases. Lyrical themes on the album include the invasion of Afghanistan, organized religion, murder and the American government. The song [...] "Ether" [...] is about George W. Bush and his Middle East policies. The song [...] "Here Comes the Butchers" [...] is about Catholicism and Catholic Church sexual abuse cases.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 October 2004, Blasko {{released}} her debut studio album, The Overture & the Underscore, {{which had been}} recorded in Hollywood at the studio of engineer Wally Gagel {{during the first half}} of the year.

Joey Waronker (Beck, Atoms for Peace) played drums and percussion on all songs, while Cranny played various instruments on the album. Blasko recalled: [...] "I stayed in a backpackers hostel right near Hollywood Boulevard and worked on the album six days a week for two months ...

60|$|The sudden flight almost {{caused a}} panic and an awful breach of {{hospitality}} {{among the few}} who were quietly watching things.
