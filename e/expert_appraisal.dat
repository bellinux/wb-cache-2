However, mere distribution of information is not enough- {{it is crucial that}} communication efforts are effective. This requires socio-psychological expertise and critical impact evaluation. In a project on bushfire preparedness programs, materials used by fire authorities in bushfire information/education were studied. The research questions included: What are relevant criteria for risk communication? Which factors determine whether residents evaluate information material as useful? How do officers and experts assess the utility of educational materials? What is the didactic value of texts and audiovisual materials?

50|$|Raja was deputed as the Minister of State, Rural Development on 13 October 1996 and he {{continued}} to retain the post till 29 September 2000. On 30 September 2000, he was deputed as the minister of state for Health and Family welfare during the National Democratic Alliance. In December 2003, the DMK {{pulled out of the}} alliance and Raja resigned his minister's post along with his other DMK colleagues. He continued with the same ministry after the 2004 elections which was won by the Congress led alliance, which included the DMK. His tenure as an Environment ministry came under intense scrutiny in 2011 during the 2G Spectrum scam. His association with key accused in the 2G scam, Unitech and DB Realty, was rooted to 2004 when he was the Environment minister. One of the key points out of the CBI is the approval of 2016 clearances given by his ministry in a span of two years from 2006 to 2008, some of which were associated with trading of hazardous waste. The other issue raised was about the large majority of Raja's supporters in the <b>expert</b> <b>appraisals</b> committee (EAC), responsible for granting clearances to various sectors.|$|R
40|$|Persons {{with disabilities}} make up some 15 % of the world's {{population}} and are {{at higher risk}} of violence. Yet there is currently no systematic review {{of the effectiveness of}} interventions to prevent violence against them. Thus the aim of this review was to systematically search for, appraise the quality of, and synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and mitigate the consequences of all the main forms of interpersonal violence against people with all types of disabilities. The method used consisted of searches of eleven electronic databases, hand searches of three journals, scanning of reference lists of review articles, contact with <b>experts,</b> <b>appraisal</b> of risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and narrative synthesis of results. This resulted in 736 titles being identified, 10 of which met the inclusion criteria and 6 and 2 addressed people with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities, respectively. Only one was from a low- and middle-income country. All studies received a weak rating on the quality assessment tool and none could be considered effective after taking risk of bias into account. In sum, the current evidence base offers little guidance to policy makers, program commissioners, and persons with disabilities for selecting interventions. More and higher quality research is required, particularly from low- and middle-income countries and on other forms of disability such as physical impairments, sensory impairments, and mental health conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{datasets}} {{provided as}} part of DTRS- 10 all relate to what may broadly be labeled as ‘design critiques’ in an educational context. As such, we chose to center our theoretical analysis on the evaluative reasoning taking place during <b>expert</b> <b>appraisals</b> of the design concepts that were being produced by industrial design students throughout the design process. This overall framing for our research allowed us to pursue a series of research questions concerning the dimensions of creative evaluation in design and their consequences for reasoning strategies and suggestions for moving further in the creative progress. Our transcript coding and analysis focused on three key dimensions of creativity, that is, originality, functionality and aesthetics. Each dimension {{was associated with a}} particular underpinning ‘logic’ that determined the distinctive ways in which these dimensions were seen to be evaluated in practice. In particular, our analysis clarified the way in which design dimensions triggered very different reasoning strategies such as running mental simulations, or making suggestions for design improvement, ranging from definitive ‘go/kill’ decisions right through to loose recommendations to continue to work on a concept {{for a period of time}} without any further directional steer beyond this general appraisal. Overall, we believe that our findings not only advance a theoretical understanding of evaluation behaviour that arises in design critiques, but also have important practical implications in terms of alerting expert design evaluators to the nature and consequences of their critical appraisals...|$|R

40|$|Conversations with teacher-librarians and coordinators of library-media {{services}} {{pointed to}} an apparent {{weakness in the}} teacher-librarianship education program offered by Memorial University of Newfoundland. Upon further invest-igation {{it was determined that}} one problem was the lack of information presented to the students regarding the context within which school libraries operated in Newfoundland. Further study showed that while there was a need for such information, there was no single document available which would provide the information. It was therefore proposed that the writer develop a text for an instructional unit on the topic. [...] The process used to develop the instructional text was a modified form of the " 4 -D Model of Instructional Development". The process involved needs assessment, learner analysis, concept analysis, specification of objectives, test construction, evaluation, and recommendations for diffusion and adoption. The instructional booklet developed through this process was based on the learner and concept analysis. Evaluation of the booklet was based on the objectives. [...] The evaluation phase involved <b>expert</b> <b>appraisals,</b> student appraisals, pilot testing, and validation testing.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Children {{sometimes}} have accidents when using large items of play equipment, and whilst many {{are due to}} poor design or lack of supervision, some are due to inadequate or incorrect assembly. OBJECTIVES To examine the possibility of incorrect assembly and identify the consequences of errors and the resultant increase in hazards. METHODS The study collected accident statistics, surveyed the market and reviewed the literature. A variety of equipment was purchased and the instructions evaluated. Finally, trials with users were completed where the assembly procedure, time taken, errors made and subjective ratings were recorded. RESULTS Little literature was found but accident data from the UK, US and Australia showed minor injuries possibly attributable to assembling the product. <b>Expert</b> <b>appraisals</b> were conducted on 40 products to assess the instructions, assembly process and design, {{as well as the}} hazards presented during assembly and in use. Trials involving 100 representative subjects allowed observation of the assembly of products. The results showed a number of minor problems and hazards with the products. CONCLUSIONS The following improvements were recommended: • Standards applying to products requiring self-assembly should address the self-assembly process; • Accurate and meaningful information should be provided on the packaging;• Attention should be paid to the presentation and content of the product instructions • Products should be designed so that the assembly process is possible, relatively easy and safe to complete; Product components should be well designed, well machined and strong enough for the intended purpose. Furthermore, consumers must recognise their duty to make sensible purchases and to be responsible during assembly and use...|$|R

Since 1998, {{the focus of}} the training involves around mountain risks in the winter, in 2003 it will be re-evaluated. The training is designed to give guides a better appreciation of the dangers they are likely to encounter, enabling them to take the necessary precautions. The objective is {{to reduce the number of}} accidents and the number of victims. Four years into the programme, the impact of the avalanche awareness training can be assessed. The effectiveness of the course is measured both by the numerous written remarks made by the trainee guides, and by the instruction reports drawn up by the instructor guides. The success of the programme is evaluated by analysing the avalanche accidents involving French Mountain Guides. This approach has lead us to completely change the avalanche course. The section devoted to the evolution and study of snow crystals and the snow-pack has been reduced, while the part devoted to the explanation of the avalanche triggering mechanism and to the study of real cases has been increased. These cases include accidents that have been the subject of <b>expert</b> <b>appraisals</b> by the Guides Association. We have put the emphasis on remote triggering phenomena, on the dangers related to thin snow covers, and on the difficulties in analysing snow-packs that often are very heterogeneous over short distances.

50|$|Perhaps {{because of}} the {{centrality}} of funding to the whole reform scheme and because the administrative machinery for handling budgets was already in place, many concrete provisions for funding research were adopted following the March 1985 Central Committee decision. In February 1986 the State Council promulgated provisional regulations under which science and technology projects listed in the annual state economic plan were to be completed as contract research, in which there would be nationwide open bidding on the contracts. Banks were to monitor expenditures under the contract. Institutes conducting basic research were to have their regular operating expenses guaranteed by the state, but all other income would come from competitive research grants. The government was to continue to fund completely the institutes working in public health and medicine, family planning, environmental science, technical information, meteorology, and agriculture. In 1986 the newly established National Natural Science Foundation, explicitly modeled on the United States National Science Foundation, disbursed its first competitive awards, totaling ¥95 million, to 3,432 research projects selected from 12,000 applications. The amount of money awarded to individual projects was not large, but the precedent of competition, disregard of administrative boundaries, and <b>expert</b> <b>appraisal</b> of individual or small-group proposals was established and widely publicized.

40|$|Background: Most of {{detected}} {{changes in}} the shoulder rotator cuff are the consequence of chronic changes. Fresh injuries of individual parts of the rotator cuff have to be proved without a doubt {{as soon as possible}} after the injury. The basic question with regard to any <b>expert</b> <b>appraisal</b> of {{changes in the}} shoulder rotator cuff is undoubtedly the determination of post-injury changes as well as the distinction between degenerative changes, changes discovered by chance and fresh injuries of the rotator cuff. A detailed analysis of the clinical picture, the biomechanics of the event and early application of specific imaging diagnostic methods enable certain determination of causal connections between the actual event and the established changes in rotator cuff. Conclusions: A systematic approach to analysis of all data about the condition of the shoulder prior to the injury, certain establishment of connection between the injury event, the first medical surgical, histological and ultrasound results, CT and magnetic resonance, along with the analyses of accompanying changes, enable an expert to give a decisive medical <b>expert</b> <b>appraisal.</b> The latest findings about the biomechanics of rotator cuff injuries which contain an analysis of load on individual parts of the rotator cuff in certain arm positions as well as the knowledge about the progress and causes of the circulation changes in parts of rotator cuff and the role of microtrauma provide for the distinction between the manifestation of silent changes which have been undergoing for a longer time and undoubtedly established fresh injuries of the healthy parts of the rotator cuff.

40|$|Variable {{selection}} for cluster analysis {{is a difficult}} problem. The difficulty originates {{not only from the}} lack of class information but also the fact that high-dimensional data are often multifaceted and can be meaningfully clustered in multiple ways. In such a case the effort to find one subset of attributes that presumably gives the "best" clustering may be misguided. It makes more sense to facilitate variable selection by domain experts, that is, to systematically identify various facets of a data set (each being based on a subset of attributes), cluster the data along each one, and present the results to the domain <b>experts</b> for <b>appraisal</b> and selection. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Gaussian mixture model, show its ability to cluster data along multiple facets, and demonstrate it is often more reasonable to facilitate variable selection than to perform it.
