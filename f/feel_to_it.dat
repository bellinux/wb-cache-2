25|$|Halbertsma {{was also}} the author of an 1836 {{biography}} of the Frisian poet Jan Cornelis Pieters Salverda (1783–1836), which almost has a naturalistic <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In 1843 he published a historical work about the Mennonites, called De Doopsgezinden en Hunne Herkomst ("The Mennonites and Their Origins"), and in 1851 he followed this up with Aanteekeningen op het Vierde Deel van den Spiegel Historiael van Jacob van Maerlant ("Notes on Part Four of the Spiegel Historiael by Jacob van Maerlant). Furthermore, in 1858, at the request of Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, whom he had met in London, Halbertsma published It Ewangeelje fen Matthewes, which was the first Frisian translation of the Biblical Gospel of Matthew (or of any gospel for that matter). This translation evoked a great deal of criticism from Halbertsma's contemporaries, who thought it was much too realistic; today, it still has an almost modern <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> showing that Halbertsma was far ahead of his time.|$|E

40|$|Richard Wright {{is known}} for his unflinching portrayals of the {{violence}} of American racism. But violence, however traumatic, was not the only thing to impact the consciousness of the writer. Rather, he was impressed by acts of empathy as much as by those of cruelty. An enduringly powerful aspect of Wright’s work is, in fact, his own substantial capacity for empathy–his ability not only <b>to</b> recognize <b>it,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> portray <b>it,</b> and <b>to</b> evoke <b>it</b> for his audience. This essay discusses empathy in Wright’s best known novel, 'Native Son'...|$|R

25|$|Afyon is {{the centre}} of an {{agricultural}} area and the city has a country town <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> There is {{little in the way}} of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However Afyon Kocatepe University opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.|$|E
25|$|New wave {{represented}} {{a break from}} the blues and rock & roll sounds of late 1960s to mid-1970s rock music. According to Simon Reynolds, the music had a twitchy, agitated <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos, and keyboards were common as were stop-start song structures and melodies. Reynolds noted that new wave vocalists sounded high-pitched, geeky and suburban. A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals and clothing fashions such as suits and big glasses that hid the body.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{development}} of the game began with creating the first Hero character, Tracer, who {{was based on a}} character from Titan with similar time-manipulation abilities. They used Tracer and a single map based on the Temple of Anubis, to test how well the core mechanics played, according to assistant game director Aaron Keller. They added three more HeroesWidowmaker, Reaper, and Pharah, all whom had been developed from Crossroads classesto start polishing the gameplay mechanics, which even at this stage Keller stated that it compared very closely with what the released game would present. They had even considered releasing Overwatch with a limited set of heroes at this point, as they had felt the game already had a finished <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1928 the Soviet {{government}} {{launched a}} building program {{headed by the}} OSA group. The OSA group oversaw {{the construction of a}} building which should have housed the employees of the People's Commissariat for Finance. Due to its close connections with the Commissariat for Finance the building was often referred to as [...] "the Narkomfin building". The building was designed by Moisei Ginzburg and Ignati Milinis and has a reputation for being one of the best examples of still-standing Soviet constructivist architecture. The architects tried to give the building a collective <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> but, when the building was finished in 1932, it was denounced as a remnant of [...] "leftist utopianism" [...] by Joseph Stalin's regime. Unlike many other Soviet constructivist buildings there is an ongoing campaign to save it.|$|E
500|$|After winning The X Factor, {{the group}} worked on their debut album, DNA, which was {{released}} on 19 November 2012.

The title track has a Gothic <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> whereby Little Mix display a darker side to their personalities. The group worked with former Girls Aloud member, Nicola Roberts, on the Latin-inspired [...] "Going Nowhere" [...] and featured Missy Elliott on the single release version of pop-funk track [...] "How Ya Doin'?".

When Digital Spy questioned group member Keisha Buchanan about her reaction to its release, she responded: [...] "I'm really excited about it. I'm looking forward to people hearing another side to the album. This single has got a kind of Jackson 5 <b>feel</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> which I love. The whole album has got a really old-school, laid-back Motown sound, so hopefully 'No Can Do' will get more people interested in the album." [...] "No Can Do" [...] {{was released}} as a digital download in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 19 December 2008. The following day, it was made available as a CD single, which consists of three remixes of the track and a cover version of Keane's song [...] "Spiralling".|$|E
500|$|Atlanta-based music {{producer}} Polow da Don {{was inspired}} to create a beat during his weekend stay in Las Vegas for the MTV Video Music Awards.

[...] He also noted its Euro influences. When he finished working on the material, da Don felt it fit for Usher, hoping that it would keep female listeners interested in Usher's music, as his popularity had declined among women since his marriage to stylist Tameka Foster in July 2007. Da Don and Usher wrote the track with rapper Young Jeezy, Darnell Dalton, Ryon Lovett, Lamar Taylor and Keith Thomas, and it was recorded at Zac Recording, Atlanta and Hitland Studios, Alpharetta.|$|E

[...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album.
