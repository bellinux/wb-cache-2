40|$|Road salting is an {{important}} aspect of winter maintenance. There has been an increase in the usage of salt in later years to keep the road safe and accessible. It is a desire {{to reduce the amount of}} salt due to environmental aspects. To achieve better practices for winter maintenance it is necessary to obtain more knowledge about the different properties of salt. The motivation for this thesis is to develop a better method for determining the melting capacity for salt, which is {{an important}} property in deicing. The purpose of this thesis is to develop and test a calorimeter. The calorimeter used in this thesis is build earlier, so the objective of this thesis is to determine the accuracy of the <b>calorimeter</b> for <b>ice</b> melting experiments. The calorimeter is able to measure the heat necessary to melt a given amount of ice, by using thermodynamic properties. When ice melts in a closed system, the temperature decreases. This happens because the energy within the system is used to break the bonding between the ice molecules. To counteract this temperature fall, the calorimeter adds heat to the system. With the premise that the initial and final temperature is the same, the energy added to the system is equal the amount of energy necessary to melt a given amount of snow. The calorimeter consists of an isolated reactor, a heater, a cooler and a computer that registers the temperatures and regulates the heat added to the reactor. To test the accuracy of the calorimeter some initial parameters had to be determined. These parameters include heat capacity of the reactor, heat leakage and heat from stirrer. The most extensive testing to evaluate the accuracy to predict the amount of ice melted, was done with ice melting in pure water. A few test was performed at cold temperatures with salt solution of NaCl. In room temperature, with no heat leakage, the accuracy of the measurements was found to be 93, 5 %. The correlation between measured and theoretical values was good, and the measured value was consequently lower than the theoretical value. If only tests performed with an amount of ice of 45 g or higher was included the accuracy was almost 95 %. The precision of the test performed at lower temperatures with salt solution turned out to be less accurate, with an accuracy of less than 70 %. This means that the accuracy of the calorimeter is still not satisfactory, but it is potential to improve the measurements further. The biggest uncertainty lays in the heat leakage and it is therefore recommended to place the calorimeter in a cold room. The testing procedure should also be improved to obtain more consistent results, especially regarding cooling time and temperature of the <b>ice</b> samples. The <b>calorimeter</b> has the prospective to investigate the ice melting properties and determine the freezing curve of unknown substances. This is possible if the accuracy and precision of the calorimeter is further improved. </p...|$|R

5000|$|One of Lavoisier's {{experiments}} {{connected the}} worlds of respiration and combustion. Lavoisier's hypothesis was that combustion and respiration were one and the same, and combustion occurs with every instance of respiration. Lavoisier, working with Pierre-Simon Laplace, designed an <b>ice</b> <b>calorimeter</b> apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. This machine consisted of three concentric compartments. The center compartment held the source of heat, in this case, the guinea pig or piece of burning charcoal. The middle compartment held a specific amount of ice for the heat source to melt. The outside compartment contained packed snow for insulation. Lavoisier then measured the quantity {{of carbon dioxide and}} the quantity of heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus. Lavoisier also measured the heat and carbon dioxide produced when burning a piece of charcoal in the calorimeter. Using this data, he concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. He also discovered through precise measurements that these processes produced carbon dioxide and heat with the same constant of proportionality. He found that for 224 grains of [...] "fixed air" [...] (CO2) produced, 13 oz. of ice was melted in the calorimeter. Converting grains to grams and using the energy required to melt 13 oz. of ice, one can compute that for each gram of CO2 produced, about 2.02 kcal of energy was produced by the combustion of carbon or by respiration in Lavoisier's calorimeter experiments. This compares well with the modern published heat of combustion for carbon of 2.13 kcal/g. This continuous slow combustion, which Lavoisier and Laplace supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. [...] Lavoisier concluded, [...] "Lla respiration est donc une combustion," [...] That is, respiratory gas exchange is combustion, like that of burning a candle.|$|E

Marie Curie had discovered radium. In June 1903, the Curie couple were invited to present a talk on radioactivity at the Royal Institution in London. Pierre Curie made the presentation, as women were prohibited from speaking engagements at the Royal Institution. In July 1904, Branson gave a presentation titled Radium and its Properties and made a demonstration with radium before members of the Leeds Geological Society and the Leeds Naturalist Club.Radium and its Properties."The Leeds Law Institute was, on the 23rd ult., crowded to the door on the occasion of a lecture by Mr. F. W. Branson, F.I.C., on that mysterious subject known as radium. The Leeds Geological Society and the Leeds Naturalist Club were also represented, and Mr. E. Hawkesworth was in the chair."The new metal, which Professor Pierre Curie discovered, has, as demonstrated by Mr. Branson, some wonderful properties and a probable great future."Mr. Branson first showed that radium is an element having the highest atomic weight known, and has a characteristic spectrum, by which it can be easily identified, and that it falls into the group of metals: barium, calcium, and strontium. He then showed the difference between atmospheric (sound) waves and ether waves (heat, light, and electrical), and alluded to the emanations given off by radium as consisting of electrons negatively charged, and also much larger particles of matter termed ions positively charged. The former have very penetrative powers as regards metals and opaque bodies, and are identical with the kathode rays that are given off in an ordinary X-ray tube."The positively charged particles are not so penetrative; indeed, they are easily stopped by such substances as cardboard. When a fragment of radium salt is held near to a zinc blende screen, the positively charged particles given off by radium salts bombard it and render the surface of the screen full of rapidly changing brilliant points. This phenomenon was shown by means of an instrument called the [...] "Spinthariscope.""With regard to the heat rays, the emanations of there from a tube of radium bromide, which had previously photographed itself on a photographic plate in the dark room, was shown by Bunsen's <b>Ice</b> <b>Calorimeter,</b> which instrument not only proves that heat is given out continuously by the salt, but measures accurately the amount generated. The reducing effect on chemical substances was alluded to, also the destruction of living tissues, and bacteria by radium emanations, and the general aspects of radio-activity were also dealt with and illustrated by numerous experiments, limelight views, and in other ways."The address was necessarily technical in its character, but sufficient properties of the metal were indicated to create a degree of sustained interest, and many eminent scientists {{from all parts of the}} country were present. A very hearty vote of thanks, proposed by Mr. Gilbert Middleton (president of the Leeds Photographic Society), seconded by Mr. Dreweryhouse (Leeds Geological Society), terminated probably the most interesting demonstration ever given before the society." ...|$|E

Some of the results are so discordant that i t is apparent that one or the other value is seriously mistaken. No attempt has been made i n this work to determine which value may be correct, but measurements have been made of the difference between these two values.
