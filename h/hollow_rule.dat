40|$|A set {{of general}} {{constructing}} schemes is unveiled to predict {{a large family}} of stable boron monoelemental, hollow fullerenes with magic numbers 32 + 8 k (k>= 0). The remarkable stabilities of these new boron fullerenes are then studied by intense ab initio calculations. An electron counting rule {{as well as an}} isolated <b>hollow</b> <b>rule</b> are proposed to readily show the high stability and the electronic bonding property, which are also revealed applicable to a number of newly predicted boron sheets and nanotubes.

40|$|There’s growing {{evidence}} that psychosis {{is linked to}} the physical environments that we live in. Good environments are the ones that allow people to step back, relax and feel secure, while engaging in interesting and meaningful activity. Bad environments don’t allow respite: they keep people on their toes and somehow magnify meaninglessness and <b>hollow</b> <b>rules</b> and unreasonable demands. They may also be bleak and even unfair or outright scary. But don’t expect everyone to notice the bad environments: recent studies demonstrate that patients with psychosis {{are far more likely to}} notice even subtle negative features in the environment than people without symptoms. The same patients are also less likely to notice the good things an environment has to offer – but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be provided...|$|R
5000|$|Mysteries of the Hollow Earth expands a {{great deal}} on the denizens of <b>Hollow</b> Earth, {{including}} <b>rules</b> for beastmen of various sorts, and provides details such as a map and gazetteer for those GMs who want a more fleshed-out world, rather than the more nebulous [...] "land of mysteries" [...] from the core book.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new multi-material based toolpath planning methodology for porous tissue scaffolds with multiple <b>hollowed</b> features. <b>Ruled</b> surface with <b>hollowed</b> features generated in our earlier work {{is used to}} develop toolpath planning. Ruling lines are reoriented to enable continuous and uniform size multi-material printing through them in two steps. Firstly, all ruling lines are matched and connected to eliminate start and stops during printing. Then, regions with high number of ruling lines are relaxed using a relaxation technique to eliminate over deposition. A novel layer-by-layer deposition process is progressed in two consecutive layers: The first layer with hollow shape based zigzag pattern and the next layer with spiral pattern deposition. Heterogeneous material properties are mapped based on the parametric distances from the hollow features...|$|R
40|$|Stainless {{steel is}} gaining {{increasing}} usage {{in the construction}} industry and tubular members represent the most widely used structural component. Cold-formed square, rectangular and circular hollow sections are readily available in stainless steel, and more recently, oval hollow sections have been introduced. Oval hollow sections are not currently included in structural design codes, neither for carbon steel nor stainless steel. This paper describes recent tests and finite element modelling performed on stainless steel oval hollow sections in compression and bending. A total of six stub column tests, six in-plane bending tests and eight column buckling tests are reported. Tests have been performed about both the major and minor axes. The results of the tests have been analysed and comparisons have been made with the structural performance of hot-rolled carbon steel elliptical <b>hollow</b> sections. Design <b>rules</b> including cross-section slenderness limits and a column buckling curve have been proposed, and progress towards the development of comprehensive design rules for stainless steel oval hollow sections is reported...|$|R
40|$|There’s {{something}} about drones that makes sane people crazy. Is it those lean, futurist profiles? The activities drone technologies enable? Or perhaps it’s just the word itself–drone–a mindless, unpleasant, dissonant thrum. Whatever the cause, drones seem {{to produce an}} unusual kind of cognitive dissonance in many people. Some demonize drones, denouncing them for causing civilian deaths or enabling long-distance killing, even as they {{ignore the fact that}} the same (or worse) could be said of many other weapons delivery systems. Others glorify them as a low-cost way to “take out terrorists,” despite the strategic vacuum in which most drone strikes occur. Still others insist that US drone policy is just “business as usual,” despite the fact that these attacks may undermine US foreign policy goals while creating an array of new problems. It is worth taking a closer look at what is and is not new and noteworthy about drone technologies and the activities they enable. Ultimately, “drones” as such present few new issues—but {{the manner in which the}} US has been using them raises grave questions about their strategic efficacy and unintended consequences. In fact, the legal theories used to justify many US drone strikes risk dangerously <b>hollowing</b> out the <b>rule</b> of law itself...|$|R
60|$|Thus in some {{countries}} to mention {{the name of your}} mother-in-law entails the most unpleasant consequences on that intimate relation. Nobody can say that to name the lady is a thing wicked in itself; yet the man who, knowing the penalties which will ensue, allows himself, even in a fit of passion against that relative, to violate the custom and mention her by name is doubtless an offender. Thus, too, the result of an entanglement between a woman and a man already married generally means unhappiness and hurt to all concerned, more especially to the women, whose prospects are perhaps irretrievably injured thereby. It is useless to point to the example of the patriarchs, some foreign royal families, and many respectable Turks; it is useless to plead that the love is deep and holy love, for which a man or woman might well live and die, or to show extenuating circumstances in the fact of loneliness, need of sympathy, and that the existing marriage is a <b>hollow</b> sham. The <b>rule</b> is clear. A man may do most things except cheat at cards or run away in action; a woman may break half-a-dozen hearts, or try to break them, and finally put herself up at auction and take no harm at all--but neither of them may in any event do this.|$|R
50|$|The Phagmodru (Phag mo gru) myriarchy {{centered}} at Neudong (Sne'u gdong) {{was granted}} as an appanage to Hülegü in 1251. The area {{had already been}} associated with the Lang (Rlang) family, and with the waning of Ilkhanate influence it was ruled by this family, within the Mongol-Sakya framework headed by the Mongol appointed Pönchen (Dpon chen) at Sakya. The areas under Lang administration were continually encroached upon during the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Jangchub Gyaltsän (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302-1364) saw these encroachments as illegal and sought the restoration of Phagmodru lands after his appointment as the Myriarch in 1322. After prolonged legal struggles, the struggle became violent when Phagmodru was attacked by its neighbours in 1346. Jangchub Gyaltsän was arrested and released in 1347. When he later refused to appear for trial, his domains were attacked by the Pönchen in 1348. Janchung Gyaltsän was able to defend Phagmodru, and continued to have military successes, until by 1351 he was the strongest political figure in the country. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyaltsän as the unquestioned victor, who established the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in that year. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as <b>hollow</b> formalities. The <b>rule</b> of Jangchub Gyaltsän and his successors implied a new cultural self-awareness where models were sought {{in the age of the}} ancient Tibetan Kingdom. The relatively peaceful conditions favoured the literary and artistic development. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) founded the Gelug sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434. After that, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. In spite of the weakening of central authority, the neighbouring Ming Dynasty of China made little effort to impose direct rule, although it had nominal claims of the Tibetan territory by establishing the U-Tsang Regional Military Commission and Do-Kham Regional Military Commission in 1370s. They also kept friendly relations with some of the Buddhism religious leaders known as Princes of Dharma and granted some other titles to local leaders including the Grand Imperial Tutor. Tibet would be independent from the mid-14th century on, for nearly 400 years.|$|R
