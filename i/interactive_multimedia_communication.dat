40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{constant}} {{increase in}} the performance and economic accessibiliy of modern calculation and communication systems has directed the interest of both researchers and industry towards the implementation of new forms of highly <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication</b> such as Video on Demand. These systems belong to the Continuous Media (CM) category 1, which feature a continuous flow of data from a service manager (mass storage system) to a multimedia user interface (client). The implementation of CM systems, however, shows up certain important limits in current mass memory technology, which is essentially electromechanical. For some time now, in fact, disks have constituted serious bottlenecks for performance in certain applications. The recent spread of parallel processing systems and multimedia applications has increased these limits even further.

40|$|Global {{communication}} and information exchange {{has become a}} critical factor for success. Computer supported collaboration tools should be used together with faster networks in order to solve these challenges. With the availability of an information highway, international and intercontinental collaboration becomes the usual form of daily work. Time and distance are no longer barriers. Colleagues in different locations around the world can contact each other easier and can discuss topics as they were just working next door. Multimedia teleservices, like conferencing and working in virutal Environments, need global, large bandwidth computer networks to transmit their simulation, audio and video data on demand. The main issue of such applications is that people located anywhere can meet together in interactive Vrtual Environments to exchange knowledge and manpower with advanced computer technologt {{in order to give}} support and help werever it is needed.

40|$|We present {{heuristics}} for multicast tree construction {{for communication}} that depends on: i) bounded end-to-end delay along the paths from source to each destination, and ii) minimum {{cost of the}} multicast tree, where edge cost and edge delay can be independent metrics. This problem of computing such a constrained multicast tree is NP-complete. We show that the heuristics demonstrate good average case behavior in terms of cost, as determined through simulations on {{a large number of}} graphs. The two measures, CT and VT, are individually insufficient to characterize a good multicast route for <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication.</b> The performance of such a multicast route is determined by two factors: i) bounded end-to-end delay along the individual paths from source to each destination, and ii) minimum cost of the multicast tree, for example, in terms of network bandwidth utilization. In our formulation, a multicast tree is a constrained Steiner tree, i. e., a delay-bounded minimum cost tree, where the delay bound is specified by the application performing the multicast. Kadaba and Jaffe [6] studied a problem that involves optimizing on both the cost and delay measures of the multicast tree. They investigated how a compromise could be struck between minimizing VT and CT. There are two primary differences between our approach and that of [6]. The fundamental difference is that we assume that edge cost and edge delay are different functions. For example, edge cost could be a measure of the amount of buffer space or channel bandwidth used, and edge delay could be a combination of propagation, transmission, and queueing delay. A second major difference is that we are trying to construct a constrained minimum cost tree, where the constraint is on the individual path delay, rather than trying to minimize the average path delay to all destinations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{key factors}} contributing to the “success ” of <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> development tools in non ICT professional contexts. We define “success ” in terms of acceptability and large scale usage by entities and institutions who may need to build <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> artifacts but do not have technical competences “in-house ” and must cope with very limited financial resources. Schools or museums, for example, may want to exploit <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> for <b>communication</b> or educational purposes, but are bound to many resource-related constraints. In this perspective, we argue that simplicity, low-cost, and ultra short “time-to-market ” are key requirements for <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> development tools to be accepted and widely adopted by non ICT professionals. To support his claim, we illustrate an exemplary tool that meets these requirements and was developed at our lab within the Policultura Project.

40|$|Voice over IP (VoIP) has the {{potential}} to be integrated with other Internet applications to provide <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication</b> services that are impossible (or at least very difficult) to deploy over the traditional circuit-switched wired and wireless networks. To fully exploit the benefit of service integration, it is necessary that VoIP services can be seamlessly provided with a good Quality-of-Service over several different network technologies. Due to their wide availability and significant user interest in mobile voice communications, particularly wireless network technologies will be crucial for the success of VoIP (and vice versa). However, the legacy Internet architecture is based on the "best effort" principle which does not guarantee a minimum amount of packet loss and a minimum delay of packet transmission required for voice communication. Considering a wireless access network to the Internet, QoS assurance is even more difficult. This is due to the inherently shared nature of the medium as well as its high medium error rate which add to the effect of congestion at routers known from wireline networks. In this paper we first analyze the concealment performance of the G. 729 decoder as one prominent example of the CELP coder family which are typically employed for VoIP. Using this result, we then develop QoS support schemes which selectively mark packets to a higher (DiffServ) network priority at the sender dependent on the properties of the speech signal and the expected concealment performance. On the wireless access link the priorities are then mapped to a simple ARQ scheme. This layered approach is in full conformance with existing standards. Objective quality measures (ITU-T P. 861 A and EMBSD) show that almost the same speech quality as if all p [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{last twenty}} years have been a period of {{unprecedented}} technological evolution, {{both in terms of}} the extent and of the acceleration of the changes brought about. Digital technology brings new services everyday, increases mobility, and spearheads unprecedented liberalization and competition, with the impact of ICT extending well beyond the economic domain. Computers are now widespread in homes after having been integrated in the workplace with broadband connections allowing truly <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication.</b> The effective and potential impact of converging information and communication digital technologies has permeated every sector of society: economic, social, political and cultural. With broadband access and wireless connections, Internet is becoming a “cultural crossroad of work, play and social interaction” (Marriott, 2006). Digital technology is overcoming barriers of time and space in ways no other technology had made possible before. The very texture of social life and cultural identities is being re-woven by those who have access to the technology and by rapidly emerging innovative, even if at times questionable, new social goals, interests and networks such as MySpace or SecondLife. Although computers have been present in classrooms for the last twenty five years, it is only with the generalised user friendly access to the Internet, in the mid ‘ 90 s, that the majority of schools and universities have begun, not only to feel the pressure to use ICT, but more importantly to develop specific, innovative and productive educational uses of ICT. Nevertheless, as communication behaviours evolve, as information access widens and societies try to implement e-democracy with IC technologies, new perspectives on information and knowledge are disrupting traditional academic perspectives. These issues will be developed in reference to the analysis, done within a European research project, of ten national Frameworks for integration of ICT in education, and to the results of a survey preceded by observations and interviews, and done with nearly 600 university students, in the first months of 2006, about their use of digital tools in their university work...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the Internet has been {{accompanied}} by an evolution of new applications, ranging from simple data services to complex applications such as IP telephony, video on demand, and <b>interactive</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication.</b> These new applications require an end-to-end IP architecture that can support multiple levels of service while preserving the scalability and simplicity of the current so-called “best-effort” Internet service model. This dissertation examines and proposes network and end-host support for these cutting-edge applications accounting for both the heterogeneity in the service requirements and the scalability concern. ^ In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we focus on the end-host and propose solutions for handling the variable resource requirements of multimedia streaming applications. We show that commonly-used round-based scheduling techniques for transferring data between the disk and the network interface are not well suited for the retrieval of multimedia streams. We propose lazy-EDF scheduling and show that it minimizes the server buffer and disk bandwidth requirements for a static set of requests. Simulation studies with MPEG traces demonstrate the significant performance gains possible under lazy-EDF. Using the optimality properties of lazy-EDF, we next propose greedy-fill with lazy discard (GFD) scheduling to address dynamic request arrivals and admission control in a disk subsystem. In addition, we propose efficient workload description for stored VBR video that we demonstrate to increase the resource utilization as high as 200 – 250 % over the best known result. ^ In the second part of this dissertation, we focus on scalable network support for providing different classes of services to multimedia applications. In particular, we focus on the achievable services and limitations of the recently proposed differentiated services (diffserv) architecture in which simple mechanisms are used within the network core and more complicated functionality is possible only at the network edge. First we determine the mechanisms at the network core that are best suited to provide service differentiation. In order to do so, we compare the ability of proposed diffserv mechanisms in providing delay and loss differentiation across service classes. Next we examine the impact of diffserv mechanisms on the applications that use TCP congestion control protocol. We present a simple and yet accurate analytical model for TCP when “profile-based” marking is used at the network edge for providing service differentiation. Using this model, we examine whether it is possible to provide rate guarantees to TCP flows by solely setting the profile parameters at the network edge. We find that it is not always easy to regulate or guarantee the rate achieved by a TCP flow using this approach. We derive conditions that determine what rates are achievable and provide insights for choosing appropriate profile parameters for these achievable services. These observations are validated in a testbed implementation using PCs running modified Linux kernel. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{specific}} {{class of}} multimedia applications {{is expected to}} be of importance for future <b>communication</b> networks: Multi-Party <b>Interactive</b> <b>Multimedia</b> (MIM). Based on the isolation and characterization of MIM applications, concrete network support requirements are derived in this paper. The varying degree of connectivity, the vastly different sizes in terms of participants and the reliance on a guaranteed Quality of Service make MIM support a difficult problem. Starting with the definition of <b>multimedia</b> <b>communication</b> abstractions, principles of solutions are sketched. For an important subclass of applications a particularly efficient and practicable alternative implementation based on half-duplex channels is introduced. Finally, interfaces at both the transport and network layers are considered. 1 Introduction In the area of distributed systems, two events can be considered as among the major sources of the research activity on high-speed networking.
