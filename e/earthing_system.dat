25|$|Having one RCD feeding {{another is}} {{generally}} unnecessary, provided {{they have been}} wired properly. One exception {{is the case of}} a TT <b>earthing</b> <b>system,</b> where the earth loop impedance may be high, meaning that a ground fault might not cause sufficient current to trip an ordinary circuit breaker or fuse. In this case a special 100 mA (or greater) trip current time-delayed RCD is installed, covering the whole installation, and then more sensitive RCDs should be installed downstream of it for sockets and other circuits that are considered high-risk.|$|E
50|$|As an {{integrative}} field, <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> science {{assumes the}} histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at NASA, where a committee called the <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Science: Overview (1986), and the book-length <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Science: A Closer View (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> science. Early works discussing <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of <b>Earth</b> <b>system</b> science parallel to the beginnings of global change studies and programs.|$|R

[...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety <b>earthing</b> <b>system.</b> [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|E

50|$|In {{high-voltage}} networks (above 1 kV), {{which are}} far less accessible to the general public, the focus of <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> design is less on safety and more on reliability of supply, reliability of protection, and impact on the equipment in presence of a short circuit. Only the magnitude of phase-to-ground short circuits, which {{are the most common}}, is significantly affected with the choice of <b>earthing</b> <b>system,</b> as the current path is mostly closed through the earth. Three-phase HV/MV power transformers, located in distribution substations, are the most common source of supply for distribution networks, and type of grounding of their neutral determines the <b>earthing</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{magnitude}} of fault currents differ widely {{depending on the}} type of <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> used, the installation's supply type and <b>earthing</b> <b>system,</b> and its proximity to the supply.

Large low-voltage networks with multiple sources may have fault levels of 300,000 amperes. A high-resistance-grounded system may restrict line to ground fault current to only 5 amperes. Prior to selecting protective devices, prospective fault current must be measured reliably at the origin of the installation and at the furthest point of each circuit, and this information applied properly to the application of the circuits.|$|E

50|$|In pre-RCD era, the TT <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> was unattractive {{for general}} use {{because of the}} {{difficulty}} of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) {{in the case of a}} line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as residual current devices mitigate this disadvantage, the TT <b>earthing</b> <b>system</b> has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) is recommended for situations where an low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.|$|E

Roehrig. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 222 pages, appendices p. 219 - 222. Over {{the last two}} decades, scientists have recognized the necessity of studying the earth as an integrated system. Consequently, the knowledge of physical <b>earth</b> <b>systems</b> and human interactions was integrated {{to form a new}} discipline, <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Science (ESS). Given the acceleration of environmental change, such as that of the global climate <b>system,</b> understanding the <b>earth</b> as a <b>system</b> has become essential {{in order to create a}} scientifically literate citizenry. However, our understanding of teachers' and students' conceptual understanding of <b>earth</b> as a <b>system</b> is still in its infancy. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the ESS discipline as well as the complexity of the ESS knowledge structure, there is no consensus about important ESS knowledge for teachers or students. This study presents an analytical framework, <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Knowledge Framework (ESKF), to assess teachers' conceptual understanding of <b>earth</b> <b>systems</b> using the concept of water. By utilizing the framework, this study investigates five secondary earth science teachers' conceptual understandings of water in <b>earth</b> <b>system.</b> This study also probes how the teachers' conceptual understanding of water in the <b>earth</b> <b>system</b> affects their selection and organization of the topics and related content knowledge for lesson planning. Through intensive interviews with the teachers, this study employs multiple case studies using inductive and qualitative analysis methods. The findings of this study demonstrate that the teachers' conceptual understandings of water in <b>earth</b> <b>system</b> are highly related to their <b>Earth</b> <b>System</b> Knowledge (ESK). Furthermore, the science teachers' conceptual understanding of water in <b>earth</b> <b>system</b> directly affects the topic choices and content knowledge used for teaching the concept of water. This study implies that the teachers not only need to possess knowledge of physical <b>earth</b> <b>systems</b> but also knowledge of earth's biosphere and ecosystems to understand <b>earth</b> as a <b>system.</b> This study also suggests a need to reform teacher preparation in a way that the teachers could gain basic and fundamental knowledge of <b>earth</b> <b>system</b> and elaborate their skills to apply <b>earth</b> <b>system</b> knowledge for teaching...|$|R
