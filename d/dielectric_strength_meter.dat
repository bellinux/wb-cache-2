50|$|The field {{strength}} at which breakdown occurs {{depends on the}} respective geometries of the dielectric (insulator) and the electrodes with which the electric field is applied, {{as well as the}} rate of increase at which the electric field is applied. Because dielectric materials usually contain minute defects, the practical <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> will be a fraction of the intrinsic <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of an ideal, defect-free, material. Dielectric films tend to exhibit greater <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> than thicker samples of the same material. For instance, the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of silicon dioxide films of a few hundred nm to a few μm thick is approximately 0.5GV/m. However very thin layers (below, say, 100 nm) become partially conductive because of electron tunneling. Multiple layers of thin dielectric films are used where maximum practical <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> is required, such as high voltage capacitors and pulse transformers. Since the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of gases varies depending on the shape and configuration of the electrodes, it is usually measured as a fraction of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of Nitrogen gas.|$|R

Stresses are caused by the overvoltages across CBs, the interrupting currents {{and the rate of}} rise of recovery voltage (RRRV). Such electrical stresses also depend on the types of system grounding and the types of <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> curves. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate a restrike waveform predictive model for a SF 6 CB that considered the types of system grounding: grounded and non-grounded and the computation accuracy comparison on the application of the cold withstand <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> and the hot recovery <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> curve including the POW (point-on-wave) recommendations to make an assessment of increasing the CB remaining life.

40|$|When {{breaking}} large {{currents in}} switching devices, arcs are created, which continue {{to carry the}} current. It is desirable to extinguish these in order to break the current. In this master thesis {{a model of the}} arcs behavior during current zero-crossings was made and put into a module, which is to be used when simulating electrical AC arcs. The module will be used when designing switches, e. g. contactors. When the current falls to 0 A there is a race between the transient recovery voltage and the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength,</b> which determines if the arc will extinguish or restrike. The arc is extinguished if the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> is greater than the transient recovery voltage through the whole cycle.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a study {{which has been}} carried out to use coconut oil as insulation in transformers. Among the important properties considered are the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of coconut oil which corresponds to less than 20 kV for a 2. 5 mm sphere gap and the pour point which is approximately 23 °C. To retain the oil in liquid form at low temperatures, several pour point depressants were tried. Some of them depressed the pour point, but also lowered the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> and proved unsatisfactory. In order to have improved properties, a purified form of coconut oil was used in the investigation. In this, the free fatty acids have been neutralized (reduced to 0. 02 %). Deodorization by steam distillation at 200 °C has removed odorizing and tasting compounds of lower boiling points. The moisture has been reduced by heating to over 100 °C. The demoisturized coconut oil sample showed promising results. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> improved to 60 kV or even higher dependant on the moisture reduction of the sample. Since the distribution transformer tank (manufactured by Lanka Transformers Ltd) is a sealed container and oil is filled inside a vacuum chamber, moisture inclusion after manufacture is prevented. As an alternative to reducing the pour point, repeated experiments on the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> of solidified and partially solidified coconut oil samples were carried out, and it was found that solidification {{does not appear to have}} any adverse effect on the <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength.</b> Coconut oil solidifies without creating voids, keeping its <b>dielectric</b> <b>strength</b> unreduced.

The estimation of the crossing quantities, performed for various power cable voltage ratings, shows that the crossing length – if any - is a strong function of the cable size and voltage rating.
