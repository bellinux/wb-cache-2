5|$|Deprived of a {{rationale}} for existence by the national monument's establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney's office, headed by <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b> In 1990 Reno's office determined after investigation {{that all of the}} town's elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E

5000|$|In 1999, he was {{appointed}} Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and subsequently Assistant Attorney General under President Bill Clinton on October 7. Raben oversaw Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno’s</b> legislative initiatives and handled extensive congressional oversight of the Department. He received unanimous confirmation vote for this position along with an endorsement from the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican subcommittee chairs. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said Raben's confirmation [...] "would place a proven person in a position that {{is critical to the}} cooperation of Congress and the Executive Branch." [...] As Assistant Attorney General under President Bill Clinton, he oversaw Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno’s</b> legislative initiatives and handled congressional oversight of the Department.

5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 1998, Mrs. King {{met with}} Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> as {{requested}} by President Bill Clinton. Their meeting {{took place at}} the Justice Department four days after the thirtieth anniversary of her husband's death.|$|E

5000|$|The manual had {{previously}} been published only anonymously, and mailed anonymously to pro-life leaders and news reporters. Leach's reprint of {{it was the first}} printing that was not anonymous. The introduction explained that <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno's</b> Virginia Grand Jury had, for a year, subpoenaed pro-lifers and [...] "commanded" [...] them to bring any copies they had of the Army of God Manual, which were then taken, which Leach alleged was treating the possession of the book as a crime. Leach wrote of the reprinting: [...] "If owning a book is a crime, here I am; prosecute me." [...] Within days after reprints went in the mail, the Virginia Grand Jury was disbanded.|$|R

25|$|In May 1998, Blumenthal, {{along with}} {{attorneys}} general from 19 {{other states and}} the District of Columbia, filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft accusing the company of abusing its monopoly power to stifle competition. The suit, which centered on Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system and the company's contractual restrictions imposed on personal computer manufacturers to tie the operating system to its Internet Explorer browser, was eventually merged with a federal case brought by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b>|$|E
25|$|Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
25|$|Reno {{was born}} in Miami, Florida. Reno's mother, Jane Wallace (née Wood), raised her {{children}} and then became an investigative reporter for The Miami News. Her father, Henry Olaf Reno (né Rasmussen), was an emigrant from Denmark and {{a reporter for the}} Miami Herald for 43 years. <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> had three younger siblings: Mark (died 2014); writer Robert Reno (1939–2012); and Maggy Hurchalla.

She {{was the first woman}} to serve as Attorney General and the second-longest serving Attorney General in U.S. history, after William Wirt.|$|R
50|$|David's wife, Linda Patrik, first {{suspected}} Theodore {{and urged}} David {{to read the}} manifesto when it was published. David recognized Ted's writing style, and the experienced criminal defense lawyer the couple hired notified authorities. On April 3, 1996, police arrested Ted in his rural cabin in Lincoln, Montana. David had received assurance from the FBI that his identity as the informant would be kept secret, but his name was leaked to the media. In addition, he sought a guarantee from federal prosecutors that Ted would receive appropriate psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The Justice Department's subsequent active pursuit {{of the death penalty}} for Ted, and Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno's</b> initial refusal to accept a plea bargain in exchange for a life sentence, was seen by Kaczynski and other members of his family as a betrayal. Such a plea bargain was eventually reached, and Ted was sentenced to serve life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Kaczynski has stated in interviews that notifying federal authorities of his brother's possible involvement in the Unabomber case was a painful decision, but that he felt morally compelled to do it in order to save lives that might have been taken had the bombings continued.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be as inoffensive as possible to prove the point that not all video games were corrupting influences. Penn Jillette commented in his radio show that the overly realistic nature of the game was in response to <b>Janet</b> <b>Renos</b> comments in support of the moral panic about violent video games at the time (see Video game controversies). He also stated that {{there would have been a}} prize for the person or group to get the highest score in the game, also substantiated by the various Desert Bus contest materials prepared for the release of the game. Penn said that the prize [...] "was going to be, you got to go on Desert Bus from Tucson to Vegas with showgirls and a live band and just the most partying bus ever. You got to Vegas, were going to put you up at the Rio, big thing, and then, you know, big shows." [...] Some have played the game using a tool-assisted emulator, managing to obtain 99 points, the maximum the game allows. A run of this length would have taken 33 days to complete in real time.|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the events of}} April 19, 1993 when Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) special agents served a warrant on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas was ongoing during Freeh's tenure. While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> then-Attorney General. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent United States Marshals to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.|$|E

25|$|Inslaw {{is known}} for {{developing}} Promis, an early case management software system. It is also known for a lawsuit that it brought against the United States Department of Justice in 1986 over Promis. Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal. The suit resulted in several Justice Department internal reviews, two Congressional investigations, {{the appointment of a}} special counsel by Attorney General William P. Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel's report under Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b> Inslaw's claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court's ruling against Inslaw in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a particular social group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the person seeking asylum is fleeing must recognize their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state annual dues are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These critics say the association is increasingly frozen out of politics {{in a state where}} Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. They point to the federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (<b>Janet</b> <b>Reno)</b> and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{first met}} <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> in November 1975, when {{he applied for}} {{a job as an}} {{assistant}} state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded, [...] "I'm only interested in virile men. That’s why I'm not attracted to you." [...] He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was [...] "a political ploy". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a [...] "kook".|$|E
500|$|Several politicians, {{including}} US Representative Bobby Rush, {{requested that}} State's Attorney Richard A. Devine seek new trials for the Death Row 10 who were allegedly tortured by Burge into making coerced [...] confessions. Devine met with representatives {{and supporters of}} the inmates and was convinced to request that the Illinois Supreme Court stay proceedings against three of the inmates. [...] However, the Illinois Supreme Court denied Devine's request. [...] Rush also sought out Attorney [...] General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> to pursue federal intervention.|$|E
500|$|ASL is {{distinguished}} by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class. [...] The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort. Students are given {{an overview of}} different types of conflict resolutions, particularly mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Ethical issues are explored in addition to legal and policy ramifications. Students learn {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each method of dispute resolution and learn which methods are appropriate for certain situations.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney General <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
