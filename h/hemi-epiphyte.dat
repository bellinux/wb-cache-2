50|$|Ficus superba, {{also known}} as sea fig or {{deciduous}} fig, is a hemiepiphytic tree of genus Ficus. It {{is also one of}} the species known as a Strangler fig because of its potential to grow as a <b>hemi-epiphyte</b> and eventually progress to the strangling habit that many figs are known for. It is, however, not an obligate <b>hemi-epiphyte</b> and can be found growing as single stemmed trees in forests. It is found in Japan, Taiwan, and China, as well as various parts of Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Java, Kalimantan, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Moluccas, Seram Island, and Peninsular Malaysia.|$|E

40|$|The species {{composition}} of vascular epiphytes and phorophytes (trees and lianas) was studied in ten 0. 1 -ha forest plots distributed over three landscape units (floodplains, swamps and well-drained uplands) in Colombian Amazonia. The {{aim was to}} analyse how host-preferences contributed to the patterns in epiphyte assemblages among the landscape units. In the plots 82 species (3310 plants) were holo-epiphytes, 11 species were primary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> (179 plants) and 61 were secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> (2337 plants). A total of 411 species of tree and liana were recorded as phorophytes. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Mantel tests showed that the {{species composition}} of holo-epiphytes and secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> differed among the landscape units. For both groups the effect of landscape unit on species composition strongly decreased after controlling for the phorophyte composition in the plots. The phorophyte composition significantly explained epiphyte composition and this effect was not removed after accounting for the effect of landscape unit. At the level of individual species, randomization tests yielded only few significant epiphyte-phorophyte associations. For 84 % of the epiphyte species the average indicator of patchiness was below 1. 5 demonstrating that most epiphyte individuals occurred scattered over different phorophytes. This probably hampered the analyses of host preferences for individual epiphyte species...|$|R
50|$|Lianas are {{relatively}} rare on mature (>20 cm dbh) individuals of S. amara, {{compared to other}} trees on BCI, with only around 25% having lianas growing on them. Putz suggested {{that this may be}} due to the trees having large leaves, but the mechanism by which this would reduce the number of lianas is unknown. Smaller individuals also have fewer lianas and woody <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> than other species of tree in the same forests.|$|R
40|$|Secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> {{start their}} life as ground-dwelling plants. Like other vines, the plant then climbs the host, {{but when the}} plant reaches maturity, the oldest portion of the stem dies. The plant then loses its stem {{connection}} to the soil and becomes semi-epiphytic. However, true secondary hemi-epiphytism is probably not as common as thought, since, in most cases semi-epiphytic vines reconnect to the soil through aerial roots. The change in soil connection during the ontogeny of these species may have physiological and anatomical consequences. As they eventually live in the canopy environment, it is feasible that secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> might develop adaptations {{to cope with the}} stressful canopy environment, especially water stress during dry periods. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the ecophysiology of secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> in rainforests. There is a paucity of information on the anatomy and physiology of secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes,</b> once they lose their stem connection to the soil, compared with the terrestrial early stage of development. To address this knowledge gap, characteristics of stem water transport, leaf anatomy and physiology, and soil water resource partitioning were examined in this research. Two species were selected for the study: Freycinetia excelsa F. Muell (Pandanaceae) and Rhaphidophora australasica F. M. Bailey (Araceae), which occur naturally in the Wet Tropics area of north Queensland. The general objective of this research is to better understand the ecophysiology of secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> during their ontogenetic development. The capacity of F. excelsa and R. australasica stems to conduct water differed between plants of different developmental phases. Adult individuals of F. excelsa and R. australasica had wider vessels than younger plants. Hydraulic architecture parameters, i. e. hydraulic conductivity, stem specific conductivity and leaf specific conductivity, were also higher in adult plants than for intermediate and juvenile individuals. These results indicate that adult plants had a higher capacity to conduct water through the stem to the leaves than did individuals at an earlier stage of development. As the plants became more mature and longer, they tended to have low hydraulic conductivity at the stem base. This finding is supported by the fact that the size of xylem vessels was found to decrease in the basipetal direction: the base of the stem had narrower vessels than the middle part of the stem. However, the low hydraulic conductivity at the base of the stem may also be related to the fact that monocotyledonous plants lack secondary development. Therefore, the stem base contains the oldest shoot tissues and the vessels might be less functional. Wider vessels and higher hydraulic conductivity in adult individuals of F. excelsa and R. australasica show that the change in plant-soil connectivity during ontogeny of these species does not physically restrict water transport. Adult individuals of F. excelsa and R. australasica had larger stomata than conspecific juveniles. However, adult plants also had more stomata per unit area, which gives them more control of the opening and closing of stomata in certain areas of the leaves. These characteristics of leaf anatomy suggest that secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> are well-adapted to the canopy environment. Juvenile plants of these two study species appear to be more sensitive to the onset of drought than plants of later developmental stages. Within each dry and wet season, the water potential of leaves from all growth forms were similar but the patterns of daily CO₂ exchange differed, with CO₂ uptake by juvenile plants most affected by dry season conditions. However, the CO₂ exchange rates were similar for adult, intermediate and juvenile plants during the wet season. High water availability in the wet season and relatively low evaporative demands provide excellent conditions for plants to absorb CO₂. The significant down-regulation of CO₂ exchange in the dry season in the juveniles is related to the lower hydraulic conductivity of their stems. Water supply to juveniles may be restricted during the dry season, such that down-regulation of CO₂ uptake and stomatal opening are necessary to diminish water loss and maintain water potential. Water supplied to intermediate and adult plants by aerial roots growing from a number of places along the stem is evidently sufficient to sustain higher rates of CO₂ exchange and water loss. Plants of different ontogenetic stages had different behaviours towards soil water resources. Based on the hydrogen stable isotopes of water derived from different layers of the soil profile, matched with isotope signatures of the stem water, water uptake by juvenile individuals was limited to the area near the soil surface; on the other hand, adult plants utilized water from all soil layers studied. This consequently affects the capacity of plants to exploit all available soil water sources across seasons, which influences the performance of individuals of different ontogenetic stages in response to environmental conditions. Variations in the ecophysiological attributes of the secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> F. excelsa and R. australasica indicate differences in the ability of these plants to survive during their development. This study showed that smaller size juveniles may have a higher potential susceptibility to stressful environmental conditions compared to larger adult congeners. Based on ecophysiological characters, these two secondary <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> have not adapted especially to the epiphytic habit as they climb the host and live in the canopy. The plants' soil connections through aerial roots provide access to soil, avoid the stem basal hydraulic bottle neck and contribute to more options for soil water resource acquisition...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{composition}} {{and structure of}} the low-trunk epiphytic herb assembly as well as its vertical distribution were studied. DBH of host tree and bark type influence species richness and abundance in a nonlooded lowland tropical rainforest in Eastern Amazonia (1 º 57 &# 8217; 36 "S 51 º 36 &# 8217; 55 "W). A total of 37 epiphytic herb species were identified, among which 60 % were Araceae. Species richness and abundance of epiphytic herbs showed tendency of positive correlation with host tree size and no relationships with bark type. Low positive correlation may be a by-product of the predominance of trees with smaller diameter in our sample rather than a reflection of neutral relationship. The absence of relationships with bark type may be partially explained by the large number of secondary, generalist, <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> and also may reflect the absence of suitable substrate in trees with smaller diameter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{adequate}} {{protection and}} sustainable management of a {{tropical rain forest}} requires a good knowledge of its biodiversity. Although considerable parts of Guyana’s North-West District have been allocated as logging concessions, little has been published on the forest types present in this region. The present paper reviews the floristic composition, vegetation structure, and diversity of well-drained mixed and secondary forests in northwest Guyana. Trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs and <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> were inven-toried in four hectare plots: two in primary forests, one in a 20 -year-old secondary forest and one in a 60 -year-old secondary forest. The primary forests largely corresponded with the Eschweilera–Licania association described by Fanshawe, although there were substantial variations in the floristic composition and densities of dominant species. The late-succession forest contained the highest number species and was not yet dominated by Lecythidaceae and Chrysobalanaceae. There {{is a need for}} updating the exist-ing vegetation maps of northwest Guyana, as they were based on limited information. Large-scale forest inventories may provide a fair indication of species dominance and forest composition, but do not give a reliable insight in floristic diversity. Although previous reports predicted a general low diversity for the North-West District, the forests plots of this research were among the most diverse studied in Guyana so far. These results will hopefully influence the planning of protected areas in Guyana...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} floristic composition, {{vegetation}} structure, {{and diversity of}} three types of swamp forest that cover a considerable part of Guyana’s North-West District. Trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs, and <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> were inventoried in three hectare plots: one in Mora forest, one in quackal swamp, and one in manicole swamp. The Mora forest, flooded annually by white water, was dominated by relatively few, large individuals of Mora excelsa. The very dense, thin-stemmed quackal forest, almost permanently flooded by black water, was characterized by Tabebuia insignis and Symphonia globulifera and contained few palms. The somewhat less dense manicole swamp, flooded regularly by brackish water, was distinguished by large numbers of Euterpe oleracea. Although the three swamps showed little overlap in floristic composition and densities of dominant species, they represent some of the lowest diversity forest in the Neotropics, with an -diversity of 7. 4 for the Mora forest, 8. 2 for the quackal forest and 5. 7 for the manicole swamp. When compared with similar vegetation types in the Guiana Shield, the swamp forests in this study show some interesting differences in species composition and density. The wetlands of the North-West District form the last stretch of natural coastline in Guyana and {{play an important role}} in the protection of riverine ecosystems. Furthermore, there is commercial potential for the extraction of non-timber forest products from these low-diversity forests. Nevertheless, in prolonged dry periods, large tracts of quackal forest are being burnt to give way to almost treeless, flooded savannas. For these reasons, adequate management and conservation strategies must be developed for the area...|$|R
40|$|Rainforests {{in eastern}} Australia have been {{extensively}} cleared {{over the past}} two centuries. In recent decades, there have been increasing efforts to reforest some of these cleared lands, using a variety of methods, to meet a range of economic and environmental objectives. However, {{the extent to which the}} various styles of reforestation restore structure, composition and ecological function to cleared land is not presently understood. In this study, we develop and apply a method for quantifying the structural attributes of reforestation sites in tropical and subtropical Australia. The types of reforestation studied were plantation monocultures, mixed-species cabinet timber plots, diverse restoration plantings and unmanaged regrowth. Two age classes of reforestation were examined: 2 ̆ 7 young 2 ̆ 7 (5 - 22 years), incorporating sites from all categories, and 2 ̆ 7 old 2 ̆ 7 (30 - 70 years), in which only monoculture plantations and regrowth were represented. A total of 104 sites were surveyed including reference sites in intact rainforest and pasture. Intact rainforest was characterised by a suite of complex structural features including abundant special life forms (vines, epiphytes, <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> and strangler figs), a dense stand of trees in a range of size classes, a closed canopy, a shrubby understorey and a well-developed ground layer of leaf litter and woody debris. These features were lost on conversion to pasture. While all types of reforestation returned some elements of structural complexity to cleared land, young plantation monocultures, cabinet timber plots and young regrowth had a relatively simple structure. These sites typically had a low density of woody stems, a relatively open canopy and grassy ground cover, and lacked large trees, coarse woody debris and most special life forms. Restoration plantings and old regrowth were more complex, with a high density of woody stems, a relatively closed canopy and shrubby understorey. Old monoculture plantations in the tropics had acquired many of the structural attributes of intact forest, however this was not the case in the subtropics, where plantations were subject to more intensive management. The marked differences in structural complexity between sites suggest that the different types of reforestation practiced in eastern Australia are likely to vary considerably in their value as habitat for rainforest biota.

40|$|Physiognomy, {{structure}} and floristic composition of one hectare of lowland {{tropical rain forest}} was studied in detail at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Physiognomically, the Los Tuxtlas forest should be classified as lsquolowland tropical high evergreen rain forestrsquo. The forest showed a closed canopy at 30 – 35 m. Of all woody, non-climbing species with a DBHge 1. 0 cm 89. 4 % (94. 5 % of all individuals) were evergreen, 25. 4 % (59. 5 % of the individuals) had compound leaves, and over 80 % of species (and individuals) had leaves in the notophyll and mesophyll size classes. The forest structure was characterized by a low density (2976 individuals with a DBHge 1. 0 cm, 346 individuals with a DBHge 10. 0 cm, per ha, excluding vines) with an average basal area (38. 1 m 2, DBHge 1. 0 cm, 34. 9 m 2, DBHge 10. 0 cm, per ha, excluding vines). This was attributed to the relative maturity of the forest on the study plot. The study plot contained 234 species (11 208 individuals with a height ge 0. 5 m), of which 55. 1 % (34. 8 % of individuals) were trees, 9. 4 % (6. 8 %) shrubs, 3. 4 % (44. 3 %) palms, 20. 1 % (5. 2 %) vines, 6. 8 % (8. 7 %) herbs and 5. 1 % (0. 3 %) of unknown lifeform. Furthermore, 58 species of epiphytes and <b>hemi-epiphytes</b> were found. Diversity of trees, shrubs and palms with a DBHge 1. 0 cm was calculated as Shannon-Wiener index (4. 65), Equitability index (0. 65), and Simpson index (0. 10). The dominance-diversity curve showed a lognormal form, characteristic for tropical rain forest. The community structure was characterized by a relative dominance of Astrocaryum mexicanum in the understorey, Pseudolmedia oxyphyllaria in the middle storeys, and Nectandra ambigens in the canopy. Species population structures of 31 species showed three characteristic patterns, differentiated by recruitment: continuously high, discontinuously high, and continuously low recruitment. Height/diameter and crown cover/diameter diagrams suggested a very gradual shift from height growth to crown growth during tree development. Forest turnover was calculated as 138 years. Compared to other tropical rain forests the Los Tuxtlas forest had 1. similar leaf physiognomical characteristics, 2. a lower diversity, 3. a lower density, 4. an average basal area, and 5. a slow canopy turnover...|$|R
50|$|Metrosideros bartlettii was {{discovered}} by John Bartlett, a schoolteacher from Auckland, in 1975. He found an unusual tree growing in Radar Bush, 9.5 km south-east of Cape Reinga. Almost ten years passed before the flowers were collected, making possible a scientific description of the tree. Bartlett's rātā grows to a height of up to thirty metres, usually beginning life as a <b>hemi-epiphyte</b> on taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi), pūriri (Vitex lucens), rewarewa (Knightia excelsa) or tree ferns (Cyathea spp.). Occasionally, the tree is found growing on the ground on rock outcrops and rocky cliffs. The tree bears white flowers {{made up of a}} mass of stamens in November or December. Seed ripens in March or April. The trunk is up to 1.5 m in diameter. Bartlett's rātā resembles northern rātā (Metrosideros robusta) but can be distinguished by the small white flowers and by the leaves, which taper to a point at the tip, while those of northern rātā are notched at the tip. Also distinctive is the white or whitish-grey bark that peels easily into soft flakes, which it is thought may offer resistance to fire damage. This may have been a key factor in the tree's precarious survival in an area prone to forest fire.|$|E
