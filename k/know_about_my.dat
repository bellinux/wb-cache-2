500|$|The {{lyrics of}} several songs relate to Duff's {{experiences}} between the releases of Hilary Duff and Dignity. The songs [...] "Stranger" [...] and [...] "Gypsy Woman", despite speculation {{that they were}} written about Madden's then-new girlfriend Nicole Richie, were actually written about Duff's father's affair. She said that [...] "Stranger" [...] was written from her mother's perspective. [...] "Stranger is a song I wrote about how my mom must feel around my dad," [...] she said. [...] "I made it seem like {{it was about a}} relationship I was in, because I didn't want people to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> parents. But I've realized that so many people can relate to what I've gone through." [...] The album's title track has also been reported to be about Richie, though Duff did not deny rumors that it was. [...] "Dignity is a song that is definitely about people in Hollywood", she said. [...] "I wouldn't say that it is about her specifically but it is about people that kind of do what she does and act the way she acts." [...] The song [...] "Danger" [...] was written about one of Duff's friends' relationships with an older man. [...] "I understand that feeling of wanting to be dangerous," [...] she said. [...] "You may know morally something's not right, but you can't help yourself." [...] She has stated that the song [...] "Dreamer" [...] was written about a stalker in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, and it has been speculated that it was written specifically about Miakovsky.|$|E

6000|$|This bit of {{conversation}} puzzled me not a little. What did these men <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> uncle? Could {{it be possible}} that he {{had anything to do}} with the Spitfire? ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{needed no}} second invitation, and poured out helter-skelter all (how very little, in my girlish folly) that I <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father's affairs, {{and of how}} I had been [...] "left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, {{out with}} it, Jane!" [...] said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her. [...] "You mean to say, Fred Vincy {{has been getting}} {{somebody}} to advance him money on what he says he <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> will, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the short}} fellow who {{got me to}} carry the valise!" [...] he said to himself. [...] "They <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> goin' to see the inspector, and are bound {{to get me out}} of the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{make it a}} rule, Sir Mungo," [...] replied Richie, [...] "always {{to speak}} any evil I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> family myself, having observed, that if I do not, it {{is sure to be}} told by ither folks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> will?" [...] he asked, {{laughing}} {{a little}} awkwardly, {{as if he}} had really attempted to kiss her--in the course of the second independent interview he had ever had with her--and been rebuffed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to hunt up this Holtzmann, {{and find}} out what he <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father's affairs. I'm {{satisfied}} that he is as deep in it as Mr. Woodward or John Stumpy, and if I can only by some means get him to tell what he knows, I may accomplish a good deal." ...|$|R
60|$|If I fell in {{love with}} any one in Wimblehurst it was with my aunt. She treated me with a kindliness that was only half maternal--she petted <b>my</b> books, she <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> certificates, she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her. Quite unconsciously I grew fond of her....|$|R
6000|$|... "He was so obliging as {{to suggest}} my father for your tutor, and he called on my father to propose it. Of course he <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father from his {{connection}} with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her." ...|$|R
6000|$|He waited, {{returning}} her glance with {{a certain}} severity. [...] "What do you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> correspondence? No doubt I ask too much," [...] he went on; [...] "I'm so attached to them. Dear old Peter, dear old Julia!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} pay me, for I settled the account," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "But let us drop this talk for the present, Jasniff. I {{want you to tell}} me all you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father and my sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}}, Annot, do you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> lover, or {{how on earth}} can you know that I have a lover at all? Why, child, I and my cousin Agatha are both going to be nuns at St. Laurent." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] exclaimed Happy Jack. [...] "Pooh! I <b>know</b> all <b>about</b> <b>my</b> own family, and I {{guess there}} isn't much worth knowing <b>about</b> <b>my</b> neighbors that I don't know." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People {{find that}} hard to believe, but Miss Muir <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> it, <b>my</b> mother <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> it and I <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> it. Nothing was hidden, but nor was it public".|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't tell any one; {{only now}} and then we'll come here and talk things over, and I'll pay you for it by telling all I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> sort of things. Will that do?" [...] and Dan held out his big, rough hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> type?" [...] Sir Claude laughed. [...] "Whatever {{it may be}} I {{dare say}} it deceives you. The truth about me is simply that I'm the most unappreciated of--what do you call the fellows?--'family-men.' Yes, I'm a family-man; upon my honour I am!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} are so confident," [...] Peter Ruff said. [...] "Of course, if I {{have to take this}} thing on I shall do my best; but, if I might venture to allude for a moment to {{anything}} so trifling as my own domestic affairs, I am very anxious to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} {{something}} I <b>know</b> <b>about</b> you, <b>my</b> dear,' returned Mrs Lammle in her winning way, 'and that is, you are most unnecessarily shy.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{publication}} of his most recent book, The Restitution of Jesus Christ, was preceded by his usage of the pseudonym Servetus the Evangelical. His stated reasons for doing so were: [...] "if my fellow Evangelicals ever <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> christological beliefs they would not accept me as a genuine Christian and ostracize me from the Evangelical community." [...] His book endorses a Unitarian viewpoint of christology, similar to the quasi-Unitarian position of Michael Servetus himself.|$|R
5000|$|In many interviews, Volkova has officially {{stated that}} she is bisexual, stating, [...] "I still like boys and girls. Even my current husband Volodya, {{sitting in front of}} me would confirm that he <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> stories with the girls. For me, this is a current issue. Quite recently, I had a girlfriend that I liked ... This is not even the echoes of the past, this is what I now live in... " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have stayed}} there," [...] said the Baroness. Acton was silent; {{he looked a}} while at the uncastled {{landscape}} before him.

6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} you to <b>know</b> <b>about,</b> <b>my</b> dear," [...] he concluded. [...] "You {{have chosen}} very wisely {{to keep out of}} these matters. Elizabeth has such {{wonderful}} courage. My own nerve, I regret to say, is not quite what it was. Waiter, I will take a liqueur of the old brandy in a large glass." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] he said. [...] "But {{you know what}} a talker Reggie is. He's an obliging sort of chump, but his tongue's {{fastened}} on at the middle and waggles at both ends. I don't want the whole of New York to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> engagement, and have somebody spilling the news to father, before I'm ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hem!' said Mrs Nickleby. 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>about</b> that, <b>my</b> dear, but I {{think it}} is very {{necessary}} that somebody should be in his confidence; highly necessary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Well, Mr. Casey here <b>knows</b> all <b>about</b> <b>my</b> affairs; so {{you need}} have no {{hesitation}} in speaking in front of him," [...] laughed the real estate man somewhat harshly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nerves!" [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Vanstone. [...] "Thank God, I <b>know</b> nothing <b>about</b> <b>my</b> nerves. If {{you have}} got anything to tell me, shock or no shock, out with it on the spot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You want to <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> {{interview}} with mother? Well, you shall {{know all about}} that, I promise you, because I have changed my mind. I intend to make you an auditor. Don't desert me, Julien, please. Remember, {{this is really a}} trying moment for me. I have to face an irate and obstinate parent. If friendship is worth anything, come and help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was wise; and, yes, it was best," [...] said Miss Milray, and {{for relief}} from the tension which was {{beginning}} to tell upon her own nerves, she asked, [...] "I suppose you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> poor brother? I'd better tell you {{to keep you from}} asking for Mrs. Milray, though I don't know that it's so very painful with him. There isn't any Mrs. Milray now," [...] she added, and she explained why.|$|E
6000|$|We {{went down}} to the {{carriage}} to see them off, and then, finding myself for a moment by the side of one of the young ladies, I tried to find out something for myself. [...] "Pray tell me, señorita," [...] I said, [...] "what you <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> father-in-law. If it is very bad, I promise you my wife shall not hear a word of it; but it is best that I should know the truth before meeting him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She—she {{wants to}} ask you about ’er husband," [...] faltered’ Mrs. Gimpson; [...] "she’s going to bring a friend with her—a man who doesn’t believe in your knowledge.
