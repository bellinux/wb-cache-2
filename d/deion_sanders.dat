5|$|Though he was {{considered}} a top prospect, the Reds held him out of winter league baseball during the 1995–96 offseason. The Reds added <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> and Rubén Sierra to their outfield competition for the 1997 season, prompting Mottola to question the Reds commitment to him. After he spent the 1997 season in the minors, the Reds traded Mottola to the Texas Rangers for a player to be named later in April 1998. He {{spent most of the}} 1998 season with the Oklahoma City RedHawks of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), but suffered a broken thumb that required surgery, limiting his season.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after losing}} Super Bowl XLI, Hester and special teams coach Dave Toub spent a {{significant}} amount of time working on new return strategies and formations. Ultimately, Lovie Smith converted Hester into a wide receiver in order {{to increase the number of}} opportunities he would receive during a game. Hester, who originally played as a wide receiver at the University of Miami, was initially hesitant about making the switch to offense, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders.</b> However, the Bears’ coaching staff eventually persuaded Hester to make the transition over the summer. During the 2007 off-season, Hester won the Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award.|$|E

5000|$|After {{retiring}} from the NFL, Sanders worked as a pre-game commentator for CBS' The NFL Today until 2004, when contract negotiations failed. Sanders turned down a 30% salary increase demanding to be paid $2.5 million, the highest of any NFL TV analyst. He was replaced by Shannon Sharpe.

25|$|From the 1988 to the 1993 seasons, the 49ers {{played in}} {{five out of}} six NFC Championship Games, winning Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV. But after head coach George Seifert's team lost two {{consecutive}} NFC Championship games to the Dallas Cowboys in 1992 and 1993, San Francisco brought in several veteran free agents to strengthen their defense. Among the players signed were defensive linemen Richard Dent (the MVP of Super Bowl XX), Charles Mann, Rhett Hall, and Rickey Jackson; linebackers Ken Norton Jr. and Gary Plummer; and cornerback <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the first}} quarter, Smith's 65-yard run set up an Eddie Murray field goal. It was the main {{highlight}} of the day for Smith, who gained only 30 yards on 14 carries {{for the rest of}} the game. Minnesota was forced to punt on their next drive, but returner <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> muffed the kick and Dwayne Rudd recovered the ball for the Vikings at the Cowboys 30-yard line. Four plays later, Gary Anderson kicked a 47-yard field goal to tie the game. Aikman led the Cowboys back, completing two passes to Ismail for gains of 45 and 25 yards before Smith finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run.|$|E
25|$|Tim McCarver ran {{afoul of}} Atlanta Braves outfielder <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> during the 1992 postseason, {{when he made}} {{comments}} on-air criticizing Sanders for his two-sport athletic career; Sanders was playing for both the Braves and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons {{at the time and}} participated in both the baseball postseason and the early NFL regular season {{for the first time in}} 1992 (Sanders was unable to do this in 1991, as his NFL contract with the Falcons would not allow him to). Sanders retaliated following Game 7 of the NLCS by dumping a bucket of ice water on McCarver (who was wired for sound and feared electrocution).|$|E
25|$|The Saints scored {{first on}} a 78-yard drive {{in which they}} started with a punt after three plays, but kept the ball due to a {{roughing}} the punter penalty against Atlanta lineman Tracy Johnson. Quarterback Bobby Hebert completed five passes on the drive, the last a 26-yard touchdown to wide receiver Floyd Turner. On the Saints next drive, they moved the ball {{all the way to}} the Falcons 3-yard line. But tight end John Tice dropped a catchable pass and then defensive back <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> intercepted Hebert's pass in the end zone to avoid a facing a fourteen-point deficit. In the second quarter Morten Andersen's 45-yard field goal gave the Saints a 10-0 lead.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} {{on television in}} the United States by CBS, with Greg Gumbel handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator Phil Simms in the broadcast booth. Armen Keteyian and Bonnie Bernstein roamed the sidelines. Jim Nantz hosted all the events with help from his fellow cast members from The NFL Today: Dan Marino, <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders,</b> and Boomer Esiason. This would be the final Super Bowl game Greg Gumbel would call; as before the 2004 season began, he and Nantz would switch roles; though by the time CBS next aired a Super Bowl; James Brown was brought in as host of The NFL Today while Gumbel had moved to a secondary play-by-play role.|$|E
25|$|Defensive {{coordinator}} Dave Campo {{was promoted}} to head coach for the 2000 season. Prior to the season starting cornerback <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> was released after 5 seasons with the team. He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41–14 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman {{for the rest of}} the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5–11 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000 yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{responded with}} a 78-yard drive, {{including}} a 25-yard run by Smith and a 16-yard run by <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders,</b> to score on Boniol's 21-yard field goal, cutting the Cowboys deficit to 23-17. Then the Cowboys forced a punt, getting the ball back with over 11 minutes still remaining on the clock, but Rohn Stark's kick was downed by Johnson on the Dallas 2-yard line. Then upon reaching their 37, Aikman threw a pass that was intercepted by Pat Terrell and returned 49 yards to the Cowboys 19-yard line, setting up Kasay's fourth field goal to make the score 26-17. The next time Dallas got the ball, Aikman was intercepted again, this time by Sam Mills, enabling Carolina to run out the clock and win the game.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{his career}} in music, Mos Def entered public life as a child actor, having played roles in {{television}} movies, sitcoms and theater, {{some of which were}} under the name Dante Beze. At the age of 14, he appeared in the TV movie God Bless the Child, starring Mare Winningham, which aired on ABC in 1988. He played the oldest child in the 1990 family sitcom You Take the Kids shortly before it was cancelled. In 1995 he played the character Dante, Bill Cosby's sidekick on the short-lived detective show, The Cosby Mysteries. In 1996 he also starred in a Visa check card commercial featuring <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders.</b> In 1997 he had a small role alongside Michael Jackson in his short film and music video Ghosts (1997).|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of 1995 season Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> away from San Francisco. Dallas started the season 4–0 {{including}} shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35–0 at Giants Stadium to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12–4 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30–11 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38–27. In Super Bowl XXX the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 at Sun Devil Stadium for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In the NFC Championship Game, Cutler {{completed}} 6-of-14passes for 80yards and an interception, {{before a}} knee injury sidelined him early {{in the third quarter}} of a 21–14 loss to Green Bay. The Bears did not make an immediate announcement about Cutler's condition, allowing speculation to grow. In possibly the NFL’s first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized seconds after the injury by Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett, <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders,</b> and Mark Schlereth. Bears coach Lovie Smith later clarified that he, and not Cutler, made the decision after consulting the medical and training staff. The following day, an MRI revealed Cutler had sprained his MCL. Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman commented that the widespread reaction reflected hostility towards Cutler's career-long polarizing attitude. Bears teammates defended Cutler, and his critics themselves became the targets of insults from other players, including Packers Aaron Rodgers ("disrespectful"), LeRoy Butler ("stupid"), and B. J. Raji ("pretty wrong and a lot times it has a lot to do with jealousy").|$|E
25|$|Dallas scored {{first on}} a 14-play, 88-yard drive in which Troy Aikman {{completed}} four passes to Michael Irvin for 65 yards {{and finished the}} drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Perhaps the key point of the game occurred on the next series when Minnesota running back Amp Lee caught a short pass from quarterback Brad Johnson {{and appeared to be}} on his way for a 43-yard touchdown. But Cowboys safety George Teague caught up with Lee at the 1-yard line and poked the ball out of his hands, knocking it out of the end zone for a touchback. Dallas then drove 70 yards, including a 22-yard carry by Herschel Walker, to go up 10-0 on Chris Boniol's 28-yard field goal. Five plays after the ensuing kickoff, Teague stripped the ball from Vikings running back Leroy Hoard. Defensive back <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> recovered the fumble and lateraled it to Shante Carver, who was tackled on the Minnesota 37, and Emmitt Smith took off for a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then during Minnesota's next possession, Teague intercepted a pass from Johnson and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 24-0 lead with 8:36 left in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|Turning down other notable offers, Biletnikoff {{chose to}} attend Florida State University in Tallahassee. He missed several games {{during his first}} varsity season in 1962 with a broken foot. He played {{on both sides of}} the ball his junior season, leading the team in receptions and interceptions. That year, he {{returned}} an interception 99 yards for a touchdown off a pass thrown by George Mira of the Miami Hurricanes, a record which stood until 1987, when <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> broke it by one yard. As a senior in 1964, Biletnikoff led the nation with 1,179 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns, and finished second in receptions (70) and scoring (90). One of his touchdowns came in the first quarter against the Florida Gators, which helped the Seminoles earn their first victory in the in-state rivalry, 16–7. The Seminoles finished the year with a 36–19 victory over Oklahoma in the Gator Bowl, in which Biletnikoff set school records with 13 receptions for 194 yards and four touchdowns. He was a consensus pick for the 1964 College Football All-America Team, receiving first-team honors from four official selectors: the Associated Press, Central Press Association, Football Writers Association of America, and Newspaper Enterprise Association. He was Florida State's first consensus All-American in football. Biletnikoff compiled 100 receptions for 1,655 yards and 20 touchdowns in his career with the Seminoles, which at the time were all school records.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Walker muffed the opening kickoff and Dallas cornerback Dave Thomas {{recovered}} {{it on the}} 49ers 25. Aided by a personal foul penalty against linebacker Rickey Jackson, Dallas drove 25 yards in seven plays to score on Smith's 1-yard touchdown run. However, the 49ers stormed right back with a 10-play, 70-yard drive that ended with Young's 3-yard rushing touchdown. Then 49ers defensive back <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> ended the Cowboys next drive with an interception. San Francisco ended up punting, but Klaus Wilmsmeyer's kick pinned Dallas back at their 11. In the final quarter, Dallas finished an 89-yard, 14-play drive with Aikman's 10-yard touchdown pass to Irvin, cutting the score to 38-28, {{but they could not}} score again. Smith, who compiled 74 yards and two touchdowns, departed during that drive with an injured hamstring, which he had already injured before this game, it got enough wear and tear to the point he couldn't play anymore. The Cowboys had two more drives, both of which resulted in turnovers on downs. At one point, Dallas coach Barry Switzer, furious that Sanders was not called for pass interference, stormed onto the field and bumped an official while arguing, which resulted in a 15-yard penalty against the Cowboys, and Aikman was sacked by defensive end Tim Harris on fourth down on the next play. Although Aikman broke an NFC Championship Game record with 380 yards passing, and Irvin also broke an NFC Championship Game record with 192 receiving yards, ultimately the first-quarter turnovers were too much to overcome.|$|E
500|$|Kansas' Aqib Talib {{was named}} the game's Most Valuable Player. Talib's 60-yard {{interception}} return for a touchdown was the Orange Bowl's first since the 1968 Orange Bowl, when Oklahoma's Bob Stephenson performed the same feat. When he appeared on stage on the field after the game to receive his award, Talib exclaimed, [...] "I felt like Deion!", a reference to former NFL star <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hester {{attributes}} {{his talent}} to his mentor, <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders,</b> who Hester claims helped him perfect his return game. Sanders, a former cornerback and kick returner, compliments Hester after every productive performance. However, Sanders also berated Hester for taunting another player {{en route to}} his second touchdown return against the St. Louis Rams. His teammates and coaches have also praised Hester. After the 2006 season, he was voted to receive the team's Brian Piccolo Award, which is given to a player who possesses a good character and work ethic.

Sanders counseled, advised, and encouraged Hester. Hester was also known as [...] "Anytime" [...] in college, which {{is a tribute to}} Sanders' nickname, [...] "Prime Time". He also adopted Sanders' signature touchdown dance, and showboating maneuvers, which he carried to his future NFL career.|$|E
500|$|Hester {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with the Atlanta Falcons on March 20, 2014. In his debut game with the Falcons, Hester caught five passes for 99 yards, helping lead the Falcons to a 37-34 Week 1 overtime victory over the New Orleans Saints. During Week 3, Hester brought back a 62-yard punt for his 20th career touchdown return, breaking the record for career non-offensive touchdowns he previously shared with <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders.</b> Also in the same game, Hester recorded a rushing touchdown, forced fumble and fumble recovery. Hester was named the NFC's Special Teams Player of the Week for his accomplishments. Hester concluded the season with 504 receiving yards from 38 receptions and led the NFL with 1,128 kick-off return yards. He was also selected {{to play in the}} 2015 Pro Bowl.|$|E
500|$|He {{was part}} of the nation's number one {{recruiting}} class for the undefeated defending national champion Wolverines. The team recruited numerous top 50-rated players on both offense: Justin Fargas, Marquise Walker, David Terrell and Drew Henson, and defense: Victor Hobson, Dave Armstrong, June, Bennie Joppru, and Larry Foote. The All-Met Offensive Player of the Year, Walter Cross, was also a member of this recruiting class. [...] The class included a total of six Parade All-Americans: Fargas, Henson, Walker, Terrell, June and Hayden Epstein. Before matriculating to Michigan he participated in the July 1998 D.C. Coaches Association All-Star game as well as the Baltimore-Washington Beltway Classic. [...] As a high schooler with aspirations of making a mark in the NFL and who kept a <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> poster in his bedroom, he left his mark by writing [...] "Big Time 1" [...] on things whenever the opportunity arose. [...] June graduated as salutatorian.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of his NFL career he ran back a total of 4kickoffs for touchdowns. [...] This ranked him tenth (2 short of the record six) in NFL history through the 2006 NFL season. [...] He had been in a {{three-way}} tie for eight upon his retirement before the 1995 NFL season. [...] His kickoff return touchdowns for three different teams tied Ron Smith for the NFL record, which was broken during the 2007 NFL season by Allen Rossum who posted a touchdown return for his fourth different team. [...] In 1991, Vaughn averaged 21.1yards per return on 34returns, which ranked 10th among those with 1.2returns per game. [...] In 1992, Vaughn posted a 28.2averaged on 20 returns to lead the National Football League (<b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> was second at 26.7).

2500|$|The {{format for}} the game was {{considerably}} altered {{in an effort to}} improve competitiveness. The biggest changes included an [...] "unconferenced" [...] format in which players would be selected regardless of the conference in which their team competes, a draft format to select the teams and various tweaks to increase the excitement of the game itself. <b>Deion</b> <b>Sanders</b> and Jerry Rice served as the non-playing captains for the two competing squads.|$|E
