500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water <b>is</b> <b>pouring.</b> Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} March 2011 {{the voices}} in the US calling for the end to the F-35 program were {{increasing}} in volume. Dominic Tierney of The Atlantic pointed out the whole program cost is now forecast to exceed US$1T, more than the annual GDP of Australia. He noted, [...] "Money <b>is</b> <b>pouring</b> into the F-35 vortex.... An internal Pentagon report concluded that: [...] "affordability is no longer embraced as a core pillar." [...] In January 2011, even Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a champion of the aircraft, voiced his frustration: [...] "The culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of restraint"." [...] Tierney further noted that the F-35 is an old Cold Warâ€“concept aircraft intended for a war between major powers, and is no longer useful in the 21st century with its asymmetric warfare. He concluded: [...] "It's hard to square the military largesse with our rampant debt." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gajalakshmi {{panel is}} on the rear wall which {{represents}} Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. The religious significance of Gajalakshmi is well brought out in the panel. She is shown with her hand holding lotus flowers, fawned by four attendants, and carved in [...] "perfect beauty and gracious countenance". Two royal elephants are filling the water vessels held by the attendants and one elephant <b>is</b> <b>pouring</b> water from the vessel on Lakshmi {{and the other is}} about to take the vessel from the maiden's hand to pour water over Lakshmi. The Durga panel, also on the rear wall, is indicative of victory over ignorance. The Trivikrama panel depicts Vishnu as the Lord of the three worlds. Another strikingly impressive panel is of Durga slaying the demon Mahishasura who is in an anthropomorphic form of a human with a buffalo head; the scene is reminiscent of a battle between good and evil forces, with the side of Durga represented by the confident looking ganas advancing and the other side of Mahishasura with his army of asuras (demons) retreating. This scene is a new architectural depiction which is appreciated as to [...] "enhance the drama and realism of the subject." [...] The Brahma panel is carved with Brahma having three heads in sambhaga or standing posture.|$|E
