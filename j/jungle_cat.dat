5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat.</b> The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat. When it encounters a threat, the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> will vocalise before engaging in attack, producing sounds like small roars – a behavior uncommon for {{the other members of}} Felis. The meow of the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> is also somewhat lower than that of a typical domestic cat. The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> is {{a habitat}} generalist; it inhabits places with {{adequate}} water and dense vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands and riparian areas. Despite its name, the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> shuns rainforests and woodlands. The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List and is mainly threatened by destruction of wetlands, trapping and poisoning. The status of the cat in the wild needs further study, though populations {{are thought to be}} declining.|$|E
5|$|In Indochina, the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> occurs {{mainly in}} {{deciduous}} forests rich in dipterocarp trees.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{southeast}} Asian <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> {{still used}} to be the most common wild cats near villages in certain parts of northern Thailand and occurred in many protected areas of the country. However, since the early 1990s, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> are rarely encountered and have suffered drastic declines due to hunting and habitat destruction. Today, their official status in the country is critically endangered. In Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> have been subject to extensive hunting. Skins are occasionally recorded in border markets, and live individuals, possibly taken from Myanmar or Cambodia, occasionally turn up in the Khao Khieo and Chiang Mai zoos of Thailand.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of deer at the sanctuary, {{including}} the Chousingha (four-horned antelope) and spotted deer. Caracals, wild boars, pangolins, Indian leopards, striped hyenas, golden jackals, foxes, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> porcupines, wild bears, and neelgai are other animals found here. In the wild life census conducted on 17 May 2011, the number of wild animals in the sanctuary was 1711, including 10 leopards, 538 jackals, 38 hyenas, 39 foxes, 117 <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Fauna: Elephants, tigers, panthers, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, bisons, deer, bears, {{monitor lizards}} {{and a variety}} of snakes are seen.|$|R
5|$|The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major threats to the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and urbanisation. Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> living along the Caspian Sea and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis chaus), {{also called}} the reed cat or swamp cat, is a {{medium-sized}} cat native to the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia and southern China. It {{is a member of}} the genus Felis and was first described by Johann Anton Güldenstädt in 1776. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber gave the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> its present binomial name and is therefore generally considered as binomial authority. Ten subspecies are recognised at present.|$|E
25|$|Piglets are {{vulnerable}} to attack from medium-sized felids like lynx, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> and snow leopards and other carnivorans like brown bears and yellow-throated martens.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Jungle</b> <b>Cats</b> exhibit {{features}} rare Sumatran tigers in thickly planted, side-by-side exhibits. Both yards {{have water}} features. 3 Sumatran tigers cubs {{were born in}} May 2014.|$|R
50|$|There are panther, Bear, Hyena, Wolf, Nilgai and Chinkara in {{the hills}} around Jawai dam. Sometimes one can see Jackals and <b>Jungle</b> <b>cats</b> {{drinking}} water at the dam.|$|R
5|$|The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> is {{a member}} of the genus Felis, which {{consists}} of small cats, within the family Felidae.|$|E
5|$|Mammal species {{consist of}} hog deer (C. porcinus), wild boar (Sus scrota), large Indian civets (Viverra civetta, Viverricula indica), common otter (Lutra lutra), fox, <b>jungle</b> <b>cat,</b> Asian golden cat, bay bamboo rat, musk shrew, common shrew, flying fox, and sambar (Cervus unicolor).|$|E
5|$|The British {{zoologist}} Reginald Innes Pocock {{reviewed the}} nomenclature of felids in 1917 and classified the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> group {{as part of}} the genus Felis. In the 1930s, Pocock reviewed the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> skins and skulls from British India and adjacent countries. Based mainly on differences in fur length and colour he subordinated the specimens from Turkestan to Balochistan to Felis chaus chaus, the Himalayan ones to F. c. affinis, the ones from Cutch to Bengal under F. c. kutas, and the tawnier ones from Burma under F. c. fulvidina. He newly described six larger skins from Sind as F. c. prateri, and skins with shorter coats from Sri Lanka and southern India as F. c. kelaarti.|$|E
5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, it is concluded that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|R
50|$|Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary is {{situated}} in South 24 Parganas district, West Bengal, India. The wildlife in this sanctuary includes estuarine crocodiles, olive ridley sea turtles, spotted deer, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> and rhesus macaques.|$|R
50|$|Bison, sambar, barking deer, Nilgiri langur, Nilgiri tahr and <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> are sighted here. The {{place is}} also known for its 165 species of butterflies, 15 types of dabchicks, wood pigeon and the Nilgiri pipit.|$|R
5|$|The <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> {{is listed}} under CITES Appendix II. Hunting is {{prohibited}} in Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkey. But {{it does not}} receive legal protection outside protected areas in Bhutan, Georgia, Laos, Lebanon, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Leopards {{are found}} in hilly areas but may also venture into the low land jungles. Small cats in the park include the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat,</b> fishing cat and leopard cat. Other mammals include barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongoose, otters, yellow-throated martens, Himalayan goral, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus macaques. Owls and nightjars can be heard during the night.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, British naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson {{proclaimed the}} red-eared cat {{commonly}} found in Nepal to be a lynx and therefore named it Lynchus erythrotus; Ceylonese naturalist Edward Frederick Kelaart described the first <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> skin from Sri Lanka in 1852 and stressed upon its close resemblance to Hodgson's red cat. William Thomas Blanford pointed out the lynx-like appearance of cat skins and skulls from the plains around Yarkant County and Kashgar when he described Felis shawiana in 1876.|$|E
50|$|This zoo {{has plans}} to house lions, hyenas, foxes, barking deer, nilgais, lesser <b>cats,</b> <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> rusty spotted cats, mouse deer and Indian giant {{squirrels}} (shekru). An ex-situ breeding centre is planned by the zoo.|$|R
50|$|The gueltas near Iherir are {{flanked by}} Cape bulrush (Typha capensis), with oleanders (Nerium oleander) and French Tamarisks (Tamarix gallica) {{abundant}} {{along the river}} bed. Notable animals include <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> (Felis chaus) and sand cats (Felis margarita).|$|R
50|$|Panthers, hyenas, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> foxes, {{bears and}} other {{carnivorous}} mammalian fauna are found here. Deer, spotted deer sambar, blackbuck and other herbivorous animals {{are found in}} the inland forests. The district has a large number of Murrah buffaloes and cows.|$|R
5|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> is largely oriental; {{it occurs in}} the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, central and southeastern Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China. It {{is the most common}} small wild cat in India. Thought to be absent from south of the Isthmus of Kra in the Malayan peninsula, the possibility of its occurrence was reported from a highly fragmented forest in the Malaysian state of Selangor in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The felids are {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} family of mammals that {{share a common}} ancestor only 10–15million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus) {{are part of the}} genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid waterless deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, <b>jungle</b> <b>cat,</b> forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
50|$|The fauna {{population}} of the park mainly includes blackbucks, wolves, Macqueen's bustards, hyenas and lesser floricans, with foxes, jackals and <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> as the main carnivores. Other species include wild pigs, hares and rodents typical of the savannah type grasslands and thorn scrubs.|$|R
5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of <b>jungle</b> <b>cats</b> have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting that they may have been used to help control rodent populations.|$|R
50|$|As {{the prey}} {{concentration}} is high along the Pench River, tigers usually inhabit this belt. Leopards, though, generally {{operate in the}} peripheral areas but are occasionally seen in deep forests also. <b>Jungle</b> <b>cats</b> are commonly seen. Leopard cats, small Indian civet and palm civet are common but seen very rarely.|$|R
5|$|Typically diurnal, the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
5|$|In the past, jackals {{competed with}} tigers and leopards, feeding on {{the remains of}} their kills and, in one case, on a dead tiger. Leopards once hunted jackals, but today the tiger is extinct in the jackal's range, and the leopard is rare. The jackal's {{competitors}} are the red fox, wolf, <b>jungle</b> <b>cat,</b> forest wildcat, and raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. Wolves dominate jackals, and jackals dominate foxes. In Europe, the range of wolves and jackals is mutually exclusive, with jackals abandoning their territory {{with the arrival of}} a wolf pack. One experiment used loudspeakers to broadcast the calls of jackals, and this attracted wolves at a trotting pace to chase away the perceived competitors. Dogs responded to these calls in the same way while barking aggressively. Unleashed dogs have been observed to immediately chase away jackals when the jackals were detected. The jackal's recent expansion throughout eastern and western Europe has been attributed to the extermination of the local wolf populations. The present diffusion of the jackal into the northern Adriatic hinterland is in areas where the wolf is absent or very rare.|$|E
25|$|Competitors of the wildcat {{include the}} <b>jungle</b> <b>cat,</b> golden jackal, red fox, marten, and other predators. Although the wildcat and the <b>jungle</b> <b>cat</b> occupy the same {{ecological}} niche, the two rarely encounter one another, {{on account of}} different habitat preferences: jungle cats mainly reside in lowland areas, while wildcats prefer higher elevations in beech forests.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{keystone}} species, the Bengal tiger, Tadoba Tiger Reserve {{is home to}} other mammals, including: Indian leopards, sloth bears, gaur, nilgai, dhole, striped hyena, small Indian civet, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> sambar, spotted deer, barking deer, chital, chausingha and honey badger. Tadoba lake sustains the marsh crocodile, which were once common all over Maharashtra.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{is home to}} {{numerous}} wildlife species, including a small population of wild Asian elephants. Other inhabitants include thamin, wild pig, gaur, sambar, banteng, muntjac, clouded leopard, civets, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> Himalayan brown bear, sun bear, Oriental giant squirrel, Indian giant squirrel, hog badger, monitor lizards, macaques, barking deer and many types of birds.|$|R
25|$|Dudhwa National Park: It covers {{an area of}} 500km2 {{along the}} Indo-Nepal border in Lakhimpur Kheri {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh, {{is best known for}} the barasingha or swamp deer. The grasslands and woodlands of this park, consist mainly of sal forests. The barasingha is found in the southwest and southeast regions of the park. Among the big cats, tigers abound at Dudhwa. There are also a few leopards. The other animals found in large numbers, are the Indian rhinoceros, elephant, <b>jungle</b> <b>cats,</b> leopard cats, fishing cats, jackals, civets, sloth bears, sambar, otters, crocodiles and chital.|$|R
