5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick <b>finally</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{he would}} end up facing his enemy, instead of {{approaching}} from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E

25|$|When Marmont and Mortier {{arrived at}} La Ferté-Gaucher, they found Prince Wilhelm of Prussia's brigade {{blocking}} them. Prince Wilhelm was gradually reinforced by elements of Kleist's corps and the Prussian artillery soon dominated the numerically weaker French guns. After unsuccessfully {{trying to push}} the Prussians {{out of the way}} and learning that Pahlen's cavalry corps was approaching from the east, the French marshals decided they could only escape the trap by marching south to Provins. Far to the east, Napoleon scored a pointless victory over Wintzingerode in the Battle of Saint-Dizier on 26 March. The next day, the French emperor <b>finally</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the Allies had called his bluff and were advancing on Paris. He ordered his troops to march toward the capital, but it was too late.|$|E
25|$|Still, he {{knew that}} his mother was still alive and refused to attend the funeral at Corinth. To ease the tension, the {{messenger}} then said that Oedipus was, in fact, adopted. Jocasta, finally realizing that he was her son, begged him to stop his search for Laius' murderer. Oedipus misunderstood her motivation, thinking that she was ashamed of him because he might have been born of low birth. Jocasta in great distress went into the palace where she hanged herself. Oedipus sought verification of the messenger's story from the very same herdsman who was supposed to have left Oedipus to die as a baby. From the herdsman, Oedipus learned that the infant raised as the adopted son of Polybus and Merope was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Thus, Oedipus <b>finally</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the man he had killed so many years before, at the place where the three roads met, was his own father, King Laius, and that he had married his mother, Jocasta.|$|E
25|$|After marching {{his army}} into Chattanooga, Major General Rosecrans {{continued}} to advance his force through southeastern Tennessee and into northern Georgia but his troops were widely dispersed. Rosecrans {{did not expect}} General Bragg to attack his force {{and did not know}} that Bragg had received 20,000 additional men and had two more divisions from Virginia due to arrive soon. Bragg planned to attack the scattered Union Army units and to retake Chattanooga after defeating them. On September 12, 1863, Rosecrans <b>finally</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> Bragg was not continuing to retreat and apparently intended to fight. The regulars had been detached from their division, now commanded by Brigadier General Absalom Baird, and were still trying to catch up on this date. Thomas and McCook had to bring their corps north toward Chattanooga in order to concentrate the scattered Union Army in one location. As the Union divisions moved along Chickamauga Creek, Rosecrans had Brigadier General Thomas Leonidas Crittenden's division move south to Lee & Gordon's Mill, along the Chickamauga, to support the movements of Thomas and McCook. On September 18, 1863, Bragg's Confederate force secured two bridges over the Chickamauga and prepared to attack Crittenden's position the next day. The same night, Rosecrans ordered Thomas to bring three divisions, including Baird's, north to Crittenden's position. The regulars arrived on the field about 6 miles from Chattanooga at sunrise on September 19, 1863.|$|E

Wrede {{was ordered to}} cross to the north bank of the Aube at Chaudrey, {{to the east of}} Arcis.

[...] "The lapel," [...] the actor said, annoyed by such stupidity. [...] "You know, when the guy flashes his lapel, you see his badge, you know he's a detective."

2500|$|Smith {{spent the}} next two days {{repairing}} his vessels and landing a broadside 8-inch (210mm) gun taken from Baron De Kalb. He and Ross decided to make a determined assault on Monday, March 16. The ironclads would be pushed closer to Fort Pemberton than before in order to be better able to silence its guns. They would advance {{side by side with the}} mortar boat lashed between them. Infantry would follow in tinclads behind them, ready to go ashore as soon as the guns in the fort were knocked out and a suitable landing place could be found. The planned attack collapsed almost immediately when a series of shot or shell hit Chillicothe's casemate. [...] The impact buckled the armor plates in such a manner that the gun port stoppers could not be raised. Chillicothe was forced to retire, and Smith decided to pull the relatively undamaged Baron De Kalb out of action also. That was essentially the end of the Union effort.
