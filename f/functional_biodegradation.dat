40|$|A nucleic acid-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} investigate the dynamics of a microbial community dominated by Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ 10 in the degradation of synthetic wastewater containing 1, 2 -dichloroethane (DCE). This study was performed over a 140 -day period in a nonsterile continuous stirred-tank bioreactor (CSTB) subjected to different operational regimens: nutrient-limiting conditions, baseline operation, {{and the introduction of}} glucose as a cosubstrate. The microbial community was analyzed by a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Under nutrient-limiting conditions, DCE degradation was restricted, but this did not affect the dominance of strain GJ 10, determined by FISH to comprise 85 % of the active population. During baseline operation, DCE degradation improved significantly to over 99. 5 % and then remained constant throughout the subsequent experimental period. DGGE profiles revealed a stable, complex community, while FISH indicated that strain GJ 10 remained the dominant species. During the addition of glucose as a cosubstrate, DGGE profiles showed a proliferation of other species in the CSTB. The percentage of strain GJ 10 dropped to 8 % of the active population in just 5 days, although this did not affect the DCE biodegradation performance. The return to baseline conditions was accompanied by the reestablishment of strain GJ 10 as the dominant species, suggesting that this system responds robustly to external perturbations, both at the <b>functional</b> <b>biodegradation</b> level and at the individual strain level...|$|E
40|$|Natural polysaccharides such as alginates, pectins, and chitins, {{possess a}} wide {{versatility}} {{in addition to}} the variability of the typical structural features of polysaccharides, as they include amino-, amido-, carboxylic acid, and esters groups. Objective: These functional groups can be exploited to graft specific moieties and macromolecules, thus tailoring the specific characteristics when envisioning improved functionality, such as targeted-drug delivery, antimicrobial, and thermo- or pH-responsiveness. Ad hoc covalent modifications of the polysaccharidic backbone can promote the loading and interactions {{with a wide variety of}} both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances, as well as enhanced cell adhesion able to promote regeneration events. Additionally, enzymatic modifications have been conducted to have precise control of both <b>functional</b> groups and <b>biodegradation.</b> Conclusion: This review intends to give an overview over chemical and enzymatic reactions to modify the backbone of polysaccharides aiming to exploit organic chemistry tools applied to meet the diverse needs of biomedicine...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2012. Major:Civil Engineering. Advisors:Paige J. Novak, Raymond M. Hozalski. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 258 pages. This dissertation describes {{the investigation of}} the fate of hydrocarbons in stormwater bioretention areas and those mechanisms that affect hydrocarbon fate in such systems. Seventy-five samples from 58 bioretention areas were collected and analyzed to measure total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) residual and <b>biodegradation</b> <b>functional</b> genes. TPH residual in bioretention areas was greater than background sites but low overall (< 3 µg/kg), and well below either the TPH concentration of concern or the expected concentration, assuming no losses. Bioretention areas with deep-root vegetation contained significantly greater quantites of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes and two functional genes involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation. Field soils were capable of mineralizing naphthalene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) when incubated in the laboratory. In an additional laboratory investigation, a column study was initiated to comprehensively determine naphthalene fate in a simulated bioretention cell using a 14 C-labeled tracer. Sorption to soil was the greatest sink of naphthalene in the columns, although biodegradation and vegetative uptake were also important loss mechanisms. Little leaching occurred following the first flush, and volatilization was insignificant. Significant enrichment of naphthalene degrading bacteria occurred {{over the course of the}} experiment as a result of naphthalene exposure. This was evident from enhanced naphthalene biodegradation kinetics (measured via batch tests), significant increases in naphthalene dioxygenase gene quantities, and a significant correlation observed between naphthalene residual and <b>biodegradation</b> <b>functional</b> genes. Vegetated columns outperformed the unplanted control column in terms of total naphthalene removal and biodegradation kinetics. As a result of these experiments, a final study focused on why planted systems outperform unplanted systems was conducted. Plant root exudates were harvested from hydroponic setups for three types of plants. Additionally, a solution of artificial root exudates (AREs) as prepared. Exudates were digested using soil bacteria to create metabolized exudates. Raw and metabolized exudates were characterized for dissolved organic carbon, specific UV absorbance, spectral slope, florescence index, excitation-emission matrices, and surface tension. Significant differences on character were observed between the harvested exudates and the AREs, as well as between the raw and metabolized exudates. Naphthalene desorption from an aged soil was enhanced in the presence of raw exudates. The surface tension in samples containing raw harvested exudates was reduced compared to samples containing the metabolized exudates. Plant root exudates may therefore facilitate phytoremediation by enhancing contaminant desorption and improving bioavailability. Overall, this resarch concludes that heavily planted bioretention systems are a sustainable solution to mitigating stormwater hydrocarbon pollution as a result of likely enhanced contaminant desorption, and improved biodegradation and plant uptake in such systems...|$|R
40|$|On October 30, 1996, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{commenced}} {{the first}} test release of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) for use in bioremediation. The specific objectives of the investigation were multifaceted and include (1) testing the hypothesis that a GEM can be successfully introduced and maintained in a bioremediation process, (2) testing the concept of using, at the field scale, reporter organisms for direct bioremediation process monitoring and control, and (3) acquiring data {{that can be used}} in risk assessment decision making and protocol development for future field release applications of GEMs. The genetically engineered strain under investigation is Pseudomonas fluorescens strain HK 44 (King et al., 1990). The original P. fluorescens parent strain was isolated from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated manufactured gas plant soil. Thus, this bacterium is able to biodegrade naphthalene (as well as other substituted naphthalenes and other PAHs) and is able to function as a living bioluminescent reporter for the presence of naphthalene contamination, its bioavailability, and the <b>functional</b> process of <b>biodegradation.</b> A unique component of this field investigation was the availability of an array of large subsurface soil lysimeters. This article describes the experience associated with the release of a genetically modified microorganism, the lysimeter facility and its associated instrumentation, as well as representative data collected during the first eighteen months of operation...|$|R
