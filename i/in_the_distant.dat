5|$|Although the Earth is {{the only}} body within the solar system known to support life, {{evidence}} suggests that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface. For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Han–Xiongnu War on the north, {{the rising}} cost of {{administration}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> state led to the Han abandoning the commandery. A group of Chinese explorers were captured by the Dian for four years. They were part of an expedition traveling southwards to establish an alternative trade route for the goods reported in Central Asian markets in 122 BCE.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jasper {{visits the}} Kwik-E-Mart and {{attempts}} to empty the freezer containing ice cream in order to freeze himself, {{with the intention of}} being defrosted sometime <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future. Apu decides {{to take advantage of this}} unusual situation for financial gain. The convenience store becomes more profitable as a tourist trap, until the freezer's cooling system fails, causing Jasper to defrost and walk away.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Charles obliged the Kőszegis {{to renounce}} their last fortresses {{along the western}} borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340. He divided the large Zólyom County (now in Slovakia), which had been {{dominated}} by a powerful local lord, Donch, into three smaller counties in 1340. The following year, Charles also forced Donch to renounce his two fortresses in Zólyom in exchange for one castle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> Kraszna County (in present-day Romania). Around the same time, Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia, invaded Sirmium and captured Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy Returning Home was {{a concert}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Distant</b> Worlds series {{conducted}} by Arnie Roth featuring music composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu from the Final Fantasy series. The concert {{was performed on}} November 6 and 7, 2010 in Tokyo, Japan, by the Kanagawa Philharmonic Orchestra with guest performances from vocalists Frances Maya and Susan Calloway, among others. The concert premiered several arrangements from Final Fantasy XIII and XIV, which were then added to the general rotation. The entire 2010 Japan concert was recorded live for a DVD and 2-CD set which was later released on January 19, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Popotan {{follows a}} semi-predetermined plot; major events remain the same, but {{personal}} storylines can diverge from the player's choices. The game focuses on protagonist Chris, a drifter who meets three girls and their maid in a mansion near {{the ruins of}} Tokyo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future. The player's {{goal is to make}} available sexual scenes and images that the player can view or replay at any time depicting the protagonist having sexual intercourse with one of the girls. The player can pursue other girls once they have finished one of the sisters' storylines.|$|E

50|$|Another use {{refers to}} a process by which one {{attempts}} to test a theory whose predictions are too long-term to be tested by waiting for a future event to occur. Instead, one speculates about uncertain events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more <b>distant</b> past, and applies the theory to consider how it would have predicted a known event <b>in</b> <b>the</b> less <b>distant</b> past. This is useful <b>in,</b> for example, <b>the</b> fields of archaeology, climatology, evolutionary biology, financial analysis, forensic science, and cosmology.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future, deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored by adults while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds the room to be a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who seems to know him.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future, {{thousands}} of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower {{in the middle of}} a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his new companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) arrive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future aboard the Starship UK, a ship constructed {{to transport the}} population and major cultural artefacts of the United Kingdom (except Scotland) away from Earth to escape {{the death of the}} sun. However, they discover that the government of the ship secretly tortures a Star Whale that guides the ship, the abandonment of which is believed will destroy the ship and kill everyone on board.|$|E

The main location of the game is a European-style mansion, seen as completely out-of-place in the city. Much of the daytime is spent outside the mansion wandering around town meeting characters and triggering event sequences.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been {{attempting}} to make a feature-length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was genuine and had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas. Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future where Homo sapienoids - a race of cyborgs— had taken over the solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... Red Dwarf.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' {{offensive}} woes seemed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> past as {{the lineup}} {{broke out in}} a big way during Game 4. Led by Ryan Howard's 3-for-4, 2 home run performance, and home runs by Jayson Werth and starting pitcher Joe Blanton, the Phillies pushed 10 runs across the plate. Blanton became the first World Series pitcher to hit a home run in 34 years, in addition to a strong performance on the mound, pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs on four hits. Roster addition Eric Hinske hit a home run for the Rays, as did left fielder Carl Crawford, his second of the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him out of focus so they could notify the network that the man out of focus was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> Valley of Mexico. The Naranjo ceramic tradition is particularly characteristic of the western Pacific coast of Guatemala between the Suchiate and Nahualate rivers. The most common forms are pitchers and bowls with a surface that has been smoothed with a cloth, leaving parallel marks, and usually coated with a white or yellow wash. At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments {{in the second half of}} the Early Classic. The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which {{was released on}} the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 11, 1995 in Japan and on August 22, 1995 in North America. The game's story follows {{a group of young}} adventurers led by Crono, who are accidentally transported through time and learn that the world will be destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>distant</b> future. Vowing to prevent this disaster, they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet. Chrono Trigger was ported to the PlayStation in 1999 as a standalone title in Japan and in 2001 as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation in North America. A third version was released for the Nintendo DS handheld platform on November 20, 2008. It is regarded today {{as one of the greatest}} games ever made.|$|E
