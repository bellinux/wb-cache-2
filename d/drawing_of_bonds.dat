History has all but forgotten the strange fact that a civil society could force imperial governments to negotiate and conclude agreements and treaties that amounted to their capitulation in more than one occasion, by only having the informal community organizational resources to seek support from. But those resources, when used skillfully <b>drawing</b> upon <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> trust, webs of local and global knowledge, communication and financial systems that were too advanced for their times, and cultural assets within the community, were enough to overcome any sanctions, political and military campaigns, even outright piracies carried out by their mighty antagonists.|$|R

40|$|Thick {{bonding wires}} {{are used in}} modern power modules as {{connectors}} between integrated circuits, carrying current from one circuit to another. They experience high values of current, which generates heat through Joule heating {{and can lead to}} various failure mechanisms. Typically used wire materials in industry are aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), and intermetallic compounds of Cu-Al. They are broadly used because of their strength, high thermal conductivity, and low resistivity. This study reports on the influence of thermal loading on the mechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Experimental techniques are developed and introduced in this thesis to analyze quasi-static and dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires 300 µm in diameter. First, an experimental technique is developed to measure the quasi-static displacement <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires carrying DC currents. It is then deployed to measure the displacement, as well as peak temperature, of three types <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires, Al, Cu and Aluminum coated Copper (CuCorAl) to study the response under DC current. Secondly, an experimental technique is established and deployed for modal analysis <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires under thermal loading. Experimental results demonstrate a drop in the natural frequency <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires with increased thermal loads. Moreover, a harmonic analysis technique using thermal excitation is developed and applied to analyze the mode shapes and frequency response <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires. Furthermore, an analytical model and a finite element model are used to analyze static and dynamic responses <b>of</b> <b>bonding</b> wires.
