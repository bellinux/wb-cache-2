A combination of viral and fungal pathogens, together with changes in management, has reduced rhinoceros beetle numbers and the damage they cause very significantly. A new approach to bio-control against <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth</b> is showing better results than earlier attempts, when the release of predators and pathogens was prejdiced by continuing use of broad spectrum insecticides. Most recently, two hymenopterous predators of P. xylostella have been released, Cotesia plutellae and Diadegma eucerophiagi, and insecticides specific to Lepidoptera have been used: Dipel, a bacteria-based product, and Atabron, a chitin inhibitor. The latest control regime {{has resulted in the}} need for spraying against <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth</b> being reduced from 8 - 12 times during the growth period of cabbage to 2 - 3 times. Farmers are very satisfied because of the saving in costs of chemicals and spray applications, while consumers are benefiting from reduced risk of pesticide contamination in fresh vegetables.

40|$|Until recently, most market gardens {{were located}} on the {{outskirts}} of cities and, in a few cases, even within. They have now spread to rural areas but their viability there is threatened if transportation and marketing systems are not improved. If rural producers are to succeed, both agronomic and economic solutions to their problems need to be found. The success of market gardens depends primarily on the initiative of these new entrepreneurs, whose numbers have increased dramatically over the last few years. Different production systems and objectives, as well as varying results, combine to make generalizations difficult in this field. It can be said, however, that if vegetable production in cities is designed to satisfy the large demand of consumers, in rural areas it reflects primarily the objectives of the producers themselves. Market gardeners have flourished in African cities because their crops can produce large quantities from small areas. Using sewage sludge to enrich their compost and grey or used water for watering, such gardeners often exploit any available land, even in the centre of urban areas. Increasing construction in urban areas, however, is slowly pushing them out to suburban plots or land even further away from the city. Even so, many market gardeners are still producing on small plots ranging in size from less than ten to up to 100 square metres which are intensively cultivated by hand. In Kinshasa, more than 6000 urban farmers were identified in the business of supplying both the city and surrounding towns. Such producers are very diverse: they include women seeking financial independence; civil servants who want to supplement their incomes; young people who are attracted by such 'modern' agriculture; and the unemployed. Increasingly, however, it is men who make their full-time living out of market gardening because it can be very lucrative. They specialize in European type vegetables (potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, squash, and so on) leaving their wives the responsibility of growing African vegetables. But despite the spectacular growth of market gardening in urban and suburban areas the supply of cities generally remains inadequate. In Brazzaville, of the 18, 000 t of vegetables consumed annually, only 3000 t are produced locally. Projects like Agricongo are attempting to modernize and increase production around urban centres. Families in rural areas have always grown their own 'sauce ingredients'. These consist of various local crops (okra, pimento, tomato, leafy vegetables) produced in small backyard plots, or in association with other food crops in more humid areas. What is new is the appearance in the countryside of market gardens whose produce is destined to be sold elsewhere. The revenue from such sales is generally used to buy cereals thereby ensuring local food security. By improving living conditions in rural areas, NGOs and some governments also hope to limit emigration towards the cities (see SPORE No. 2). Market gardening is also well received by local farmers because it does not compete with their cereal crops, which remain the first priority. Produced during the off-season, vegetable crops can be used to exploit both idle hands and abandoned lands. Furthermore, although they require intensive care, {{there is no need for}} expensive equipment or specialized techniques to succeed. Such initiatives have been rapidly developed not only in the droughtstricken Sahel but also in more humid regions where they can generate considerable revenues. One indication of this is the considerable amount of land now dedicated to market gardening. Collective gardens have sprung up around wells and vegetables now occupy increasing space in irrigated fields. Lands that were abandoned, such as easily-irrigated lowlands or sandy soils unsuitable for cereals, have now been brought back into production. Growing methods have also changed: cultivation is now more intensive, green manure is being used, and improved seeds are being introduced. Enthusiasm but little experience For the first few years, the enthusiasm of farmers and some NGOs disguised the problems inherent to this kind of production. The multiplication of these projects throughout sub-Saharan Africa also tended to ignore the fact that to succeed, crops must not only grow well but sell well. Unfortunately, very little was done in the beginning to ensure production and commercialization of such cross. One of the main difficulties is that there is no regular supply of inputs. From time to time it is difficult to get the right seeds as improved varieties for foreign vegetables are rarely produced locally. Imports are either insufficient or arrive too late, especially in remote areas. Furthermore, there is the problem of hybrid seeds that cannot be reproduced at all and must be bought every year. This is particularly crucial for potatoes, an up-and-coming new crop. Local production of seed potatoes is often impossible because the tubers are difficult to store under tropical conditions. They are supplied from Europe but often arrive too late. The organization of seed production is one of the main priorities in order to increase the output of market gardens. Furthermore, the plants themselves are not always adapted to the local climate or cultivation techniques. Improved varieties are more sensitive to drought and pests. Finally, it is unfortunate that so little work has been done on local vegetables that are more resistant and which can be grown during the hot and humid season. Such crops require more stringent protection measures, all the more important because they grow during the dry season and thus are a prime target for insects that have nothing else to eat at that time. That explains why cotton pests such as Heliothis become major problems for out-ofseason tomatoes, why thrips attack onions, or <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moths</b> threaten cabbages. To limit such damage, growers treat their beds with insecticides which they find on the local market, often designed to be used on cotton crops. Unfortunately, they are poorly trained in the use of pesticides and have little choice other than, as one of them explained, the 'white powder bought in bulk at the market'. Excessive treatments are common especially in suburban areas. This leaves toxic residues on the produce and builds up resistance in the pest themselves. The growers also have to deal with other, more dreaded problems such as nematodes or Pseudomonas solanacearum, a bacterium that infects the soil and makes it unfit for growing tomato crops. Researchers are now working on improved varieties to help overcome such difficulties. Plant problems are particularly serious in humid, tropical zones with relatively little direct sunlight. On the other hand, tropical uplands which have lower temperatures are much more suited to producing a large variety of vegetables. If such regions are well exploited, it seems that they could supply large areas. Generally speaking, research on market garden crops remains inadequate. Current work deals with the selection of new varieties and crop protection. In view of the increasing importance of such crops, however, national and foreign research organizations are renewing their interest in these long-forgotten crone. Commercialization is lacking The sale of market garden produce essentially takes place through the traditional systems which usually rely on women. These networks involve numerous intermediaries, except for the very small producers who sell directly on the local markets. Transportation systems that are often inadequate or poorly adapted, and poor packaging and storage methods, result in heavy losses. Furthermore, those producers who are far removed from markets depend entirely on local merchants for information about current prices and supply conditions on the market. Those who are not near major transportation routes or urban areas are faced with considerable problems in selling their produce. Sacks of onions and crates of tomatoes often rot by the roadside because of poor collection and transportation systems. Another problem is that many of these vegetables mature at the same time. In the Sahel, they all arrive at the same time on both rural and urban markets, usually between January and March. Sales during such periods of glut are often impossible and the bottom can fall out of the market. This has happened much more frequently during the last few years with the increase in the area cultivated. Villagers outside Matam in the Senegal River valley, for example, are no longer able to sell their produce on the saturated local markets For farmers, sales are often the only reason for growing such crops. If they cannot make sufficient profit this way, they prefer to find a more lucrative activity that requires less effort. With the good results of the past few years, their financial needs are less pressing. In some areas there has already been a movement away from market gardening towards other activities that are considered to be more profitable such as gold panning or jobs in the city. The question that remains is how to increase sales. Several answers are possible but there are no easy solutions. An increase in the consumption of vegetables in rural areas is encouraged, primarily to improve the local diet, which is often inadequate. The consumption of fresh vegetables in rural areas is far behind that in urban areas and European vegetables are eaten only as a last resort. In Mauritania, for example, the average annual consumption of vegetables is about 24 kg but villagers eat only 6 kg. Modification of traditional eating habits is necessary. Spreading out the production period is another way of ensuring better sales. This could involve the development of tomato varieties that grow during the winter and others that can be planted early. African vegetables that can be grown throughout the year also enable farmers to spread out their production In order to ensure more regular supply for markets, attention must also be given to better storage methods. In this respect, onions and potatoes are receiving research attention designed to find varieties that keep better. For highly perishable produce, such as tomatoes, processing techniques are recommended. Solar drying is a simple solution available to all but it alone cannot handle large excesses. The development of small industrial units to process tomatoes into concentrate seems promising but, in order to make such investments cost-effective, there needs to be good organization of production and collection systems. At one point, export crops were hailed as the way of the future and this resulted in the development of numerous plantations outside urban areas. Markets for such products however, became more and more difficult to find and maintain. Today only green wax beans still find sufficient buyers. Produced in Senegal and Burkina Faso, they demand careful cultivation and harvesting, thus farmers have little room for error. Furthermore, shipping methods often require production dates that simply cannot be respected. At the moment, the absence of guaranteed markets is the biggest obstacle to the success of market gardening. Efforts must therefore be made to give these crops the place they deserve in the local diet and economy of rural regions. It would be unfortunate if the enthusiasm of the farmers is not matched by equally energetic efforts of others to ensure that such hopes for the future are realized BIBLIOGRAPHY 3 rd Seminar of CIRAD/DSA on Amenagements hydro-agricoles et systemes de production.

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) serve as signals mediating information between plants and their higher trophic level beneficials, such as parasitoids and predators of herbivores. We recently demonstrated with oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) plants, herbivorous <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth</b> (Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae)) larvae and Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) parasitoids that atmospheric pollution, i. e., elevated ozone (O 3), can disturb attraction of natural enemies by plant-emitted host-induced volatile cues. Additionally, {{we found that the}} degree of herbivore feeding damage is an important contributor to this O 3 interference. Low feeding damage in herbivore-resistant plants was sufficient to attract C. vestalis females to host-damaged plants under ambient air, but this tritrophic signaling turned non-functional in the combination of low feeding damage and high O 3 concentration. Here we present some additional data of how climate change factors may modify feeding patterns and growth of herbivores. We further discuss how the degree of herbivore feeding damage and the tritrophic signaling interaction relaying on the herbivore-induced VOCs from attacked plants might change through direct and indirect effects of increased levels of carbon dioxide, temperature and O 3...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{limitations}} {{regarding the use}} of the neonicotinoids: clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid there are no currently available insecticide seed dressings for oilseed rape in Poland. For maize here is only one seed dressing containing methiocarb available with a very narrow registered scope of use. The impact of limitations on protection possibilities of other major Polish agricultural crops is either negligible or non-existent. In consequence a group of economically important insect pests of maize [dungbeetles (Melolonthidae); click beetles (Elateridae); noctuid moths (Agrotinae) ] and oilseed rape [leaf miners (Agromyzidae), turnip sawfly (Athalia colibri Christ.), cabbage weevils (Curculionidae), cabbage root fly (Hylemyia brassicae Bche.), <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth</b> (Plutella maculipennis Curt.) ] is left without any legal possibility of chemical control. For the other important pests of the early growth stage of oilseed rape development, there are only pyrethroids available together with one product containing chloropiryfos that can be applied once per vegetation season. Since both maize and oilseed rape are grown in Poland on the area of approximately 1 million ha (each crop), this situation raises concerns about production possibilities as well as development of pest resistance...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of plastic}} mulch color {{including}} aluminum polyethylene, clear, green, red, and yellow plastic on growth of pak-choi (Brassica campestris L.) cv. 'Feng Jing' in greenhouse were investigated at three different croppings i. e. September, 2003, November, 2003 and January, 2004. Root temperature under mulches {{was higher than}} the non-mulched control during the three croppings. The highest root temperature was shown under aluminum polyethylene and clear plastic which was 2. 6 to 3. 1 ℃ higher than control at midday. Green, red and yellow plastics had similar effect on root temperature. PPFD tended to be increased on mulch surfaces, except red plastic. The highest PPFD were measured on aluminum polyethylene and yellow plastic which were 6 - 21 ％ higher than in control at three croppings. The effect of mulch color on plant growth varied among different crops. Yield in Sept. crop decreased in mulched treatments but increased in clear and yellow plastics by 19 and 31 ％, respectively, in comparing to control in Jan. crop. There were no differences in yield between mulches and control in Nov. crop, however, the differences among mulches were shown with higher yield in yellow plastic compared to aluminum polyethylene. Nitrate content in leaves grown in Sept. crop increased in mulched treatments but decreased in mulching with yellow plastic in Jan. crop. Percentage of leaves injuried by <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth</b> (Putella xylostells L.) generally was decreased by mulching during three crops, however, yellow plastic was the most efficient mulch to reduce the leaf injury. 本試驗以小白菜(Brassica campestris L.)

40|$|The {{potential}} impact of future extreme weather events on horticultural crops was evaluated. A review was carried out of the sensitivities of a representative set of crops to environmental challenges. It confirmed that a range of environmental factors are capable of causing {{a significant impact on}} production, either as yield or quality loss. The most important of these were un-seasonal temperature, water shortage or excess,and storms. Future scenarios were produced by the LARS-WG 1, a stochastic weather generator linked with UKCIP 02 projections of future climate. For the analyses, 150 years of synthetic weather data were generated for baseline, 2020 HI and 2050 HI scenarios at defined locations. The output from the weather generator was used in case studies, either to estimate the frequency of a defined set of circumstances known to have impact on cropping, or as inputs to models of crop scheduling or pest phenology or survival. The analyses indicated that episodes of summer drought severe enough to interrupt the continuity of supply of salads and other vegetables will increase while the frequency of autumns with sufficient rainfall to restrict potato lifting will decrease. They also indicated that the scheduling of winter cauliflowers for continuity of supply will require the deployment of varieties with different temperature sensitivities from those in use currently. In the pest insect studies, the number of batches of Agrotis segetum (cutworm) larvae surviving to third instar increased with time, as did the potential number of generations of Plutella xylostella (<b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth)</b> in the growing season, across a range of locations. The study demonstrated the utility of high resolution scenarios in predicting the likelihood of specific weather patterns and their potential effect on horticultural production. Several limitations of the current scenarios and biological models were also identified...|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} aim to {{demonstrate}} how methods of pest control developed for conventional vegetable production can be adapted for use by organic growers. The study will concentrate on pests of umbelliferous and cruciferous crops and will be composed of 11 specific objectives outlined as follows, together with {{ways in which they}} might be achieved: 1. Adaptation of the existing carrot fly forecast to quantify how the date of crop drilling influences subsequent fly pressure. The carrot fly forecast produced at HRI Wellesbourne will be used to predict the proportion of the first generation of flies that will lay eggs on carrot crops drilled on different dates. The model will also be used to predict the timing of emergence of the subsequent fly generation within the crop. It will then be verified using data from experimental carrot plots located close to the source of the main carrot fly population at HRI; these data will be incorporated into the existing carrot fly forecast model; 2. Production of a model to quantify how crop damage can be reduced by altering the harvest date. A sub-model based on published and field data will be incorporated into the carrot fly forecast model, together with meteorological data; this model will be calibrated with experimental data collected from carrot plots at Wellesbourne; 3. Identification of times at which crops should be covered to reduce carrot fly damage. Output from the carrot fly model will be modified to identify the times at which crops should be covered and the dates after which it is safe to uncover crops for operations such as weeding; 4. Quantification of the contribution possible from host plants with various levels of resistance. Data collected at HRI Wellesbourne will be used in simple mathematical models to quantify how partial plant resistance can contribute to the reduction of carrot fly damage alone or in combination with other damage reduction techniques; 5. Verification of carrot fly control strategies. Information collected in objectives 1 - 4 will be used to produce a strategy for reducing carrot fly damage in organically grown umbelliferous crops; this will be evaluated by HDRA in commercial carrot and parsnip crops where there are high and low levels of infestation. Objectives 6 - 11 will focus on pests of cruciferous crops; 6. Adaptation of the existing pest forecasts to quantify how the judicious choice of planting and harvesting dates can be used to reduce crop damage. Existing forecasting systems for pollen beetle, cabbage root fly, cabbage aphid, <b>diamond-back</b> <b>moth,</b> small white butterfly, cabbage moth and garden pebble moth will be used to identify the periods when cruciferous crops are at risk from each of these pest species. Forecasts will be verified by experimental data obtained from cabbage plots; 7. Identification of crop/pest situations where application of crop covers would be advantageous. A literature review will be conducted to identify crop/pest combinations where it would be advantageous to apply covers to exclude insect pests; results from relevant field experiments will also be included; 8. Evaluation of simple methods for inspecting crops to determine {{the presence or absence of}} any given pest species. A literature review will be conducted, including results from studies involving sampling aphid and caterpillar pests within cruciferous crops; 9. Identification of critical periods during which control measures should be applied. The literature will be reviewed to indicate the best time to apply the various control measures available to organic growers. Output from models of pest activity will be modified to indicate the most appropriate timings for application of each control measure; 10. Verification of the pest control strategy arising from work conducted in objectives 7 - 10. This strategy will be underpinned by the pest forecast models and will be presented as a MORPH decision support system. The strategy will be evaluated in an organic cropping system by growing crops of cauliflower and cabbage in locations with different levels of pest infestation; and 11. Production of a user-friendly format for disseminating the information produced in the study to organic growers. Information will be provided in the form of a decision support system in MORPH, articles in grower publications, through the advisory network and at annual meetings for organic growers...|$|E
