40|$|Abstract—Corrugated <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguide</b> in {{actually}} extensive {{application is}} analyzed {{by using the}} mode matching method and Mathieu function. Considering space harmonics in the interior and higher order modes in the slot region of the corrugated <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the dispersion equation of even TM modes is derived. The dispersion and attenuation characteristics {{as well as the}} influence of passband and stopband properties with the changes of structural parameter are investigated in detail. The calculated results in good agreement with ones in the relevant references are of very important values in theoretical studies and actual applications of corrugated <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguide</b> for microwave engineering. 1...|$|E
40|$|A scalar Frequency-Domain Finite-Difference {{approach}} to the mode computation of <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguides</b> is presented. The use of an elliptic cylindrical grid allows us to take exactly into account the curved boundary of the structure and a single mesh has been used both for TE and TM modes. As a consequence, a high accuracy is obtained with a reduced computational burden, since the resulting matrix is highly sparse...|$|R

The programs for resonance frequency calculating of disk loaded rectangular and <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguides</b> were created. For structures with disk slot apertures the focussing gradient values have been measured at {{a broad range}} of slot height change. The investigation of electrodynamic characteristics of structures with non-axisymmetic slots for beam path is very essential for high-energy linear electron-positron collider design. Such structures has RF focussing feature [I]. For a structure focussing properties determination it’s essential to know the electromagnetic field configuration in the beam channel...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} subband {{structure of}} carriers in bismuth-like cylindrical nanowires is investigated analytically, using an {{anisotropic effective mass}} model. Quantum confinement effects {{are found to be}} significantly enhanced over the results of a quasi-isotropic approach, due to the correct consideration of both the mass anisotropy and the boundary shape of the wire. The size quantization problem for a carrier with anisotropic effective mass parameters in a cylindrical well is shown to be equivalent to that of a carrier with some isotropic effective mass in an elliptical well. Detailed study of the energy levels reveals their orbital degeneracy is lifted by the elliptic symmetry, where the degree of ellipticity corresponds to the mass anisotropy. Carrier motion is analysed by analogy to the geometrical optics of <b>elliptic</b> <b>waveguides,</b> with bounding caustic curves defining two groups inside the wire that correspond to 'whispering gallery' and 'jumping ball' modes. The additional confinement, arising from the mass anisotropy, leads to larger critical wire diameters for the semimetal-to-semiconductor transition, which is investigated for wires of different crystallographic orientation...|$|R

It is shown that the transfer function of both multiresolution filters {{is related to the}} solution of a Mathieu equation of odd characteristic exponent. The number of notches of these analysing filters can be easily designed. Wavelets derived by this method have potential application in the fields of optics, microwaves and electromagnetism.

40|$|Abstract—A {{narrowband}} trisection substrate-integrated <b>waveguide</b> <b>elliptic</b> filter with {{coplanar waveguide}} (CPW) {{input and output}} ports is proposed and demonstrated for X-band applications. The filter is formed by incorporating metallized vias in a substrate (RT/Duroid) to create cross-coupled waveguide resonators. The result is an attenuation pole of finite frequency on the high side of the passband, therefore exhibiting asymmetric frequency response. The fabricated trisection filter with a centre frequency of 10. 05 GHz exhibits an insertion loss of 3. 16 dB for 3 % bandwidth and a return loss of − 20 dB. The rejection is larger than 15 dB at 10. 37 GHz. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} alternative approach {{for the analysis of}} inductive waveguide microwave components. The technique uses a surface integral equation formulation, in which the contours of the waveguide walls and of the inner obstacles are all discretized using triangular basis functions. In order to avoid the relative convergence problem of other techniques based on mode matching, an alternative port treatment is used. The technique is based on the application of the extinction theorem using the spatial representation of the Green’s functions in the terminal waveguides. In addition, the Fast Multipole Method is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} computational cost for large problems. Different complex structures are analyzed, including microwave bandpass filters with <b>elliptic</b> transfer functions, <b>waveguide</b> bends and T-junctions. Results show the high accuracy and versatility of the technique derived. 1...|$|R

IN PART I, WE TREAT THE PROPAGATION OF TM AND TE MODES IN ECCENTRIC CIRCULAR - ELLIPTIC PERFECTLY CONDUCTING WAVEGUIDES. IN PART II, THE SCATTERING OF PLANE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED CYLINDRAL STRUCTURE IS EXAMINED. IN THIS LAST CASE, BOTH POLARIZATIONS (TM AND TE WITH RESPECT TO Z AXIS) ARE CONSIDERED FOR NORMAL INCIDENCE. SHARE PERTURBATION METHODS ARE USED IN THE PRESENT THESIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SEPARATION OF VARIABLE TECHNIQUES FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE FIELD EQUATIONS. USING EXPANSION FORMULAS BETWEEN ELLIPTICAL AND CIRCULAR CYLINDRICAL WAVE FUNCTIONS, AND TRANSLATIONAL ADDITION THEOREMS FOR THE LAST ONES WE CONCLUDE, AFTER THE SATISFACTION OF THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND SOME MANIPULATION, TO TWO INFINITE SETS OF LINEAR EQUATION. FOR GENERAL VALUES OF ELLIPTICITY, THE SYSTEM CAN BE SOLVED ONLY NUMARICALLY BY TRUNCATION, BUT FOR SMALL VALUES OF H=KCL 2 (<< 1) A SEMI - ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION OF THE FORM S(H) = S(0) [1 +GH^ 2 +O(H^ 4) ] IS OBTAINED FOR THE CUT OFF WAVENUMBERS AND THE SCATTERED FIELD.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there was a}} notable {{developmental}} leap in communications systems operating at microwave frequencies. In the dissertation, {{the goal is to}} demonstrate the challenges and to propose solutions that enable the successful design and realization of very wide band microwave components, in particular, microwave directional couplers and filters. Directional couplers are an essential part in microwave systems. They are commonly used for dividing or combining signals. For example they are used in the generation of the desired power division in beam-forming networks for spacecraft antennas. In other applications, they are used for power monitoring. In the dissertation, a comprehensive treatment of wide-band ridge waveguide directional couplers is included. Analysis and design of different configurations and arrangement of couplers realized in ridge waveguides are discussed. A new detailed systematic design procedure for ridge waveguide couplers in the two most used configurations "E-plane and H-plane" is proposed. Filters are also an integral part of any communication system. They separate communication channels operating at different frequencies thus eliminating interference between different channels. In the dissertation, design issues of wide-band ridge <b>waveguide</b> <b>elliptic</b> function filters realized in Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) are discussed. Ridge waveguide filters have excellent characteristics such as wide stop-band and compact size. An excellent approach in manufacturing RF/microwave systems is the integration of components into multilayer substrates using LTCC which facilitates the design of microwave modules in the same package thus increasing reliability and reducing size. A new scheme to achieve the strong couplings, a crucial requirement for the realization of wide band elliptic filters is proposed in the dissertation. As an example, rigorous mode matching method is successfully used in the analysis and design of a challenging wide-band ridge waveguide filter realized in LTCC technology. Another interesting realization of couplers is the realization in strip-line transmission lines. In the dissertation, new proposed multi-section multi-layer LTCC stripline couplers are designed and analyzed. The proposed design enables the designer to achieve precise performance otherwise restricted by limitations posed by available technologies. The realization of wideband performance is made possible by such proposed design...|$|R
