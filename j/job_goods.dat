40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} two questions: (1) Do informal <b>job</b> searchers find <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> in Hungary? (2) Do social resources {{theory and}} the theory of employee referrals explain {{the conditions under which}} informal <b>job</b> searchers find <b>good</b> <b>jobs?</b> The questions are examined using a rather unique dataset which was collected among people who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. It is found that the use of informal methods in itself rarely promotes one’s chances of finding a <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> Rather, <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> can be accessed through either high status contacts or employee referrals. These findings are consistent with both social resources {{theory and the}} theory of employee referrals...|$|R

40|$|We analyze how {{changes in}} location-specific trade {{exposure}} a¤ect employment growth in US local labor markets between 1990 and 2010. In particular, {{our focus is}} investigating heterogeneous effects on local employment growth of <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> versus bad jobs. We have three main findings. First, rising local exposure to import competition, via falling local tariffs or rising Chinese import penetration, destroys bad <b>jobs</b> but creates <b>good</b> <b>jobs.</b> Conversely, greater local access to foreign markets creates bad <b>jobs</b> but destroys <b>good</b> <b>jobs.</b> Third, falling local tariff protection is substantially more important, economically and statistically, than rising local exposure to Chinese import penetration...|$|R

Urban sprawl is a global phenomenon and is characterised by increase in population growth in urban areas, migration, change in built-up areas and spatial form. Urban sprawl creates economic, social and environmental costs such as environmental degradation due to more intensive land and car use as well as economic challenges brought about by increased distance to <b>jobs,</b> <b>goods</b> and service markets. Infrastructure costs seem to increase in new sprawling development than compact development. It becoming more difficult to pay for the additional costs incurred by urban sprawl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} an on-the-job search {{model that}} includes wage bargaining and employer-employee mismatch. There are two states {{of workers in}} relationship to their fit for a particular <b>job,</b> <b>good</b> match versus bad match (mismatch). These states change in accordance with a stochastic process. There are two main results; {{the first is that}} the turnover level that workers find optimal is lower than the socially optimal level. The second is that the level of the firm’s entry is not optimal even though the Hosios condition is hold. The first result is clearly distinct from previous studies.

Four behavioral traits are proposed and discussed as distinctive of amphibious companies: doing different <b>jobs</b> <b>good,</b> diversifying in multiple market arenas, brokering and bridging across business networks and absorbing knowledge from the outside. The paper illustrates these arguments through a paradigmatic case study of an Italian firm operating in the chemical industry, which has been able to survive a challenging crisis by adopting an amphibious behavior. <br...|$|R
50|$|In 1989, Riggi and Palermo, {{along with}} several other associates, were put on trial for {{racketeering}} and extortion by illegally using Local 394 of the International Association of Laborers and Hod Carriers, to extort <b>jobs,</b> <b>goods</b> and services from the construction industry in New Jersey. Additionally, Riggi used his power and influence to place subcontractors and workers other than laborers at various construction projects around the state. In this way, Riggi and the DeCavalcantes were able to rip-off union welfare and pension funds. In 1990, Giovanni Riggi was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Palermo was acquitted on his racketeering charges.|$|R

30|$|Accordingly, we need {{policies}} {{that will enable}} more workers to obtain the skills and credentials that employers seek when creating <b>good</b> <b>jobs.</b> This means not only a stronger educational system, but one in which higher education and workforce development are more effectively integrated and responsive to trends in the labor market, especially sectors where <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> are being created.|$|R
40|$|The lack of “good ” jobs is {{a serious}} problem for all Americans and an {{especially}} dire problem for America’s people of color. Th e current recession has highlighted overall job loss and the need for robust job creation; however, we must also look at the quality of those jobs. Th e United States has too few <b>good</b> <b>jobs,</b> and the share has been declining over time. A recovery that creates millions of low-wage, no-benefi t jobs is not a real recovery at all. Th is Briefi ng Paper uses a minimal defi nition of a “good ” job. It defi nes a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> as one that pays a wage that can support a family and that provides health care and retirement benefi ts. Using this minimal standard, the paper shows that Hispanics are less than half as likely as whites to have <b>good</b> <b>jobs,</b> and African Americans are about two-thirds as likely. When comparing workers of the same educational level, whites {{are also more likely to}} have <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> than Asian Americans. Th e large share of college graduates among Asian Americans, however, hides their disadvantage when one examines the group as a whole. Generally, people of color have less access than whites to quality jobs. Th e lack of <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> is a problem for all racial and ethnic groups. From 1979 to 2008, the share of <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> declined 6. 9 percentage points among all races. Th is is a surprising development when one considers that there has been a 76 % increase in productivity over the same period. 1 Average Americans are working harder and smarter, but average workers of all racial and ethnic groups have not benefi tted in pay and benefi ts from these improvements. Without the <b>good</b> <b>jobs</b> agenda outlined in this paper, we will likely continue to see reductions in their number...|$|R

50|$|Is there {{anything}} unique {{about the experience}} of urban Appalachians?

However, inner city white Appalachians now share with underemployed African-Americans and black Appalachians the tragedies and challenges of living in the post-industrial metropolis.
