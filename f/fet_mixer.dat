40|$|This paper investigates up/down {{conversion}} asymmetry in {{intermodulation distortion}} observed in measurements of resistive <b>FET</b> <b>mixers.</b> Symmetric behaviour is intuitively expected {{of such a}} topology, so a first principle analysis is carried out to determine the responsible mechanism. Previous analysis of up/down conversion asymmetry has focused on conversion gain in diode based mixers, whereas the effects investigated in this paper are for mixers with symmetry in this aspect. The aim is to fully understand the intermodulation mechanism, so that performance can be enhanced. The approach taken is to consider the mixer as a two-port nonlinear element driven by multiple frequency sources. Mixing performance then becomes {{a function of the}} relative frequencies and amplitudes, which is related to the mode of operation as an up or down converter. This investigation is performed with FET models of increasing complexity and physical accuracy. In this manner the effect on intermodulation and other mixer performance parameters can be isolated to those differences introduced with each model change such as the effect of adding higher order even/odd terms to the drain or gate non-linear model independently. The result is an understanding into the FET properties that contribute to intermodulation distortion. This knowledge is useful to designers as it allows educated modifications to mixer topology to obtain improved linearity.

40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis covers work done on device {{characterization}} methods. A statistical method for estimating small-signal model parameters in FET-models was proposed. A maximum likelihood estimator was derived and the new method was compared to a standard direct extraction technique.

A method for extracting the thermal impedance of microwave transistors was developed. The method was derived from a thorough theoretical analysis of the self-heating feedback problem. The method uses small-signal measurements at low-frequency and a temperature controlled fixture. A technique for improving dynamic range in oscilloscope based RF measurements was also presented. The technique uses repeated measurements synchronized at baseband and an extended Kalman filter for estimating the unknown RF-phase, which allowed for averaging and thus reduction of measurement noise.

Each exhibits a range of 110 dB between the available input power necessary for 10 dB((S+N)) /N sensitivity and the available input power of a two-tone signal which causes intermodulation products down 40 dB from the desired signals. An expression for the conversion transconductance of a junction FET used as a mixer is first derived from the device transfer characteristic equation. The advantages of a balanced mixer con figuration are then discussed. A noise equivalent circuit which describes the sources of noise {{in each of the}} proposed mixers is developed. This leads to the calculation of noise factor and hence, sensitivity of the common source mixer as a function of RS, the generator resistance.

40|$|Graphene has {{exceptional}} {{carrier transport}} properties {{which makes it}} a promising material for future nanoelectronics. The high carrier mobility along with the ability to switch between n- and p-channel in a graphene field effect transistor (G-FET) truly distinguishes it from other types of FET technologies and enables completely new high frequency devices. In this thesis, a novel subharmonic resistive G-FET mixer is presented. The mixer operation is based on the G-FET’s symmetrical transfer characteristic. Due to this property, the mixer operates with a single transistor and unlike the conventional subharmonic resistive <b>FET</b> <b>mixers,</b> it does not need any balun at the local oscillator (LO) port. This makes the mixer circuit more compact. The mixer conversion loss (CL) is measured with fRF= 2 GHz, fLO= 1. 01 GHz and fIF= 20 MHz in a 50 Ω impedance system, and for a G-FET with an on-off ratio of 3, a CL of 24 dB is obtained. In addition, the mixer performance is analysed based on the GFET parameters, the LO power and the embedding impedances. It is predicted that by having a G-FET with an on-off ratio of 10 and selecting proper embedding impedances, a CL of 17 dB is attainable. Also, by further improvement of the G-FET on-off ratio, the CL is optimised to about 14. 2 dB. Moreover, a process technology for 1 μm gate-length G-FETs based on exfoliated graphene has been developed. A contact resistance as low as 500 - 600 Ω. μm is obtained, which is close to the lowest reported value. In addition, different gate dielectric materials have been investigated. A plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process for deposition of a silicon nitride film as a gate dielectric is developed. The process maintains the carrier mobility of the graphene film largely intact after deposition. Also, to form Al 2 O 3 gate dielectric films, a protective layer of naturally oxidised Al is used prior to e-gun evaporation of Al 2 O 3. This layer prevents further degradation of the carrier mobility. Finally, a novel closed-form large-signal model for G-FETs is developed. The model is semiempirical and can be utilised in standard Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools for designing and analysing G-FET circuits. The model is implemented in Agilent’s Advanced Design System (ADS) software and experimentally verified for a G-FET under both DC and RF operation. The DC results agree with the model. The RF verification includes S-parameters and power spectrum measurements. The S-parameters measurements essentially coincide with the model and the power spectrum analysis shows good agreement up to the 4 th order. Moreover, the model is used to simulate the G-FET mixer CL and the results follow the measurements...|$|R

A 10 -GHz prototype was fabricated, which demonstrated a locking range more than double that of the isolated VCO injection-locking range over the same range of injected signal power.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to develop new {{concepts}} and technology for the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF), Cassini, and other future deep space missions which maximally conform to the Functional Specification for the NASA X-Band Transponder (NXT), FM 513778 (preliminary, revised July 26, 1988). The study is composed of two tasks. The first task was to investigate a new digital signal processing technique which involves the processing of 1 -bit samples and has the potential for significant size, mass, power, and electrical performance improvements over conventional analog approaches. The entire X-band receiver tracking loop was simulated on a digital computer using a high-level programming language. Simulations on this 'software breadboard' showed the technique to be well-behaved and a good approximation to its analog predecessor from threshold to strong signal levels in terms of tracking-loop performance, command signal-to-noise ratio and ranging signal-to-noise ratio. The successful completion of this task paves the way for building a hardware breadboard, the recommended next step in confirming this approach is ready for incorporation into flight hardware. The second task in this study was to investigate another technique which provides considerable simplification in the synthesis of the receiver first LO over conventional phase-locked multiplier schemes and in this approach, provides down-conversion for an S-band emergency receive mode without the need of an additional LO. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop methodology and models to predict the conversion loss, input RF bandwidth, and output RF bandwidth of a series GaAs <b>FET</b> sampling <b>mixer</b> and to breadboard and test a circuit design suitable for the X and S-band down-conversion applications...|$|R
40|$|Key {{requirements}} for a 30 GHz GaAs monolithic receive module for spaceborne communication antenna feed array applications include an overall receive module noise figure of 5 dB, a 30 dB RF to IF gain with six levels of intermediate gain control, a five-bit phase shifter, {{and a maximum}} power consumption of 250 mW. The RF designs {{for each of the}} four submodules (low noise amplifier, some gain control, phase shifter, and RF to IF sub-module) are presented. Except for the phase shifter, high frequency, low noise FETs with sub-half micron gate lengths are employed in the submodules. For the gain control, a two stage dual gate FET amplifier is used. The phase shifter is of the passive switched line type and consists of 5 -bits. It uses relatively large gate width FETs (with zero drain to source bias) as the switching elements. A 20 GHz local oscillator buffer amplifier, a <b>FET</b> compatible balanced <b>mixer,</b> and a 5 - 8 GHz IF amplifier constitute the RF/IF sub-module. Phase shifter fabrication using ion implantation and a self-aligned gate technique is described. Preliminary RF results obtained on such phase shifters are included...|$|R
