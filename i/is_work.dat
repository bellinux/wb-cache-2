5|$|Lions Entertainment {{is a new}} {{event at}} Cannes Lions where brands, {{agencies}} and entertainment companies can focus on producing outstanding creative work together. The Entertainment Lions for Music celebrate creative musical collaborations. Entries will need to demonstrate original production, promotion or distribution of music for brands; that <b>is</b> <b>work</b> where a recording artist or platform is innovatively leveraged to communicate with consumers. Adele has won once.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the ACLC <b>is</b> <b>work</b> with DND to reach {{the goals of the}} cadet movement, with a primary focus on the army cadet portion.|$|E
25|$|It is just unthinkable.... I {{am proud}} and {{honored to be}} a priest and a Jesuit. As a person of faith I must believe that there <b>is</b> <b>work</b> for me to do which somehow will be more {{important}} than the work I am required to leave.|$|E
50|$|The mine <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> further under lease by Henry R. Whittell {{and later}} by Ralph M. Robey, {{although}} it <b>was</b> often not <b>worked.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> as South Hetton Colliery as late as 1906.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the PD&SWJR {{main line}} <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by the LSWR ostensibly {{as part of}} its own system, the Callington branch <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> {{independently}} by the PD&SWJR.|$|R
50|$|Hot short iron can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> {{but it has}} to <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> at low {{temperatures}}. Working {{at lower}} temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman. The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can <b>be</b> <b>worked,</b> but it requires a great deal more time and effort.|$|R
25|$|After a late {{return from}} {{southern}} work in 1883 {{the ship was}} put to summer work in surveys of the bar at New York harbor entrance. This work apparently continued into 1884. The last mention of active survey by Drift <b>is</b> <b>work</b> in summer and fall of 1885 in the East River during multi-ship work in New York harbor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1972, Hess was hired as an art {{professor}} at Willamette University. When he arrived, the university {{did not have a}} sculpture studio so Hess began <b>is</b> <b>work</b> in an auditorium attic area. Initially, he taught classes in sculpture and basic design. Later, Hess added classes in figure drawing, structural design, and metalsmithing. Hess eventually began operating a foundry to produce metal sculptures.|$|E
25|$|The Libramiento Sur-Poniente {{is a new}} {{ring road}} under construction, though parts of it already exist. When completed, it will join Bernardo Quintana on its southeastern part, go around the city in its southwestern and western parts, and reach the {{northern}} suburb of Santa Rosa Jauregui. Currently, there <b>is</b> <b>work</b> in progress that aims to extend Bernardo Quintana on its northwestern end to this ring road.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} seams <b>were</b> <b>worked.</b> They <b>are</b> {{shown in}} rough stratigraphical order thought not all seams are present throughout the coalfield. Those shown in bold <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> {{to the greatest}} extent: ...|$|R
5000|$|In the [...] "Jesús F. Contreras" [...] gallery there <b>are</b> art <b>works</b> by {{contemporary}} Mexican artists. These <b>were</b> rewarded <b>works</b> from the Young Encounter of Arts; in another gallery <b>is</b> the <b>work</b> of Enrique Guzmán Villagómez, a recognized artist whose <b>work</b> <b>is</b> expressionist in nature. In the Arts Library gallery, there <b>are</b> <b>works</b> by photographers {{from a variety}} of backgrounds and styles.|$|R
50|$|Sinking of the {{colliery}} commenced in {{the late}} 1840s with production commencing {{towards the end of}} 1850. The colliery was owned by Earl Fizwilliam, and <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> by Wakefield-based agents J. & J. Charlesworth & Company. Coal <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> from two seams, the 5 ft. seam <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> at a depth of 90 yards, the 9 ft. seam being found at 127 yards. These seams were connected by a shaft.|$|R
25|$|To her, life <b>is</b> <b>work,</b> work is life. She {{believes}} in women freedom {{but does not}} think marriage is a stumbling block on the way. She is religious and believes that Islam does not stand on the way for Muslim women to live a modern life. A very hospitable lady, Iffat Ara is {{near and dear to}} many in Mymensingh. She has mothered three children with utmost care and success. At her residence in Mymensingh town, she passes her time through writing, gardening and entertaining young authors and literary workers.|$|E
25|$|Becoming a GP in Spain {{involves}} studying {{medicine for}} 6 years, passing a competitive national exam called MIR (Medico Interno Residente) and undergoing a 4 years training program. The training program includes core specialties as general medicine and general practice (around 12 months each), pediatrics, gynecology, orthopedics and psychiatry. Shorter and optional placements in ENT, ophthalmology, ED, infectious diseases, rheumathology or others {{add up to}} the 4 years curriculum. The assessment <b>is</b> <b>work</b> based and involves completing a logbook that ensures all the expected skills, abilities and aptitudes have been acquired {{by the end of}} the training period.|$|E
25|$|A low {{temperature}} example <b>is</b> <b>work</b> by Kitagawa, et al. {{who used a}} two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration. The result {{was one of the}} first instances of a MOF showing “superprotonic” conductivity (8 x 10−3 S/cm) at 25°C and 98% relative humidity (RH). They later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even more. In this {{low temperature}} regime that is dependent on degree of hydration, it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels.|$|E
50|$|One {{metal that}} <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> <b>is</b> wrought iron, mostly for {{utilitarian}} items. In {{the communities of}} El Santuario and Mapethé, they made scrapers for maguey leaves, blades for plows, hoes and blades for scythes, knives, machetes and more. More iron <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> in Huasca de Ocampo and Molango.|$|R
50|$|They have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> very {{thoroughly}} and are evidence of highly developed technological skills {{and of a}} workmanlike tradition. Like in today’s tournament javelins, the greatest diameter and therefore its centre of gravity is in the front third of the shaft. The tips <b>are</b> <b>worked</b> symmetrically {{from the base of}} the stems, and the end of the tips <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> beside the medullary ray, the weakest part of the stem, on purpose.|$|R
50|$|Faccon SD666715Faccon was a {{very early}} {{colliery}} in Bentham. Coal outcropped by the River Greta and could <b>be</b> <b>worked</b> in shallow pits on Ingleton and Bentham Moors. The pits <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> by turntrees. The workings were levelled and landscaped in 1836.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{projects}} either in progress or in development for NY135. The one with active construction, however, <b>is</b> <b>work</b> by NYSDOT to repair segments of NY135, along with many other highways in Nassau and nearby Suffolk counties, that have concrete beginning to wear out. The project was projected to end in mid-2008, but the department has not updated their project site with the construction. In late 2006, development began on a project to construct a 100-parking space Park & Ride at the interchange of NY135 and NY25. Work on the project began in mid-2015 and was completed in mid-2016. Funds came from {{the federal government and the}} state of New York.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work <b>is</b> <b>work</b> and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors {{to feel as if}} they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim told me that the Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do <b>is</b> <b>work,</b> work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E

5000|$|Holbein stitch <b>is</b> usually <b>worked</b> on an even-weave fabric {{where the}} threads {{can be counted}} to ensure perfect {{regularity}} and <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> in two stages. Firstly, a row of evenly spaced running stitches <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> along the line to be covered. Then the return journey is completed, filling in the spaces between stitches made on the first journey and sharing the same holes: ...|$|R

500|$|Observers {{using the}} Warner and Swasey Observatory have made {{important}} contributions to astronomical research. [...] An early example <b>is</b> <b>work</b> {{carried out by}} the observatory's then director, Jason Nassau, on the classification of carbon stars and M-type stars in 1949; more recently, observations made using the Burrell Schmidt telescope led to the discovery of the galaxy Andromeda VIII in 2003. This galaxy orbits the more famous Andromeda Galaxy, and was previously undiscovered due to its position in front of the bright disk of the parent galaxy. [...] The Burrell Schmidt has also recently been used to image the intracluster light in the Virgo Supercluster. [...] The intracluster light is a thousand times fainter than the night sky, and was observed after combining seventy images of the cluster which were taken with the Burrell Schmidt telescope.|$|E
500|$|A {{second problem}} is the {{difficulty}} of comparisons across cultures. [...] "Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature." [...] In-depth surveys {{may be the only}} way to get necessary information desired, but they make it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. [...] "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor <b>is</b> <b>work,</b> existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres. 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that 'every mother is a working mother.' There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment." ...|$|E
500|$|Domestic work is {{maintenance}} of the home, and is usually universally recognizable, e.g. doing the laundry. Care work is looking [...] "after a relative or friend who needs support because of age, physical or learning disability, or illness, including mental illness;" [...] this also includes raising children. Care work also involves [...] "close personal or emotional interaction." [...] Also included in this category is [...] "self-care," [...] in which leisure time and activities are included. Subsistence work <b>is</b> <b>work</b> done {{in order to meet}} basic needs, such as collecting water, but does not have market values assigned to it. Although some of these efforts [...] "are categorized as productive activities according to the latest revision of the international System of National Accounts (SNA) ... are poorly measured by most surveys." [...] Unpaid market work is [...] "the direct contributions of unpaid family members to market work that officially belongs to another member of the household." [...] Voluntary work is usually work done for non-household members, but in return for little to no remuneration.|$|E
50|$|This list is {{most likely}} incomplete. All <b>works</b> listed <b>are</b> {{composed}} or arranged for brass band unless otherwise stated.Included <b>are</b> <b>works</b> by the pseudonymous Carlile Vernon. These <b>works</b> <b>are</b> indicated and {{are believed to be}} composed by Charles Trussell, but it has also been suggested they <b>are</b> <b>works</b> by Welsh composer William Carlile Bawden (b.1857, d.1925).|$|R
50|$|Wrought {{iron and}} tin <b>are</b> <b>worked</b> in San Cristobal de las Casas. Iron <b>is</b> <b>worked</b> mostly for making plows and other {{agricultural}} implements, but other {{items such as}} decorative elements for buildings such as balconies and railings are also produced. These accoutrements are mainly in colonial style, and the neighborhood most noted for this <b>work</b> <b>is</b> El Cerillo.|$|R

500|$|Most {{commentators}} blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; {{one analyst}} {{stated that the}} company's troubles were more [...] "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO Paul Eibeler to be the [...] "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to [...] "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" [...] as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and Todd Howard, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from Joystiq complained of the vagueness of the updates: [...] "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There <b>is</b> <b>work</b> that {{still needs to be}} done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working....While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game." ...|$|E

50|$|From late July 2004, Dublin-Rosslare {{services}} have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> exclusively by diesel railcars. Initially the railcars used {{were drawn from}} the 2700 Class fleet, but these were replaced within a year. At present, most services <b>are</b> <b>worked</b> by the 22000 Class, {{of which there are}} four carriage sets, with the 29000 Class working some services. These however, will be replaced by the 22000 Class DMU's by 2020. Prior to July 2004, services <b>were</b> <b>worked</b> by sets of Mark 2D carriages hauled by 071 class locomotives.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not clear}} exactly when the quarry ceased to <b>be</b> <b>worked.</b> Kellow states that it <b>was</b> <b>worked</b> from the bottom upwards for 33 years, which he says was the whole time that it <b>was</b> <b>worked,</b> and that {{production}} ceased mid way through World War I, as {{there was no longer}} a market for the slate products which it produced. The details in his autobiography were dictated from memory around 1941, by which time he was almost blind. Richards states that the quarry closed in 1920.|$|R
