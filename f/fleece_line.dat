5000|$|Although most of Brooks Brothers' {{clothing}} is imported, {{many of the}} firm's suits, sport coats, shirts, and some accessories are manufactured in the United States. Many of its mid-range [...] "1818" [...] line of suits are manufactured at Brooks Brothers' Southwick plant in Haverhill, Massachusetts. All Brooks Brothers necktie silk is woven in England or Italy, and the ties still are [...] "cut and piled" [...] at the Brooks Brothers' tie factory in Long Island City, New York; many of its shirts are manufactured at its shirt factory in Garland, North Carolina. Brooks also has a series of books on etiquette and manners for ladies and gentlemen. Its higher-end label is the Golden <b>Fleece</b> <b>line</b> which features suits that are tailored in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Merino sheep {{infested with}} lice (Bovicola ovis) and with 8 months 2 ̆ 7 wool were hand jetted with a {{commercial}} spinosad formulation or treated with an α-cypermethrin backline product {{to examine the}} effect of long wool treatment on lice numbers and wool damage, relative to untreated controls. Mean lice numbers were reduced significantly (P < 0. 05) by treatment and then remained relatively constant until shearing 20 weeks later. Treatment with either product resulted in significant improvements in mean clean and greasy wool cut, yield, staple length, both visually assessed and measured colour, and the proportion of fleeces classed into the main <b>fleece</b> <b>line.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the two treatments in either efficacy in reducing louse numbers or on production characters. Wool rub score and cotting assessed on the sheep increased slightly after treatment and then did not change until shearing whereas both scores increased significantly in the untreated group. There was a strong relationship between the visual rub score and the loss of wool at shearing, indicating that rub score can be a good predictor of lice-induced reduction in fleece weights...|$|E

5000|$|Cold Climate Jacket - <b>Fleece</b> <b>lined</b> {{often used}} in cold climates, or worn during {{overnight}} firefighting shifts if cold.|$|R
5000|$|The uniform {{consists}} of a bottle green v-neck jumper worn over a white open necked girls' blouse, with a calf-length green check skirt (green trousers are also an option) and a green rain-coat with a <b>fleece</b> <b>lining</b> bearing the schools crest. Shoes must be flat-soled and black.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} [...] "patrol uniform" [...] {{consisted of}} a grey-brown denim jacket for officers and chiefs while a grey all weather smock coat was worn by enlisted personnel. Some of the original U-boat uniforms had been issued from British stocks abandoned at Dunkirk. [...] U-boat personnel were also issued a variety of weather clothing to include <b>fleece</b> <b>lined</b> footwear and all weather over-trousers of brown or grey leather. After the war, information came to light that the U-boat crews had also been issued a special brand of hair yarn socks which had been made from the shaved hair of concentration camp inmates.|$|R
50|$|Horse tie-up collar. A collar {{designed}} to teach horses to tie up and to tie stallions at public events. It is constructed from double-stitched wide leather (sometimes <b>fleece</b> <b>lined),</b> with heavy duty dees sewn into each end. The collar is placed on a horse just behind the poll strap of a headcollar (headstall) which is used in conjunction, and a strong rope passes through the headcollar to secure the two dees so that the horse's wind is not impaired in any way. This manner of application will {{reduce the likelihood of}} the collar slipping and injuring or choking the horse. Sometimes used for tethering horses, they are expensive and are potentially dangerous if the horse should become entangled in the tether or frightened etc.|$|R
60|$|An old farmer has {{assured me}} that he has also caught him tormenting his sheep, {{lighting}} on their backs and pulling the wool out by the roots to get <b>fleece</b> for <b>lining</b> his nest. This {{is a much more}} serious charge than that of pulling up corn, though the latter makes almost every farmer his enemy.|$|R
50|$|Slipper boots - {{slippers}} {{meant to}} look like boots. Often favoured by women, they are typically furry boots with a <b>fleece</b> or soft <b>lining,</b> and a soft rubber sole. Modelled after sheepskin boots, they may be worn outside.|$|R

In 2017 she was named one of Forbes 30 under 30.

30|$|Due {{to their}} {{positive}} characteristics, like strength increasing and film generating features, {{they are more}} and more used for various purposes as additives in the paper industry [12, 21, 22]. Currently, the application of nanocellulose [BNC, NFC, and CNC (cellulose nanocrystals)] in paper conservation is increasing quickly, and approaches vary considerably. Santos et al. used BNC sheets prepared as <b>fleeces</b> for <b>lining</b> or reinforcing papers [23, 24]. A novel type of mending paper of BNC fibres and Japanese fibres was developed by Segers et al. [25]. Because of the special surface characteristics, it is well-suited for transparent or coated papers, as well as parchment, and can be used to stabilize or to fill losses [25].|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, some car coats were being {{designed}} in nylon, {{a report from}} the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede car coat with brushed <b>fleece</b> nylon <b>lining</b> as: [...] "one of the good possibilities" [...] of the technology. Real leathers remained popular - showerproof suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh. Another new motoring design was the roebuck suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: [...] "A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed." ...|$|R
