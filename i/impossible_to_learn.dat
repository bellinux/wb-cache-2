Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and {{made it sound like}} only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E

The committee chooses between pairs of alternatives drawn from X by a simple majority vote. The committee’s choices induce a preference relation on X.

We prove that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> precisely <b>learn</b> the preference relation of a committee before seeing all its choices, even if a teacher guides the learner through the learning process.

40|$|This project {{revolves}} around the concepts motivation and learning, {{in terms of the}} grading process in secondary schools in Denmark. The project seeks to investigate how dependent the two concepts are to each other in relation <b>to</b> students <b>learning.</b> Furthermore, the project aims to explore the importance of grades in secondary schools. The method of the project is a combination of a focus group interview and observations, in which the interview is the primary focus. The project will also apply a number of different theories and terms within the concepts motivation, learning and argumentation. These theories and terms enable an analysis of the empirical data obtained from the focus group interview and observations. All in which contribute to answer the research question of the project.

50|$|The nativist theory, {{proposed}} by Noam Chomsky, argues that {{language is a}} unique human accomplishment. Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD {{is an area of}} the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to construct novel sentences using learned vocabulary. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that what children hear—their linguistic input—is insufficient to explain how they come <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> language. He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is <b>impossible</b> for children <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> linguistic information solely from their environment. However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> language despite incomplete information from their environment. This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Finding similar e-learners in a {{distributed}} {{and open}} e- learning environment {{and help them}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> collaboratively is {{becoming one of the}} urgent challenges of personalized e-learning services. Literature shows that current e-learner community building approaches are generated from qualitative studies of small-sized learner-centered classrooms which may need the teacher's participation. However, the findings might not apply to large classes in distributed learning environments, which make the teachers to face hundreds of e-learners in each class. In such situations, teachers also find it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> analyze the <b>learning</b> behaviors of each e-learner and divide them into different learning communities accurately. This paper addresses this problem in the adaptive e-learner community self-organizing point of view. Considering both the feature vector of learning resources and a learner's rating value on each resource, this paper firstly defines the learning interest feature vector to model the learner's behavior. Based on this an accurate learning interest feature representation method and, an innovative e-learner community self-organizing algorithm, called IFV- SORC, are proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that this algorithm exhibits good community organizing efficiency and scalability...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{availability of}} data {{in recent years}} has led several authors to ask whether it is possible to use data as a computational resource. That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required <b>to</b> perform the <b>learning</b> task? We give the first positive answer to this question for a natural supervised learning problem — we consider agnostic PAC learning of halfspaces over 3 -sparse vec-tors in {− 1, 1, 0 }n. This class is inefficiently learnable using O (n/ 2) examples. Our main contribution is a novel, non-cryptographic, methodology for establish-ing computational-statistical gaps, which allows us to show that, under a widely believed assumption that refuting random 3 CNF formulas is hard, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> efficiently <b>learn</b> this class using only O n/ 2 examples. We further show that under stronger hardness assumptions, even O n 1. 499 / 2 examples do not suf-fice. On the other hand, we show a new algorithm that learns this class efficiently using Ω̃ n 2 / 2 examples. This formally establishes the tradeoff between sample and computational complexity for a natural supervised learning problem. ...|$|R
