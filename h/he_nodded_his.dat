2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head again, evincing {{even greater}} {{satisfaction}} than before.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head gloomily, {{and seemed}} pondering a serious question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I {{see what}} the {{mischief}} is," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head. [...] "Those little rascals, the boys,--they have stolen our stones to build a wharf with!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Florist: [...] "Dropic? With icepergs on the wintows?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> {{head toward}} the frosty panes, and wraps a sheet of {{tissue-paper}} around the cotton and the flowers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] {{says the}} Policeman {{tramping}} the pavement {{in front of}} the Great Eastern, and <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> head pleasantly to show that he is the representative of Law and Peace and that the city of Calcutta is safe from itself for the present.|$|R
60|$|Poirot {{seemed to}} follow my thoughts. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head gravely.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>his</b> {{dark eyes}} fixed upon her face but {{displaying}} no expression.|$|E
60|$|And Porportuk’s eyes watered as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> {{head and}} smacked his lips.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent {{females of}} getting {{away at the}} first approach, the male {{approaches}} the female during mating season very cautiously. <b>He</b> <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> head constantly to make its peaceful intentions cognizable. After mating it takes six months before two to five young are born.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> over <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} at Zack, {{and walked away}} quickly {{in the direction of}} Kirk Street.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{go along}} the passage for a bit," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> {{head on his}} {{shoulder}} at the door, [...] "until you come to a spiral staircase; and on the second landing is a door covered with green baize. Go through that, and down the long corridor to the end, and the Red Room is on your left up the steps." ...|$|R
60|$|The eyes {{of every}} one were bent upon the Duke. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head slowly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head, with {{a sullen}} frown, {{and took his}} pipe {{out of his pocket}} again.|$|E
60|$|Captain Truck {{looked hard}} at the speaker, {{and when he had}} done, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head in approbation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, heard," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head knowingly; [...] "but {{you have}} seen nothing strange; your eyes are not good enough yet." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{pressing}} <b>his</b> palms together. The train jolted through Vauxhall points, and {{was welcomed}} with the clang of empty milk-cans for the West.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Lucy," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> {{head up and}} down, as he coiled up his string again, [...] "what do {{you think}} I mean to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Deacon {{could not}} speak. His throat lumped and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> {{head as he}} reached for the cards.|$|E
60|$|Words {{seemed to}} fail the plasterer. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head {{a great many}} times and spat upon the floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head at me {{with the}} most {{complete}} bright confidence, quite sure {{now that he had}} settled his case perfectly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{and resumed}} <b>his</b> chair. His {{unexpected}} politeness gave her courage.|$|R
6000|$|Winsome chuckled. It was a soft, gentle chuckle. [...] "Yes," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head, [...] "we are. You {{can trust}} that little busybody {{to know what}} she is talking about, every time. I {{sometimes}} think she knows more about other people's affairs than about her own. Welcome and I may not look much alike, but we are cousins just the same. Don't you think Welcome is looking unusually fine this spring?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} brother--I saw your brother," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head, as Archer lagged past him, {{trailing}} his spade, and scowling {{at the old}} gentleman in spectacles.|$|R
60|$|Ernestine obeyed. To all {{appearance}} {{the man was}} {{engrossed in}} his own work, but when she paused <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head appreciatively.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head {{towards the}} German tutor, {{who had come}} into view across the lawn, talking profoundly with Mr. Britling's eldest son.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Who do {{you think}} we’ve ’ad ’ere, sir?’ he began breathlessly, as the chaise drove off. ‘Red Breasts’; and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head portentously.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Lucy," [...] <b>he</b> began, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head up {{and down}} with great significance, as he coiled up his string again, [...] "what do you think I mean to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father, but <b>he</b> {{laughed and}} <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] <b>he</b> cackled, <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head childishly. [...] "Stick with it. Don't ever let'm know. You're a good one. I take my hat off to you, Standing. You never squealed." ...|$|R
60|$|She glanced {{towards the}} doctor. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head slightly. Then {{she went up}} {{to her husband and}} laid her hand upon his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|For reply <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head. The scorn of her voice, {{in a sort}} of baleful hiss, sounded--and felt--like the lash of a whip.|$|E
6000|$|To {{my great}} surprise, the doctor {{appeared}} very much affected. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> little bob-wigged head at us, and said repeatedly, ‘All right, Johnny—me comprong.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> vehemently <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> approval; {{his color}} rose, and his {{blinking}} eyes brightened in malicious triumph. [...] "She shan't have a farthing," [...] {{he said to}} himself, in a whisper--"she shan't have a farthing!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> sadly, with <b>his</b> {{eyes on the}} ground. Almayer {{looked at}} him with growing indignation.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> twice, with <b>his</b> {{eyes on the}} fire, {{as though}} that was a formal statement.|$|R
