For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) utilizes an [...] "entity's business model for managing the financial assets" [...] as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its financial instruments accounting standard, IFRS 9.

In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and 48 reported net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition of their <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and liabilities. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement.

50|$|In {{the long}} run, {{income before tax}} and taxable income will likely be more similar {{than they are in}} any given period. If the one is less in earlier years, then it will be greater in later years. <b>Deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> will reverse {{themselves}} in the long run and in total will zero out, unless there is something like a change in tax rates in the intervening period. A deferred tax payable results from a tax break in the early years and will reverse itself in later years; a deferred tax receivable results from more taxes being paid in early years than the tax expense reported to shareholders and will again reverse itself in later years. The deferred tax amount is computed by estimating the amount and the timing of the reversal and multiplying that by the appropriate tax rates.|$|E
50|$|Net {{operating}} profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) refers to after-tax EBIT adjusted for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> or NOPAT + net increase in deferred taxes.It represents the profits generated from a company's core operations after subtracting the income taxes {{related to the}} core operations and adding back in taxes {{that the company had}} overpaid during the accounting period. It excludes income from non-operating assets or financing such as interest and includes only profits generated by invested capital. NOPLAT is the profit available to all equity stake holders including providers of debt, equity, other financing and to shareholders. NOPLAT is distinguished from net income which is the profit available to equity holders only. NOPLAT is often used as an input in creating discounted cash flow valuation models. (Aditya deo) It is used in preference to Net Income as it removes the effects of capital structure (debt vs. equity).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the signalling function of accounting and financial information by investigating the information content of the adoption of a certain accounting practice, namely the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in the financial statements. Specifically, we examine whether (1) the decision to recognise a certain accounting practice, and (2) the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling devices. The new accounting law on <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> (Royal Decree of December 30, 1991) requires all Belgian firms to recognise <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> for all grants on the balance sheet as of 30 / 12 / 91. The results show that the recognition and the timing of the recognition supplement one another as signalling tools. The immediate recognition of positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> signals good news: firms that report positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> typically perform better at the time of adoption and in the near future thereafter. Within the class of recognisers, early recognisers perform better than late recognisers. However, this second signal, the timing of the recognition is only used as a second signal for the class of tax-paying firms. Our findings also indicate that the impact on the balance sheet is a significant determinant of the decision to report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Firms where the adoption of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> would lead to a high increase in the debt/equity ratio are less likely to adopt, or, if they do report <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> do so later. These results suggest that firms decide not to recognise positive <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> in order to limit the decrease in their solvency position. Indeed, firms that have already experienced a decline in their solvency position are more likely to postpone the recognition of <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes.</b> Accounting; Law; Solvency;...|$|E

30|$|In this context, ETR {{represents}} {{the relationship between}} overall tax expense, including <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> and pre-tax earnings of the year. Thus, by taking into account provisions for <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes</b> that were simultaneously set aside, this rate disregards any effects that shift current tax expenses or tax payables to later accounting periods. In contrast to this, CurrETR depicts only the current tax expenses excluding <b>deferred</b> <b>taxes,</b> and CashETR indicates the relative size of cash taxes paid (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). As in most cases of international double taxation the German tax system imposes the exemption method by following the worldwide approach to taxing foreign income, Germany-based multinationals can easily use the benefits of lower foreign tax rates (Spengel 2005). Consequently, profit shifting should not lead to excessively high deferred tax liabilities which could potentially bias tax rate measures.|$|E
