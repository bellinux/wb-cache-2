40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of 7 -nitroinidazole (7 -NI), selective inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase, on anxiety and memory of chronically immobilized rats. Methods: We used Wistar albino strain mature male rats. Animals were divided into three groups: 1) Control group: The rats without any intervention, injection or immobilization. 2) Peanut oil+chronic immobilization group: The group was exposed to 30 minutes daily immobilization stress for 15 days and 0. 5 ml peanut oil was administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) 30 minutes <b>before</b> <b>immobilization.</b> 3) 7 -NI+Chronic immobilization group: The group was exposed to 30 minutes daily immobilization stress for 15 days and was given 30 mg/kg 7 -NI, i. p. 30 minutes <b>before</b> <b>immobilization.</b> Open field, holeboard and Morris water maze tests were applied to all three groups. Results were analyzed by one way ANOVA-Tukey HSD test and Student’s t-test. Results: In holeboard test, the peanut oil+chronic immobilization group, showed {{a significant increase in}} the immobilization time, and a decrease in the number of rears and the squares crossed when compared with the control group. Comparison between 7 -NI+chronic immobilization and peanut oil group did not yield any statistically significant result. In open field test, there was no significant difference among the groups. In Morris water maze test, the latency to find the platform was decreased in control and 7 -NI+chronic immobilization groups, whereas in peanut oil+chronic immobilization group no significant shortening was found.

However, little information is available on the potential bacterial colonisation of dental appliances returning from dental laboratories and their need for decontamination. This study investigated the extent and nature of microbial contamination of removable prosthodontic appliances produced at different dental laboratories and stored in two clinical teaching units (CTU 1 and CTU 2) of a dental hospital and school. Forty consecutive dental prosthodontic appliances that were being stored under varying conditions in the two clinical teaching units were selected for study; the appliances having been produced 'in-house' (hospital laboratory) or 'out-of-house' (external commercial laboratory). Two appliances, that were known to have undergone <b>decontamination</b> <b>before</b> storage, were used as controls. Swabs were taken according to a standard protocol and transferred to the microbiological laboratory with bacterial growth expressed as colony forming units (cfu) per cm(2). Microbial sampling yielded growth from 23 (58 %) of the 40 appliances studied (CTU 1, n = 22; CTU 2, n = 18), with 38 % of these having a high level of contamination (> 42, 000 cfu/cm(2)). The predominant bacteria isolated were Bacillus spp. (57 %), pseudomonads (22 %) and staphylococci (13 %). Fungi of the genus Candida were detected in 38 % of the samples.

30|$|The {{successful}} attachment of {{the enzyme}} to the membrane {{depends on the}} active groups existing on the membrane and the pore-size parameter. If the pores of the membrane have a small size, it would cause the limitation in the diffusion capability and rearrangement of enzymes structure {{which resulted in the}} reduction of enzyme activity. On the contrary, the very large pore sizes would minimize the interaction between the enzymes and their solid support which resulted in an enzyme leaching out phenomenon. The surface area and the membrane's porosity parameter were determined by Brunauer, Emmet, and Teller (BET) method. The detected BET surface areas for each membrane (PES- 10, PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 <b>before</b> <b>immobilization,</b> and PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 after immobilization) were as 3, 12, and 43  m 2 /g, respectively. The membranes were selected to check the effect of additives and amination process toward the membrane's properties. Moreover, according to the previous report, PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 has a high enzyme loading value (Handayani et al. 2012). Based on the results, it can be inferred that the amount of monolayer adsorbed gas onto PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 membrane after immobilization was the largest. Therefore, by immobilization of enzyme, the ability of adsorbent to capture the adsorbate and form a chemical interaction becomes greater. Porosity parameter of PES and PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 membranes <b>before</b> <b>immobilization</b> was difficult to be detected due to the small value of BET surface area. The total pore volume of PESNH_ 2 - 10 D 2 P 5 after immobilization was 0.12  cm^ 3 /g and the diameter was in a range of 3 – 20  nm. The range of pores diameter indicates that the membrane was categorized as mesoporous membrane.|$|R

Coleman Research and its subcontractors, Thermedics Detection, Inc. (TD) and the University of Idaho (UI) are {{in the second phase}} of a three phase program to develop 3 D-ICAS to support Decontamination and Decommissioning (D&D) operations. Accurate physical characterization of surfaces and the radioactive and organic is a critical D&D task. Surface characterization includes identification of potentially dangerous inorganic materials, such as asbestos and transite. Real-time remotely operable characterization instrumentation will significantly advance the analysis capabilities beyond those currently employed. Chemical analysis is a primary area where the characterization process will be improved. Chemical analysis plays a vital role throughout the process of <b>decontamination.</b> <b>Before</b> clean-up operations can begin the site must be characterized with respect to the type and concentration of contaminants, and detailed site mapping must clarify areas of both high and low risk. During remediation activities chemical analysis provides a means to measure progress and to adjust clean-up strategy. Once the clean-up process has been completed the results of chemical analysis will verify that the site is in compliance with federal and local regulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} {{response in}} the parasitic fungus Monacrosporium haptotylum and its nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans were analyzed during infection using cDNA microarrays. The array contained 2, 684 fungal and 372 worm gene reporters. Dramatic shifts occurred in the transcriptome of M. haptotylum during the different stages of the infection. An initial transcriptional response was recorded after 1 h of infection when the traps adhered to the cuticle, but <b>before</b> <b>immobilization</b> of the captured nematodes. Among the differentially expressed genes were two serine proteases (spr 1 and spr 2), and several homologues to genes known to be regulated in other pathogenic fungi. After 4 hours, when approximately 40 % of the nematodes were paralyzed, we identified an up-regulated cluster of 372 fungal genes which were not regulated during the other phases of the infection. This cohort contained a large proportion (79 %) of genes {{that appear to be}} specific for M. haptotylum and closely related species. These genes were of two different classes; those translating into presumably functional peptides and those with no apparent protein coding potential (noncoding RNAs). Among the infection-induced C. elegans genes were those encoding antimicrobial peptides, protease inhibitors and lectins...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{continuous}} fermentation of high-sugar fruit must (containing about 320 g/L of total sugars) on the viability and morphology of yeast cells. The process was carried out for 2. 5 months in a 4 -column bioreactor at 22 °C, using the Saccharomyces bayanus S. o. / 1 AD wine yeast strain, which was immobilized on cubes of white foam glass. During the time of continuous fermentation, the apple wine contained 11. 4 – 16. 8 % (by volume) of alcohol and a total sugar concentration of 49. 2 – 115. 4 g/L. Yeast cells isolated from the carrier {{at the end of}} continuous fermentation were bigger than the cells <b>before</b> <b>immobilization</b> and were characterized by various shapes, e. g. they were elongated, large and round or pear-shaped. Some cells were connected to other cells in the form of aggregates. Some yeast cells from the second, third and fourth columns showed a substantial number of wrinkles or folds. Moreover, it was observed that yeast from the carrier in the first column was characterized by the highest viability, 70 %. In the fourth column, the percentage of viable cells was only 11 %...|$|R
