500|$|The {{album was}} the Fall's first to include Karl Burns and Paul Hanley in the band's classic two-drummer lineup. Smith {{intended}} the album's lyrics [...] "to be like reading {{a really good}} book. You <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> beers, sit down and immerse yourself. None of those fuckers Elvis Costello or Spandau Ballet did that". Hex Enduction Hour was written during an unusually prolific period in his career. Many of the tracks had already been dropped from the band's live set {{by the time they}} visited Australia and New Zealand in the autumn of 1982. The earlier single [...] "Look, Know" [...] was recorded during the Icelandic sessions but not included on the album. This was characteristic of Smith's [...] "never look back" [...] approach.|$|E
500|$|When {{recording}} Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, Alexander {{stated that}} he [...] "completely ripped up the rules that applied to [...] first two records." [...] While the album was credited to the New Radicals, it is often {{considered to be a}} Gregg Alexander album, as he wrote and produced most of its songs, played several instruments on it, and is the only constant member of the band. In reference to the wide variety of musicians he recruited to record the album, Alexander stated, [...] "Most of that record was me pulling favors with studios or musicians that had played on earlier records and were like, 'Oh, Gregg's down on his luck — let's go play on his demo for the hell of it, we'll have a good laugh, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> beers and maybe smoke a jay or whatever.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> swigs of water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|E

500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: [...] "Don't you think that something is terribly wrong when it {{has gone so far}} that we have a Christian [...] "death metal" [...] band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?" [...] Euronymous replied to this: [...] "It's bad enough to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don't worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time." [...] However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor's session drummer on their latest two releases.|$|E
500|$|The game's central story {{theme is}} the [...] "pursuit of the almighty dollar". Missions {{follow the lead}} characters' efforts to plan and execute {{complicated}} heists to accrue wealth for themselves. The team focused on money as the central theme {{in response to the}} 2007–08 financial crisis, as its effects turn the main characters back to a life of crime. [...] "We wanted this post-crash feeling, because it works thematically in this game about bank robbers", Houser explained. The positive reaction to Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] missionin which an elaborate heist is coordinated and executed by lead protagonist Niko Bellic and accomplicesencouraged the team to develop the story around the heists. Houser said that while [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] was well-received, the team had not captured the thrill of the robbery to their best abilities and wanted Grand Theft Auto V to achieve it. He explained, [...] "We wanted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> really strong bank robberies...It felt like that was a good device that we'd never used in the past. Repeating ourselves is a fear when we're doing games where part of the evolution is just technological".|$|E

I was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough.

Finishing the Hat was published in October 2010. According to a New York Times review, [...] "The lyrics under consideration here, written during a 27-year period, aren't presented as fixed and sacred paradigms, carefully removed from tissue paper for our reverent inspection. They're living, evolving, flawed organisms, still being shaped and poked and talked to {{by the man who}} created them".
