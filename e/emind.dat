This is aimed at providing a consistent, regulated and educationally focussed incorporation of technology throughout the phases of primary and secondary education. In the Junior and Senior Secondary Schools this {{takes the form of a}} 1 to 1 laptop scheme called <b>eMind.</b> In the Primary School the focus is on providing a high availability of ICTs with a significant use of interactive whiteboard technologies.|$|E

Energy {{and pitch}} angle {{resolved}} measurements of highly energetic (megaelectronvolt range) suprathermal ions {{ejected from the}} plasma through interaction with fishbone oscillations are presented. The measurements are obtained with a 2 -D scintillator probe diagnostic installed on JET, {{which is designed to}} detect lost ions only above a certain energy threshold (<b>Emin,D</b> ∼ 200 keV). In the case reported here the lost ions are identified as fast protons which had been accelerated to high energies by ICRF minority heating. The energy of the lost protons (∼ 0. 5 - 4 MeV) is approximately one order of magnitude higher than the energy of the injected beam ions (max. 130 keV) driving the fishbone. Losses arriving at the probe are enhanced by about a factor 10 - 20 with respect to MHD-quiescent levels, and are found to increase quadratically with the fishbone amplitude. Using a number of simplifying assumptions, numerical simulations have been performed which combine the HAGIS, MISHKA and SELFO codes (where the distribution function predicted by SELFO has been validated against NPA measurements). The losses are found to originate from orbit stochastic diffusion of trapped protons near the plasma boundary or from counter-passing proton...|$|E
