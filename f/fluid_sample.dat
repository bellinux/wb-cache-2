Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto.

25|$|On 17 July Hullett {{wrote out}} a cheque for Adams for £1,000 – {{to pay for}} an MG car her husband had promised to buy him. Adams paid the cheque into his account the next day, and on being told that it would clear by the 21st, asked for it to be {{specially}} cleared – to arrive in his account the next day. On 19 July Hullett is thought to have taken an overdose and was found the next morning in a coma. Adams was unavailable and a colleague, Dr Harris, attended her until Adams arrived later in the day. Not once during their discussion did Adams mention her depression or her barbiturate medication. They decided a cerebral haemorrhage was most likely. On 21 July Dr Shera, a pathologist, was called in to take a spinal <b>fluid</b> <b>sample</b> and immediately asked if her stomach contents should be examined in case of narcotic poisoning. Adams and Harris both opposed this. After Shera left, Adams visited a colleague at the Princess Alice Hospital in Eastbourne and asked about the treatment for barbiturate poisoning. He was told to give doses of 10cc of Megimide every five minutes, and was given 100cc to use. The recommended dose in the instructions was 100cc to 200cc. Dr Cook also told him to put Hullett on an intravenous drip. Adams did not.|$|E
40|$|Alveolar macrophages from Pneumocystis carinii-infected rats are {{defective}} in phagocytosis. To {{investigate whether}} this defect {{is due to}} a certain factor present in P. carinii-infected lungs, alveolar macrophages from uninfected rats were incubated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from P. carinii-infected rats. Alveolar macrophages treated with these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> became defective in phagocytosis but remained normal when treated with BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from noninfected or Toxoplasma gondii-infected rats. The suppressive activity of the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from P. carinii-infected rats on phagocytosis was retained when the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> were passed through a filter with a pore size of 0. 45 μm but was lost when the BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> were digested with proteases such as trypsin, pepsin, papain, or endopeptidase Gly-C. Lipid fractions of these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> had no suppressive activity on phagocytosis. The suppressive activity of these BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> was also lost when they were incubated with concanavalin A-agarose beads, suggesting that the inhibitor is a glycoprotein. The inhibitor was estimated to be larger than 100, 000 Da by exclusion filtration. After binding to the concanavalin A-agarose beads, the inhibitor in BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> and P. carinii lysate could be eluted with 200 mM methylmannose. Treatment of both the crude BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> and P. carinii lysate and the 200 mM methylmannose eluate with antibody against the major surface glycoprotein of P. carinii eliminated their suppressive activity. These results suggest that the factor capable of suppressing the phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages is P. carinii major surface glycoprotein or one or more of its derivatives...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the transfer of}} fentanyl across the early human placenta, we have collected samples of maternal blood and fetal fluids and/or blood, simultaneously, between 5 and 22 min following an intravenous bolus of fentanyl (1. 5 mg/kg) to the mother. The pregnancies were between 6 and 16 weeks of gestation and scheduled for elective termination of pregnancy under general anaesthesia. Total fentanyl concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay in 11 pairs of first trimester maternal serum and fetal coelomic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> 14 pairs of maternal serum and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> seven series of first trimester maternal serum and coelomic and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> and 10 series of early second trimester maternal and fetal sera and amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples.</b> Fentanyl was not detected in coelomic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> at any gestational age and in amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> collected after 12 weeks of gestation. Measurable concentrations of fentanyl were found in maternal serum collected within 15 min after the initial bolus and in fetal serum collected between 10 and 12 min later. These findings indicate that fentanyl is transferred across the early placenta into the amniotic cavity and fetal blood circulation but not into the exocoelomic cavity. The distribution of this molecule inside the early gestational sac is probably influenced by the increased binding by maternal and fetal sera, its short half-life of distribution and the specific biology of the fetal fluid formation and composition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{bronchoalveolar lavage}} (BAL) cytology and organism burden {{in patients with}} Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) who were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in those with other immunodeficiencies. STUDY DESIGN: BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> from patients with PCP were selected (HIV-infected patients, n= 3 D 15; patients with other immunodeficiencies, n= 3 D 11). May-Gr-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparations were evaluated. Foamy alveolar casts (FACs) and P carinii clusters were counted. RESULTS: The numbers of FACs and P carinii clusters in BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> of HIV-infected patients were significantly higher as compared to those in samples from patients with other immunodeficiencies. Striking cytologic findings observed in half the samples from both patient groups included the presence of foamy alveolar macrophages, activated lymphocytes, plasma cells and reactive type II pneumocytes.

Specificity was tested in BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> of nonpneumococcal etiology (n = 41) and in samples with no respiratory pathogen and a total bacterial count of < 104 CFU/ml (n = 35). Using the ICT, pneumococcal antigen was detected in 29 (30. 2 %) BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples,</b> with a sensitivity of 95. 0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 90. 6 % to 99. 4 %) and a specificity of 86. 8 % (95 % CI, 80. 1 % to 93. 8 %). The ICT was easy to perform and revealed unequivocal and reproducible results. No interference was observed with high cell counts, red blood cells, or elevated protein levels. Four out of 10 false-positive readings occurred in samples with S. pneumoniae counts below the 104 CFU/ml threshold limit of pneumonia. In BAL <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> obtained after pneumococcal bacteremia, positive test results were found for up to 35 days after bacteremia.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a PRRSV-specific NA assay to determine NA titers in pig oral <b>fluid</b> <b>samples.</b> At first, we standardized the PRRSVNA assay using pen-based pig oral <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> collected over a period of 3 months from a herd of swine that received a PRRSVmodified live vaccine (PRRS-MLV), and we also used oral <b>fluid</b> and serum <b>samples</b> collected from individual boars that were vaccinated with PRRS-MLV or infected with a virulent PRRSV strain. Our results suggest that a PRRSVNA titer of> 8 in oral <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> is virus specific and can be detected beginning at 28 days after vaccination or infec-tion. To validate the assay, we used 104 pen-based pig oral fluid and five representative serum samples from each pen of un-known history, as well as 100 serum samples from repeatedly vaccinated sows and oral <b>fluid</b> <b>samples</b> of their respective litters belonging to four different swine-breeding farms.

The {{trend in}} subsea {{petroleum}} production systems in offshore field developments points towards integrated production and processing facilities at the seabed {{along with more}} extensive use of multiphase transportation technology. The SOFA (Subsea On-line multiphase <b>Fluid</b> <b>sampling</b> and Analysis) system designed by Christian Michelsen Research {{in cooperation with the}} University of Bergen is an autonomous metering station for permanent installation subsea.
