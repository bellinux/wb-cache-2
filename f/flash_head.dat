25|$|If direct flash must be used, a {{good rule}} of thumb is to {{separate}} the flash from the lens by 1/20 of the distance of the camera to the subject. For example, if the subject is 2 meters (6feet) away, the <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> should be at least 10cm (4inches) away from the lens.|$|E
60|$|Once {{before in}} his life The Maltese Cat had heard that very same stroke played off his own back, and had profited by the {{confusion}} it wrought. This time he acted on experience, and leaving Bamboo to guard the goal in case of accidents, came through the others like a <b>flash,</b> <b>head</b> and tail low--Lutyens standing up to ease him--swept on and on before the other side knew what was the matter, and nearly pitched on his head between the Archangels' goal-post as Lutyens kicked the ball in after a straight scurry of {{a hundred and fifty}} yards. If there was one thing more than another upon which The Maltese Cat prided himself, it was on this quick, streaking kind of run half across the ground. He did not believe in taking balls round the field unless you were clearly overmatched. After this they gave the Archangels five-minuted football; and an expensive fast pony hates football because it rumples his temper. Who's Who showed himself even better than Polaris in this game. He did not permit any wriggling away, but bored joyfully into the scrimmage as if he had his nose in a feed-box and was looking for something nice. Little Shikast jumped on the ball the minute it got clear, and every time an Archangel pony followed it, he found Shikast standing over it, asking what was the matter.|$|E

50|$|The Rollei Strobomatic E66 costing 548 DM was {{the first}} {{electronic}} flash on the market, but not for long. The Strobofix, a similar model without a brightness control, sold for 357 DM. Rollei subsequently released many more variants. In 1968, Rollei introduced flash units for studio photography; there were three models (E250, E1250 and E5000), each with a different <b>flash</b> <b>head.</b> A special feature of Rollei's studio flash units was a modeling light - a halogen lamp integrated into the <b>flash</b> <b>head.</b> This helped the photographer to adjust the lighting and select the most appropriate aperture.|$|E

50|$|Virtually {{all modern}} camera-mounted flash devices with zoomable <b>flash</b> <b>heads</b> also have either a {{built-in}} mechanical circular calculator (such {{as shown in}} the photo {{at the top of this}} article) or a digital display; both automatically show the effect zoom levels have on fstop and distance (guide number).|$|R
50|$|Until the 1960s, studio flash {{systems were}} large and cumbersome, {{requiring}} bulky power generators {{to power the}} <b>flash</b> <b>heads,</b> connected by large cables. In 1963, Bowens invented the first electronic studio flash unit with its power source built into it. This became known as a monobloc (sometimes Monolite) which is now an industry standard tool.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> can swivel up (to 90°), right (to 90°) {{and left}} (to 180°). The swivel {{properties}} allow the photographer to bounce the flash off walls, ceilings, and other objects, diffusing {{the light that}} hits the subject and reducing the harsh shadows associated with on-camera flash.|$|E

50|$|Later, after Playboy {{abandoned}} {{film and}} moved to digital cameras, Freytag continued to create images using up to fifty <b>flash</b> <b>heads,</b> each light meticulously placed and targeted to illuminate a small area of the photo. Freytag likens his technique {{to that of a}} painter, using each light as his brush strokes, selectively illuminating each area as he incrementally builds the final image.|$|R
50|$|Individual signal heads may be set {{to flash}} a color to create a {{different}} signal aspect. Signals in the United States typically <b>flash</b> only one <b>head</b> at a time, while signals in Canada may <b>flash</b> two <b>heads</b> at a time; flashing lights are generally less restrictive than steady lights.|$|R
50|$|During {{his studies}} at Brooks, Freytag became {{proficient}} with the 4”x5” view camera, {{a skill that}} served him well shooting the monthly multi-page (gatefold) Playboy centerfold. Attempting to produce the very highest quality possible for the centerfold image, Playboy used the very large 8"x10” view camera. Due {{to the amount of}} strobe (electronic flash) light needed to expose that large a sheet of film, Freytag, at first of necessity and later by choice, specialized in the use of elaborate lighting setups, often using dozens of <b>flash</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|If direct flash must be used, a {{good rule}} of thumb is to {{separate}} the flash from the lens by 1/20 of the distance of the camera to the subject. For example, if the subject is 2 meters (6 feet) away, the <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> should be at least 10 cm (4 inches) away from the lens.|$|E

Vallow began dating Flash midfielder McCall Zerboni, left the Flash, and became an assistant coach of the Rochester Rhinos in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The Manifold rises at <b>Flash</b> <b>Head</b> {{just south}} of Buxton near Axe Edge, at the {{northern}} edge of the White Peak, known for its limestone beds. It continues for 12 mi before it joins the Dove. For part of its course, it runs underground (except when in spate), from Wetton Mill to Ilam. During this section it is joined by its major tributary, the River Hamps.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{the optics}} of <b>flash</b> <b>heads</b> are complex; each manufacture’s designs {{not only have}} {{illumination}} areas that are slightly different, but {{are the product of}} differing relative proportions of transmission, diffusion, reflection, and refraction amongst their optical elements (flash tube, reflector, Fresnel lens, and add-on wide-angle adapter). Accordingly, there is no universal formula for precisely calculating how guide numbers diminish from, for instance, a 105 mm setting to 50 mm or 35 mm settings. One may consult the users guide for a specific flash device to obtain guide numbers for different zoom settings.|$|R

There was a late modification to the RTF540 that changed its capability to include TLA functionality {{for use with}} later cameras, via the RTF540 TLA Adapter; this was the RTF540T and could be recognized {{by the addition of}} a symbol - the letter T in a circle - to the serial number plate beneath the <b>flash</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

On July 15, 2011, head coach Nick Nurse left the Energy and {{was hired by the}} Rio Grande Valley Vipers to be their new head coach. The Energy later named former Utah <b>Flash</b> <b>head</b> coach Kevin Young as the team's new head coach.|$|E

50|$|The HVL-RLAM and HVL-RL1 are {{ring-shaped}} LED continuous lights for {{use with}} video. To a limited extent {{they can also be}} used for macro photos of static objects, although a true macro flash is much preferred. The Sony flash system does not include a ring flash, but the Minolta R-1200 and 1200 AF ring flash heads can be used with the Minolta Macro Flash Controller MFC-1000 on Sony DSLRs as well, whereas the older Minolta Control Unit 1200 AF is not compatible with digital cameras. The MFC-1000 also accepts the Minolta Twin Flash T-2400 as well as the <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> of the Sony HVL-MT24AM twin flash, but not vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "red-eye effect" [...] {{is another}} problem with on camera and ring flash units. Since the retina of the human eye {{reflects}} red light straight back in the direction it came from, pictures taken from straight {{in front of a}} face often exhibit this effect. It can be somewhat reduced by using the [...] "red eye reduction" [...] found on many cameras (a pre-flash that makes the subject's irises contract). However, very good results can be obtained only with a flash unit that is separated from the camera, sufficiently far from the optical axis, or by using bounce flash, where the <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> is angled to bounce light off a wall, ceiling or reflector.|$|E
5000|$|All four Stroboflash models {{consisted}} of a power pack that connected to a separate <b>flash</b> <b>head</b> via a power cord and special plug and all used the same Stroboflash flash heads, which were light weight and had a satin reflector that produced very soft, non directional light. Professional photographers used Stroboflash II and IV electronic flashes extensively in the 50's through 80's because of the soft, well diffused light they produce. The Stroboflash electronic flash units are still considered flashes that produce excellent quality high power lighting, but the battery expense {{and the fact that}} the batteries only produce between 1,000 to 2,000 flashes (depending on the power level selected) {{and the fact that the}}se flash batteries were not rechargeable led to professionals replacing these flashes with other models that were powered by batteries that could be recharged.|$|E
