5|$|Ecstatic {{with her}} blessings, Satyavati gave birth {{the same day}} to her baby on {{an island in the}} Yamuna. The son {{immediately}} grew up as a youth and promised his mother that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> her aid every time she called on him; he then left to do penance in the forest. The son was called Krishna ("the dark one") due to his colour, or Dvaipayana ("one born on an island") and would later become known as Vyasa – compiler of the Vedas and author of the Puranas and the Mahabharata, fulfilling Parashara's prophecy. After this, Satyavati returned home to help her father.|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E
25|$|O'Brien {{used these}} conversations {{as the basis}} for a 2014 book 'Keating: The Interviews'.

25|$|Nothing is {{recorded}} about Pindar's {{wife and son}} except their names, Megacleia and Daiphantus. About ten days before he died, the goddess Persephone appeared to him and complained {{that she was the}} only divinity to whom he had never composed a hymn.

25|$|Hoveida {{would serve}} as {{minister}} of court within Jamshid Amouzegar's government in 1977. With this role, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> discover the pervasiveness of internal corruption, once concealed by Asadollah Alam and the team he had surrounded himself with. Nevertheless, he continued to tolerate the practice as well, while simultaneously remaining a trusted advisor to the Shah.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations between Scotland and England for a union {{were going}} on at this time.

25|$|In 1887, Nietzsche {{wrote the}} polemic On the Genealogy of Morality. During the same year, he {{encountered}} {{the work of}} Fyodor Dostoyevsky, to whom he felt an immediate kinship. He also exchanged letters with Hippolyte Taine and Georg Brandes. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to read Kierkegaard, to which Nietzsche replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Copenhagen and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen {{one of the first}} lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.|$|E
25|$|After 1840, Prešeren {{was left}} without any {{interlocutor}} who could appreciate his works, {{but continued to}} write poetry, although much less than in the 1830s. He gradually departed from the typical romantic trend, adopting an increasingly diverse and innovative style. In 1843, an important breakthrough for Prešeren happened: Janez Bleiweis started publishing a new daily journal in the Slovene language and invited Prešeren to participate in its cultural section. The two men came from rather different backgrounds: Bleiweis was a moderate conservative and staunch supporter of the ecclesiastical and imperial establishments and alien to the Romantic culture. He nevertheless established a fair relationship with the poet. Prešeren's participation in Bleiweis' editorial project was the closest <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> public recognition during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|As a {{fifth-generation}} Texan, Lair {{never lost}} his childhood accent. He was raised as an only child, although eventually <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> have two younger sisters, and {{he grew up}} poor, quiet, and shy. His imagination sparked by his reading, he dreamt of becoming a pilot. He was a seventeen-year-old freshman at Texas A when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Anxious to defend his nation, he applied for naval pilot's training, but was rejected because of substandard eyesight. He then convinced his mother to cosign his enlistment papers into the U.S. Army as a private. He saw his first combat in the invasion of Normandy. His armored unit fought its way across Europe for the next year. Lair's unit ended World War II on the Elbe River, facing a Russian unit on the far bank. It was there that Lair became convinced the American army should have continued the war, and defeated the communists.|$|E

25|$|The sudden {{increase}} in the reputation of Partizan team was not followed by {{increase in}} the organizational structure. After the defeat in the finals, club administration failed to operate on a higher level, and Partizan entered a long organizational crisis. All main players signed contracts with biggest Western clubs, and the promising generation was scattered. Milutin Šoškić went to 1. FC Köln, Milan Galić to Standard Liège, Vladica Kovačević to Nantes, Fahrudin Jusufi to Eintracht Frankfurt and Velibor Vasović, who had scored in the final, was transferred to Ajax where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> feature again in the European Cup. Thus followed a period of mediocre results, and for a decade not a single trophy was won. Few players remained from the previous generation, including Milan Damjanović, Blagoje Paunović and Borivoje Đorđević. In {{a short period of}} time, numerous managers were in position. The arrival of the talented young players Momčilo Vukotić, who came through Partizan's youth ranks, and Nenad Bjeković from Proleter Zrenjanin, announced better days for the Black & Whites.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, New York City {{voted to}} approve the {{beginning}} of construction of the Grand Central Parkway, which would connect from the Interborough Parkway to the Northern State at Lake Success. Construction of the project would begin in 1932 with paving and landscaping. Governor Roosevelt announced on July 22 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{the site where the}} Northern State and the Grand Central would eventually meet and lay a new cornerstone to mark the spot on July 26. The governor, who was touring throughout Nassau and Suffolk County, called the project a significant upgrade to provide the city with proper traffic outlets. Roosevelt laid mortar on the previously placed cornerstone, while Robert Moses announced that state aid would be requested. The day prior, the contract for grading of the new parkway from the city line to Lakeville Road along with construction of the Long Island Motor Parkway and Lakeville Road bridges was awarded. As Moses had warned, the LISPC requested over $5.5million in funds for the projects to be completed in 1932. All the land for it had been accepted to the commission, and a majority of the money went to paying for the Northern State Parkway.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Prus lent {{his support}} to many {{charitable}} and social causes. But {{there was one}} event <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> rue for the broad criticism it brought him: [...] his participation in welcoming Russia's tsar during Nicholas II's 1897 visit to Warsaw. [...] As a rule, Prus did not affiliate himself with political parties, as this might compromise his journalistic objectivity. [...] His associations, by design and temperament, were with individuals and select worthy causes rather than with large groups.|$|E

500|$|His {{success in}} the role was cut short by the news that Goldfaden, whose plays they were using without permission, was coming with his troupe to Odessa.

Rosenberg, never the most ethical of men, withdrew his troupe from Odessa to tour the hinterland. (Soon, though, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an accommodation by which his troupe would be an officially recognized touring company attached to Goldfaden's own troupe.)

500|$|Calvin and Servetus {{were first}} brought into contact in 1546 through a common acquaintance, Jean Frellon of Lyon; they {{exchanged}} letters debating doctrine; Calvin used a pseudonym as Charles d' Espeville; Servetus left his unsigned. Eventually, Calvin lost patience {{and refused to}} respond; by this time Servetus had written around thirty letters to Calvin. Calvin was particularly outraged when Servetus sent him {{a copy of the}} Institutes of the Christian Religion heavily annotated with arguments pointing to errors in the book. When Servetus mentioned that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Geneva, [...] "Espeville" [...] (Calvin) wrote a letter to Farel on 13 February 1546 noting that if Servetus were to come, he would not assure him safe conduct: [...] "for if he came, as far as my authority goes, I would not let him leave alive." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his party}} speeches, Raj had also reproached North Indian {{migrants}} on {{the celebration of}} Chhath Puja, a festival popular in Bihar, calling it a [...] "drama" [...] and a [...] "show of arrogance". He demanded that they must only celebrate Maharashtrian festivals. A petition was filed in the Patna civil court on 8 February against him for his remarks over Chhath Puja. His statements drew flak from leaders of Bihar, especially Indian Railways minister and former chief minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, who challenged that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Mumbai and perform Chhath Puja in front of Raj's house, also ridiculed Raj saying, [...] "He [...] is a child in politics". The Navnirman Sena leader accused migrants of swamping Maharashtra, India's most industrialised state, in search of jobs.|$|E
500|$|In 1911, Republicans were {{blocking}} {{the admission of}} Arizona to statehood, while planning to admit New Mexico.

[...] It was, however, also generally expected that Arizona would return two Democrats to the Senate, while New Mexico was expected to favor Republicans. [...] Owen filibustered the Senate for twelve hours until he had forced a Senate vote on the joint admission of both states. [...] During the course of his filibuster, a message was brought to him that, if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the President (Taft), a sincere effort would be made to reach an accommodation over Arizona.
