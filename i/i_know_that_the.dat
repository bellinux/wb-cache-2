Eighty actresses auditioned for the role, which {{was awarded to}} Murphy who had {{previously}} won two Tony Awards for her roles in the Broadway musicals Passion and The King and I. Murphy was such a favorite of Frakes and the producers that after auditioning, {{only a small number}} of other actresses were seen. She said of the role, [...] "I feel a great honor and responsibility to be a part of this film, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Star Trek audience has such a devotion to and affection for these richly drawn characters." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} New York Magazine, Victor Fresco, the show's creator, was asked why he thought the show didn't catch on. He responded, [...] "I think not enough people knew about it. It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of people watch it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it. And I don’t think we got either of that". Fresco also added, [...] "I still feel there’s an audience out there for it, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people who liked it, liked it a lot." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Chouhal qualified for the Games via a wildcard because his fastest time of 10.83 seconds, set at the Marsa Sports Complex on 2 June 2012, was 0.59 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 100 metres. Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, I go for it. I am not afraid. I am confident in my training and am careful not to get hurt. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds). Overall Chouhal finished 58th out of 75 athletes, but did not progress to the first round because he was 0.21 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his meat who advanced to the later stages.|$|E
500|$|Woodburne was {{initially}} against Susan developing the condition, {{but when she}} started researching it, she realised {{how much of a}} challenge the storyline would be and she changed her mind. The actress and the shows writers worked closely with the MS Society to make the storyline as realistic as possible and it was praised by both the society and viewers who have the condition. Jenna Litchfield of the MS Society said soap opera storylines in which characters are diagnosed with MS helped to highlight the condition and its effects. She added that the storyline had [...] "sparked interest." [...] Of the storyine, Woodburne stated [...] "It's a massive story and to take a character that has always been so strong and to challenge them physically and emotionally was terrific. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writing department did an enormous amount of research." [...] Woodburne also explained that as Susan is such a strong person mentally, she goes through an emotional struggle when her body lets her down. Woodburne commented that she found the scenes distressing to play as she is so attached to her character. She told a writer for Inside Soap that it was a difficult storyline, but [...] "ultimately rewarding". On screen, Susan learnt how to keep her symptoms under control and Woodburne said she would occasionally have a relapse, as the condition does not go away. In 2011, Woodburne commented on the MS storyline, which she enjoyed, saying it was very challenging to tell a good story and make it authentic and real for people who have the condition.|$|E
500|$|On December 9, 1993, the United States Congress {{began to}} hold {{hearings}} on video game {{violence and the}} marketing of violent video games to children. One of the games {{at the center of}} this controversy was the Sega CD's Night Trap, a full-motion video adventure game by Digital Pictures. Night Trap had been brought to the attention of United States Senator Joe Lieberman, who said of the game, [...] "I looked at that game, too, and there was a classic. It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of Dracula; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message." [...] Lieberman's research later went on to conclude that the average video game player at the time was between seven and twelve years old and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children. Similar issues were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that [...] "Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity.... Questions were even raised in the UK Parliament about its suitability. This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only served to reinforce that image." [...] Although experiencing increased sales as a result of the hearings, Sega decided to recall Night Trap and re-release it with revisions in 1994. Following these hearings, video game manufacturers came together in 1994 to establish a unified rating system, eventually materializing in the form of the Entertainment Software Rating Board used in North America.|$|E

[...] Obama argued that it was necessary to intervene because the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria [...] "risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemicals weapons" [...] and that it put U.S. regional allies that share a border with Syria in danger.

Ma Chao also contacted Yang Qiu, Li Kan (李堪), Cheng Yi (成宜), Hou Xuan (侯選), Cheng Yin (程銀), Zhang Heng (張橫), Liang Xing (梁興), Ma Wan (馬玩) and others, and they formed a 100,000 strong coalition army to attack Tong Pass (present-day Tongguan County, Shaanxi). Liu Zhang, the governor of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), wanted to marry his daughter to Ma Chao to build ties with Ma, but Wang Shang (王商), a commandery administrator under Liu Zhang, opposed the idea and said that Ma Chao was courageous but inhumane and untrustworthy.|$|E
