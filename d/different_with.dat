5|$|Preserved {{images of}} Szczerbiec from various {{points in time}} {{indicate}} that the decorative plates were several times dismounted and placed again on the hilt in variable configurations. The current composition, with the symbols of the Evangelists duplicated {{on each side of}} the hilt, matches that known from the earliest preserved depiction drafted by Johann Christoph Werner in 1794. It is possible, though, that the original placement of the golden plates was <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> the symbols of Saints John and Matthew on the obverse of the grip, so that each side of the hilt displayed the symbols of all four of the Evangelists.|$|E
5|$|The {{assimilation}} was not {{as strongly}} implemented in the German dominions of Swedish Pomerania, Bremen-Verden, and the Baltic dominions (Estonia and Livonia). In Germany, Charles found himself being opposed by the Estates there. He was also bound by {{the law of the}} German emperor and the peace treaty. In the Baltic, the power structure was completely <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> a German-descended nobility that used serfs, something that Charles abhorred and wanted to abolish but was unable to. Finally, Kexholm and Ingria were sparsely populated and not of great interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain {{some of the}} highest {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is no <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black colobus, who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E

5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very <b>different.</b> <b>With</b> the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.|$|E

T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the first}} half was {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second was no <b>different</b> <b>with</b> both Alabama and LSU only managing a pair of field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each offense to less than 300 yards of total offense with each having a pair of interceptions. With the loss, Alabama dropped to 4–8 all-time in overtime games and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–25–5.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very <b>different</b> <b>with</b> one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E

5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> the track having been pushed through flat swamp land that was punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is <b>different,</b> <b>with</b> the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the floor level of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
