40|$|Abstract. Herbrand <b>disjunctions</b> are a {{means for}} {{reducing}} the problem of whether a first-oder formula is valid in an open theory T or not to the problem whether an open formula, one of the so called Herbrand <b>disjunctions,</b> is T-valid or not. Nevertheless, the set of Herbrand <b>disjunctions,</b> which has to be examined, is undecidable in general. Fore this reason the practical value of Herbrand <b>disjunctions</b> has been estimated negatively (cf. [30]). Relying on completeness proofs {{which are based on}} the algebraization technique presented in [30], but taking a more optimistic view, we show how Herbrand <b>disjunctions</b> become the base of a method for building in theories into automatic theorem provers [26].

40|$|Abstract The present paper reviews {{advances}} {{in the study of}} two major intercontinental disjunct biogeographic patterns: (i) between Eurasian and western North American deserts with the Mediterranean climate (the Madrean– Tethyan disjunctions); and (ii) between the temperate regions of North and South America (the amphitropical <b>disjunctions).</b> Both disjunct patterns have multiple times of origin. The amphitropical <b>disjunctions</b> have largely resulted from long-distance dispersal, primarily from the Miocene to the Holocene, with available data indicating that most lineages dispersed from North to South America. Results of recent studies on the Mediterranean disjuncts between the deserts of Eurasia and western North America support the multiple modes of origin and are mostly consistent with hypotheses of long-distance dispersal and the North Atlantic migration. Axelrod’s Madrean–Tethyan hypothesis, which implies vicariance between the two regions in the early Tertiary, has been favored by a few studies. The Beringian migration corridor for semiarid taxa is also supported in some cases.

Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as <b>disjunction.</b> Boole kept the result as something undefined.
