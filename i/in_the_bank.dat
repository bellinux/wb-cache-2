At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the Money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his Money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his Money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would be out for a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E

Over the next few weeks, The Miz attempted to cash in his Money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>banking</b> {{industry}} <b>in</b> South Africa {{is facing}} three main challenges, namely: continuous change, foreign competition, and increasing levels of risk. These problems flow mainly from cultural diversity, globalisation, and rapid technological development in systems and communication. Decreasing predictability stems {{to a great}} extent from a lack of foreknowledge of how globalisation will develop, and how it can influence <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry in general and holistic risk management (HRM) in particular. Management of <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry therefore need to rely on crucial intelligence and foreknowledge concerning events, trends and development of (HRM) that affect the profitability and future strategic viability of the whole South African <b>banking</b> industry. At <b>the</b> onset various concepts and processes were emphasised in this study, namely operational risk management, strategic risk management, the risk management culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry, <b>the</b> role of risk management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry, <b>the</b> role of risk management process <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry, corporate governance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry <b>in</b> South Africa. However, the main {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the need and the dynamics of managing risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry <b>in</b> a holistic manner. To this end the development of, and trends in (HRM) as part of good corporate governance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry were researched and documented. The practical aspect of the study was firstly based on the definition and analysis of different categories of risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry. <b>The</b> definition and analysis was done in order to cover a broader range of risks <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry is facing. Secondly the risk management culture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry was investigated. Thirdly the role of risk management <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry was explored <b>in</b> detail. Fourthly <b>the</b> risk management process <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry was investigated and explained. Fifthly the link between risk management and corporate governance was explored. Sixthly models developed by Kloman (2000), Lam (2003) and Regester and Larkin (2005) were used as a benchmark to develop a framework for the management of holistic risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry. It was concluded that <b>in</b> view of <b>the</b> need <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry for a structured means of managing risk holistically, and in view of HRM constituting such a process, there is relevance for the implementation of HRM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four big <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry. However, small and unlisted banks do not manage HRM as suggested by <b>the</b> HRM framework. <b>In</b> this regard a number of recommendations were made with respect to managing HRM proactively. A framework based on empirical research and earlier work by Kloman (2000), Lam (2003) and Regester and Larkin (2005) was furthermore suggested for the implementation of HRM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belief that this framework, and the overall research reported in this study could be of theoretical as well as practical value for risk managers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South African <b>banking</b> industry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays. The first essay examines the cost efficiency and production technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector of Thailand using a stochastic frontier approach. The empirical results indicate that banks with lower Non-performing-loanto-total-loan ratio, higher equity-to-total-asset ratio, higher liquid-asset-to-total-asset ratio, and more branches {{are likely to be}} more efficient. The second essay investigates the degree of competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry using <b>the</b> new empirical industrial organization approach. The empirical results indicate that, despite the Thailand government's efforts to increase competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry by relaxing restrictions on entry to the market after the financial crisis, the oligopolistic degree of <b>the</b> biggest four <b>banks</b> has intensified. <b>The</b> third essay links the results of the first and second essays, cost efficiency and competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector, to <b>the</b> transmission mechanism of monetary policy in Thailand using Vector Autoregression approach. The empirical results indicate that an unexpected tightening monetary policy shock leads to higher financial costs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> industry, forcing banks to compete more fiercely and operate more efficiently, significantly helping strengthen the transmission of monetary policy. Hence, the policy implication is that Thai government should exert more effort to enhance efficiency and competition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector...|$|R
