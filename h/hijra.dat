5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great <b>Hijra.</b> A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which {{in the darkness of the}} night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Hijra</b> in AD 622 (also {{sometimes}} spelled Hegira), the Arabian horse {{spread across}} the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed.

By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720.

2500|$|<b>Hijras</b> are Indians who {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as neither man nor woman. [...] Some describe <b>hijras</b> as a “third sex.” Their identity is distinct from a Western gay or transgender identity, though many <b>hijras</b> have male sexual partners. [...] There is a distinctive mode of speech often attributed to <b>hijras,</b> but it is stereotypical frequently derogatory. [...] It is often the standard for <b>Hijras</b> to adopt feminine mannerisms, feminine gender agreement when addressing the self or other Hijaras, and pronouns, depending on context and their interlocutors, to create solidarity or distance. [...] They also use stereotypically male elements of speech, such as vulgarity. [...] <b>Hijras</b> often refer {{to themselves as}} masculine {{in the past tense}} and females in the present. [...] Their combined use of masculine and feminine speech styles can be see as reflecting their ambiguous sexual identities and challenging dominant sexuality and gender ideologies. Thus, <b>Hijras</b> use grammar as a form of resistance against gender roles.|$|R
5000|$|In India, some <b>Hijras</b> do {{not define}} {{themselves}} by specific sexual orientation, {{but rather by}} renouncing sexuality altogether. Sexual energy is transformed into sacred powers. However, these notions can come {{in conflict with the}} practical, which is that <b>hijras</b> are often employed as prostitutes. Furthermore, in India a feminine male who takes a [...] "receptive" [...] role in sex with a man will often identify as a kothi (or the local equivalent term). While kothis are usually distinguished from <b>hijras</b> as a separate gender identity, they often dress as women and act in a feminine manner in public spaces, even using feminine language to refer to themselves and each other. The usual partners of <b>hijras</b> and kothis are men who consider themselves heterosexual as {{they are the ones who}} penetrate. These male partners are often married, and any relationships or sex with [...] "kothis" [...] or <b>hijras</b> are usually kept secret from the community at large. Some <b>hijras</b> may form relationships with men and even marry, although their marriage is not usually recognized by law or religion. <b>Hijras</b> and kothis often have a name for these masculine sexual or romantic partners; for example, panthi in Bangladesh, giriya in Delhi or sridhar in Cochin.|$|R

5|$|In 615, some of Muhammad's {{followers}} {{emigrated to}} the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony {{under the protection of}} the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to <b>Hijra,</b> while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, only talk about one migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E
5|$|Iravan, {{also known}} as Iravat and Iravant, is a minor {{character}} from the Hindu epic of Mahabharata.

Both these cults are of Tamil origin, from a region of the country where he is worshipped as a village deity and is known as Aravan.

5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or <b>Hijra,</b> of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} Iberian peninsula by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses may have come with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of horse that came with Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad gained few early {{followers}}, and met hostility {{from some}} Meccans. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before {{he and his}} followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the <b>Hijra,</b> {{marks the beginning of}} the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. Before his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} adjacent to Muhammad's house; he settled there after his <b>Hijra</b> (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE. He {{shared in the}} heavy work of construction. The original mosque was an open-air building. The mosque served as a community center, a court, and a religious school. There was a raised platform {{for the people who}} taught the Quran. Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated it. In 1909, it became the first place in the Arabian Peninsula to be provided with electrical lights. The mosque is {{under the control of the}} Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The mosque is located in what was traditionally the center of Medina, with many hotels and old markets nearby.

50|$|In Hinduism, Shiva {{is still}} worshipped as an Ardhnarishwara, i.e. half-male and half-female form. Shiva's symbol, which is today known as Shivalinga, {{actually}} comprises {{a combination of}} a 'Yoni' (vagina) and a 'Ling' (phallus).The third genders have been ascribed spiritual powers by most indigenous societies. In the Indian subcontinent, e.g., the <b>Hijras</b> are supposed to have supernatural powers, through which they can bless people or curse them. This gives <b>Hijras</b> a unique space in the society, and traditional Indians still invite <b>Hijras</b> to seek their blessings on important occasions such as marriage.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the anomic bonds between <b>hijras</b> of Gujarat, whorenounced their social {{positions}} to live as devotees of the Hindu Goddess Bahucharā, and those wholive in the ordinary, mundane world and have a new-born baby. The <b>hijras</b> have been represented bygender studies as an exemplar of the ‘third gender’ in non-Western society, though no such consistentrepresentation or social niche exists in India. Most <b>hijras</b> are born and raised as male, but they subsequentlyrenounce their traditional familial and societal relations, and present themselves as femalethrough various methods, including transvestism and castration. However, their altered appearancedoes not grant them the same status as women; instead, they straddle between gender boundaries, existing at the gateway to a sacred sphere where their ambiguity is understood and accepted. Hijrasare traditionally invited to assist in important transitional life events such as childbirth. Childbirth is aliminal phase that is believed to endanger babies, mothers and their families, and <b>hijras</b> are required todispel evils and bestow blessings in order to overcome the vulnerability. In this paper, I will explore themeaning of vulnerability attributed to childbirth and anomy of childbirth where <b>hijras</b> and laypeoplecome to interact...|$|R
