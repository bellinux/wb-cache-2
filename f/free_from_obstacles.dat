40|$|In {{this work}} an {{algorithm}} for automatic detection and suppression of Forest fires is proposed. The algorithm is implemented using parallel distributed model of neural network with three activation functions {{to determine the}} next consecutive moves to the cells for the actor. The algorithm uses reinforcement learning with weights determined dynamically in each iteration. The Entire forest is decomposed into grid of square cells with initial position of the Actor {{is assumed to be}} the cell 1 and the goal cell is the cell where the fire has occurred. The neural network model uses starting cell, goal cell and number of cells in each row or column and three activation functions to determine the next consecutive cells in which the robot has to travel. It uses only three movements LEFT, DIAGONAL and UP to reach the target cell. After calculating next cell, the check will be made for presence of obstacles in that cell. If there is any obstacle in that cell, then one cell from other two cells obtained using other two movements, which is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>obstacle</b> will be chosen for next move. Then the cell number is stored in memory. This process is repeated till the next cell computed is same as the goal cell. The Actor will begin to move from start cell and reach the goal cell using the cell numbers available in the memory to extinguish Forest fire. This algorithm is designed keeping in mind only static obstacles and hence it works well for Forest environment with static obstacles. Computer simulation results show that path has been found successfully without collision with obstacles...|$|R

This paper presents about motion planning of mobile robot (MR) in obstacles-filled workspace using the modified Ant Colony Optimization (M-ACO) algorithm combined with the point to point (PTP) motion in achieving the static goal. Initially, MR try to plan the path to reach a goal, but since there are obstacles on the path will be passed through so nodes must be placed around the obstacles. Then MR do PTP motion through this nodes chosen by M-ACO, in order to form optimal path from the choice nodes until the last node that is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>obstacles.</b> The proposed approach shows that MR can not only avoid collision with obstacle but also make a global planning path.

To get the answers I sought, my questions on which this study is based, were how the planning work is done at municipal level regarding restoration in river Moälven in Örnsköldsvik, compared to what is recommended in the theory. I also wondered what factors affected the choice of river Moälven instead of other rivers in the area. Finally, I wanted to know what measurers are supposed to be made, what the area is like today and how the area is supposed to look like after restoration.

This thesis tackles {{the history of this}} gallery’s reception and seeks to address its absence in the writing of New Zealand’s art history. In reassessing its history, I assert the Women’s Gallery deserves a place within critical accounts of art in New Zealand. Chapter one locates the Women’s Gallery within the cultural and political context of New Zealand society by tracing the development of the women’s art movement, and feminism as a grassroots political movement. An examination of the gallery’s Opening Show serves {{as an example of the}} way in which the ideology of the Women’s Gallery shaped its organisational structure. Chapter two pinpoints the time of the gallery’s existence at a point of transformation within feminist thinking. This chapter problematises the evolution of feminist thought from ‘essentialism’ to a critique informed by poststructuralist strategies. A close analysis of artworks demonstrates that the Women’s Gallery was simultaneously occupied by artists who exhibited both tendencies. By proposing Victor Turner’s model of liminality as a framework upon which to base a discussion of the Women’s Gallery, chapter three reframes the gallery as a liminal space.

[Findings] The paper finds that the system has been assessed positively for this specific application because it satisfies the initial system requirements. [Research limitations/implications] The research and experiments have been focused on irregular terrain with low vegetation and <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>obstacles.</b> Further research will be focused on the complete coverage of a terrain including large vegetation and obstacles.

Finding a suitable vertical surface becomes a problem when the projector changes positions when a mobile robot is looking for suitable surfaces to project. Two problems must be addressed to achieve a correct undistorted image: (i) finding the biggest suitable surface <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>obstacles</b> and (ii) adapting the output image to correct the distortion due to the angle between the robot and a nonorthogonal surface.

Finally, the algorithm checks the surface looking for imperfections and occlusions and transforms the original image using a homography matrix to display it over the area detected. The proposed solution can detect projection areas in real-time using a single Kinect camera, which makes it suitable for applications where a robot interacts with other people in unknown environments.

40|$|The {{world of}} equestrian {{exhibitions}} aims {{most of its}} attention on the overall image and glamour, without focusing organizational strains on safety among public, workers and horses. Preventing accidents on workplaces means protecting the safeness of people and animals. The not easy definition of risks in the equestrian range rises from the extreme variability and arduous foreseeing of working states and from the considerable number of activities which are often simultaneously performed. The sphere of these risks concern: Safety of people: constraint of dangerous animals, buildings and structures authorized by firemen, sound fences and enclosures around rings, trial and competition fields, safety distance from public and horses, moving carriages and equipments, visible signals of routes equipped for horses. Safety of workers: specific training and information for horse managing employees, equipments and individual protective devices according to regulations, good acquaintance of expositive dynamics. Horses’ physical and psychical safety: sound and wide stalls so that horses may be stabled in the most comfortable conditions; doors, gangways and transit paths <b>free</b> <b>from</b> dangers, <b>obstacles</b> and unevenness that may wound horses; removal of stress from excessive lighting, ceaseless presence of noisy public, scanty moments of relax through daytime, close presence of more stallions, separation of foal from mare.

This paper explores pool design, specifically the design of the access to the tank, which is key for a pools inclusivity. In trying to break down existing barriers between users, accessibility experts and designers, we interviewed physically impaired architects about their perception of four types of pool access often used by wheelchair users; ramps, transfer walls, transfer systems and lifts. The interviews revealed limitations in all four types of pool access. Therefore, combining different types of access in one single pool may be of interest in finding a balance between the limitations identified. Moreover, the interviews allowed to identify another type of pool access, designed by one of the interviewees: an upper pool border connected to an underwater bed and seat, which allows for an easier exit than transfer walls and transfer systems. Another interviewee advanced the idea of a cane holder for physically and visually impaired people, which may contribute to <b>freeing</b> poolside floors <b>from</b> <b>obstacles</b> and reducing the risk of falls.

40|$|Abstract — The goal {{of motion}} {{planning}} {{is to find}} a feasible path that connects two positions and is <b>free</b> <b>from</b> collision with <b>obstacles.</b> Path sets are a robust approach to this problem in the face of real-world complexity and uncertainty. A path set is a collection of feasible paths and their corresponding control sequences. A path-set-based planner navigates by repeatedly testing each of these robot-fixed paths for collision with obstacles. A heuristic function selects which of the surviving paths to follow next. At each step, the robot follows a small piece of each path selected while simultaneously planning the subsequent trajectory. A path set possesses high path diversity if it performs well at obstacle-avoidance and goal-seeking behaviors. Previous work in path diversity has tacitly assumed that a correlation exists between this dynamic planning problem and a simpler, static path diversity problem: a robot placed randomly into an obstacle field evaluates its path set for collision a single time before following the chosen path in entirety. Although these problems might intuitively appear to be linked, this paper shows that static and dynamic path diversity are two distinct properties. After empirically demonstrating this fact, we discuss some of the factors that differentiate the two problems. A. Path Sets I...|$|R
