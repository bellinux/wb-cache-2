With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate.|$|E

25|$|The Cardinals {{took the}} lead in the second inning on a lead-off single by Yadier Molina {{followed}} by two advancing groundouts, and then an infield single by David Eckstein. Detroit third baseman Brandon Inge made a good play to stop the ball off Eckstein's bat, but then made a poor throw to first which <b>got</b> <b>by</b> the first baseman and allowed Eckstein to advance to second.

25|$|In {{a bid to}} {{maintain}} Israel's technological gap ahead of Arab states, the F-35 deal was pushed through instead of upgrading the air force's F-15s and F-16s. This approach sticks to the principle that Israel is the first country in the Middle East to receive the newest fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently committed to this principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal was damaging them. The package also <b>got</b> <b>by</b> opposition {{from a number of}} members of the General Staff who criticized the high price of the deal, which does not allow for investment into weapons for the land forces and navy.|$|E
25|$|In qualifying, McLaren took 1–2 {{ahead of}} the Williamses and the Benettons with Senna ahead of Berger, Mansell, Patrese, Piquet and Schumacher. At the start, in {{extremely}} torrential wet conditions, Patrese lost time and was quickly behind Piquet and Alesi had also <b>got</b> <b>by</b> him and Schumacher. Senna led from Berger, Mansell, Piquet, Alesi and Patrese. On lap 3, Berger went wide allowing Mansell to be second and thus go after Senna. He was close enough on lap 5 and was {{side by side with}} Senna on the next lap but saw yellow flags because of Nicola Larini's crash. Thus he was forced to back off and Senna retained the lead. Alesi spun off immediately and was followed there by Schumacher. Both were out.|$|E
