The available measurements of chromium, iron, and nickel are well reproduced by stellar models, which account for the largest shifts in the heaviest isotopes of each element: in particular ^(54) Cr, ^(58) Fe, and ^(64) Ni. Moreover, many circumstellar condensates reflect ^(50) Ti excesses and some production of ^(46, 47, 49) Ti, as predicted by slow-neutron captures in AGB stars.

40|$|Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) {{stars are}} known to be sites of dust {{formation}} and undergo significant mass loss. The outflow is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on grains and momentum coupling between the grains and gas. While the physics of shell dynamics and grain formation are closely coupled, most previous models of circumstellar shells have treated the problem separately. Studies of shell dynamics typically assume the existence of grains needed to drive the outflow, while most grain formation models assume a constant veolcity wind <b>in</b> which <b>grains</b> <b>form.</b> Furthermore, models of grain formation have relied primarily on classical nucleation theory instead of using a more realistic approach based on chemical kinetics. To model <b>grain</b> formation <b>in</b> carbon-rich AGB stars, we have coupled the kinetic equations governing small cluster growth to moment equations which determine the growth of large particles. Phenomenological models assuming stationary outflow are presented to demonstrate the differences between the classical nucleation approach and the kinetic equation method. It is found that classical nucleation theory predicts nucleation at a lower supersaturation ratio than is predicted by the kinetic equations, resulting in significant differences <b>in</b> <b>grain</b> properties. Coagulation of clusters larger than monomers is unimportant for <b>grain</b> formation <b>in</b> high mass-loss models but becomes more important to <b>grain</b> growth <b>in</b> low mass-loss situations. The properties of the dust grains are altered considerably if differential drift velocities are ignored <b>in</b> modeling <b>grain</b> formation. The effect of stellar temperature, stellar luminosity, and different outflow velocities are investigated. The models indicate that changing the stellar temperature while keeping the stellar luminosity constant has little effect on the physical parameters of the dust shell formed. Increasing the stellar luminosity while keeping the stellar temperature constant results in large differences <b>in</b> <b>grain</b> properties. For small outflow velocities, <b>grains</b> <b>form</b> at lower supersaturation ratios and close to the stellar photosphere, resulting in larger but fewer grains.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the micro-method {{achievements}} have emerged as the high-throughputexperimentation approaches to complex processes in which development of heterogeneous catalysts forindustrial purposes has become a challenge. Also the selective oxidation of gaseous alkanes should bedirected towards green and profitable synthesis which involve complex processes. Namely, intermediates ofthe high activation-temperature oxidation react faster than the alkane substrate and burn up especially athot-spots due to temperature rise and catalyst deactivation. Moreover, uniformity between alkane functionalgroups complicate the oxidation scheme with parallel side-reactions. However, in this case the well-known,adverse effect of unsatisfactory comparability of the micro-method with those obtained in the conventionalreactors becomes a problem that permanently follows a limitation of heat-transfer across catalytic grains. The limitation causes non-isothermal conditions and then the hot-spot effects which give rise to theincomparability. Hence, to data n-butane selective oxidation to maleic anhydride on VPO phases is the onlysuch a synthesis applied on the industrial scale owing to both stability of the quasi-aromatic product andselectivity of the catalyst acting as a stoichiometric agent that for this reactivity is used only <b>in</b> <b>grain</b> <b>forms.</b> Accordingly, a short contact-time, selective catalytic system could bring about the comparability and thenselectivity. Therefore, a new catalytic system of thin-layer VPO catalyst on structured carriers with enhancedheat-transfer efficiency was elaborated in this work, and optimized towards n-butane selective oxidation ona semi-industrial scale. The selective oxidation on that catalyst was controlled with the intrinsic processparameters and reactant properties.
