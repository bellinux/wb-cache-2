5|$|Days {{after the}} spill, tar balls began washing ashore on beaches {{down the coast}} in nearby Summerland and then <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast in Ventura county. Although the source of these tar balls could not be {{immediately}} confirmed, the pipeline company sent workers to clean them up. Crews cleaned up coin-sized clumps of oil along the Rincon shoreline such as Faria, the beaches in the City of Ventura including San Buenaventura State Beach, and the extensive oceanfront of the Oxnard Plain.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E

5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as this is the most easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E
25|$|A deep {{foundation}} {{is a type}} of foundation that transfers building loads to <b>the</b> earth <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> from <b>the</b> surface than a shallow foundation does to a subsurface layer or a range of depths.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> beneath <b>the</b> ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|R
5000|$|The park {{had major}} renovations {{prior to the}} [...] season, with a new {{grandstand}} behind the plate and along the first-base side as well as [...] "open-air suites" [...] (railed-in areas with picnic tables) <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> on <b>the</b> first-base line. A new scoreboard was also installed.|$|R
5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat through the Black Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column {{led the way}} over the Höllenthal, breaking through the Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching Freiburg im Breisgau on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general wanted to reach Kehl <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. <b>Farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E

25|$|Most {{visitors}} reach Zermatt by {{cog railway}} train {{from the nearby}} town of Täsch (Zermatt shuttle). Trains also depart for Zermatt from <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> valley at Visp and Brig, which are on the main Swiss rail network. The town also has a heliport (ICAO: LSEZ) and a local helicopter operator, Air Zermatt, which also provides alpine rescue services.|$|E
25|$|A small firewarden's hut {{was located}} on the summit of Mount Monadnock and {{operated}} from 1911 to 1948, when it was decommissioned {{with the advent of}} modern means of detecting forest fires. The hut remained as a snack bar and hikers' shelter until 1969 and was removed in 1972. A small cabin, located <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> mountain, served as the fire lookout's residence. It, too, is gone.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the word}} [...] "Patrician" [...] is usually {{employed}} as a synonym for aristocrat, in the naming of the Regiment it meant [...] "the sons of the homeland" [...] (Spanish [...] "Patria" [...] meaning [...] "homeland"). Indeed, the original members of the Regiment were not aristocrats but Criollos, who were much <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> social hierarchy of the time.|$|R
50|$|A steady {{food and}} {{freshwater}} supply {{as well as}} the presence of rocks {{that could be used to}} manufacture tools drew early humans towards Lake Mojave. As lake levels dropped, people migrated progressively <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> to reach <b>the</b> lake.|$|R
25|$|In 1627 Pyotr Beketov was {{appointed}} Yenisei voevoda in Siberia. He successfully {{carried out the}} voyage to collect taxes from Zabaykalye Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in Buryatia. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov {{was sent to the}} Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded Yakutsk and sent his Cossacks to explore the Aldan and <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.|$|E
25|$|The land in {{this part}} of North Carolina is low and rather flat, and is {{sometimes}} marshy. In 1862, the solid land was mostly covered with open pine forest, although in places it was broken into low hills with deciduous forests, separated by ravines. It is crossed by many creeks that sometimes rise to the status of small rivers. One of these, the Trent River, separates New Bern from the land to its south. The slightly smaller Slocum's Creek, enters 16 miles (26km) <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Neuse. It was to be the landing site for the attacking Federal forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{floods and}} debris flows of 1999 {{did not follow}} the eastern channel on Caraballeda. This channel, formed during the 1951 floods, had been lined with {{concrete}} and designed to safely transport the flows into the sea. Instead, the debris flows overwhelmed the channel and the flows overtopped the banks wherever the channel changed direction. Once free of the culvert, the channel rapidly avulsed across the fan and spread debris throughout the community. These overbank flows demolished 2-story houses and destroyed the first two stories of apartment buildings. <b>Farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> fan, the debris flows routed themselves down streets. As the flows progressed, they left thinner and thinner deposits, though they often still exceeded 1 meter (3feet) in thickness. After several avulsions, the channel roughly followed the pre-1951 flood path.|$|E
60|$|In {{this manner}} the throngs moved on, until at length, {{approaching}} the Thames, {{they arrived at}} Blackheath and Greenwich, two villages below London, <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> than <b>the</b> Tower, and near {{the bank of the}} river. Here they halted, and determined to send an embassage to the king to demand an audience. The embassador that they were to send was the knight, Sir John Newton.|$|R
50|$|The First {{boat house}} used by KSBC {{was nothing more}} than a large shed. Today one would pass it by with little thought of its {{tremendous}} history. It is located on the other side of <b>the</b> Macedonia Brook <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> river than <b>the</b> newer boat houses.|$|R
60|$|The next corral held a like {{number of}} sheep, and also several Mexicans who were evidently driving {{them into a}} narrow lane that led <b>farther</b> <b>down.</b> Carley saw <b>the</b> heads of men above other corral fences, {{and there was also}} a thick {{yellowish}} smoke rising from somewhere.|$|R
25|$|However, {{no single}} {{southern}} leader emerged {{to rally the}} Mon populace as Alaungpaya did with the Burmans in 1752. A rebellion broke out in 1758 throughout Lower Burma but was put down by local Konbaung garrisons. The window of opportunity {{came to a close}} {{in the second half of}} 1759 when the Konbaung armies, having conquered Manipur and the northern Shan states, were back down south, preparing for their invasion of the Tenasserim coast and Siam. The Konbaung armies seized the upper Tenasserim coast following the Burmese-Siamese War (1759–1760), and pushed out the Mon resistance <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast. (Alaungpaya died in the war.) The resistance was driven out of Tenasserim in 1765 when Alaungpaya's son Hsinbyushin seized the lower coastline as part of the Burmese-Siamese War (1765–1767).|$|E
25|$|Fort Collins {{was founded}} as a {{military}} outpost of the United States Army in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as Camp Collins, on the Cache La Poudre River, near what is known today as Laporte. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the Overland Trail would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864. Afterward, {{the commander of the}} fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel William O. Collins, suggesting that a site several miles <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> river would make a good location for the fort. The post was manned originally by two companies of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry and never had walls.|$|E
25|$|Within {{an hour of}} {{receiving}} this alarming report some Indians brought word that Jean Ribault with two hundred men was {{in the neighborhood of}} the place where the two French ships had been wrecked. They were said to be suffering greatly, for the Trinity had broken to pieces <b>farther</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> shore, and their provisions had all been lost. They had been reduced to living on roots and grasses and to drinking the impure water collected in the holes and pools along their route. Like the first party, their only hope lay in a return to Fort Caroline. Le Challeux wrote that they had saved a small boat from the wreck; this they caulked with their shirts, and thirteen of the company had set out for Fort Caroline in search of assistance, and had not returned. As Ribault and his companions made their way northward {{in the direction of the}} fort, they eventually found themselves in the same predicament as the previous party, cut off by Matanzas Inlet and river from the mainland, and unable to cross.|$|E
