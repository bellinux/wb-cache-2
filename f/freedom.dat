40|$|Two {{enduring}} human concerns {{throughout the}} world are (a) the various <b>freedoms</b> enjoyed (or not enjoyed) by citizens of different nations, and (b) {{the presence or absence}} of corruption among public officials and politicians of those same countries. This paper explores the relationship between human <b>freedoms</b> and corruption in national public life around the globe. A common conception of the relationship between human <b>freedoms</b> and corruption is that increasing <b>freedoms</b> create more opportunities for corruption. A competing hypothesis is that <b>freedoms,</b> by providing greater opportunities for personal choice, action, responsibility, and accountability, decrease corruption. A third proposition ⎯ examined in this paper ⎯ posits a curvilinear relationship, of the cubic form, between <b>freedoms</b> and corruption. Specifically, at low levels of human <b>freedoms,</b> corruption will increase as <b>freedoms</b> increase; at moderate to moderately high levels of <b>freedoms,</b> corruption will decrease as <b>freedoms</b> increase; and at very high levels of <b>freedoms,</b> a threshold point will be reached, beyond which corruption will increase. This proposition is tested using polynomial regression analysis, with corruption as the dependent variable and human <b>freedoms</b> as the independent variable. Corruption is gauged with the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International. Human <b>freedoms</b> are measured with an index created by factor analyzing various published measures of economic, political/civil, cultural, and religious <b>freedoms.</b> Results support the curvilinear hypothesis, and implications and limitations of those results are discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|<b>Freedom</b> Square {{was located}} {{on the corner of}} Victoria and Morris Streets. It was famous in the 1950s for the {{political}} meetings held there. It was utilised by the African National Congress (ANC) and the Transvaal Congress Party. Many of the meetings were chaired by Trevor Huddleston. <b>Freedom</b> Square facilitated the cooperation between the aforementioned political parties. Here parties worked together against the apartheid regime. <b>Freedom</b> Square in Sophiatown {{should not be confused with}} <b>Freedom</b> Square in Kliptown, Soweto, where the <b>Freedom</b> Charter was adopted by the ANC in 1955. It was in this <b>Freedom</b> Square in Sophiatown that Nelson Mandela made his first public allusion to violence and armed resistance as a legitimate tool for change. This earned him a reprimand from Albert Luthuli who by then replaced Dr A.B. Xuma as president of the ANC.

5|$|<b>Freedom</b> of Speech was {{the first}} of a series of four oil paintings, {{entitled}} Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution were <b>freedom</b> of speech and <b>freedom</b> of worship. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: <b>Freedom</b> of Speech (February 20), <b>Freedom</b> of Worship (February 27), <b>Freedom</b> from Want (March 6) and <b>Freedom</b> from Fear (March 13).

The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the Allies' World War II policy statement, the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers: <b>Freedom</b> of Speech (February 20), <b>Freedom</b> of Worship (February 27), <b>Freedom</b> from Want (March 6) and <b>Freedom</b> from Fear (March 13). For the essay accompanying <b>Freedom</b> of Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author {{at the peak of his}} fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.

50|$|The <b>Freedoms</b> {{were active}} in the trade market at the WTT Roster Player Draft on April 1, 2008.

Raymond, on the other hand, could have been protected in the fourth round, if the <b>Freedoms</b> had protected Jackson in the first round. In the second round, the <b>Freedoms</b> protected Travis Parrott, who had substituted for Daniel Nestor in 2007. Parrott was still technically a WTT rookie under the rules in place at the time, even though he played for Sacramento Capitals in 2006, and for the <b>Freedoms</b> in 2007. The <b>Freedoms</b> traded their third round pick to the Delaware Smash for Alex Bogomolov Jr., whom had been selected by the Smash with the seventh pick in the first round. The trade forced the <b>Freedoms</b> to leave 2006 WTT Male Most Valuable Player Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer unprotected. The Smash used the third round selection it acquired from the <b>Freedoms</b> to draft Madison Brengle. In the fourth round, the <b>Freedoms</b> selected Audra Cohen and left Olga Savchuk unprotected. The <b>Freedoms</b> did not select any roster-exempt players.|$|R
