40|$|AbstractGlatiramer acetate (Copaxone®; GA) is a non-biological complex {{drug for}} {{multiple}} sclerosis. GA modulated thousands of genes in genome-wide expression {{studies conducted in}} THP- 1 cells and mouse splenocytes. Comparing GA with differently-manufactured glatiramoid Polimunol (Synthon) in mice yielded hundreds of differentially expressed probesets, including biologically-relevant genes (e. g. Il 18, adj p< 9 e− 6) and pathways. In human monocytes, 700 + probesets differed between Polimunol and GA, enriching for 130 + pathways including response to lipopolysaccharide (adj. p< 0. 006). Key differences were confirmed by qRT-PCR (splenocytes) or proteomics (THP- 1).

The Saint Louis University Mental State examination (SLUMS) was ported onto a computerized mobile application named the Cambridge University Pen to Digital <b>Equivalence</b> <b>assessment</b> (CUPDE). CUPDE was piloted and compared to the traditional pen and paper version, with a common comparator test for both groups. Sixty healthy participants (aged 50 to 79) completed both measurements. Differences were tested between overall outcomes, individual items, and relationship with the comparator. Significant differences in the overall scores between the two testing versions as well as within individual items were observed.

In order to put the current TTIP negotiations in context, the paper studies the history of the transatlantic regulatory cooperation going back to the 1990 s. The paper includes assessments of some of the high-profiled disagreements and disputes between the EU and the U. S. on regulatory issues, such as the hormones case, the chlorinated poultry case and the case on GMOs – all dating back to the 1990 s. The paper describes the role of mutual recognition of conformity <b>assessment</b> procedures and <b>equivalence</b> <b>assessments</b> of regulations and standards, as means to facilitate trade, and analyses what role these regulatory tools may play in TTIP. Some critical regulatory issues of the TTIP negotiations are highlighted including institutional issues, and some pitfalls and possibilities for regulatory cooperation on these issues are analysed. The paper discusses some potential consequences of a TTIP Agreement, including also the consequences for thirdcountries such as Norway. Key conclusions are as follows: As the TTIP negotiations now stand, there is little to indicate dramatic changes in EU and U. S. regulatory approaches. However, if the EU and the U. S. succeed in setting up a strong institutional framework for regulatory cooperation, based on stronger stakeholder involvement and effective dispute settlement mechanisms, TTIP could have more substantial long-term effects on regulatory developments...|$|R

The PNS was modified so as to enable its use in nurturance studies where the prime source of nurturance might vary between respondents. Method It was translated into Japanese through the forward-backward translation procedure. With attempting to enhance representativeness of language in the target populations, translators used were married couples that consisted of a native English speaker and a native Japanese speaker. Multiple translations were produced and {{used to make a}} single Japanese version. A panel of reviewers identified problems in conceptual and semantic equivalence between the original and the translated versions. The Japanese version was altered accordingly with reference to alternate Japanese forms from the original English to Japanese translations. The altered translation was again re-translated into English and problematic differences were checked. This forward-backward process was repeated until satisfactory agreement was attained. The PNSM was administered to 222 native English speakers and the PNSM-J to 1320 native Japanese speakers. Results Factor analysis and target rotation revealed a nearly identical factor structure and factor loadings of the items of the PNSM and PNSM-J between the different cultural groups. High Cronbach's alpha coefficient supported the reliability of the test scores on both versions. Conclusion The equivalence between the two scales was supported. It is suggested that the PNSM and PNSM-J are suitable tools for comparative cross-cultural studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{the concept of}} {{substantial}} equivalence has been a guiding principle of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada's regulatory approach toward products of plant biotechnology destined for the food and livestock feed markets. To assess substantial equivalence in terms of chemical composition, genetically modified (GM) plants are compared to conventional counterparts {{at the level of}} macro- and micro-nutrients, allergens and toxicants. Such targeted comparative analyses are limited in their scope and their capacity to detect unintended changes in chemical composition. There is a need to develop more effective testing protocols to improve the substantial <b>equivalence</b> <b>assessment</b> of GM crops. The objective of this thesis was to explore high-density oligoarrays as tools to assess substantial equivalence of Roundup Ready(TM) soybean. Three conventional and two GM soybean varieties were selected according to the similarity of their performance in field trials. Total RNA was extracted from first trifoliate leaves harvested from soybean plants grown in a controlled environment until the V 2 stage. To annotate the 37 776 soybean probesets present on the multi-organism Soybean Affymetrix GeneChip(TM), consensus sequences were aligned with TIGR Soybean Gene Index tentative consensus sequences using BLASTN. After redefining the chip description file to exclude non-soybean probesets, the effects of three different normalization methods (Robust Multichip Average (RMA), Microarray Analysis Suite (MAS 5. 0) and Model-Based Expression Index) were compared and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM for R-Bioconductor) was applied to detect differential gene expression between conventional and GM soybean varieties.

40|$|This {{overview}} {{of research on}} the relationship between behavior and culture is organized as follows. The first section relates how cross-cultural psychology, or cultural psychology, since it emerged in the mid 20 th century has reflected a continuous tension between how and how much humans are the same psychologically and to what extent there is cultural specificity in psychological functioning. The second section on the charm of differences argues that research is often biased towards finding differences rather than cross-cultural invariance. The third section briefly outlines problems of cultural bias, or lack of <b>equivalence,</b> in <b>assessment</b> across cultural populations and its implications for interpretation of data. The fourth section makes explicit a theme that is embedded in other sections and reflected in the title, namely the psychological organization of cross-cultural differences. The section challenges the tendency to conceive of such differences as being organized in broad dimensions or psychological functions. This tendency to over-generalize is illustrated in the fifth section for various traditions of research, including the recent tradition of cultural neuroscience where the increasing contributions of Chinese researchers are particularly evident.

Results Eleven systems (out of 21 OAEI participating systems) were {{able to cope with}} {{at least one of the}} tasks in the Disease and Phenotype track. AML, FCA-Map, LogMap(Bio) and PhenoMF systems produced the top results for ontology matching in comparison to consensus alignments.

Conclusions Four systems gave the highest performance for matching disease and phenotype ontologies. These systems coped well with the detection of equivalence matches, but struggled to detect semantic similarity. This deserves more attention in the future development of ontology matching systems. The findings of this evaluation show that such systems could help to automate equivalence matching in the workflow of curators, who maintain ontology mapping services in numerous domains such as disease and phenotype...|$|R

The project include three sub-projects: (1) Stable sample supply for food biosafety assessment of transgenic papaya. (2) non-specific immune responses of domestic transgenic papaya TPY 10 - 4 and allergenicity assessment on backcross breeding. (3) Levels of nutrients and anti-nutrients in transgenic papaya TPY 10 - 4 and single-resistnat hohmzygotic parental lines. Single resistant to Papaya ringspot virus(PRSV) and double resistant to PRSV and Papaya leaf-distortion mosaic virus (PLDMV) transgenic papaya lines have been successfully developed by the Molecular Plant Virology Laboratory of National Chung Hsing University (NCHU). In this project, the selected single- and double-resistance transgenic papaya lines will be microprogagated by tissue culture. The main objective of this research project is supply the single resistant to PRSV transgenic fruits of Thailand and Sunrise varieties at different time for the experimental needs of food bio-safety assays in 2011. The transgenic Thailand and Sunrise varieties were obtained from several times of backcrossing transgenic line 1824 with parent lines. Total DNA extracted from leaves, peel and pulp of transgenic papaya and non-transformed control was used for variety identification by PCR with transgenic variety-specific primers. According to PCR results, test materials obtained from transgenic line was confirmed again. Non- transformed variety Tailand were determined with their horticultural traits. The test samples were divided into fresh and freeze-dried materials. Fresh fruit materials were collected depended on the experiments. Freeze-dried materials were prepared by professional manufacturer follows fruit characters analysis. In the first year (2010) the domestic transgenic papaya TPY 10 - 4 {{will be used as}} the experimental materials to conduct the allergenicity assessment on non-specific immune responses using BALB/c mouse model in this study. The experimental design concerning allergenicity of transgenic papaya TPY 10 - 4 using a non-specific immune response animal model is based on immunologic theory. The effects of test samples on the Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine secretions by spleen cells, and the serum titers of non-specific antibodies in vivo will be determined. According to the results of the productions of Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine (such as IFN-γ/IL- 4 ratio) by immune cells, and the level changes in non-specific antibodies in vivo, especially IgE, compared to the non-transgenic papaya, the allergenic possibility of test samples will be judged. To further confirm the backcross stability of transgenic papaya, in the second year (2011) the papaya fruits from backcross breeding of domestic transgenic papaya resistant to PRSV coded as 1824 will be subjected to the allergenic assessment under specific immune responses using female BALB/c mouse animal model. As this study is finished, the backcross stability of transgenic papaya concerning allergenicity will be determined. In this sub-project (3), we investigated the chemical composition variances between the two (823 and 2210) cross anti-Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) genetically modified (GM) and non-GM papaya fruits (including unripe and ripe); and the substantial <b>equivalence</b> <b>assessment</b> for two GM ones. The general analytic methods, high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy along with two assessment methods (comparisons with the control and the international databases) were used. Of the 25 test parameters, the substantial equivalence rates for the unripe and ripe anti-PRSV GM 823 papaya fruits were 71 and 76 %, respectively, as well as 76 % of rate for both unripe and ripe 2210 samples. The substantial equivalent results were not fully satisfactory, which were partly due to the sampling errors. Some constituent (i. e. fiber and vitamin C) levels in the papaya fruits were highly correlation with their ripe degree. When the unripe/ripe sampling standards were not consistent possibly resulting in the substantial equivalent assessment mistakes. 本計畫依據衛生署「建立我國基因改造產品風險評估環境建制計畫」要點，針對中興大學研發之轉基因木瓜提出此整合計畫。內容包過三項子計畫：一、供食品安全評估國產轉基因木瓜穩定樣品之提供；二、國產轉基因雙抗病毒木瓜TPY 10 - 4 之非特異性免疫及單抗病毒木瓜 1824 回交育種之過敏性評估；三、國產轉基因雙抗病毒木瓜TYP- 104 及回交育種之營養成分及抗營養成分分析。由中興大學植物病理學系分子植物病毒學研究室利用遺傳工程基因轉殖技術，成功育成單抗輪點病毒(Papaya ringspot virus; PRSV) 及雙抗輪點病毒與畸葉嵌紋病毒(Papaya leaf-distortion mosaic virus; PLDMV) 轉基因木瓜。本年度進行單抗輪點病毒回交親本-日昇及泰國品種木瓜之供果試驗。定植後及採果期間利用針對雙抗轉基因木瓜的外源基因設計專一性引子，抽取木瓜葉片、果皮及果肉之總量DNA，進行PCR，電泳分析結果確認各供試轉基因木瓜株系材料正確無誤，非轉基因對照則根據其園藝性狀判別。供試樣品分為鮮果材料和冷凍乾燥材料二種，鮮果材料視實驗需要不定期採集。冷凍乾燥材料採集後經過去皮及切片處理後，先初步進行果實各項性狀分析，冷凍乾燥後，交由其他子計畫進行試驗。本研究第一年(99 年) 將以中興大學育成之雙抗輪點病毒與畸葉嵌紋病毒基因轉殖木瓜TPY 10 - 4 為材料，進行非特異性免疫反應下之過敏性分析，以動物體內實驗探討輪點病毒及雙抗輪點病毒轉殖木瓜前後，木瓜對Th 1 /Th 2 細胞激素及非特異性抗體含量之影響，並依免疫指標之變化，判斷輪點病毒與畸葉嵌紋病毒基因轉殖後是否增加其過敏性。為探討基因改造木瓜之回交育種穩定性，本研究第二年(100 年) 將進行單抗病毒木瓜 1824 回交育種之過敏性評估，實驗將針對基因改造木瓜回交育種後的木瓜果實，進行特異性免疫評估，以了解基因改造木瓜回交育種後，過敏性是否發生變化。子計畫三分析二個回交基改抗木瓜輪點病毒之木瓜果果實 (青果、熟果) 於化學組成分之差異，並分析與未轉基因木瓜間『實質等同』之符合度。分析方法包括一般化學分析法、比色法、高效能液相層析法及感應耦合電漿發散光譜法等；實質等同評估方法包括與對照組及國際重要資料庫間之差異。期中報告之結果顯示出，以對照組評估法 (assessment with control) 聯合OECD參考數據評估法 (assessment with OECD data) 之結果，在分析之 25 個項目中， 823 青果及熟果之實質等同率均分別為 71 及 76 %； 2210 則均為 76 %。二個回交基改木瓜之實質等同率均未達理想，推測其部分原因，係由於木瓜樣品採樣誤差，青果及熟果採摘之判斷基準不一；而一些組成分 (纖維素、維生素C等) 之含量與其成熟度有高度之關聯性，因此造成實質等同評估結果的偏差...|$|E

Risk assessment scales for pressure ulcer prevention have become an aspect of quality improvement in healthcare, but their effectiveness depends on the reliability and validity of the scale. Methods. A convenience sample of 481 residents in 15 nursing homes in rural Norway was included between January and June 2007. The English-language version of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale was translated into Norwegian, and this scale was used to collect the data, including a skin examination. The number of pressure ulcers and grades were documented. Reliability was assessed in a small group of 26 residents and construct validity in the total study group. Results. <b>Equivalence</b> between two <b>assessments</b> regarding total scores of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale was reflected in an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 95.

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL legform impactor is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The global technical regulation (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL legform impactor. However, a flexible legform impactor has been under development. When the flexible legform impactor development is fully completed and evaluated, it is possible that both legform impactors may be determined to be useful in the GTR. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL legform impactor and the flexible legform impactor. Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used. The center of the bumper and center of the side members (i. e., the vehicles main longitudinal beams) were selected as impact locations for the legform impactors tests.

A 15 -item numerical test and an 18 -item reasoning test that were originally developed in English and then translated to French were used. The analyses were based on four groups, each containing 1, 000 examinees. Two groups of English-speaking ex-aminees were administered the English version of the tests; {{the other two were}} French-speaking examinees who were administered the French version of the tests. The percent of items identified with significant differ-ential item functioning (DIF) in this study was similar to findings in previous large-sample studies. The four DIF methods showed substantial consistency in identi-fying items with significant DIF when replicated. Sug-gestions for future research are provided. Index terms: area measures, differential item functioning, item response theory, language translations, Lord’s X 2, Mantel-Haenszel procedure. When tests are adapted from the language and culture in which they were developed to another language, the measurement equivalence of the adapted instrument should be assessed. The origi-nal and adapted instruments may not be equivalent because (1) the meaning of the test items may have been inadvertently altered in the translation process and/or (2) the test items may not be equally rel-evant in the different linguistic and cultural groups. In the past, some cross-cultural researchers (Brislin, 1980, 1986) have argued that the conscientiou...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the research are (1) to describe the types of verbal humor in the English verbal humor expressions in the Kung Fu Panda 3 movie text and their bahasa Indonesia translated expressions in the subtitling text, (2) to describe subtitling strategies employed in the English verbal humor expressions in the Kung Fu Panda 3 movie text and their bahasa Indonesia translated expressions in the subtitling text, and (3) to describe the degree of meaning <b>equivalence</b> as <b>assessment</b> from the result of strategies employed. 	The research used a descriptive qualitative. The data of this research were the English verbal humor expressions in the Kung Fu Panda 3 movie text and their bahasa Indonesia translated expressions in the subtitling text. Meanwhile, the units of analysis are words, phrases, or sentences. The researcher as the main instruments in this research manually collected and analyzed {{the data from the}} movie. To gain the trustworthiness of the data, the data are repeatedly checked by the researcher and some friends in a triangulation process. 	The research shows three crucial findings. First, there are three types of verbal humor. They are wordplay, allusion, and verbal irony. The most frequent type that appears in the research is verbal irony. Ironic repetitions become amusing verbal humor in the movie. Ironic repetitions are represented by the main character in the movie. The type of verbal irony is increasing the strength of questioning and automatic influence and also increase the probability of recollection of earlier asking, a consciously controlled use memory. Second, the translator used seven subtitling strategies in subtitling English verbal humor expressions in the movie. The most frequent strategy is transfer, because the translator focuses in meaning instead of in verbal humor. Third, the translator is succeeding in transferring the English verbal humor expressions. The result of the research shows that 39 data from 73 data of verbal humor in this research are considered as fully equivalent; 30 data are considered as partly equivalent; 4 data are considered as fully non equivalent; and there is no datum considered as no meaning at all...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to translate and test the psychometric properties of the Norwegian-language version of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale. Background. Risk assessment scales for pressure ulcer prevention have become an aspect of quality improvement in healthcare, but their effectiveness depends on the reliability and validity of the scale. Methods. A convenience sample of 481 residents in 15 nursing homes in rural Norway was included between January and June 2007. The English-language version of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale was translated into Norwegian, and this scale was used to collect the data, including a skin examination. The number of pressure ulcers and grades were documented. Reliability was assessed in a small group of 26 residents and construct validity in the total study group. Results. <b>Equivalence</b> between two <b>assessments</b> regarding total scores of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale was reflected in an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 95. Construct validity was supported, and the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale could define groups with expected low and high scores. Further evidence of construct validity was shown in a confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion. The Norwegian version of the Risk Assessment Pressure Sore scale has shown sufficient psychometric properties to be considered a reliable and valid scale for identifying risk of pressure ulcers among nursing home residents. However, further testing is needed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor small – low {{molecular}} weight – molecule medicines a robust regulatory system has evolved over the years. This system guarantees high and constant quality of our (generic) medicines. Pharmaceutical <b>equivalence</b> and bioequivalence <b>assessment</b> are the pillars under that system. But there are complex medicines where the question of equivalence is more challenging to answer. For biologicals the paradigm of similarity rather than equality (the emergence of ‘biosimilars’) {{was developed in the}} past decade. This has been a program where an evolutionary, science based approach has been chosen by the frontrunner regulatory body, the EMA, with a ‘learn and confirm’ character. In addition, there is another group of complex drugs, the non-biological complex drugs, NBCDs, where the generic paradigm can be challenged as well. The NBCDs are defined as: 1. consisting of a complex multitude of closely related structures; 2. the entire multitude is the active pharmaceutical ingredient; 3. the properties cannot be fully characterized by physicochemical analysis and 4. the consistent, tightly controlled manufacturing process is fundamental to reproduce the product. NBCDs encompass product families such as the glatiramoids, liposomes, iron–carbohydrate colloids and many candidates of the group of the upcoming nanoparticulate systems. Following the main principles of regulatory pathways for biologicals (with appropriate product-by-product adjustments), instead of that for small molecules, would be the more logical strategy for these NBCDs. The status and outstanding regulatory issues for biosimilars and NBCD-similars/follow on versions were discussed at a conference in Budapest, Hungary (October 2014) and this commentary touches upon the issues brought up in the presentations, deliberations and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Many {{substances}} {{are active}} in in vitro tests for estrogenic activity, but data from multigenerational and other toxicity studies are not available for many of those substances. Controversy has arisen, therefore, concerning the likelihood of adverse health effects. Based on a toxic <b>equivalence</b> factor risk <b>assessment</b> approach, some researchers have concluded that exposure to environmental estrogens is not associated with estrogen receptor (ER) -mediated health effects. Their rationale cites the low potency of these compounds in in vitro assays relative to estradiol, and the widespread exposure to pharmaceutical, endogenous, and dietary estrogens. This reasoning relies on two assumptions: that the relative estrogenic potency in in vitro assays is predictive of the relative potency for the most sensitive in vivo estrogenic effect; and that all estrogens act via the same mechanism to produce the most sensitive in vivo estrogenic effect. Experimental data reviewed here suggest that these assumptions may be inappropriate because diversity in both mechanism and effect exists for estrogenic compounds. Examples include variations in ER-ligand binding to estrogen response elements, time course of nuclear ER accumulation, patterns of gene activation, and other mechanistic characteristics that are not reflected in many in vitro assays, but may have significance for ER-mediated in vivo effects. In light of these data, this report identifies emerging methodological issues in risk assessment for estrogenic compounds: the need to address differences in in vivo end points of concern and the associated mechanisms; pharmacokinetics; the crucial role of timing and duration of exposure; interactions; and non-ER-mediated activities of estrogenic compounds.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports a}} study into {{the appropriateness of}} on-screen assessment materials compared to paper-based versions, and how any potential change in assessment modes might affect assessment practices in schools. The research was centred around a controlled comparative trial of paper and on-screen assessments with 1000 school students. The appropriateness of the assessments was conceptualised in terms of exploring the comparative reliability, validity and scoring <b>equivalence</b> of these <b>assessments</b> in paper and on-screen modes. Reliability was considered using quantitative analysis: calculating the performance and internal reliability of the assessments using classical test theory, Cronbach???s alpha and Rasch latent trait modelling. Equivalence was also addressed empirically. Marking reliability was not quantified, however it is discussed. Validity was considered through qualitative analysis, using questionnaire and interview data obtained from the students and teachers participating in the trial; {{the focus on the}} comparative authenticity and fitness for purpose in assessments in different modes. The outcomes of the research can be summarised as follows: the assessment tests in both modes scored highly in terms of internal reliability, however they were not necessarily measuring the same constructs. The scores from different modes were not equivalent, with students performing better on paper. The on-screen versions were considered to have greater validity by students and teachers. All items in the assessments that resulted in significant differences in performance were analysed and categorised in terms of item types. Consideration is then given to whether differences in performance are the result of construct irrelevant or relevant factors. The recommendations from this research focus on three main areas; that in order for on-screen assessments to be used in schools and utilise their considerable potential, the equivalence issue needs to be removed, the construct irrelevant factors need to be clearly identified and minimised and the construct relevant factors need to be enhanced. Finally a model of comparative modal dependability is offered, which can be used to contrast and compare the potential benefits and issues when changing assessment modes or item types are considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of two different policies for implementing new mathematics standards in two schools, for grades two through five, on student understanding of the equal sign. The study also examined teachers’ knowledge of the equal sign. The research used a mixed methods design to explore differences in student understanding of the equal sign as a result of how standards were implemented in two adjoining states with two different decisions as to when the standards would be implemented. This dissertation shares research that may be of interest to teachers, administrators, teacher educators and other stakeholders. The main constructs under investigation were student understanding of the equal sign, teacher knowledge regarding the equal sign including how it is taught and assessed, and the impact of different implementation schedules for new mathematics standards on student performance on their knowledge of the meaning of the equal sign - a standard that was not previously explicit in either state. The study was conducted in two adjoining Midwestern states in three separate schools (fifth grade students from one of the states are housed in a middle school building for overcrowding reasons and are equivalent to fifth grade students in an elementary setting). Each school as per their state mandates, followed the timeline for new mathematics standards implementation with one school in the fourth year of implementation and the other two (same district) in their first year. The sample was 1, 182 students in second, third, fourth and fifth grade and their forty-two classroom teachers. Students and teachers from the three schools were given the Mathematical <b>Equivalence</b> Knowledge <b>Assessment</b> (MEKA) as a measurement of teacher knowledge and student understanding of the equal sign. Data from teacher interviews and surveys were used to complement findings related to their students’ understanding of the equal sign and their classroom practices related to this topic. A hierarchical linear model was used to detect differences between student scores on the MEKA in each school in the two states. To determine the impact of teacher knowledge of the equal sign on student understanding of the equal sign an unconditional hierarchical linear model and a follow up ANCOVA were conducted using the MEKA results from both teacher and student participants. The same model was also used to detect significant differences found between student scores on the MEKA in one state and student scores on the MEKA from another state where each state followed a different timeline for new standard implementation. Findings from the study reveal that the different timeline for the implementation of the mathematics standards in the two states appears to have an impact on students’ understanding of the equal sign and indicated that teacher knowledge was not a significant predictor of student understanding of the equal sign. However, the results also show that state implementation timeline and a students’ grade level were significant predictors of student understanding of the equal sign. Through the interviews teachers were also found to have difficulty predicting their students’ performance on the MEKA, had varying definitions of the meaning of the equal sign, and many suggested that they did not explicitly teach or assess the meaning of the equal sign...|$|R
40|$|Background  The {{most widely}} used method for {{establishing}} the minimal erythema dose (MED) before narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy is time-consuming, inconvenient and may yield inconsistent results. Objectives  To assess the <b>equivalence</b> of MED <b>assessment</b> using a filtered xenon arc lamp UV source, a semiautomated MED tester, and a UV-opaque template method of MED determination with a panel of TL- 01 311 -nm UVB fluorescent tubes. Secondly, to gauge the current usage of MED testing, and the method used, in a large sample of U. K. phototherapy units. Thirdly, to assess variation in UV output of the semiautomated skin tester immediately after switching on to identify optimum warm-up time. Finally, to assess reproducibility of MED testing by assessing within-patient variability and interobserver variability of MED test results. Methods  Sixty-five patients about to undergo UVB phototherapy had their MED determined using three different methods. Within each patient we compared the values of MED determined by a semiautomated Durham MED tester, a panel of narrowband UVB lamps with a UV-opaque template constructed by a phototherapist, and a 310 -nm filtered xenon arc lamp with a liquid light guide. MED test results were assessed by clinical evaluation using a 6500 K colour temperature examination lamp. The output of the semiautomated MED tester was measured by spectroradiometer {{over a period of}} 20 min in order to identify the time to steady output. Reproducibility of MED testing with the semiautomated MED tester was carried out in 25 normal volunteers. All MEDs were assessed by at least two independent observers. A postal questionnaire was sent to 78 U. K. phototherapy units to assess routine practice concerning MED testing prior to narrowband UVB phototherapy. Results  The semiautomated MED tester showed consistency with the panel method (r = 0 · 92, panel MED = − 0 · 57 + 1 · 14 × Durham MED). The semiautomated MED tester produced a slightly lower MED result than the panel MED. Reproducibility tests showed high interobserver agreement (kappa value = 0 · 79), and high consistency for successive day testing (kappa value = 0 · 79). Questionnaires were returned from 67 of 78 phototherapy units (85...|$|R
40|$|The overrepresentation of {{minority}} students identified for special education services continues to plague schools {{and serves as a}} challenge for researchers and practitioners (Ferri 2 ̆ 6 Conner, 2005). Teacher nomination, office discipline referrals (ODR), and functional behavior assessments (FBA) continue to guide referral processes (Bradshaw, Mitchell, O’Brennen, 2 ̆ 6 Leaf, 2010; Eklund, et al., 2009; Mustian, 2010). These methods {{have been found to be}} riddled with inconsistencies. Practices used to identify students for behavioral and emotional interventions over-identify students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The use of a behavioral and emotional screener to make data-based decisions regarding placement and services could provide an objective assessment of student risk. The first chapter of this dissertation reviews methods used in the identification of students for behavioral and emotional support services. Additionally, the use of universal screening in conjunction with student self-report are proposed as tools for alleviating the overrepresentation {{of minority}} students in special education programs for behavioral and emotional disorders. The second chapter of this dissertation explores the measurement <b>equivalence</b> of Behavior <b>Assessment</b> System for Children, Second Edition (BASC- 2) Behavioral and Emotional Screening System Student form (BESS Student) across the Black, Hispanic, and White participants in the norming sample. The BESS Student as a universal screening tool is poised to alleviate the disproportionate number of children of color identified by schools as having behavior and emotional disorders. This instrument also provides an avenue to identify students with internalizing disorders who are often overlooked in present referral practices (Bradshaw, Buckley, 2 ̆ 6 Ialongo, 2008; Kataoka, Zhang, 2 ̆ 6 Wells, 2002). The findings of the measurement equivalence study suggests that the BESS Student is, as designed, identifying behavioral and emotional risk across each of the three groups explored. These findings support the use of a universal screening measure as the first step in a multi-step identification and intervention process. Following up with additional assessment to evaluate the specific areas of risk warranting intervention is pivotal to providing appropriate support services and promoting the behavioral and emotional health of students. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R
