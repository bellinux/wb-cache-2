25|$|Movie {{versions}} of camp TV shows {{in recent years}} have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In Grizzly Man (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of George Kuchar and his brother Mike Kuchar, ASS Studios, launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and Jen Miller, began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film Satan, <b>Hold</b> <b>My</b> Hand (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000, {{the band}} {{completed}} their debut lp I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me, which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters. The BBC {{used one of}} the tracks from this album, 'So Much As <b>Hold</b> <b>My</b> Hand', on their World Service as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom. In 2004, Magnétophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with The Breeders' Kelley Deal, was voted by listeners of BBC 6 Music as the Rebel Playlist winner on the Steve Lamacq show. Their second lp, The Man Who Ate The Man, was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-post rock lp of 2005 by Piccadilly Records. Shortly after its release, in late 2005, Magnétophone recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's Blue Room show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for BBC Radio 1's Rob da Bank show, both broadcast in November 2005.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{was mainly}} {{targeted}} towards its repetitiveness and {{the controls of}} the mobile version. Tom Christiansen of Gamezebo was mixed on the game, saying that there was [...] "nothing to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> attention" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "highly repetitive, overall." [...] Pocket Gamer, reviewing the mobile version, described its controls as [...] "floaty." ...|$|E

He's a very good person. And a tough guy, but look, he has to be. I think {{he is going to be}} a terrific {{president}} of France. But he does love <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> hand." ...|$|R

500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did something completely different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> line, so I knew I was exactly where I needed to be".|$|E
500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, {{that was the last}} time I played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump at the beginning of the song got all over me. I couldn't <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Moss, Peggy [...] "has the {{capability}} of being a Don Draper, and there can't be {{two of them in}} the office." [...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Arriving in Geneva on December 26, the Christmas Eve, Balzac {{stayed at}} the Auberge de l'Arc, near the Maison Mirabaud where the Hański family had settled for the season. She left a ring {{for him at the}} hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and {{described}} how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, [...] "with which I <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> paper, so that the thought of you clasps me tight." [...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|The couplet {{summarizes}} the sonnet in two lines, [...] "Therefore, like her, I sometime <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> tongue, because I would not dull {{you with my}} song". This is a clear statement from the poet vocalizing for the final time {{that he will not}} dull, bore, or represent his muse in a tedious way by creating a sonnet as exhausted and cliched as his contemporaries. In his analysis of the couplet, Stephen Booth compares the couplet to a proverb: [...] "My desire is not to dull you, if I cannot delight you." [...] Booth suggests that the poet does not wish to make his lover seem common with overabundant praise. Aitkins similarly suggests that the poet does not wish his praises to become annoying. Helen Vendler suggests that the poet uses proverbial language here to address the Fair Youth's seeming obsession with receiving praise; a personal plea would fall on deaf ears, so he makes his case rather impersonal.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 28 April 1789, Bounty lay about [...] south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He {{understood}} from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as loudly as [...] could in hopes of assistance". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to [...] "lay down again, and <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> tongue or I was a dead man".|$|E

500|$|Gaga was {{the most}} {{nominated}} artist at 2010's Video Music Awards with a record thirteen nominations, including two nods for Video of the Year (the first female artist to achieve this feat). She arrived in an Alexander McQueen dress and changed into a Giorgio Armani number before donning her third and final outfit of the evening: a dress, hat, boots, and purse made of raw meat. Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote. [...] "But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, explaining that [...] "after last week’s semi-misfire, it was reassuring to see Fringe back in good form this week, with a creepy case, a great villain, and a pertinent plot twist". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> interest at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted [...] "Inside Out" [...] {{is one of}} the [...] "ten remaining tracks [...] continue the trend [...] ", considering the song's lyrics as [...] "blatantly slutty" [...] and praising [...] "the much-welcomed piano breakdown". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that [...] "the [...] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is [...] "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] On her review of Femme Fatale, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "songs like the dark, slinky [...] "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along [...] "Till The World Ends", and the strange, flute-assisted digression [...] "Criminal" [...] add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed to <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> attention. If I heard it on the radio, I probably would change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "Inside Out" [...] reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.|$|E

500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will <b>hold</b> <b>my</b> own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E
