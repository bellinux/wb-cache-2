50|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>{{tractors}}</b> (mini tractors) are small, light tractors {{designed for}} use in domestic gardens and small estates. <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are designed for cutting grass, snow removal, and small property cultivation. In the U.S., the term riding lawn mower today often is {{used to refer to}} mid- or rear-engined machines. Front-engined tractor layout machines designed primarily for cutting grass and light towing are called lawn tractors; heavier-duty tractors of similar size are <b>garden</b> <b>tractors.</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are capable of mounting a wider array of attachments than lawn tractors. Unlike lawn tractors and rear-engined riding mowers, <b>garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are powered by horizontal-crankshaft engines with a belt-drive to transaxle-type transmissions (usually of four- or five-speeds, although some may also have two-speed reduction gearboxes, drive-shafts, or hydrostatic or hydraulic drives). <b>Garden</b> <b>tractors</b> from Wheel Horse, Cub Cadet, Economy (Power King), John Deere, Massey Ferguson and Case Ingersoll are built in this manner. The engines are generally a one- or two-cylinder petrol (gasoline) engines, although diesel engine models are also available, especially in Europe. Typically, diesel-powered <b>garden</b> <b>tractors</b> are larger and heavier-duty than gasoline-powered units and compare more similarly to compact utility tractors.|$|R

50|$|Visually, the {{distinction}} between a <b>garden</b> <b>tractor</b> and a lawn tractor is often hard to make - generally, garden tractors are more sturdily built, with stronger frames, 12-inch or larger wheels mounted with multiple lugs (most lawn tractors have a single bolt or clip on the hub), heavier transaxles, and ability to accommodate {{a wide range of}} front, belly, and rear mounted attachments.|$|E

In 1966, Jacobsen Chief Tractors started using a Peerless 2300 and steering was improved as well as a style change. Jacobsen made tractors for Oliver, Ford, Minneapolis-Moline, and White.Jacobsen also made light tractors aimed at the farm market, with innovative attachments to make the tractors more useful and to make them qualify for tax breaks.Textron purchased Jacobsen around 1975, but continued to produce Jacobsen garden tractors into the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The {{demand for}} <b>garden</b> <b>tractors</b> was rapidly {{increasing}} as households with small gardens found them rather inexpensive, practical {{to use for}} a variety of chores, and they were economical to maintain. By 1956, the business had become very successful. The company began to build a range of small to large lawn and <b>garden</b> <b>tractors,</b> in addition to a line of riding lawn mowers. A characteristic of the products was their standardization through the years. The most popular model and year was the R-J58 Wheel Horse 1958, it came without a mowing deck, but one could be added.|$|R

5000|$|The final {{series of}} Cub Cadets International {{produced}} was the models 482, 580, 582, 582S, 682, 782, and 982. The model 482 was powered by an eleven-horsepower single-cylinder Briggs and Stratton engine and a four speed-belt-driven transmission. The three speed direct drive 582 {{and the four}} speed belt driven 582S was powered by a twin-cylinder sixteen-horsepower Briggs and Stratton engine. The hydrostatic models 682 and 782 were both powered by a seventeen-horsepower Kohler engine. The difference between the model 682 and model 782 was the model 782 had hydraulic lift and hubcaps and a high back seat while the model 682 did not. This was the first series of Cub Cadets to feature twin-cylinder engines. Another unique Cub Cadet model, the 982, was built on a longer frame, giving it a longer wheelbase (6.5 inches longer than the normal garden tractors produced). This {{was known as the}} first super <b>garden</b> <b>tractor.</b> the extra wheelbase gave it more stability. Also, the 982 employed larger tires which gave it a wider stance. The hydrostatic 982 was powered by a 19.9-horsepower Onan engine. Because of its size, International classified the 982 as a super <b>garden</b> <b>tractor.</b> According to sales brochures, the 982 was designed to maintain commercial and estate properties. This series of Cub Cadets can easily be distinguished by International's deviation of the white and yellow paint scheme to red paint designed to match their big tractors for farm equipment dealers. At this time OPE dealers marketed yellow and white Cub Cadets. This production ran from November 1979 to 1981 until International sold its lawn and <b>garden</b> <b>tractor</b> line to MTD. International also produced several lawn tractors beginning in 1972. Cub Cadet advertising at the time harped on their thorough testing by [...] "boys - acknowledged by many as the world's worst destructive force!". Cub Cadets became known for their dependability and rugged construction.|$|E
