These matters are not always explicitly stated, but they underlie the challenges felt by all to adapt to new realities. Adaptation, the article thankfully concludes is ultimately a shared experience in {{that we want to}} and can help one another. A new way of integration is proposed, that doesn't cower in the face of increasing complexity, and plurality, and resulting hybridisations - all characteristic of the age. Commencing with locating ourselves in relation to modernity and globalization, the article proceeds to examine the significance of Bildung; ‘meta-transitioning' as Dowson terms it; and the call for integrity. The second-half of the article considers such matters as the place of corporate responsibility; leadership today; ‘cooperant’-style volunteering and work experiences for students; and the employment market in the face of inequality. Here also Paul Dowson sets out to introduce some of the key ideas covered in his forthcoming (2015) textbook: Personal and professional development for business students. The contribution of the book is locating PD in our contemporary global context, which challenges traditional dualities reflected in thinking and approaches such as: personal versus professional; us versus them; mind versus body; and sense versus sensibility. True to his reflective style and teaching practice and in pursuit of <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> surrounding, sometimes pressing realities, Dowson's intention is to provide new information or new ways of looking at the challenges we face in the Twenty First Century...|$|E

A content analysis is applied to 586 messages posted by ten political leaders in two different time lapses, one of them characterized by the attention paid by media to a political scandal. Criteria regarding type of messages and discourse directionality are followed. Results indicate that most messages are basically unidirectional, with few addressing other users.

40|$|This thesis {{intervenes}} {{in current}} critical debates about space, place and landscape in late-twentieth and twenty-first century British and Irish poetry, by examining models of excavation in selected work by Geoffrey Hill, Ciaran Carson, Geraldine Monk and Alice Oswald. It {{argues that the}} influence of the spatial turn on literary criticism over the last thirty years has led to the deployment of a limited set of spatial tropes as analytical tools for interpreting the spaces and places of poetry. By deploying excavation as a critical method it seeks to challenge existing approaches that tend to privilege ideas of space over time, and socio-spatial practices over literary traditions of writing place. In doing so it develops a new model for reading contemporary poetries of place that asserts the importance of locating spatial criticism within temporal and literary-historical frameworks. The four poets examined in the thesis exhibit a common concern with unearthing the strata of language as well as material space. Starting from a premise that excavation always works over the ground of language as well as landscape it investigates the literary traditions of landscape writing in which each of these poets might be said to be embedded. After surveying the critical field the thesis sets out four principles of excavation that it argues are transformed and renewed by each of these poets: the relationship between past and present; recovery and interpretation of finds; processes of unearthing; exhumation of the dead. The subsequent chapters contend that these conventions are put into question by Geoffrey Hillâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s sedimentary poetics, Ciaran Carsonâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s parodic stratigraphy, Geraldine Monkâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s collaborations with the dead, and Alice Oswaldâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s geomorphology of a self-excavating earth. The critical method that underpins the discussion in each of the chapters is also excavatory in that it unearths both the historical and literary strata of specific sites (the Midlands, Belfast, East Lancashire, Dartmoor and the Severn estuary) and resonances in the work of earlier poetic excavators (Paul Celan, Edward Thomas, Gerard Manley Hopkins, William Wordsworth, Dante Alighieri and Homer). Through careful exegesis of these poets and their precursors this thesis demonstrates that by transforming existing forms of excavation, contemporary poetry is able to renew its <b>deep</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> place and literary history.

These {{bring together}} members of the different international nodes (in 2012 Vision Forum ran 10 nodes) and interact with local institutions and art organizations. This means that the research {{carried out in the}} individual nodes have started cross referencing and exchanging methodology between each other. Vision Forum, through its structure, develops modes of communication and knowledge production that make use of current technology. The nodes of the network also allow a <b>deeper</b> <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> their audiences that, in their turn, are inscribed into in numerous interconnected networks. It has become increasingly clear that the network focuses on research about how art uses, retains, distributes and develops knowledge along with how this can be fed back into the everyday lives of art's audience. This ties in with Vision Forum's founder Per Hüttner's work that can be exemplified by projects like I am a Curator”, Democracy and Desire and (In)Visible Dialogues and have allowed them to participate in collective work in the Caribbean and in biennials in Brazil. The methodology builds on Deleuzian ideas about knowledge and creativity and has been developed in Vision Forum’s nodes and networks, particularly in OuUnPo. This idea of exchange is based on co-producing knowledge with the collaborating institutions and audiences, rather than a top down knowledge distribution. The strategy that they call [...] "collapsing the global with the local" [...] is currently being developed by the network in collaboration with Global Art and the Museum at ZKM in Karlsruhe.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a practical}} theology study of spiritual companionship with the saints, working with Teresa of Avila as a case study. Teresa’s writing reflects a robust understanding and practice of spiritual companionship with saints. While contemporary literature on spiritual companionship exists {{and the notion of}} friendship with saints can be found in some theological works on the communion of saints, practical theology studies that attend to the rich potential and theological meaning of friendship with saints have been lacking. This dissertation seeks to fill that gap, arguing that the relationship of saints to contemporary Christians is one of companionship within the communion of saints. This allows saints to serve as spiritual companions to contemporary Christians in ways that are analogous to contemporary personal relationships of spiritual companionship. This is an interdisciplinary study, working across disciplines of practical theology and spirituality studies while deeply engaging historical studies. Due to the importance of historical context in spirituality studies and concerns with issues of appropriation, the practical theology methodology is modified, strengthening the historical theology movement. The dissertation provides a textual and historical-contextual analysis of Teresa of Avila’s understandings and practices of friendship, including friendship with the saints. Current literature on spiritual companionship is explored and brought into a mutually critical <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> Teresa’s own descriptions—demonstrating common themes of journey and intimacy, affirmation and challenge, and personal transformation and growth in relationship with God. These themes are placed in <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> two contemporary understandings of the communion of saints, Anglican theological reflections based on liturgical practice and Elizabeth Johnson’s systematic treatment, yielding a model for companionship with saints that is grounded in norms of mutuality, deep knowledge, mutually critical <b>dialogue,</b> and living <b>with</b> differences. These norms suggest personal practices of companionship as well as contemplative pedagogical techniques for teaching the saints in an academic setting The dissertation thus presents a practical theology study of spiritual companionship with the saints, rooted in a <b>deep</b> historical-contextual <b>dialogue</b> <b>with</b> Teresa of Avila. It seeks also to demonstrate the value of increased attention to historical studies in practical theology methodology...|$|R

They play major role in spermatogenesis and hormone production. They also represent secondary gender symbols and therefore are important for the personality forming of young individuals. Testicular cancer stand for about 1 - 1. 8 % of all malignant tumour diseases in males and occur most often between 15 - 35 years of age. This bachelor's work gives information on the anatomy and physiology of testes, the risk factors and causes for the occurrence of testicular cancer, and also about the symptoms and diagnostics. This thesis also deals with the role the nurse has in general practitioner's office for children and adolescents regarding the prevention of testicular cancer, preventive check-ups and self-examination. Work aim First aim of this work is to map {{the role of the}} nurse in general practitioner's office for children and adolescents regarding the prevention of testicular cancer. The research question posed was: What {{is the role of the}} nurse in general practitioner's office for children and adolescents regarding the prevention of testicular cancer? Second aim was to find out about the awareness on testicular cancer in boys 15 - 19. First hypothesis says: Awareness about the prevention of testicular cancer varies with age. Second hypothesis: Self-examination of testes changes with age. Used methods Qualitative research was used for the first part of the assignment, while a questionnaire and method of <b>deep</b> <b>dialogues</b> <b>with</b> the nurses working at general practitioner office for children and adolescents in South Bohemia was conducted for the second part. The dialogs were recorded on a dictaphone and then transcribed word for word. In the second part quantitative research was used through a method of questioning and technique of non-standardised questionnaire. The questionnaire was filled in by boys aged 15 - 19 living in South Bohemia. The parameter test Anova, a type of scattering analysis, was used on the data. "Its basis lies in the total scattering of the followed variable being divided into scattering within individual selections and scattering between them. If the scattering between the selections is improbably large it points towards significant influence of factor a (Budíková, 2010, s. 181). " Results The transcribed dialogs were analysed by open coding, by the pen and paper method. Five categories were defined: Education, testicular cancer, testes examination, patient dispensary. Subcategories with major data encoded, were assigned to each category. Analysis of the non-standardised questionnaire gave rise to ten resulting graphs with respondent answers. The graphs were consequently described. First hypothesis saying that the knowledge about the prevention of testicular cancer changes with age was not proven. The second hypothesis saying that the process of self-examination changes with age was not proven either. Conclusions The first research part proves that nurses working in general practitioner office for children and adolescents do educate the patient on this subject. The respondent possessed basic information on the subject of prostatic cancer and stated that testes examination is conducted in the surgeries. Scientific literature for this subject was recommended by only two of nine respondents. The respondents stated that testes examination and education about the subject of testicular cancer is conducted, although the second part of the research showed that the boys are almost not at all familiar with the subject. Furthermore, testicular examination was not conducted for most of them at the practitioner's office. The second part of research showed that the boys aged 15 - 19 let possess insufficient information on the prevention of testicular cancer. Most had almost no knowledge on what is involved in such prevention...|$|R
