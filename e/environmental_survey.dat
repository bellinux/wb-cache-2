5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An <b>environmental</b> <b>survey</b> of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{evidence on the}} validity and reliability of cross-national <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys,</b> an aspect that has not found much attention so far. Methods. Validity can be checked in examining whether cross-national differences in environmental attitudes are in accordance with theoretical hypotheses. For example, a study can claim some validity if concern about inadequate sanitation is strongly negatively correlated with the actual extent of access to sanitation in a country. Results. Several validity checks were undertaken for the Gallup, Gallup, and Dunlap (1993) survey, all of which tend to support its validity. Next, the reliability of cross-national <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys</b> was checked. Both Pearson and Spearman rank correlations were run for similar questions from differing studies. Most correlations were low and statistically insignificant, however, thus putting some doubt on the reliability of cross-national <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys,</b> at least {{with respect to the}} questions examined. Conclusions. The findings support the validity of cross-national <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys,</b> but not their reliability. Future surveys should be designed such that validity and reliability checks become easier to undertake...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of {{remotely piloted aircraft}} systems has sharply increased for both amateur and professional purposes. Rapid technological development is driven by consumer grade applications. On the professional side, RPAS technologies have already been widely used in different fields of environmental resource management, especially in agriculture. Due to the recent price development, technology has become also attainable for less financially productive purposes, such as <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys.</b> By applying RPAS technologies in <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys</b> of forest industry, {{a substantial amount of}} fieldwork can be avoided thus leading to financial savings and possibly to more comparative measurements and results. To test this hypothesis, three different sub-disciplines of forest industry <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys</b> were conducted by both traditional fieldwork and by applying manual and automatic remote sensing methods. Aerial imagery was recorded with a multispectral sensor attached to consumer grade remotely piloted aircraft. Sub-discipline specific attributes were measured and compared to estimates derived from aerial imagery and three dimensional models. It was proved that by using even relatively low-priced instruments the quality of the data was more than adequate for remote sensing purposes. An automated workflows to derive measurements from the subjects of interest did not perform satisfactory, but manual interpretation of imagery gave promising results. It can be assumed that RPAS technologies are able to provide savings for conducting <b>environmental</b> <b>surveys.</b> Manual interpretation was at that moment seen superior to automated workflows...|$|R

2500|$|The Futurama movie [...] showcases {{the fight}} between {{conservationism}} and {{the interests of}} big business; the construction of the universe's largest giant mini golf course (headed by Amy's father, Leo Wong) threatens to destroy 12% (an entire branch) of the Milky Way. An <b>environmental</b> <b>survey</b> headed by Professor Farnsworth and the Futurama crew discovers an asteroid full of primitive life, orbiting a violet dwarf star. However, Farnsworth has been bribed by Leo, and declares the destruction 'environmentally friendly', leading to plans for the dwarf star to be imploded, creating a black hole. This leads to two groups trying to sabotage this plan – a group of eco-feminists, who are joined by Amy, Leela and LaBarbara Conrad, who start destroying equipment, machines and sections of the golf course, and even accidentally kill Nixon's beloved vice-president, Agnew. The second group is the Legion of Madfellows, a secret organization of mind readers, of which Fry joins. They prophesize a new green age, headed by a resurgence in the life force Chi, which they believe will be started by the asteroid and the dwarf star. A resurgence in the Chi would halt the extinction rate, and increase the diversity of life by preserving endangered species DNA and reintroducing extinct life forms through the Encyclopod. Fry is given the responsibility to preserve and protect it at all costs.|$|E
