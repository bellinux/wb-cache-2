50|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>sun</b> <b>scalding</b> is fundamentally simple: reduce {{the intensity of}} the sun, or block the sun completely.|$|R

50|$|Frost {{crack and}} <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> are {{examples}} of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree, depending on the severity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>scald</b> is the {{freezing}} of bark following high {{temperatures in the}} winter season, resulting in permanent visible damage to bark. Fruits may also be damaged. In the northern hemisphere, it is also called southwest injury.|$|R
50|$|For fruit {{the most}} {{important}} part of avoiding <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> is to be aware of where the fruit has been during its growth. If the fruit grew in the shade then exposing it to the sun will be likely to yield damage to the produce. Because of the importance of keeping shaded fruits out of the sun, leaves of fruit plants should be monitored for wilting and disease. If the leaves that shade a fruit die, the fruit will be exposed and in danger of <b>sun</b> <b>scald.</b> Another measure that can be taken to avoid damage is covering the fruits with straw or screen to block the sun.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} method {{used to prevent}} <b>sun</b> <b>scalding</b> on the trunks of trees is to wrap the tree {{up to the first}} branch with white paper {{overlapping}} approximately thirty three percent each time around the tree. The white paper is effective in reflecting the <b>heat</b> of the <b>sun</b> off the tree. The paper should be applied after the tree has gone dormant for the winter and taken off before it becomes active again. If the paper is left on too long it can interfere with the growth of the tree and harbor insects that may damage the tree.|$|R
50|$|When <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> {{appears on}} trees {{it is most}} {{frequently}} a result of reflected light off the snow during winter months. The damage {{in this case will}} appear as sunken or dead bark on the trunk of the tree, then later in the tree’s life the bark might fall away revealing dead tissue in the tree's cambium layer. This damage will typically be found on the south west facing side of the tree’s trunk. It can be found on other sides of the tree if there is light reflection from other sources, like man made structures or reflective rock faces. After a tree is afflicted by <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> it becomes much more vulnerable to decay organisms. The plant will create walls around the affected area, but sometimes {{it is not enough to}} block the infections. The leaves of the tree are also affected by <b>sun</b> <b>scald,</b> particularly on a bright sunny day following a period of warm cloudy humidity. The damage to the leaves will start as bronzing of the epidermis between the veins of the leaf, and if the sunny conditions persist the tissue of the leaf will die.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>scald</b> on fruit appears when a {{fruit is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} after being in the shade {{for an extended period}} of time. The damage to fruit will often lead to the death of the fruit by consumption from insects, animals, bacteria, or fungi. This is the case if the defenses of the fruit are rendered useless, which is the case when the outer skin is damaged to the point that the cell walls are either gone, or so thin that the plant’s enemies can get through it. Some times the <b>sun</b> <b>scalding</b> is a more internal damage and, although it destroys the fruit in a productive sense, the fruit is able fend off attacks and recover if placed back into an ideal setting.|$|R
50|$|Frost crack or Southwest canker {{is a form}} of {{tree bark}} damage {{sometimes}} found on thin barked trees, visible as vertical fractures on the southerly facing surfaces of tree trunks. Frost crack is distinct from <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> and <b>sun</b> crack and physically differs from normal rough-bark characteristics as seen in mature oaks, pines, poplars and other tree species.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} light a tree {{receives}} on its southwest side is correlated {{with the amount of}} <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> the tree endures. Reducing the {{amount of light}} the tree is exposed to by planting a shrub or bush strategically to shade the southwest side can be less effective than wrapping or painting, but can have better aesthetic qualities for landscaping.|$|R
5|$|Organic {{apples are}} {{commonly}} {{produced in the}} United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple <b>sun</b> <b>scalding.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whitewash {{is applied}} to trees, {{especially}} fruit trees, to prevent <b>sun</b> <b>scald.</b> Most often only the lower trunk is painted. In Poland painting the whole trunk is also said {{to help keep the}} body of the tree cool in late winter and early spring months and hence help prevent fruit trees from blooming too soon, i.e. when warm sunny days could promote rapid tree warming, rising sap and bloom and intermittent frosty nights could damage outer tree rings and destroy the young buds and blossoms.|$|R
40|$|Physiological {{disorders}} are plant diseases caused by non-living agents. Other terms {{for this group}} of {{disorders are}} abiotic diseases or noninfectious diseases. Physiological disorders are often confused with pathogen-caused diseases {{but they do not}} spread from plant to plant as do diseases caused by living organisms. Landscape plants are often exposed to toxic materials, mechanical damage, nutritional stress, homeowner neglect and other stress factors in the urban environment. This 4 -color extension publication highlights the following physiological disorders of landscape plants: <b>sun</b> <b>scald,</b> drought, lightning injury, winter injury, root girdling, iron chlorosis, salt injury, herbicide injury and air pollution...|$|R
50|$|Another popular {{misconception}} {{is that a}} topped tree {{will benefit}} from increased light penetration. The removal of {{a large portion of}} a trees canopy can have detrimental effects. When a tree is topped, newly formed bark may be susceptible to <b>sun</b> <b>scald.</b> Prolonged exposure can severely damage the bark, thus creating an attractive home for decay causing organisms. Evidence of decay may be the presence of conks (fungal fruiting structures) on the outer tree bark. The loss of leaves reduces a tree's ability to photosynthesize and produce food. If a large tree is unable to produce enough sugars to feed the roots, it will slowly die from starvation.|$|R

40|$|Tomato {{diseases}} occur {{every year}} in every garden to some extent. This NebGuide discusses the symptoms {{and management of the}} most common and damaging ones in Nebraska. Gardening is a favorite summer activity of backyard farmers and nothing tastes better than a ripe, home grown tomato. The popularity of local farmer 2 ̆ 7 s markets has increased tremendously in the 90 s. Tomatoes are a mainstay of the backyard garden and the Saturday morning farmer 2 ̆ 7 s market. Being a successful gardener requires knowledge, skill and persistence. Every summer, nature pits the skills of the gardener against weather, insects and diseases. These challenges test our ability to grow plants free of blemishes from <b>sun</b> <b>scald</b> or blossom end rot, disease spots and rots and holes from chewing insects. In the end many gardeners feel it is worth all the time, expense and effort to raise that perfect tomato...|$|R
40|$|Distinctive basidiomes of Pycnoporus sp. were {{observed}} on 5 - 6 -year-old living Paulownia trees at two commercial plantations in Western Australia. The basidiomes were erupting through the bark, which readily peeled away {{to expose the}} rotting wood beneath. Based on internal transcribed spacer-polymerase chain reaction, the fungus was identified as Pycnoporus cinnabarinus. Under-bark inoculation of 3 -year-old Paulownia fortunei trees in the glasshouse, with mycelium isolated from basidiomes on trees at the commercial plantations, resulted {{in the formation of}} dark lesions and the pathogen was re-isolated ahead of the lesion front. Benomyl and cyprodinil were the most effective fungicides at inhibiting the growth of mycelium in vitro. This is the first report of Pyc. cinnabarinus acting as a pathogen on Paulownia trees. It is likely that the pathogen enters living trees through pruning wounds or damage from <b>sun</b> <b>scald.</b> Further work is required to confirm methods of control in the field...|$|R

Some Argyroxiphium, including the well-known Haleakala and Mauna Kea silverswords, live in harsh alpine desert-like conditions of <b>heat,</b> <b>sun,</b> wind, and aridity, and are drought-adapted plants capable of storing water as a gel in leaf structures which are normally air pockets in other plants. However, A. grayanum is a bog plant adapted to very different conditions - excessive moisture, lack of regular sunlight, and cool temperatures, and its leaves are non-succulent {{like those of the}} related genus Dubautia.|$|R
