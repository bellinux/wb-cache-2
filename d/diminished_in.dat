5|$|Hamhuis' {{role with}} the Predators was <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> his final few seasons in Nashville with the {{emergence}} of younger defencemen Shea Weber and Ryan Suter as the club's top two defencemen. With Weber and Suter providing most of the offence from the blueline, Hamhuis was used primarily as a shutdown defenceman, matching up against opposing team's top forward units and leading the club in shorthanded ice time, while seeing limited powerplay time.|$|E
5|$|The Theme of Sicily (θέμα Σικελίας, thema Sikelias) was {{responsible}} for Sicily and the imperial possessions in south-western Italy (Calabria). Once the bastion of Byzantine naval strength in the West, by the late 9th century it had greatly <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> strength, and disappeared after the final loss of Taormina in 902. Distinct tourmarchai are attested for Sicily proper and Calabria.|$|E

5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|As his Census {{obligations}} <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> 1872, Walker reconsidered {{becoming an}} editorialist and even briefly entertained {{the idea of}} becoming a shoe manufacturer with his brother-in-law back in North Brookfield. However, in October 1872, he was unanimously offered to fill Daniel Coit Gilman's vacated post at Yale's recently established Sheffield Scientific School led by the mineralogist George Jarvis Brush.

5|$|As {{the role}} of native cavalry grew, that of Roman/Latin cavalry <b>diminished.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1st century BC, Roman cavalry was phased out altogether. After the Social War, the socii were all granted Roman citizenship, the Latin alae abolished, and the socii {{recruited}} into the legions. Furthermore, Roman equestrians were no longer required to perform cavalry service after this time. The late Republican legion was thus probably bereft of cavalry (a tiny cavalry force of 120 men was probably added back to the legion under Augustus).|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

The name of the Native tribe was changed from the Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E

Although Alt US40 has <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> importance from its original status as the National Road {{with the construction of}} I-68, it remains an important route for local traffic and serves as the Main Streets of Grantsville and Frostburg.|$|E
5|$|After the Báb was {{executed}} in 1850, {{a group of}} Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah Nasser-al-Din Shah, {{in retaliation for the}} Báb's execution. Bahá'u'lláh condemned the plan; however, any moderating influence that he may have had was <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> June 1851 when he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's request, returning only after Amir Kabir's fall from power. On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the Bábí community that were encouraged and orchestrated by the government. During this time many Bábís were killed, and many more, including Bahá'u'lláh, were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál ("black pit"), an underground dungeon of Tehran.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of John IV of Portugal in 1656, various Spanish offensives were {{launched}} against Portuguese territory, mainly from Extremadura, but also from Galicia, where a second front was opened to force the Portuguese to divide their forces. The Spanish Army of Extremadura, recently reinforced with many veterans of the war against France, was commanded by Francisco de Tuttavilla, Duke of San German, who appointed Gaspar Téllez-Girón y Sandoval, Duke of Osuna, as general of artillery and his second-in-command. In 1657 they laid siege to the Portuguese town of Olivença with 8,000 soldiers and 29 cannons and occupied the town, despite a desperate attempt by the Count of San Lorenzo, military governor of Alentejo, to dislodge them by launching a surprise attack himself on the Spanish town of Badajoz. Mourão fell into Spanish hands shortly thereafter. San Lorenzo was then dismissed from his command and replaced by dom Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos, who easily managed to retake both Mourão and Olivença in the following months, since their Spanish garrisons had been considerably <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> order to move troops to face the French armies in Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, George Washington {{owned and}} raced a Narragansett Pacer, while in 1772, Edmund Burke asked an American friend for a pair. Paul Revere {{possibly}} rode a Pacer during his 1775 ride {{to warn the}} Americans of a British march. The extinction was due mainly to the breed being sold in such large numbers to sugarcane planters in the West Indies that breeding stock was severely <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> the United States. The few horses that were left were crossbred to create and improve other breeds and the pure strain of the Narragansett soon became extinct. North Carolina was also a noted to have breeders of the Narragansett, with breeding stock having {{been brought to the}} area as early as 1790 by early pioneers. The last known Pacer, a mare, died around 1880.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Romans {{hoped to}} resolve the {{situation}} by diplomatic means: Corbulo and Ummidius Quadratus, the governor of Syria, both sent embassies to Vologases, proposing that he give up hostages, as was customary during negotiations, to ensure good faith. Vologases, himself preoccupied by the revolt of his son Vardanes which forced him to withdrew his troops from Armenia, readily complied. A period of inactivity ensued, while the Armenian issue remained in limbo. Corbulo used this lull to restore his troops' discipline and combat readiness, which had <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> the peaceful garrisons of the East. According to Tacitus, Corbulo discharged all who were old or in ill health, kept the entire army under canvas in the harsh winters of the Anatolian plateau to acclimatize them to the snows of Armenia, and enforced a strict discipline, punishing deserters by death. At the same time however, he took care to be constantly present amongst his men, sharing their hardships.|$|E

5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, Baker redeveloped {{a center}} over the Caribbean Sea off {{southern}} Cuba, and re-intensified to tropical storm status. On August 27, Baker affected the Pinar del Río Province with 60mph (75km/h) winds, {{and then turned}} northward over the southern Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, Baker re-strengthened to hurricane intensity; reconnaissance and ship reports suggest the hurricane attained a second peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h) on August 30. The minimum central pressure was 979 mbar (28.92 inHg) on this date. The cyclone <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> intensity prior to landfall. On August 31, the hurricane struck Gulf Shores, Alabama as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds estimated near 85mph (140km/h). The estimated central pressure at landfall was 980 mbar (28.95 inHg). Baker moved inland over Alabama and dissipated over southeastern Missouri on September 1.|$|E
5|$|On May28, the NHC {{once again}} {{initiated}} outlooks {{on the system}} as convection quickly redeveloped. Around 1500UTC, they designated the system as Tropical Depression One while it was located about 310mi (500km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. Upon being classified, the depression exhibited deep convective activity, with the center of circulation situated on the northwestern edge. The redevelopment of the system {{was the result of}} low wind shear and warm waters, up to , from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, convection began to diminish as the depression tracked into an area of progressively higher shear and cooler waters. By this time, the system was embedded within the westerlies between a subtropical ridge to the southeast and a trough to the northwest. Around 2330UTC, a QuickSCAT satellite pass over the depression found tropical storm-force winds; however, the winds were determined to have been affected by rain and therefore not representative of the depression's actual intensity. Following the satellite pass, the center of circulation became partially exposed to the northwest and the area of convection associated with the depression <b>diminished</b> <b>in</b> area.|$|E
