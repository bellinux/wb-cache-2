25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
