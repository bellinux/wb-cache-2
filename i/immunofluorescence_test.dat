40|$|Murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{directed against}} type-specific antigens of influenza A and B viruses {{have been shown}} to be useful diagnostic reagents for the detection of influenza viruses by <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>testing</b> of nasopharyngeal cells. We have developed fluorescent focus assays utilizing these antibodies in cell culture chamber slides and shell vials for the rapid diagnosis of influenza A and B.

Virus isolation was compared with <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>testing</b> in 38 of the 160 specimens. Compared with virus isolation, 24 -h cell culture chamber slide assays had a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 96 %. <b>Immunofluorescence</b> <b>testing</b> of nasopharyngeal cells was only 38 % sensitive and 91 % specific.

Capripoxvirus strains are often recognized by how the main target host responds. They cannot be distinguished using routine laboratory tests such as virus neutralisation test, <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>test</b> or agar gel immunodiffusion test. They, however, can be isolated by using the HinDill restriction enzymes to separate their DNA. Comparisons of fragmented DNA sequences from different strains showed that all capripoxviruses have a very similar nucleotide sequence homology. Strains were also proven to not all be host-specific. All Capripoxvirus DNA are double-stranded with lengths of around 150 kbp. Strains from goatpox and sheeppox share at least 147 genes; LSDV have an extra 9 genes that are non-functional in GTPV and SPPV. Strains of GTPV, SPPV, and LSDV generally have genome identities similar by at least 96%.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThree {{methods used}} for the {{detection}} of BK virus in urine specimens, the indirect <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>test,</b> the dot enzyme immunoassay and the DNA-DNA hybridization assay, were compared by testing specimens from 49 immunocompromised patients.

The <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>test</b> was found to be the simplest one to perform; the DNA-DNA hybridization assay displayed exquisite sensitivity; and the easy reading of the dot enzyme immunoassay did not require the specialized training inherent to immunofluorescence assays. The dot enzyme immunoassay might therefore be the most practical method for screening urine specimens of immunocompromised patients, especially when the sediment is poor in cells.
