One factor that may have con-tributed to mask the knowledge that subjects may have about the task is that subjects were only allowed to push the reward away from them, which is a particularly difficult ac-tion for primates in certain problem solving situations. We presented five orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), two chim-panzees (Pan troglodytes), two bonobos (Pan paniscus), and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a modified trap tube that allowed subjects to push or rake the reward with the tool. In two additional follow-up tests, we <b>inverted</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> 180 ◦ rendering the trap nonfunctional and also presented subjects with the original task {{in which they were}} required to push the reward out of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> Results showed that {{all but one of the}} subjects preferred to rake the reward. Two orangutans and one chimpanzee (all of whom preferred to rake the reward), consistently avoided the trap only when it was functional but failed the original task. These find-ings suggest that some great apes may have some causal knowledge about the trap-tube task. Their success, how-ever, depended on whether they were allowed to choose certain tool-using actions...|$|R

One gram of small intestine and MLN tissues (0.5 [*]g each) was homogenised in 1 ml TE buffer (10 mM Tri, 1 mM EDTA, pH[*] 8.0) in a tissue homogenizer and allowed to settle for 30 min. To 750 μl of supernatant transferred to a fresh sterile microfuge, lysozyme (Sigma, MO, USA) (final concentration 10 mg/ml) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The suspension was mixed with 10 % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (final concentration 1 mg/ml) and proteinase K (Sigma, MO, USA) (final concentration 2 mg/ml) and incubated at 56 °C overnight (16 – 20 h). The enzyme digested samples were gently mixed with 0.4 volume of 5 M potassium acetate, kept in ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 9600 × g for 10 min.

Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - Inoculation loops - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 d if the optional second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by <b>inverting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by <b>inverting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. - *Carry out all subsequent steps in a sterile environment*. - vi. Remove the supernatant, and immerse the entire open tube in 70 % ethanol for 10 sec. Remove the supernatant. Air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 - 15 min. - vii. Dissolve the dried DNA in 200 μL of sterile H 2 O or TE buffer. - viii. Aliquot DNA dissolved in H 2 O and freeze at - 20 °C for short-term storage. DNA dissolved in TE buffer is stable for at least several weeks at 4 °C. - ix. Remove an aliquot of the DNA, and estimate the concentration and purity of the DNA. 5. Transform cells using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. *Use only chemical transformation with competent cells, not electroporation, because increased recombination following electroporation has been observed. The efficiency of transfection using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA strongly depends on the growth state of recipient cells, concentration of calcium and phosphates, concentration of DNA, pH, temperature, and duration of the precipitation reaction. It is advisable to prepare several buffers with slightly different pH values (see Step 5. iii below) *. - i. Plate CHO DG 44 cells in three 75 -cm 2 flasks the day before transfection. - ii. Replace the medium in the flasks with fresh medium 4 h before transfection. Cells should be 50 %- 80 % confluent and be in the log phase of growth for efficient transfection. - iii. Prepare three reaction tubes. In each one, dilute 7 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA (from Step 4. vii) in 0. 5 mL of CaCl 2 (250 mM), mixed with 0. 5 mL of TR buffer, varying only in its pH value (6. 95, 7. 05, or 7. 10). Incubate the reactions for 30 min at room temperature. - iv. Add each DNA mixture dropwise to a flask of cells (from Step 5. ii). Incubate the flasks for 24 h. - v. Replace the transfection medium with F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with 10 % defined FBS, and incubate the cells for an additional 24 h. - vi. Replace the medium with selective medium (F- 12 medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine, but containing 10 % dialyzed FBS). Stable transformants are obtained after 2 wk of selection. **Enrichment of Stable Cells with Large-Copy-Number Inserts Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting** *This procedure describes the selection of CHO cells expressing high amounts of exogenous DHFR from a pool of stably transformed cells using cell sorting, a strategy to enrich for cells harboring large chromosome insertions of the DHFR-containing transgene. Selection is based on binding a fluorescent cell-permeable DHFR inhibitor to the pool of cellular DHFR. Cells with high fluorescence show a high total expression of DHFR, which correlates roughly with copy number (as well as chromosome position effects) *. 6. Select and sort the cells as follows: - i. Grow cells in 25 -cm 2 tissue culture flasks until they are in log phase. - ii. Replace the growth medium with fresh F- 12 (HAM) medium supplemented with FBS (10 %) and FMTX (20 μM). Add glycine (100 μM), hypoxanthine (30 μM), and thymine (30 μM) to the medium to relieve the toxic effects of FMTX. Incubate the cells for 8 h. - iii. Harvest cells by trypsinization, and keep them in sterile PBS on ice. - *Because FMTX is retained in cells at concentrations high enough to cause damage, cells are viable in PBS on ice only for several hours*. - iv. Sort the cells into flasks or 96 -well plates. - v. Grow enough cells for freezing, and freeze them after screening. 7. Prepare a large number of clones for screening or subcloning as follows: - i. Plate cells produced in Step 6 onto a Petri dish at a low density, ideally, 20 - 100 cells per 150 -mm dish. To minimize cross-contamination among neighboring colonies, make sure that the density of plating is low enough and that the colonies are spread out. Use several Petri dishes, titrating the cell concentration by factors of 2 - 3 between dishes, to ensure optimal cell density. - *The action of the trypsin (Step 6. iii) must have progressed enough to ensure the absence of cell clumping and the predominance of single cells in suspension. This is aided by mechanical agitation or by vigorous pipetting of the culture*. - ii. Return the cells to the incubator, and if possible, avoid moving the dishes (particularly after the first few days) for ~ 10 d to allow good-size colonies to form. - *Movement of the dishes will cause cells to dislodge and form satellite colonies and/or a lawn of dispersed cells, increasing cross-contamination*. - iii. Allow the cells to grow until the colonies are well-defined and visible by eye while avoiding overgrowth to minimize colony cross-contamination. Mark individual isolated colonies {{on the bottom of the}} plate with a permanent marker. View the colonies under low magnification to check for the presence of undesirable smaller colonies growing in the vicinity of any colony of interest. 8. If visual screening of the clones is unnecessary, then pick and harvest a large number of colonies from the 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish (from Step 7), using one of the subcloning methods described below. If live visual screening is desired, refer to the Discussion regarding subcloning stable transformants. **Trypsin Method for Picking Colonies** - i. Cut filter paper into small squares, each with an area of ~ 4 mm 2. Use sharp-tipped forceps to place the squares together in a glass Petri dish. Cover them and sterilize by autoclaving. - ii. Aspirate the medium from the Petri dish containing the marked colonies (from Step 7. iii above). - iii. Wash the cells with sterile calcium- and magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS), and remove excess liquid. - iv. Dispense trypsin solution into a small sterile Petri dish. Using the sterile forceps, dip a sterile filter paper (from Step 8. i) in trypsin, blot it to remove excess trypsin, and place it over a colony. - v. Repeat Step 8. iv for each of the colonies. Return the Petri dish containing the cells to the incubator for ~ 5 min. - vi. Transfer each filter paper into a separate well of a 96 -well microtiter plate containing 0. 1 mL of tissue culture medium per well. If visual screening will be performed, use a glass-bottom 96 -well plate. Duplicate plating can be accomplished by dipping the filter paper into one well to dislodge some cells, and then dropping the filter paper into a well of a second 96 -well plate. - *The efficiency of colony duplication by this method is close to 100 %. Do not leave the cells without buffer for more than 15 - 20 min or they will dry out. Also, CMF-PBS may induce rounding of cells and/or detachment after prolonged treatment (see Steps 8. x and 8. xi) *. - vii. Grow the collected cells in the 96 -well plates for 1 - 2 d. - viii. Remove the filter paper pieces from the wells, taking care to avoid cross-contamination. One method for doing this is to attach a plastic hose to a vacuum system with an in-line trap. Insert the larger end of a 1 -mL micropipette tip into the hose. Cut the other end of the tip to accommodate a sterile 200 -μL micropipette tip. Next, insert the 200 -μL tip into the bottom of a well. The vacuum will cause the filter paper to adhere to the tip. Withdraw the tip, and discard both the filter paper and the 200 -μL pipette tip. Finally, repeat with the remaining wells, using a fresh sterile 200 -μL tip each time. - ix. Continue to grow the cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. **Micropipette Tip Method for Picking Colonies** *This method works well with more densely packed colonies, and it is faster than the trypsin method (Steps 8. i- 8. ix). A few hundred colonies can be easily transferred within a couple of hours. Once this method is optimized, efficiency is near 100 %, although the number of cells transferred per colony into the well may be somewhat lower*. - x. Mark the colonies that are less likely to be cross-contaminated with cells from other colonies. Rinse the cells twice with CMF-PBS (10 mL per 150 -mm dish). Add a small amount of CMF-PBS (~ 4 - 6 mL), just sufficient to cover the surface of the dish, and return the dish to the incubator. - xi. After ~ 5 min, look at the cells under a microscope to see if cells in colonies have rounded. If not, incubate further. Once the cells in the colony have rounded, but are still attached, they can be picked. - xii. Use a permanent marker to circle small groups of colonies on the bottom of the dish. This helps to keep track of which colonies have already been harvested. - xiii. Using a fresh 200 -μL pipette tip per colony, scrape two to three times over the colony while aspirating 10 μL into the pipette tip. Insert the pipette tip into the well of a 96 -well plate, pipetting medium from the well several times into the tip to wash the cells off into the well. - xiv. Grow cells until their numbers are sufficient for screening. Screen the cells from each well, and freeze the positive clones. Examine the positive clones by microscopy for the biological activity of interest. ### DISCUSSION In general, screening of clones uses either a visual, microscope-based screen (if possible) or a molecular or biochemical screen. In some cases, both might be combined, either as two sequential screens or one parallel screen. An example from our work is a screen of a set of 96 subclones transfected with a nonfluorescent VP 16 transcriptional activator fusion protein. A visual immunofluorescence assay was used to test directly for expression of the activator, and a transient transfection expression assay was run to test the capability of each clone to activate a luciferase reporter gene. The intersection of these two screens yielded a clone that induced chromosome repositioning after induction of VP 16 targeting. A starting point for subcloning is to determine roughly what fraction of stable transformants show the desired properties. If this fraction is large, then we typically carry out the initial transformation in a single flask, followed by subsequent subcloning of the mixed stable transformant pool by serial dilution cloning into 96 -well plates. A range of dilutions should be used to ensure success. The advantage of serial dilution is that the investigator can more easily verify whether the cells in a given well actually arise from a single clone. If the fraction of desired cells is small (a few percent or less), and if a visual screen is possible, we prepare a single coverslip from the mixed pool of stable transformants and obtain an initial estimate of exactly how many clones need to be screened. One approach is to initially subclone in pools of clones (e. g., five to 10 per well). In theory, this should allow cloning of even rare transformants through several stages of subcloning. Often, however, the desired subclones are rare because of a selective bias against growth of these clones. In this case, if the pool size is too great, the percentage of desired cells can drop in the culture prior to the next stage of subcloning, producing diminishing returns. A better approach, where possible, is cell sorting with flow cytometry to enrich the cell population with cells containing the desired expression levels (see Step 6 above). When large numbers of clones are required, and if visual screening is unnecessary, we simply pick large numbers of colonies from a 150 -mm-diameter Petri dish, using either small, trypsin-soaked pieces of filter paper (Steps 8. i- 8. ix above) or micropipette tips (Steps 8. x- 8. xiv above). These are used to deposit clonal cells into 96 -well plates. Both methods are very rapid but have a high risk of clone contamination, due to the use of a single Petri dish. Any clones selected, based on a secondary screen, must go through an additiona...|$|E

The objective of this research project was to determine the effect of above- and below-ground litter manipulation on the retention and release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), nitrate and ammonium in the soil profile at 0 - 5 and 5 - 15 cm depths. The soils were obtained from a Long Term Ecological Research site in the Sikfokut Forest in Hungary. The site is a mature oak forest and the soil has no organic layer; the leaf litter sits directly on the A horizon. There are six treatments applied to the soil: doubling of annual leaf litter (DL), doubling of annual wood litter (DW), removal of annual leaf litter (NL), removal of roots (NR), removal of leaf and roots (NI) and control (C). Each plot is 7 x 7 m, and each soil sample taken was 15 x 15 cm square. A stock solution of leaf litter was added in different concentrations to soils from each treatment in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Because I was investigating retention or release of carbon and nitrogen, I <b>inverted</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> gently over a period of 2 hours prior to centrifugation and removal of supernatant. The supernatant solution was analyzed for DOC, DON, ammonium and nitrate to determine retention and release values for each dependant upon the different treatments. The results of the study were interesting. Dissolved organic nitrogen was neither retained nor released in the 0 - 5 cm layer for any treatment yet nitrate, typically considered a mobile anion showed retention and release in this layer. In the 5 - 15 cm layer we had no retention or release of nitrate but dissolved organic nitrogen was retained and released between the solid and solution phases...|$|R

In this protocol we describe a co-culture system where primary simian hepatocyte could be maintained {{for a month or}} more through co-cultivation with an immortalised liver derived cell line, Hepa-RG. The hepatocytes can be infected with Plasmodium sporozoites and the persisting hypnozoites can then observed and investigated. ### Introduction Infection by malaria is initiated by the deposition of sporozoites in the skin from the salivary of an infected Anopheles mosquito during its blood meal. These sporozoites then {{make their way to the}} liver where they immediately develop in hepatocytes to produce the merozoite forms that invade red blood cells, thus staring the cycle of multiplication that causes disease and allows transmission to mosquitos. In a few of the parasite species that infect primates, the development of some of the hepatic parasites is arrested early after invasion, to resume only months or years later (1 - 3). During this time these quiescent parasites are insusceptible to all anti-malarial drugs except for primaquine. The activation of these dormant forms, known as hypnozoites, causes a relapse episode thereby increasing the morbidity of the infection and its potential to transmit. In humans, two species Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale are capable of forming hypnozoites, and this considerably hampers efforts to control and eventually eliminate them. Searching for drugs active against hypnozoites suitable for mass deployment is a urgent requirement because primaquine administration can lead to potentially severe haemolysis in persons with glucose- 6 -phosphate deficiency, a genetic trait common in populations living the areas endemic for vivax and ovale malaria. At present, screening for hypnozoitocidal activity can only be done one experimentally infected hosts, which must be followed for many months after drug administration. Since the 1950 ’s, the P. cynomolgi-infected rhesus monkey, an excellent model for P. vivax, has been used to test for efficacy (4). Given the costs and ethical limitations inherent to research on primates, screening is restricted to very few compounds indeed. Moreover, there is very little known about the biological processes associated with quiescence and activation of hypnozoites that could help narrow down the molecules to test. Clearly, in vitro cultivation of hypnozoites would make it possible to envisage more efficient and cost-effective screening strategies. We had previously demonstrated that hypnozoite-like forms could be obtained in cultured primary simian hepatocytes infected with P. cynomolgi sporozoites (5). However confirmation that these were indeed hypnozoites, and optimal use for screening assays, were hampered by the characteristic short durations (10 - 14 days at most) of primary hepatocyte cultures. Here we describe protocols in which the co-culture of simian primary hepatocytes with a HepaRG cell line allows to maintain the cultures for about a month, during which hypnozoites resulting from an initial infection with P. cynomolgi sporozoites can be enriched and observed to activate and develop into mature forms. It is likely that these protocols would also be suitable for the cultivation of P. vivax hypnozoites in human primary hepatocytes. ### Materials 1.

Microscopic examination under fluorescence microscopy should permit observation of a small number of fluorescent GFP-HepaRG cells (present at a 1 : 30 ratio) within the hepatocyte monolayer. **Isolation of sporozoites from infected mosquitoes** Plasmodium cynomolgi (M strain) sporozoites can be obtained from Anopheles stephensi salivary glands infected 14 – 35 days earlier by membrane-feeding on the blood of a P. cynomolgi-infected Macaca mulatta (8). A variety of suitable Anopheles and P. cynomolgi lines are available at Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR 4) ([URL] 1. Prepare 3 Petri dishes with 8 mL of L 15 medium - Kill mosquitoes in 70 % ethanol - Rapidly wash them in the first Petri dish - Repeat the washing by dipping in the second and then the third Petri dishes - Align the mosquitoes on a sterile glass slide under a stereomicroscope - Under a stereomicroscope and using needles, separate the head of the mosquitoes from the thorax that is simultaneously carefully pressed to extrude the salivary glands - Remove the salivary glands with the L 15 medium to the homogenizer placed on ice - Homogenize the salivary glands - Filter the suspension through a 40 µM cell strainer in a 50 mL tube placed on ice - Centrifuge to recover the sporozoites at 16, 000 x g 3 minutes at 4 °C - Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the sporozoites in culture medium - Count the number of sporozoites in a haemocytometer and adjust the concentration to 800 000 sporozoites per mL - Keep on ice until use **Infection of the co-culture cells by P. cynomolgi (Figure 2) ** 1.

Remove the wash culture medium - d. Pipette 100 µL of Matrigel using a cold tip and gently overlay the cells in each well - When Matrigel covers all the wells, return the plate to the incubator for 30 minutes to allow the Matrigel to gel. - Add 300 µL of culture medium to each well and replace the plate in the incubator - Every 48 hours, carefully aspirate the medium, taking care to not disturb the Matrigel, and replace it with 300 µL of fresh culture medium **Treatment with Atovaquone to eliminate schizonts** 1. At day 5 post-infection, fix 3 wells for parasite immunostaining (see “Fixation and parasite immunostaining”) so as to evaluate the proportion of schizonts versus hypnozoites - Prepare sufficient atovaquone solution for 3 days of treatment (300 µL per well per day) - a.

Add 300 µL of the atovaquone in culture medium to each well - At day 8 fix 3 treated and three untreated wells for parasite immunostaining (see “Fixation and parasite immunostaining”) in order to confirm that the schizonts have been eliminated and that hypnozoites are present in sufficient numbers - If this is the case, then the infected co-culture is suitable for further experimentation - Continue to change the culture medium every 48 hours until the end of the experiment **Fixation and immunostaining of parasites** 1. Remove the medium and the Matrigel by aspiration - Add 200 µL of 4 % PFA to each well to fix the cells by incubation at RT for 15 minutes - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - Add 200 µL of 0. 1 % Triton X 100 and incubate at RT for 10 minutes - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - To each well add 150 µL of mouse polyclonal serum raised against PfHSP 70 (1 / 2, 000 dilution), or alternatively use other suitable antibodies at the appropriate dilution, or stain with Giemsa 9 - Incubate for 45 minutes at 37 °C - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - To each well add 150 µL of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) diluted 1 / 600 - Incubate for 45 minutes at 37 °C - Rinse 3 times with 300 µL of PBS - Enumerate the parasites under a fluorescence microscope at a 200 X magnification **Critical steps** - The homogeneity of cell plating is of the most importance. - Mosquito dissection should be performed as cleanly as possible. The use of highly infected mosquitoes (> 20 000 sporozoites per mosquito) is advisable in order to minimize bacterial and fungal contamination. Prior training on uninfected mosquitoes is highly recommended. - Efficient removal of mosquito debris during the washing steps prior to adding Matrigel. This can be achieved most optimally by using a Percoll (10) or an Accudenz (11) cushion to purify the sporozoites. - Keep Matrigel on ice to avoid untimely polymerization. - Infected co-cultured cells: avoid shaking that might perturb the cells during handling, and changes to the temperature the cultures during medium addition. - Good fixation relies on a total removal of Matrigel. ### Timing - Preparation of co-cultured cells requires around 2 hours. - The full procedure, including counting, for sporozoite isolation from 100 mosquitoes generally necessitates 2 hours when 2 trained technicians carry out the dissection. - Infection of the co-cultures requires one hour followed by an additional 3 - 4 hours for the co-incubation of cells and sporozoites. - Matrigel cover requires 1. 5 h including the incubation step (for one 48 wells culture plate) ### Troubleshooting - Hepatocyte density: hepatocytes need to be highly confluent in order to thrive, particularly for long-term cultures (hepatocyte differentiation relies in large part on establishing good intercellular junctions). It is advisable to determine the optimal cell density for seeding on the plates selected for the cultivation. - Should the viability of the hepatocytes be lower than 90 %, it might be more difficult to reach adequate hepatocyte density. In order to eliminate dead cells (thus increasing the proportion viable) one can add a Percoll purification step prior to plating: re-suspend the hepatocyte suspension in 10 ml column of 40 % iso-osmotic Percoll, and then centrifuge at 900 x g for 3 min at RT without brake; remove the supernatant and the interphase containing dead cells; suspend the pellet of viable hepatocytes in 20 ml culture medium and centrifuge again at 200 x g for 1 min at RT; discard the supernatant and suspend the cells in a known volume of culture medium; enumerate the cells and determine the proportion viable (Trypan blue dye exclusion) using a haemocytometer; adjust density to 0. 8 million of viable cells per mL. - Contamination of the cultures is often due to inadequate care (sloppy sterile technique) during mosquito dissection or mosquito contamination during breeding. - The wounding due to the cell traversal activity of sporozoites can lead to a degradation of the cell layer in the co-cultures. The effect should be minor when 100, 000 sporozoites or less are used to infect each well. ### Anticipated Results - Following the 3 -day atovaquone treatment (usually Day 8 post-infection), the number of maturing hepatic schizonts should diminish by > 80 %, and the number of hypnozoites should be similar to that in the untreated wells - One week after atovaquone treatment (usually Day 15 post-infection), a proportion of the hypnozoites should have activated to resume development, and consequently the number of hepatic schizonts observed should mirror the decrease in the number of hypnozoites - In the absence of a Matrigel layer, merosomes should be detectable in the culture medium from D 8 post-infection in co-cultures not treated with atovaquone, or from Day 16 post-infection onward in atovaquone-treated co-culture (8 days after the end of treatment) ### References 1.

Eckmann 1 Corresponding author (eckmann@mpi-cbg. de). ### INTRODUCTION RNA coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) {{experiments}} are {{an extension of}} protein co-IP experiments in which in vivo RNA-protein complexes are investigated. This protocol describes how to perform RNA co-IPs from *C. elegans* whole-worm extracts. In principle, a protein-specific antibody is used to purify the protein of choice and its associated complex members from worm extract. This may also include RNA molecules associated with other protein components. To identify a specific mRNA molecule, all RNA molecules are first separated from the protein components after immunopurification. The mRNAs are then converted into cDNA by reverse transcription. Candidate mRNAs are detected by sensitive gene-specific amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a semiquantitative manner. Since RNA molecules are very prone to degradation, {{it is crucial to}} avoid any kind of contamination with RNase activity in this experiment. ### RELATED INFORMATION This protocol was used to show that gld- 1 mRNA is part of the GLD- 3 /GLS- 1 /GLD- 4 complex in vivo (Schmid et al. 2009). The protein co-IP procedure upon which this protocol is based is described in [Analysis of In Vivo Protein Complexes by Coimmunoprecipitation from *Caenorhabditis elegans*]([URL] (Jedamzik and Eckmann 2009). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** *To prepare DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate) -treated solutions, add 0. 1 % DEPC (e. g., SERVA 18835. 01) to the solution in a screw-cap bottle.

To avoid an accumulation of inhibitory pheromones and thus a delay in worm development or an induction of starvation, a two-step plate-based amplification protocol is used. Worms are frozen in liquid nitrogen in the form of pearls to facilitate usage of smaller portions (instead of the entire worm culture) for extract preparation (Step 12) *. 1. Take 12 10 -cm NGM plates and 30 14. 5 -cm NGM plates, and seed each of them with 1 mL or 2 mL of OP 50 solution, respectively. Dry the plates under a laminar flow hood and store overnight at room temperature. Keep plates at 4 °C for long-term storage. - Prepare the worms from starved-worm plates as follows: - i. Take three 6 -cm starved-worm plates and wash the worms off three times with 1 mL of M 9 salt solution into 1. 5 -mL tubes. - ii. Pellet the worms by centrifugation for 1 min at 400 g. - iii. Put the worms on ice for 2 min to settle them. Remove the supernatant. - iv. Wash the worms three times with 1 mL of M 9 salt solution. - Resuspend the worms in 1. 2 mL of M 9 salt solution. Plate 100 μL of resuspended worms on each of the 12 10 -cm NGM plates under a laminar flow hood, and let the plates dry for 5 min with the lids open. - Let the worms grow at 20 °C for 4 days until the food is almost consumed. - Feed the worms by adding 1 mL of OP 50 solution onto the plates under the laminar flow hood, and let the plates dry with the lids open. - Incubate the worms at 20 °C until the food is almost consumed (usually one more time overnight). - Treat the worms as follows: - i. Wash the worms off the plates with M 9 salt solution and collect them in 15 -mL Falcon tubes. - ii. Store the worms on ice. - iii. Pellet the worms by centrifuging in a tabletop centrifuge at 600 g for 2 min. - iv. Wash the worm pellet three times with M 9 salt solution. - Resuspend the worms in 60 mL of OP 50 solution and distribute 2 mL per 14. 5 -cm NGM plate (30 plates in total). Dry the plates under the laminar flow hood and incubate the worms at 20 °C until they reach at least the L 4 stage. - *Avoid starving the animals!* - Treat the worms as follows: - i. Harvest the worms by washing them off the plates with M 9 salt solution and collect them in 15 -mL Falcon tubes on ice. - ii. Wash the worms three times with M 9 salt solution. - iii. Wash the worms twice in buffer B 70 supplemented with protease inhibitors. - Collect all worms in one or two 15 -mL Falcon tubes (not more than 4. 5 mL of settled worms per tube) and add an equal volume of buffer B 70 supplemented with protease inhibitors. The yield of settled worms is ~ 3 - 6 mL and is expanded to a total volume of 6 - 12 mL after the addition of buffer. - *An equivalent of ~ 2 mL of settled worms is plenty for a typical IP experiment with two individual samples. * - Freeze the worms as follows: - i. Resuspend the worms well and let them drip into a container of liquid nitrogen by gently pushing them out of a 1 -mL micropipette tip. - ii. Collect the frozen worm pearl suspension with a sieve placed over an empty liquid nitrogen container. - iii. Transfer the worm pearls to a 50 -mL Falcon tube using a metal spoon. At this point, the worm pearls can be stored at − 80 °C. **Whole-Worm Extract Preparation** *This section (Steps 12 - 15) describes an efficient and economical protocol for the production of cytoplasmic extract from frozen worm cultures under conditions that preserve the integrity of cellular proteins and RNA. Perform the entire procedure at 4 °C unless otherwise stated*. 12. Use an equivalent of 2 mL of settled worms for an IP experiment with two individual samples, or more depending on the number of IP samples in the experiment. Grind the worms to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and a pestle that have been precooled with liquid nitrogen. Maintain the worm homogenate as a cold paste during the entire grinding procedure by adding fresh liquid nitrogen to the mortar once it has evaporated. Grind the worms several times to produce a fine powder. - *Be careful when touching the cooled mortar. It is necessary to wear protective gloves to prevent cold burns*. 13. Transfer the powder into 15 -mL glass tubes with a precooled spatula and add 2 mL of buffer B 70 (supplemented with fresh protease inhibitors). - *The powder produced from an equivalent of 2 mL settled worms fills approximately half the volume of a 15 -mL glass tube*. 14. Centrifuge as follows: - i. Centrifuge the tubes in a high-speed centrifuge at 37, 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. - ii. Transfer the supernatant to precooled 1. 5 -mL tubes. - iii. Centrifuge again in a tabletop centrifuge at 20, 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. 15. Pass the supernatant through a 0. 45 -μm filter into a precooled Falcon tube using a 10 -mL syringe. Immediately add 5 μL of RNasin per 1 mL of extract and proceed straight to the co-IP (Step 16). Keep some extract aside to determine the protein concentration in a Bradford assay. - *The concentrations may vary between 10 and 35 mg protein per mL extract*. **RNA Co-IP** *This section (Steps 16 - 27) describes how to immunopurify RNA-protein complexes from worm extract in two steps. First, the extract is incubated with the antibodies to allow binding of the antibody to its target protein. Second, the antibody with the associated protein-RNA complex is affinity purified using Protein A-agarose. Perform Steps 16 - 27 at 4 °C unless otherwise stated*. 16. For each IP experiment (consisting of one specific and one nonspecific antibody sample), place 60 μL of bed volume of Protein A-agarose into RNase-free 1. 5 -mL tubes. 17. Wash the beads three times with buffer B 70 as follows: - i. Pellet the beads in a tabletop centrifuge at 400 g for 30 sec. - ii. Remove the supernatant and add wash buffer to the beads. - iii. Mix by carefully <b>inverting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> at least three times. - *Avoid shaking the tube to prevent foam production and fragmenting the beads*. 18. Preclear 1. 1 mL of fresh extract on the washed Protein A-agarose beads for 30 min on a wheel to remove all molecules that nonspecifically bind to Protein A-agarose. 19. Pellet the beads at 400 g for 30 sec and use the supernatant for the actual IP experiment. 20. Transfer two 50 -μL aliquots as input samples into two RNase-free 1. 5 -mL tubes. 21. Add 350 μL of Trizol to each sample (from Step 20) and incubate them for at least 10 min at 65 °C and 1000 rpm in a thermoshaker. Proceed to Step 28 with the input samples after the IP has been started (Steps 22 and 23). 22. Take 500 μL of precleared extract (from Step 19); add the IP-antibody (typically ~ 80 μL of serum plus 3 μL of RNasin). Incubate for 1 h on a rotating wheel. 23. In the meantime, prepare new Protein A-agarose beads to be used for pulling down the antibody-protein complex from the extract. - i. For each IP sample, take 30 μL of bed volume of Protein A-agarose and wash three times with buffer B 70. - ii. Block the beads by incubating them for at least 30 min on a wheel in buffer B 70 containing 10 mg/mL BSA, 0. 1 mg/mL yeast total RNA, and 0. 1 mg/mL heparin. - iii. Wash the beads once with buffer B 70. 24. Add the extract-antibody mix (Step 22) to the preblocked Protein A-agarose and incubate for 1 h on a wheel. 25. Wash the beads quickly three times in buffer B 70, then wash twice in buffer B 70 for 10 min on a wheel. Discard the entire wash buffer. 26. To elute the RNA from the beads, add 200 μL of Trizol and incubate for at least 10 min at 65 °C in a thermoshaker at 1000 rpm. 27. Centrifuge the beads at 400 g for 2 min at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube. **Purification of Total RNA** *Steps 28 - 38 describe how to isolate and purify total RNA from the input and IP samples. Perform the entire procedure at room temperature unless otherwise stated*. 28. Add one-fifth volume chloroform (80 μL for the input samples or 40 μL for the IP samples) and shake the tube vigorously by hand for 15 sec. 29. Let the tube sit for 3 min, then centrifuge at 12, 000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. 30. Transfer ~ 60 % of the starting volume from the upper phase to a new tube (240 μL for input and 120 μL for IP samples). Avoid the white interphase! Bring the volume up to 400 μL with DEPC-treated H 2 O. 31. Add 30 μL of DEPC-treated HEPES (50 mM, pH 7. 5), mix well, and centrifuge. Add 400 μL of PCI and mix well by shaking. 32. Centrifuge at 13, 200 g for 5 min. 33. Transfer the upper phase (~ 400 μL) to a new tube while avoiding the interphase, add 350 μL of chloroform:IAA, mix well, and centrifuge at 13, 200 g for 5 min. 34. Transfer the upper phase (~ 380 μL) to a new tube while avoiding the interphase, and precipitate the RNA by adding 1. 5 μL of glycogen (20 mg/mL), 1 / 10 volume of DEPC-treated NaOAc (3 M, pH 5. 2), and 2. 5 volumes of ethanol. Mix the tube well and incubate at − 20 °C for at least 30 min. - *At this point, the procedure can be interrupted and continued the next day or later*. 35. Pellet the RNA by centrifugation at 16, 000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. 36. Remove the supernatant with a drawn-out glass pipette and wash the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 75 % ethanol. 37. Centrifuge the tube at 16, 000 g for 5 min at 4 °C and remove the entire supernatant with a drawn-out glass pipette. 38. Air-dry the pellet until it starts to turn from white to clear, then dissolve it in 20 μL of DEPC-treated H 2 O at room temperature. Keep the RNA on ice and immediately proceed to Step 39. **DNase I Treatment of the RNA** *To remove genomic DNA contamination, the RNA is treated with DNase I, which is described in Steps 39 - 40. Per IP experiment, take two input samples and treat one with and one without DNase I to have a control for the DNase I treatment*. 39. Assemble the following reagents in 1. 5 -mL tubes on ice as indicated. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 40. Mix the tubes by gently tapping the bottoms, centrifuge the contents at 5000 g for 10 sec, and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Immediately proceed to Step 41. **Repurification of RNA** *Prior to cDNA production (Steps 46 - 49), the RNA must be purified a second time (described in Steps 41 - 45) to prevent subsequent cDNA degradation by DNase I or inefficient reverse transcription*. 41. To the DNase I-treated RNA, add 360 μL of DEPC-treated H 2 O, 30 μL of DEPC-treated HEPES (50 mM, pH 7. 5), and 350 μL of PCI. Mix well by shaking. 42. Centrifuge at 13, 200 g for 5 min at room temperature. 43. Transfer the upper phase to a new tube while avoiding the interphase (~ 400 μL), add 350 μL of chloroform, and mix well. Centrifuge at 13, 200 g for 5 min. 44. Repeat Step 43. 45. Precipitate and wash the RNA as in Steps 34 to 38. Dissolve each RNA pellet in 26 μL of DEPC-treated H 2 O. Keep the dissolved RNA on ice and proceed immediately to Step 46. **Reverse Transcription of mRNAs into cDNA** *The mRNA will be reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer to minimize ribosomal RNA contamination (Steps 46 - 49). Each RNA sample is divided into an RT+ sample and an RT− sample (negative control) *. 46. Heat the RNA for no longer than 3 min at 96 °C and immediately place it in ice water for at least 5 min. 47. Centrifuge the sample, divide it into an RT+ sample and an RT− sample, and assemble the following reactions in PCR tubes kept on ice: *Add components in the order indicated*. ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 48. Mix the reactions by gentle tapping and incubate for 60 min at 55 °C. Inactivate the reactions for 20 min at 65 °C in a thermocycler. 49. Centrifuge the reactions and proceed to Step 50 or store the cDNA at − 20 °C. **Gene-Specific PCR** *During the following steps (Steps 50 - 54), the presence of a particular mRNA in the IP and input samples is detected in a PCR reaction with gene-specific primers. Due to the low amount of mRNA in the samples, it may be necessary to perform a two-step PCR amplification for high sensitivity and specificity. To stay in the linear range of each PCR reaction, as few cycles as possible are advised*. 50. Perform a gene-specific, nested PCR to detect the presence of a particular mRNA (now cDNA) in the samples. For optimal results, design the primers so that the primary PCR product with the outer primer pair is not larger than 500 bp (spliced!) and the secondary PCR product with the inner primer pair is in the range of ~ 300 bp (spliced!). Try to design primers with an annealing temperature of 58 °C and a GC content of 50 %. 51. For the input sample, take one sample with 0. 5 μL of cDNA and one sample with 1. 5 μL of cDNA as template to determine whether the PCR reaction is still in the linear range. Bring the volume up to 2 μL with H 2 O. For the IP samples, take 2 μL of cDNA as a template for the PCR reaction. Set up the following primary PCR reaction in a total volume of 20 μL: ![Table 3]([URL] "Table 3 ") 53. Set up and run the secondary PCR in the same way as the primary PCR (Steps 51 and 52), but use 0. 5 μL of primary PCR reaction as a template for the PCR. 54. Analyze the complete volume of the secondary PCR reaction on a standard agarose gel. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: There is no signal in the IP samples in the gene-specific PCR. [Step 54] - **Solution**: The IP samples usually contain very little RNA (often < 300 ng in total). Also, consider the following: - RNA is highly sensitive to any kind of degradation. To test whether degradation is occurring during the experiment, monitor the RNA quality of an input sample during the procedure. Analyze purified RNA of an equivalent of 1 μL of extract on a denaturing agarose gel, or load 1 μL of purified RNA on an Agilent Bioanalyzer chip (e. g., after Steps 15, 18, 38, and 45). Any kind of degradation should be avoided (see “There is substantial RNA degradation” below). - There could be low enrichment of coimmunoprecipitated RNAs as a consequence of poor antibody affinity. If this might be the problem, use a higher antibody concentration or test different antibodies that recognize the protein in question. - **Problem**: There is substantial RNA degradation. - **Solution**: Consider the following: - To prevent RNA degradation during the procedure, it is important to work RNase-free and fast. Do not interrupt the procedure unless the RNA has been precipitated (Steps 34 and 45) or purified. - Keep the RNA on ice and avoid multiple freezing/thawing steps. - Consider the addition of the nonspecific RNase inhibitor ribonucleoside-vanadyl complex (RVC; 200 mM; NEB S 1402 S) to the extract. RVC is an RNA analog and generally blocks RNases, which improves overall RNA stability. However, EDTA must be excluded in all buffers that contain RVC because EDTA disassembles the RVC. Note also that traces of RVC can inhibit reverse transcriptases. - **Problem**: No specificity is seen in the pull-down of mRNAs. - **Solution**: Consider the following: - Try to use high salt (1 M urea or 300 mM KAc) or heparin in the wash buffer when performing Step 25. - Make sure that the PCR reaction is still in the linear range at the end of the secondary PCR (the 0. 5 -μL and 1. 5 -μL input concentrations should show a threefold difference in intensity on the DNA gel). If the PCR reaction has been exhausted, differences between specific and nonspecific IP might be lost. ### DISCUSSION The method described here allows for the investigation of RNA-protein complexes and identification of mRNA targets of RNA-binding proteins in vivo. Although the method is generally applicable, it utilizes whole-worm extracts as a starting material for the co-IP procedure. Worms are protected by a tough cuticle, which makes it difficult to obtain intact extracts of high protein concentration. We have tested alternative procedures for homogenizing worms, such as sonication and the use of a French press. In our hands, grinding frozen worm pearls with a mortar and pestle gives the most reproducible results and costs the least. During sonication and French pressing, local heating of the samples was measured; this can affect the quality of the mRNA. Furthermore, these methods require larger volumes for efficient worm lysis, which either reduces the protein concentration of the extract or increases the quantity of worms needed for extract preparation. We also observed that it is more beneficial for germline protein/RNA complexes to grow the worms on solid support than in liquid culture, where the morphology of the germ line and the progeny produced are of lower quality. The use of egg plates is not recommended, because it is rather difficult to reduce the high protein and lipid background, which is a result of contaminating chicken yolk. Good controls are crucial for a meaningful result in co-IP...|$|E

30|$|The RNA {{isolation}} protocol {{we developed}} combined steps from conventional Trizol extraction and an RNeasy Micro Elute Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) with some modifications (described below) {{to obtain a}} maximum yield and quality of total RNA. We first spun down antennae in tubes at 13, 000  rpm for 3  min at 4 °C, and then carefully combined antennae from all tubes into 1 MagNA Lyser Green Beads tube (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The tissue was then disrupted in approximately 1  ml Trizol with MagNA Lyser (Roche) at 7, 000  rpm for 15  s each time for 4 or 5 times until the tissue was almost invisible. Between all 15 -s disruptions, we cooled down the lysate on ice for 10  s to prevent RNA degradation. The tissue lysate was transferred from <b>the</b> Green Beads <b>tube</b> to a new RNase-free 1.5  ml tube. Two hundred microliters of chloroform per microliter of tissue lysate {{was added to the}} lysate and well mixed by shaking vigorously for 15  s and was then allowed to sit at room temperature for 2 to 3  min. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifuging the lysate at 13, 000  rpm at 4 °C for 15  min and then carefully transferring to a new 1.5  ml tube. For RNA precipitation, we added 5  μl Carrier RNA working solution (Qiagen) and 1  ml of 70 % EtOH to the aqueous phase and mixed it well by carefully <b>inverting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> To obtain a greater amount of RNA, we kept the samples at − 80 °C overnight to promote RNA precipitation. RNA isolation then followed the manufacture's protocol of the RNeasy Miro Elute Kit (Qiagen) with modifications of an increased volume (700  μl) of RPE buffer and 80 % ethanol to wash the RNA. Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment for 15  min at room temperature. As there is only one major ribosomal RNA peak in Drosophila total RNA, the quality could not be evaluated by an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Instead, we evaluated the quality of total RNA by running 500  ng of total RNA on a 2 % agarose gel.|$|R

30|$|STS {{activity}} was measured as described previously [15]. In brief, SH-SY 5 Y cells were homogenized on ice, in 2  ml 0.06  M Tris–HCl-buffer pH  7.0 (assay buffer {{throughout the entire}} procedure) for approximately 1  min at maximum speed using a Polytron® homogenizer (Kinematica, AG). Hippocampus tissue (2  mg) was finely minced with scissors and homogenized accordingly. All incubations were carried out in duplicate. The incubation mixtures consisted of 200  μl homogenate, 19.39 pmol [3 H]-E 1 S in 100  μl of buffer, and 100  μg of NADH and NADPH in 100  μl of buffer (total incubation volume 400  μl). Simultaneous background incubations using buffer instead of cell and tissue homogenate, respectively, were performed in order to correct for non-enzymatic transformation of the substrate. After 15  min of incubation in air at 37  °C in a water bath, 200  μg of non-radioactive E 1 and E 2 were added in 100  μl of ethanol together with 0.5  ml of 0.5  M sodium phosphate buffer, pH  7.0. The unconjugated steroids were extracted with 2.0  ml toluene. After <b>inverting</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> 100 times they were centrifuged at 1500 [*]×[*]g for 10  min.

40|$|Smooth pursuit eye {{movements}} {{are important for}} vision because they maintain the line of sight on targets that move smoothly within the visual field. Smooth pursuit is driven by neural representations of motion, including a surprisingly strong influence of high-level signals representing expected motion. We studied anticipatory smooth eye movements (defined as smooth eye movements {{in the direction of}} expected future motion) produced by salient visual cues in a group of high-functioning observers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a condition that has been associated with difficulties in either generating predictions, or translating predictions into effective motor commands. Eye movements were recorded while participants pursued the motion of a disc that moved within an outline drawing of an <b>inverted</b> Y-shaped <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> cue to the motion path was a visual barrier that blocked the untraveled branch (right or left) of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> ASD participants showed strong anticipatory smooth eye movements whose velocity was {{the same as that of}} a group of neurotypical participants. Anticipatory smooth eye movements appeared on the very first cued trial, indicating that trial-by-trial learning was not responsible for the responses. These results are significant because they show that anticipatory capacities are intact in high-functioning ASD in cases where the cue to the motion path is highly salient and unambiguous. Once the ability to generate anticipatory pursuit is demonstrated, the study of the anticipatory responses with a variety of types of cues provides a window into the perceptual or cognitive processes that underlie the interpretation of events in natural environments or social situations...|$|R

40|$|During {{cross flow}} in a heat exchanger, heat {{transfer}} {{in the front}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is more compared to back portion of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> This is due to less formation of vortices at the backside of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> For uniform heat transfer to take place throughout <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> {{it is necessary to}} increase the vortex formation at the rear side of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> aim {{of this study is to}} explore the possibilities of improving the flow structure and thereby increasing uniform heat transfer around <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> by introducing special type of fin arrangement over <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> effect of shape and orientation of the fin on vortex generation and respective heat transfers are studied numerically. It have been identified that by introducing special type of fin arrangement over <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> there is a possibility for increase the vortex formation at the rear portion of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> which significantly leads to creation of uniform heat transfer all around <b>the</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|R
