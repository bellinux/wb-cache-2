25|$|Dirt buildup on {{headlamp}} lenses increases glare {{to other}} road users, even at levels {{too low to}} reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, <b>headlamp</b> lens <b>cleaners</b> are required by UN Regulation 48 on vehicles equipped with low-beam headlamps using light sources that have a reference luminous flux of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them. North America, for example, does not use UN regulations, and FMVSS 108 does not require lens <b>cleaners</b> on any <b>headlamps,</b> though they are permitted.|$|R
