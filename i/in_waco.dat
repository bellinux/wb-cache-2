5|$|The {{game against}} Baylor was played in Floyd Casey Stadium <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas, {{approximately}} 100miles (161km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin, {{the home of}} the University of Texas. Because home UT games are usually a sell-out, Texas games at Baylor have found numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to watch the game.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, Fleming took Washington to Hill County {{to prevent}} vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, {{questioned}} Washington with Fleming; Washington {{told them he}} had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the {{rape and murder of}} Fryer; the confession was published the next day <b>in</b> <b>Waco</b> newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack, although the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she could resist. A lynch mob assembled <b>in</b> <b>Waco</b> that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after they did not find Washington. Nevertheless, a local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer.|$|E
5|$|The Baylor game {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a two-game stretch of road games to finish the season for Oklahoma. The Sooners traveled to Baylor <b>in</b> <b>Waco</b> for the 16th meeting between the schools and the seventh at Floyd Casey Stadium. Oklahoma had never lost to the Bears, though the game in 2005 in Norman went into double-overtime. This was the last game of the season for Baylor; even with a win they would not be bowl-eligible.|$|E
5|$|The Sooner defense played {{extremely}} well <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> limiting Baylor to 148total yards and -48yards of rushing. That was the fewest yards Baylor had produced all season and their worst {{performance on the}} ground in the program's history; it was also the second-best performance by an Oklahoma defense ever. Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|Lynching was {{a terrifying}} and {{relatively}} uncommon spectacle. It could involve victims being hanged furtively by a mob at night, or {{in front of}} hundreds or even thousands of witnesses during the day. An audience of 10,000, including the mayor and chief of police, {{was said to have}} attended the lynching of Jesse Washington <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas, in 1916. As well as being hanged, victims were sometimes burned alive and tortured, and body parts were removed and kept as souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|The 2005Baylor {{game was}} played <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas, {{approximately}} 100miles (161km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin. Since UT home games are usually sold out and Waco is relatively close to Austin, recent games against Baylor have attracted numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to see the game. The Baylor athletic department suspended ticket sales at onepoint {{in an effort to}} limit the number of Longhorn fans who purchased tickets. The average attendance for Baylor's home games for the season was 38,899, but for the UT game the attendance was 44,783 still short of the 50,000official capacity for Baylor's Floyd Casey Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{landscape}} of the cities changed dramatically during this period. The Praetorian Building in Dallas (1907) and the Amicable Life Insurance Company building <b>in</b> <b>Waco</b> (1911) {{were among the first}} skyscrapers in Texas. The Perlstein Building in Beaumont was the first skyscraper built {{as a direct result of}} the boom. Beaumont's downtown grew rapidly during the first decade after the 1901 strike. After a second major strike at Spindletop in 1925, Beaumont had the largest skyline of any city between Houston and New Orleans by the end of the decade. The twenty–two story Edson Hotel, completed in 1929, was the tallest hotel building in Texas for several years.|$|E

5|$|On March 21, 1942, Davis {{enlisted in}} the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II. On June 3, he was {{appointed}} an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was moved to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas for pre-flight training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas for primary flight training. During this training, {{he got his first}} 60 hours of flight time aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas and a final stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and immediately ordered to active duty with the Army Air Forces. By this time he had accrued 314 hours of flight time.|$|E
5|$|The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's {{suffrage}} activist from New York City, {{to investigate}} the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement there. After attending a suffrage convention in Dallas in early May, she began her assignment <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the lynching. She found that almost all residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed {{the challenge of the}} investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the north. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her presence and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas.|$|E

5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners <b>in</b> <b>Waco</b> reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E
5|$|Like modern elephants, Columbian mammoths were {{probably}} social {{and lived in}} matriarchal (female-led) family groups; most of their other social behavior was also {{similar to that of}} modern elephants. This is supported by fossil assemblages such as the Dent Site in Colorado and the Waco Mammoth National Monument <b>in</b> <b>Waco,</b> Texas, where groups consisting entirely of female and juvenile Columbian mammoths have been found (implying female-led family groups). The latter assemblage includes 22 skeletons, with 15 individuals representing a herd of females and juveniles that died in a single event. It was originally proposed that the herd was killed by a flash flood, and that the arrangement of some of the skeletons suggests that the females may have formed a defensive ring around the juveniles. In 2016, it was instead suggested that the herd had died by drought near a diminishing watering hole; scavenging traces on the bones contradicts rapid burial, and the absence of calves and large diversity of other animal species found gathered at the site support this scenario. Another group, consisting of a bull and six females, is found at the same site; although both groups died between 64,000 and 73,000 years ago, whether they died in the same event is unknown. At the Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona, where several Columbian mammoth skeletons have been excavated, a trackway similar to that left by modern elephants leads to one of the skeletons. The mammoth may have made the trackway before it died, or another individual may have approached the dead or dying animal—similar to the way modern elephants guard dead relatives for several days.|$|E
