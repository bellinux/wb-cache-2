5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate <b>energy</b> <b>reserve</b> displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{survival}} value of high <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> during winter, animals often face energy deficits when entering winter. Compensatory growth in <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> {{during the winter}} period to buffer such deficits may increase winter survival and alleviate the need for costly compensatory mechanisms before or after winter when predation risk is much higher. However, such compensatory responses in <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> during winter have not been demonstrated under field conditions.

Discriminant function analysis was used to acquire an initial reflection of the differences of the parameters among the sex and species of the mosquitoes considered in the study. Using logistic regression and ANOVA, the effects of species and sex as contributors to variations in <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> could be established. The results indicated that for all the mosquitoes, sex-specific differences were prominent with reference to the <b>energy</b> <b>reserves.</b> Species-specific differences in <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> reflect differences in resource acquisition and assimilation in the tissues, and thus the differences in the life history strategies of these four species...|$|R

In addition to optical measurement of <b>energy</b> <b>reserves,</b> two well-established chemical techniques (microgravirnetric and Iatroscan TLC-FID analyses) were used over the same period. Seasonal patterns of visible <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> measured by the optical method were positively correlated with both the Iatroscan measurements of triacyl-glycerol (Pearson’s r was between 0. 72 and 0. 87, P < 0. 005) and the microgravimetric measure-ments of total lipid (Y was between 0. 73 and 0. 88, P < 0. 005). Thus, the optical method {{can be used to}} investigate seasonal changes in <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> in calanoid copepods but at a substantially lower cost (equipment, handling time) than chemical-based methods. Moreover, the optical method offers increased resolution because <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> can be measured for each animal so that in-dividual feeding success can be assessed, provides data on the partitioning of lipids in various body regions, and is nondestructive because anesthetized animals can be measured and returned to culture.

Intraspecific variation in survival of Heterorhabditis megidis has been observed for eight isolates of H. megidis stored in water at 20 Â°C for up to 14 weeks with the 50 % survival time (ST 50) ranging from 5. 6 to 12. 5 weeks. How important physical and behavioral attributes were in explaining this variation in survival was explored using stepwise regression. Included in the analysis were: initial <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> (measured by image analysis densitometry), size (area and length) the time at which 50 % of <b>energy</b> <b>reserves</b> were depleted (ET 50), and motility (head movements/min in week 0). Energy depletion rate, ET 50, is an important predictor of survival, explaining 93. 8 % {{of the variation in}} ST 50 among isolates. Energy depletion rate was highest in the first week, a time at which H. megidis IJs were spontaneously active during storage. By week 5, when IJs had begun to die, some individuals had completely depleted their <b>energy</b> <b>reserves,</b> supporting the hypothesis that death was a result of starvation. In a second stepwise regression, performed to explore what factors contribute to variation in rate of energy depletion, motility accounted for 60. 1 % of the variation in ET 50.
