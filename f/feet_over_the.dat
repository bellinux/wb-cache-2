25|$|Before its {{transformation}} into buildable land by a 19th-century filling project, the Back Bay was literally a bay, {{west of the}} Shawmut Peninsula (on the far side from Boston Harbor) between Boston and Cambridge, the Charles River entering from the west. This bay was tidal: the water rose and fell several <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of each day, and at low tide much of the bay's bed was exposed as a marshy flat.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} SAP 4.7 was that climate is changing. Sea {{levels in the}} Gulf of Mexico are likely to rise by two to four <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 50 to 100 years from the {{combination}} of climate-induced warming and land subsidence. Tropical storms are anticipated to increase in intensity {{and the number of}} heavy precipitation events is expected to increase, raising prospects of flooding and structural damage. And the number of very hot days (i.e., >90°F) could rise by 50%.|$|E
25|$|The brown awl flies {{as low as}} 6 <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bushes or as high as 60 to 75 feet in the canopy. The adults feed {{at lower}} levels on flowers of shrubs and small trees, but ascend to higher reaches of the {{vegetation}} to lay eggs or to bask, which it does very occasionally, holding its wings flat with the forewings covering the hindwings thus giving an arrowhead effect. The flight of the butterfly is fast and bounding with an audible wing beat.|$|E
5000|$|Cross-step waltz (originally, the French Valse Boston) is {{a social}} ballroom dance in [...] time, {{performed}} primarily in closed position, to slower tempo waltz music (around 110 to 120 beats per minute). It {{is characterized by a}} [...] "primary cross step" [...] where the Lead role crosses <b>the</b> right <b>foot</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> left, as the Follow role crosses <b>the</b> left <b>foot</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> right, on the first count of the musical measure. Cross-step waltz can travel and rotate like traditional waltzes, while the dynamic of the cross-step facilitates a wide range of traveling variations.|$|R

25|$|In {{the second}} Test, which we won 20-7, David Campese scored {{one of the}} dodgiest tries I've ever seen... they didn't have video referee that day - because Campo was at least three <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{sideline}} when he plonked the ball down. He had gone hard for the corner but hadn't mustered enough pace to flank the fullback who cut him down with a low tackle. The referee was about 25 metres back up the paddock and the touch judge a good fifteen metres away. In the absence of certain knowledge they awarded the try. But it wasn't one.|$|E
25|$|Although easy to ride slowly {{because of}} their high center of mass and the {{inverted}} pendulum effect, the penny-farthing is prone to accidents. To stop, the rider presses back on the pedals while applying a spoon-shaped brake pressing the tire. The center of mass being high and not far behind the front wheel means any sudden stop or collision with a pothole or other obstruction can send the rider over the handlebars. On long downhills, some riders hooked their <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> handlebars. This made for quick descents but left no chance of stopping. A new type of handlebar was introduced, called Whatton bars, that looped behind the legs so that riders could still keep their feet on the pedals and {{also be able to}} leap forward feet-first off the machine.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 20 March 1994 a Lynx helicopter, serial number ZD275, {{was in the process}} of landing at the large British Army base at Crossmaglen. Meanwhile, an IRA unit had mounted a Mark 15 mortar on a tractor, {{concealed}} behind bales of hay. The tractor was parked 150 yards from the intended target, on waste ground. At 20:27, there was a sudden blackout across Crossmaglen's square and at the same time, a single mortar shell was lobbed into the barracks. The IRA had used the mains for the collapsing circuit of the firing pack, turning off the street's power supply and allowing the mortar's own battery to trigger the launcher. When the Lynx was hovering 100 <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> helipad, the mortar round hit the aircraft on the tail's boom, which was severed from the fuselage. The machine spun out of control, but the pilot was able to crash-land the Lynx inside the base. A Grenadier Guards' patrol spotted a huge orange fireball from a mile away. Three members of the crew managed to get out with minor injuries, but a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was trapped inside the blazing wreckage. The constable was rescued just before the fuel tanks and the ammunition started to explode.|$|E

500|$|Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are {{salt water}} marshes that absorb marine water {{when it gets}} high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during {{hurricane}} and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. [...] Animal life in this zone is dependent upon {{the amount of water}} present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), [...] wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.|$|E
500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the trail is a water-powered prayer wheel, set in motion by a flowing stream. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into. On the approach path to the monastery, there is a Lakhang (village level monastery) and a temple of Urgyan Tsemo ("U-rgyan rTse-mo") which, like the main monastery, is located on a rocky plateau with a precipitous projection of several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> valley. From this location, the monastery’s buildings are on the opposite ravine, which is known by the name “Copper-Colored Mountain Paradise of Padmasambhava”. This is the view point for visitors and there is a cafeteria to provide refreshments. The trek beyond this point is very scenic with the sound of the water fall breaking the silence. Along the trek route blue pine trees, prayer flags and kiosks selling paraphernalia for worship (such as prayer wheels, temple bells and skulls) are seen. The route is scattered with number of temples. On this path, a large water fall, which drops by [...] into a sacred pool, is forded over by a bridge. The track terminates at the main monastery where colorful paintings are displayed. Guru Rinpoche's cave where he meditated is also seen. This cave is opened for public viewing only once a year.|$|E

2500|$|In 1963–1964, {{there were}} two cracks—referred to as [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary"—extending {{approximately}} 34 feet around the die block. By 1974, they had extended to 40 feet. They grew another 4.6 <b>feet</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next 15 years. Inspection has determined that the cracks have increased horizontally since 1990.
