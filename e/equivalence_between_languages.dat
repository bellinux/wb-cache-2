I show how Carter captured her experience of linguistic and cultural estrangement through this favorite intertext. Unlike the ordinary mirror, which presupposes <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> <b>languages,</b> the Carrollian looking glass opens up into a strange and wonder-filled space that Carter explored as a foreigner in Japan and as a translator from the French. The cross-linguistic and transcultural imaginary that informs Carter’s writing becomes visible through a translational and transcreative reading of her work, which in turn sheds light on her intertextual source(s) in mirrorlike fashion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{notions of}} decidability and definability for the Monadic Second-Order Logic over labeled tree structures, and {{its relations with}} finite automata using oracles to test input prefixes. A general framework is defined allowing to transfer some MSO-properties from a graph-structure to a labeled tree structure. Transferred properties are the decidability of sentences {{and the existence of}} a definable model for every satisfiable formula. A class of finite automata with prefix-oracles is also defined, recognizing exactly languages defined by MSO-formulas in any labeled tree-structure. Applying these results, the well-known <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> <b>languages</b> recognized by finite automata, sets of vertices MSO definable in a tree-structure and sets of pushdown contexts generated by pushdown-automata is extended to k-iterated pushdown automata...|$|E

In addition RDFLog is aware of important RDF features such as the distinction between blank nodes, literals and URIs or the RDFS vocabulary. The semantics of RDFLog is closed (every answer is an RDF graph), but lifts RDF’s restrictions on literal and blank node occurrences for intermediary data. We show how to define a sound and complete operational semantics that can be implemented using existing logic programming techniques. Using RDFLog we classify previous approaches to RDF querying along their support for blank node construction and show <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> <b>languages</b> with full quantifier alternation and languages with only ∀∃ rules. ...|$|E

40|$|Much {{traditional}} translation {{research has}} focused on formal correctness and semantic <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> source <b>language</b> and target language, taking for granted that the two systems being compared exhibit the same type of architecture (E.

In this paper we argue that prior to any commitment to matching the formal or denotative acceptability, we must ascertain the overall correspondence between the selected register of the source language and the end results of the target language. Following this line of inquiry, we observed that some translations into Italian missed relevant connotations clearly expressed in the source texts due to the failure to adhere to the source text’s diasystemic variation levels (diamesic: ‘spoken, colloquial language’; diaphasic: ‘(youth) slang’; diastratic: ‘blue collar language’) ...|$|R

50|$|Apart from terminological lacunae, or lexical gaps, the {{translator}} may {{focus on the}} following aspects. Textual conventions in the source language are often culture-dependent and may not correspond to conventions in the target culture (see e.g. Nielsen 2010). Linguistic structures that are often found in the source language may have no direct equivalent structures in the target language. The translator therefore has to be guided by certain standards of linguistic, social and cultural <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> the <b>language</b> used in the source text (ST) to produce a text (TT) in the target language. Those standards correspond {{to a variety of}} different principles defined as different approaches to translation in translation theory. Each of the standards sets a certain priority among the elements of ST to be preserved in TT. For example, following the functional approach, translators try to find target language structures with the same functions as those in the source language thus value the functionality of a text fragment in ST more than, say, the meanings of specific words in ST and the order in which they appear there.|$|R
40|$|Whereas we {{can observe}} macro-pragmatic <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> PILs across <b>languages</b> based on common macro-aims, {{it is rare}} to {{encounter}} other types of equivalence.

Failure to recognize such differences may affect the process of translation and result in particularly inadequate (cf. Nord 1997) translations. I present {{the results of a}} contrastive analysis of a small corpus of British and Italian PILs with the aim to foreground the most significant dissimilarities between the two. Based on the results of this analysis, I look at Italian PILs translated into English in order to assess their functional adequacy.

40|$|In {{recent studies}} of loanword adaptation, two main sides have emerged. Phonological {{accounts}} (e. g.

On the other hand, phonetic accounts (e. g. Silverman 1992; Peperkamp and Dupoux 2003) emphasize the influence of low-level perceptual factors in the mapping of L 2 forms to L 1 forms. In this paper, I present evidence from Burmese in favor of an intermediate model incorporating both language-independent phonetics and language-particular phonology. On the basis of a corpus of 278 loanword adaptations in Burmese, I first argue that while the adaptation of English loanwords involves multiple types of scansion like Cantonese (cf. Silverman 1992), one scansion in Burmese must be phonological. For example, English aspirated [pʰ] is consistently adapted with Burmese unaspirated /p / (cf. 1) rather than Burmese aspirated /pʰ/, which is used instead to represent English [f] (cf. 2).

At the same time, arises the awareness that the popularization {{of science is}} fundamental to scientific knowledge, may become {{an essential component of}} the culture of the citizens in general, providing the integration cultural, social and economic. Objective: To study the potential role of cooperative networks of information in the popularization of science, considering several organizational challenges (infrastructure, human resources, senior management commitment) that a SIEO network would have to operate in this new context. Methodology: It is based on an exploratory study guided the model of collaborative network of information that used a qualitative research as guide as well as a documentary research combined with a case study. Results: Results show that, although the network is prepared in terms of organizational and operational structure and quality of their collections, the lack of financial resources and qualified staff for the generation of specific materials to disseminate scientific and actions towards the popularization of science inhibits the possibilities of immediate use of this potential.

Previous research on various language pairs (source and target language) has revealed a number of culture-overlapping and culture-specific cognitive metaphorical mappings. According to translation theory, translated language is treated as an independent variety of any language, with textual features delineating it from similar texts in the target language. One of these features is the exaggeration of target language features in translated text. Hence, translated language exhibits more of these features than non-translated language. Using two corpora representing the non-translated variety of English (COCA/BNC) and one corpus containing translated English (TEC), the quantitative distribution of metaphorical expressions of the cognitive metaphor TIME IS MOTION is studied. Regarding four different variables, a quantitative deviation in the form of overrepresentation in the translated variety is established. The results suggest that translated English is marked by overuse of certain cognitive metaphorical expressions regardless of source language and text. This has implications for research into translational strategies and processes with regard to culture-overlapping and culture-specific cognitive mappings...|$|R

Five statistical criteria were applied to 144 national items to examine their performance in competition with internationally agreed core items from the same facet, using data obtained from within that centre. Multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis was used to examine the structural relationship of national items within their own facet and directed their inclusion. Forty (29 %) national items were selected and detailed examples demonstrate the selection methods used. They show how entirely new facets as well as individual items can be assessed for appending to the core WHOQOL- 100. They also enable ambiguity to be resolved where there may be doubt about whether proposed items constitute part of an existing facet or justify a new one. Where national items are similar in more than one centre, a mechanism is provided whereby these items can be re-evaluated as candidates for inclusion in any future revision of the international core.

It drew upon an existing dataset from the larger research project. The study employed a monolingual matched two-group design consisting of 150 mainly English speaking and 149 mainly isiXhosa learners in grades 6 and 7. This study had two sub aims. The first was to investigate item bias by identifying DIF items in the VA scale across the isiXhosa and English by conducting a logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedure. Five items were identified by both techniques as DIF. The second sub aim was to evaluate construct <b>equivalence</b> <b>between</b> the isiXhosa and English versions of the WMLS on the VA scale by conducting a factor analysis on the tests after removal of DIF items.
