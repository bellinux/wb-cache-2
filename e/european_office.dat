5|$|The {{localization}} {{staff at}} Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, {{as well as}} Russian, Korean and Mandarin {{for a number of}} titles. In 2016, Final Fantasy XV became the first major title from the company to release in Latin American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. Minor titles are occasionally localized from English to European languages. Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003, Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams, as was the case for Dragon Quest VII. Square also did not initially have a localization department, though a number of localizers such as Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis in the early 1990s. Moriyama described the work at the time as leaving very little leeway for polishing text due to the limitations of the ROM sizes. She also commented Hironobu Sakaguchi was not willing to put extra work for the English version at that time. Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII, however, the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products-the game was widely criticized for its rushed English translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. To that end, Square tasked Richard Honeywood, originally a programmer, with creating a dedicated localization team in the Tokyo headquarters. His first major project was Xenogears. While there were only two members at first, including Honeywood, the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007, and over 70 in 2015. The success of Final Fantasy VII also {{led to the creation of}} a London-based <b>European</b> <b>office</b> in 1998, which would handle marketing and quality assurance for the PAL market.|$|E

25|$|During World War I {{the city}} was the world's largest spy centre because of Dutch {{neutrality}} and its strategic location in between Great-Britain, Germany and German-occupied Belgium. Many spies who were arrested and executed in Britain were led by German secret agents operating from Rotterdam. MI6 had its main <b>European</b> <b>office</b> on de Boompjes. From there the British coordinated espionage in Germany and occupied Belgium. During World War I, an average of 25,000 Belgian refugees lived in the city, as well as hundreds of German deserters and escaped Allied prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, Sanderson {{was named}} Agent-General for Western Australia, {{replacing}} Noel Ashcroft. Appointed by Governor Ken Michael {{on the advice}} of Alan Carpenter, the premier at the time, she took up the role in November 2008, becoming the first female agent-general in Australia. The agent-general is based at Australia House, London, and, as head of the government's <b>European</b> <b>Office,</b> is primarily involved in promoting trade and investment, with some diplomatic functions. During her period as agent-general, Sanderson concentrated on attracting foreign investment and skilled immigrants to Western Australia, as well as promoting WA food and wine exports in European markets. She was also involved in promoting Australia's (successful) bid for the Square Kilometre Array, a radio telescope to be built near Boolardy. Sanderson left the position in December 2011, after her three-year term expired, and was replaced by Kevin Skipworth.|$|E
500|$|London generates about 20 {{per cent}} of the UK's GDP (or $600billion in 2014); while {{the economy of the}} London {{metropolitan}} area—the largest in Europe—generates about 30 per {{cent of the}} UK's GDP (or an estimated $669billion in 2005). London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way {{to get an idea of}} their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world. London is the world's most expensive office market for the last three years according to world property journal (2015) report. [...] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion – same value as that of Brazil annual GDP. The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the <b>European</b> <b>Office</b> of Statistics. On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188 and Paris €11,229.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{preparations}} for the 1940 Portuguese World Exhibition, Lisbon was the stage of an unusual movement: as the crossroads of the circulation of refugees from World War II, Lisbon was an important meeting place for spies from both sides, given the neutral character of the country. [...] "In 1940 Lisbon, happiness was staged so that God could believe it still existed," [...] wrote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. During World War II, Saint-Exupery escaped from France to Portugal {{and ended up in}} Lisbon, waiting for a visa to go to America. He was not the only one; the Portuguese capital became a symbol of hope for many refugees. Even Ilsa and Rick, the star-crossed lovers in the film Casablanca, sought a ticket to that [...] "great embarkation point." [...] Thousands had flooded the city, trying to obtain the documents necessary to escape to the United States or Palestine. On June 26 the main HIAS-HICEM (Jewish relief organization) <b>European</b> <b>Office</b> was authorised by the Portuguese Government to be transferred from Paris to Lisbon.|$|E
