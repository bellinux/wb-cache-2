25|$|The <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> {{and real}} self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{universal}} behaviors in the furry fandom {{is the creation of}} a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona – an anthropomorphic avatar or representation of themselves. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves; relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas; in part, {{this is due to the}} fact that, for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their <b>ideal</b> <b>self.</b> The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons. Data suggest that there are generally no associations between personality traits and different fursona species. However, furries, along with sport fans, report different degrees of personality traits when thinking of themselves in their everyday identity compared with their fan identity. Some furries identify as partly non-human: 35% say they do not feel 100% human (compared with 7% of non-furries), and 39% say they would be 0% human if they could (compared with 10% of non-furries).|$|E

This research addresses the relationship between <b>ideal</b> <b>selves</b> and social context from asocial identity perspective. Based on Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979, 1986) and related research, {{it is argued that}} <b>ideal</b> <b>selves</b> stand in a functional relationship with identity management strategies and that, consequently, shared beliefs about relevant intergroup relations influence the preferences for <b>ideal</b> <b>selves.</b> Three studies conducted with black and white adolescent and adult South Africans tested the assumption. The overall results of the studies confirmed that whether <b>ideal</b> <b>selves</b> corresponding to social change, social mobility or social creativity were preferred depended on whether the intergroup relations between black and white South Africans were perceived as secure or insecure.

40|$|L 2 {{motivation}} {{research has}} a longstanding monolingual bias. Recently, however, the motivational systems of a multilingual’s different languages have been conceptualized as constituting a multilingual motivational system, {{and it has}} been suggested that interactions between the <b>ideal</b> Lx <b>self</b> and the <b>ideal</b> Ly <b>self</b> can lead to the emergence of an <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>self.</b> While the notion of an <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>self</b> chimes with research on multilinguals’ identity experiences, it has not been investigated empirically. The purpose of this study is to establish whether there is empirical support for the proposed <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>self</b> construct, and whether it influences motivation to learn a second foreign language. A questionnaire containing items measuring the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> and the <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>self</b> was administered to a sample of secondary students (N= 324) at two schools in Sweden with international profiles. Using structural equation modeling, analyses yielded discriminant validity for the <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>self</b> construct, and revealed an indirect influence on intended effort mediated via the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self.</b> On the strength of these results, a case is made for future research into people’s motivation to be or become multilingual, and educational interventions focused on developing students’ <b>ideal</b> multilingual <b>selves.</b> ...|$|R

First, results replicated findings from Li et al. (2002) and Li & Kenrick (2006). For ideal long-term mates, men prioritized physical attractiveness and women prioritized social status. For ideal short-term mates, both sexes prioritized physical attractiveness. Second, people’s design of their <b>ideal</b> <b>selves</b> mirrored what the opposite sex ideally desired in their mates. For a long-term mating context, men prioritized social status in themselves and women prioritized physical attractiveness in themselves. For <b>ideal</b> short-term <b>selves,</b> both sexes prioritized physical attractiveness. Findings were consistent with a domain-specific view of psychological mechanisms, in that processes for valuing potential mates and processes for valuing one’s own mate value may be specialized mechanisms...|$|R

2500|$|According to Horney we {{can have}} two views of our self: the [...] "real self" [...] and the [...] "ideal self". The real self is who and what we {{actually}} are. [...] The <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> {{is the type of}} person we feel that we should be. The real self has the potential for growth, happiness, will power, realization of gifts, etc., but it also has deficiencies. The <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> is used as a model to assist the real self in developing its potential and achieving self-actualization. (Engler 125) But {{it is important to know}} the differences between our ideal and real self.|$|E
2500|$|Adolescents can conceptualize {{multiple}} [...] "possible selves" [...] {{that they}} could become and long-term possibilities and consequences of their choices. Exploring these possibilities may result in abrupt changes in self-presentation as the adolescent chooses or rejects qualities and behaviors, trying to guide the actual self toward the <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> (who the adolescent wishes to be) {{and away from the}} feared self (who the adolescent does not want to be). For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.|$|E

30|$|In the {{particular}} Japanese context, {{the connection between}} English language anxiety and the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> can be understood {{in light of what}} Kojima-Takahashi (2013) found about the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>selves</b> of Japanese university students. She discovered that one of the main components of students’ <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> was to be able to communicate with foreigners (native speakers). This, along with a desire for higher test scores, was the main component of students’ <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>selves.</b> Therefore, our results that anxiety and <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> were negatively correlated is fitting with the Japanese concept of <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self.</b> As students’ anxiety about communication with foreigners decreases, their own motivation to communicate increases.|$|R
2500|$|Rogers {{identified}} the [...] "real self" [...] as {{the aspect of}} one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the [...] "you" [...] that, if all goes well, you will become. On the other hand, {{to the extent that}} our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an [...] "ideal self". [...] By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the <b>ideal</b> <b>self,</b> the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{neurotic}} person's self {{is split}} between an idealized self {{and a real}} self. As a result, neurotic individuals feel that they somehow do {{not live up to}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>self.</b> They feel that there is a flaw somewhere in comparison to what they [...] "should" [...] be. The goals set out by the neurotic are not , or indeed possible. The real self then degenerates into a [...] "despised self", and the neurotic person assumes that this is the [...] "true" [...] self. Thus, the neurotic is like a clock's pendulum, oscillating between a fallacious [...] "perfection" [...] and a manifestation of self-hate. Horney referred to this phenomenon as the [...] "tyranny of the shoulds" [...] and the neurotic's hopeless [...] "search for glory". She concluded that these ingrained traits of the psyche forever prevent an individual's potential from being actualized unless the cycle of neurosis is somehow broken, through treatment or, in less severe cases, life lessons.|$|E
2500|$|Fromm {{believed}} that freedom was {{an aspect of}} human nature that we either embrace or escape. He observed that embracing our freedom of will was healthy, whereas escaping freedom {{through the use of}} escape mechanisms was the root of psychological conflicts. Fromm outlined three of the most common escape mechanisms: automaton conformity, authoritarianism, and destructiveness. Automaton conformity is changing one's <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> to conform to a perception of society's preferred type of personality, losing one's true self in the process. Automaton conformity displaces the burden of choice from self to society. Authoritarianism is giving control of oneself to another. By submitting one's freedom to someone else, this act removes the freedom of choice almost entirely. Lastly, destructiveness is any process which attempts to eliminate others or the world as a whole, all to escape freedom. Fromm said that [...] "the destruction of the world is the last, almost desperate attempt to save myself from being crushed by it".|$|E
30|$|Regarding our {{research}} question, we investigated whether the avatars {{created by the}} adolescents could be considered subjective representations of how they think they actually are (“real” selves”) real selves or how they desire {{to be in their}} imagination or in the future (“ideal selves”). To answer to this question, we analyzed avatar-self coherence versus avatar-self discrepancy in the context of our sample. Surprisingly, the results showed that the adolescents considered their avatars to be equally similar to both their real and <b>ideal</b> <b>selves.</b> In this sense, the adolescents of our sample seem to be characterized by an advanced level of self-construction, since their <b>ideal</b> <b>selves</b> appear not dissimilar from their real ones, if not substantially overlapping. This interpretation is confirmed by the significant positive correlation between the avatar-self coherence and avatar-self discrepancy questions.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, we {{performed}} a correlation analysis between the avatar-self coherence and avatar-self discrepancy questions, finding a significant positive relation between the two: ρ = . 454, p = . 001.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to explore, in a Japanese EFL context, the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> with some hypothesized relationships among motivated learning behaviour, self-efficacy, L 2 anxiety, and the perceived amount of information related to learners’ future self-guides by performing structural equation modelling on the data of 126 Japanese first-year university students. Moreover, the present study examines the possibility of postulating two levels of the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> to confirm whether a theoretical model better than Dörnyei’s original one can be attained by doing so. The SEM analysis showed that we can postulate two levels of the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self,</b> indeed resulting in a better theoretical model. The proposed model revealed that self-efficacy and the perceived amount of information had a positive influence on learners’ formation of a better <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self.</b> Furthermore, the model indicated that the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> and self-efficacy positively affected motivated learning behaviour, while the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> negatively affected anxiety. Based on these findings, the authors argue that the L 2 motivational self system (with the two levels of the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self)</b> can be developed into a framework that explains not only L 2 motivation but also other affective variables, all in one system...|$|R
2500|$|The {{division}} of the True and False self roughly develops from Freud's (1923) notion of the Superego which compels the Ego to modify and inhibit libidinal Id impulses, possibly leading to excessive repression but certainly altering the way the environment is perceived and responded to. However {{it is not a}} close equation as the Id, Ego and Superego are complex and dynamic inter-related systems that do not fit well into such a dichotomy. The theory more closely resembles Carl Rogers simplified notions of the Real and <b>Ideal</b> <b>self.</b> According to Winnicott, in every person the extent of division between True and False Self can be placed on a continuum between the healthy and the pathological. The True Self, which in health gives the person a sense of being alive, real, and creative, will always be in part or in whole hidden; the False Self is a compliant adaptation to the environment, but in health it does not dominate the person's internal life or block him from feeling spontaneous feelings, even if he chooses not to express them. The healthy False Self feels that it is still being true to the True Self. It can be compliant to expectations but without feeling that it has betrayed its [...] "True Self." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before writing Pierre, Melville {{read the}} Confessions by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Autobiographical Sketches and Confessions of an English Opium-Eater by Thomas De Quincey, Sartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle. Murray writes that Benjamin Disraeli's autobiographical novels {{provided}} him with [...] "more raw material for Pierre than any other author" [...] save Lord Byron. Scholar Merton M. Sealts, Jr. agrees with Murray that Melville's own fascination in his youth with Byron {{is reflected in the}} character of Pierre himself in the early chapters of the novel. [...] "The book which was most potent in fashioning Melville's ideal and thus indirectly affecting his personality and his writings", Murray suggests, was Thomas Moore's Life of Byron. Second to Byron only, [...] "though ahead of him as a source for the first two acts of Pierre", Disraeli—himself a Byronist—was another major influence of Melville's early ideal self-conception, and hence Pierre's personality. Still other yet less consequential [...] "architects of Melville's early <b>ideal</b> <b>self</b> and so of the character of Pierre of act 1" [...] are Walter Scott, Edmund Spenser, Thomas Moore, James Fenimore Cooper, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Melville developed the characterization of Pierre further with William Makepeace Thackery's Pendennis, and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, though the spirit of Shakespeare's play only pervades the early chapters, giving way to Hamlet's spirit later. As Book IX of Pierre says, [...] "Dante had made him fierce, and Hamlet had insinuated that {{there was no one to}} strike".|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{many studies}} have {{examined}} an important role of the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> in language learning motivation (see Csizér & Magid, 2014; Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2009). Yet, less {{is known about the}} relationships between the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> with current self-constructs, even though Ushioda and Dörnyei (2009) assert that it is the gap between the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> and the current selves that is the source of motivational power of the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self.</b> Moreover, there have been few attempts to examine antecedents of self-related beliefs (for exceptions, see Mercer, 2011). The aim of the current study is {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self,</b> self-efficacy beliefs and the English self-concept and identify the sources of self-related beliefs. 236 Polish learners of English aged 15 - 16 completed a motivational questionnaire, and 20 participated in semi-structured interviews. The quantitative data was analysed in SPSS, whereas the interviews were transcribed and coded. The results of regression analysis revealed that the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> is more closely related to learners’ self-efficacy beliefs than to their English self-concept, although the latter was also found to significantly contribute to the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self.</b> The interviewees reported six antecedents of self-related beliefs. These were: mastery experiences, grades, peer comparison, teachers, comparison across different domains, and other sources. The results suggests that the English self-concept and self-efficacy beliefs are socially co-constructed. The two constructs are also a basis on which students draw when creating positive visions of oneself as successful language learners. This finding is in line with Dörnyei’s (2009, p. 11) assertion that the <b>ideal</b> L 2 <b>self</b> is a possible self that one day can become reality...|$|R
