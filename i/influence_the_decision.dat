25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, {{as many women}} {{who are members of}} groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted {{within six months}} followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Agyarko's ministerial {{confirmation}} in February 2017, he {{was accused}} by Mahama Ayariga of the parliamentary appointment committee of bribing members of the minority to facilitate his approval as a Minister of energy. Ayariga reported on Radio Gold, that Agyarko through Muntaka Mubarak, the minority chief whip, had tried to <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of the Appointments Committee of Parliament by giving each minority member a bribe. The Speaker of Parliament, Aaron Mike Oquaye set up an adhoc parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. After the investigation, the Joe Ghartey committee exonerated Agyarko but cited and found Ayariga guilty of being in contempt of parliament for making false allegations against a colleague and bringing the parliament into disrepute. Ayariga was made to render an apology {{on the floor of}} parliament and warned to be mindful of his actions in the future. After his ministerial appointment was approved, Ayariga publicly praised Agyarko for his track record asserting that his nomination was approved on merit.|$|E

500|$|Enemies such as {{publisher}} and former Seward ally Horace Greeley cast doubts as to Seward's electability in the battleground states of Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. [...] Lincoln {{had worked hard}} to gain {{a reputation as a}} moderate in the party and hoped {{to be seen as a}} consensus second choice, who might be successful in those critical states, of which the Republicans had to win three to secure the election. Lincoln's men, led by his friend David Davis, were active on his behalf. As Lincoln had not been seen as a major candidate, his supporters had been able to <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to hold the convention in his home state, and surrounded the New York delegation, pro-Seward, with Lincoln loyalists. [...] They eventually were successful in gaining the support of the delegations from the other battleground states, boosting delegates' perceptions of Lincoln's electability. Although Lincoln and Seward shared many views, Lincoln, out of office since 1849, had not excited opposition as Seward had in the South and among Know Nothings. Lincoln's views on nativism, which he opposed, were not public.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford {{was founded in}} 1918 shortly {{after the end of}} the First World War. Ferdinand Foch, or [...] "Marshal Foch", was supreme commander of Allied forces from April 1918 onwards. The Chair was endowed by an arms trader, Basil Zaharoff, in Foch's honour; he also endowed a post in English Literature at the University of Paris in honour of the British Field Marshal Earl Haig. Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a right of veto over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this. The compromise reached was that Paris should have a representative on the appointing committee (although this provision was later removed). In advance of the first election, St√©phen Pichon (the French Foreign Minister) unsuccessfully attempted to <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> [...] The first professor, Gustave Rudler, was appointed in 1920. , the Chair is held by Catriona Seth. [...] The position is held in conjunction with a Fellowship of All Souls College.|$|E
500|$|In 1538, {{the king}} and Cromwell {{arranged}} with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance. Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the Schmalkaldic League since summer 1537. The Lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther, Friedrich Myconius. The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538. After initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to Lambeth Palace under Cranmer's chairmanship. Progress on an agreement was slow partly due to Cromwell being too busy to help expedite the proceedings and {{partly due to the}} negotiating team on the English side, which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers. The talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop's strenuous efforts. The negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king. Cranmer's colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry's Privy Council, had died earlier in the year. The king chose as his replacement Cranmer's conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice. On 5 August, when the German delegates {{sent a letter to the}} king regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of private masses for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for {{the king and}} to <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> The result was a thorough dismissal by the king of many of the Germans' chief concerns. Although Cranmer begged the Germans to continue with the negotiations using the argument [...] "to consider the many thousands of souls in England" [...] at stake, they left on 1 October having made no substantial achievements.|$|E

2500|$|L'Auberge rouge(CNRS √âditions), by {{historian}} Thierry Boudignon, {{challenges the}} official theory {{and suggests that}} {{the case of the}} Red Inn was a terrible miscarriage of justice based on rumors, dubious witnesses, and the need to [...] "make an example". It is based on the documents from local and national archives, analyses the procedures of the instruction (preparation of the case), and shows that patois was an obstacle because the clerk of the court [...] "interpreted" [...] in French testimony given in patois, rather than simply translating what witnesses said. It concludes that the objective of the magistrates was to develop a convincing narrative in order to <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of the jury. [...] Facts forbidden by law were presented in order to discredit the couple; the inadmissibility of some evidence didn't prevent the legal system from using it to secure a conviction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{team that}} wins the coin toss has {{the choice of}} batting first or last. This choice can be crucial to success; {{particularly}} in Test cricket. As the pitch is used {{for up to five}} consecutive days with little maintenance, the deterioration of the pitch with wear can have a major influence on the result of the match (e.g. typically the ability of spin bowlers to [...] "turn" [...] the ball increases toward the end of a Test match, whereas fast bowlers often prefer a harder and bouncier pitch often found {{at the start of a}} match). It is usual for some amount of grass to be left on the pitch on the first day of a Test, since it helps bind the surface. The presence of grass on the pitch is conducive for pace bowling, so a grassy pitch may also tempt a captain to field first. Sometimes, weather conditions also <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision,</b> since a cloud (especially overcast cloud) cover has been found to assist swing bowling. Aggressive captains such as Allan Border of Australia have been known to bat first in Test cricket regardless of the conditions.|$|E

60|$|The {{great and}} ever-present {{difference}} between the National or Federal affairs of the United States government and {{the affairs of the}} government of each individual State, should be borne in mind at all times by those who desire to understand the political position of the States. Till this be realized no one can have any correct idea of the bearings of politics in that country. As a matter of course we in England have been inclined to regard the government and Congress of Washington as paramount throughout the States, {{in the same way that}} the government of Downing Street and the Parliament of Westminster are paramount through the British isles. Such a mistake is natural; but not the less would it be a fatal bar to any correct understanding of the Constitution of the United States. The National and State governments are independent of each other, and so also are the National and State tribunals. Each of these separate tribunals has its own judicature, its own judges, its own courts, and its own functions. Nor can the supreme tribunal at Washington exercise any authority over the proceedings of the courts in the different States, or <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> of their judges. For not only are the National judges and State judges independent of each other, but the laws in accordance with which they are bound to act may be essentially different. The two tribunals--those of the nation and of the State--are independent and final in their several spheres. On a matter of State jurisprudence no appeal lies from the supreme tribunal of New York or Massachusetts to the supreme tribunal of the nation at Washington.|$|E
