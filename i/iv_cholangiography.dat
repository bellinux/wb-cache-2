40|$|BACKGROUND: On {{the basis}} of a {{flowchart}} including prior or current jaundice or pancreatitis, abnormal liver function, ultrasound or <b>IV</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> bile duct (BD) stones were suspected in 71 / 593 patients referred for gallstones. METHODS: When endoscopic retrograde cholangiography detected BD stones, endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) and endoscopic BD clearance were attempted, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). BD stones were found in 44 / 71 patients. The sensitivity values of preoperative conditions were: 92 % for <b>IV</b> <b>cholangiography,</b> 88 % for abnormal liver function, 50 % for ultrasound, and 37 % for jaundice at admission. RESULTS: Endoscopic clearance succeeded in 37 patients and LC was completed in 33 patients. Conversion to open surgery (9 %) was comparable with the rate in patients without BD stones. The median hospital stay for the sequential endoscopic and laparoscopic treatments was 13 days (range 4 - 54) or 22 days if open surgery was used. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, BD stones can be endoscopically cleared preoperatively in most patients without interfering with LC...|$|E
