25|$|In the {{minority}} of cases with bilaterally non-palpable testes, further testing {{to locate the}} testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. Pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often, but not invariably, locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. A karyotype can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome or mixed <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, feminizing {{reconstructive}} surgery {{continued to be}} recommended and performed throughout the 1990s on most virilized infant girls with CAH, as well as infants with ambiguity due to androgen insensitivity syndrome, <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> and some XY infants with severe genital birth defects such as cloacal exstrophy. Masculinizing {{reconstructive surgery}} continued on boys with severe hypospadias and the other conditions outlined above, with continued modifications and refinements intended to reduce unsatisfactory outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosing {{germ cell}} tumors may be {{difficult}} because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this is certainly the case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as <b>gonadal</b> atrophy or <b>dysgenesis</b> characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|R
40|$|Bardet–Biedl {{syndrome}} (BBS) is a multisystem {{autosomal recessive}} disorder with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. It {{is a type}} of ciliopathy characterized by retinal dystrophy, central obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, and <b>gonadal</b> and renal <b>dysgenesis.</b> It has been suggested that the involved proteins attach to the basal body of ciliated cells making this a disorder of ciliary dysfunction. We report two cases of typical BBS in a 17 -year-old female and 29 -year-old male patient, who presented for live-related renal transplant. We discuss the relevant points of the syndrome regarding anesthetic management...|$|R
25|$|Dysgerminoma {{accounts}} for 35% {{of ovarian cancer}} in young women and {{is the most likely}} germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25–30% of cases. These tumors may have mutations in the KIT gene, a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. People with an XY karyotype and ovaries (<b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis)</b> or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries (Turner syndrome) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a gonadoblastoma in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10–20% of the time.|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of dynamic}} {{endocrine}} tests is particularly helpful in isolating {{a diagnosis of}} PAIS. [...] One such test is the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test. [...] If the gonads are testes, {{there will be an}} increase in the level of serum testosterone in response to the hCG, regardless of testicular descent. [...] The magnitude of the testosterone increase can help differentiate between androgen resistance and <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> as does evidence of a uterus on ultrasound examination. [...] Testicular function can also be assessed by measuring serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels, which in turn can further differentiate PAIS from <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> and bilateral anorchia.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{differentials}} for CAIS {{are complete}} <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> (Swyer syndrome) and Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome or MRKH). [...] Both CAIS and Swyer syndrome {{are associated with}} a 46,XY karyotype, whereas MRKH is not; MRKH can thus be ruled out by checking for the presence of a Y chromosome, which can be done either by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis or on full karyotype. [...] Swyer syndrome is distinguished by poor breast development and shorter stature. [...] The diagnosis of CAIS is confirmed when androgen receptor (AR) gene sequencing reveals a mutation, although up to 5% of individuals with CAIS do not have an AR mutation.|$|E
5000|$|Chromosomal {{abnormalities}} (resulting in <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis)</b> - Turner's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Swyer's syndrome, XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis,</b> and mosaicism.|$|E
50|$|Swyer {{syndrome}} {{represents one}} phenotypic {{result of a}} failure of the gonads to develop properly, and hence is part of a class of conditions termed <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> There are many forms of <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Turner {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a demonstrable abnormality in or absence {{of one of the}} sex chromosomes that is the cause of the development of <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> In contrast XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> has a normal female chromosome situation.|$|E
50|$|Women with 46 XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> {{experience}} primary amenorrhea with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. There are {{forms of}} 46 xx <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> wherein abnormalities in the FSH-receptor {{have been reported}} and {{are thought to be}} the cause of the hypogonadism.|$|E
50|$|The term “pure gonadal dysgenesis” (PGD) {{has been}} used to {{distinguish}} a group of patients from <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> related to Turner syndrome. In the latter a distinct chromosomal aberration is present, while in PGD the chromosomal constellation is either 46,XX or 46,XY. Thus XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> is also referred to as PGD, 46 XX, and XY <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> as PGD, 46,XY or Swyer syndrome. Patients with PGD have a normal chromosomal constellation but may have localized genetic alterations.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} forms of <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis.</b> The term “pure gonadal dysgenesis” (PGD) {{has been used}} to {{describe}} conditions with normal sets of sex chromosomes (e.g., 46,XX or 46,XY), as opposed to those whose <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> results from missing {{all or part of the}} second sex chromosome. The latter group includes those with Turner syndrome (i.e., 45,X) and its variants, as well as those with mixed <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> and a mixture of cell lines, some containing a Y chromosome (e.g., 46,XY/45,X).|$|E
50|$|Another type of XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> {{is known}} as 46,XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> epibulbar dermoid, which follows the similar {{symptoms}} as the regular syndrome, though it also shows signs of epibulbar dermoid (eye disorder).

50|$|Swyer Syndrome (Also {{known as}} Pure <b>Gonadal</b> <b>Dysgenesis</b> or XY <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis)</b> {{is a type}} of {{hypogonadism}} in a person whose karyotype is 46,XY. The person is externally female with streak gonads, and left untreated, will not experience puberty. Such gonads are typically surgically removed (as they have a significant risk of developing tumors) and a typical medical treatment would include hormone replacement therapy with female hormones.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gonadal</b> <b>Dysgenesis</b> - is any {{congenital}} developmental {{disorder of}} the reproductive system {{characterized by a}} progressive loss of primordial germ cells on the developing gonads of an embryo.|$|E
50|$|Defects in this protein {{have been}} {{associated}} with partial <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> (PGD) accompanied by minifascicular polyneuropathy. This protein may be involved in both male gonadal differentiation and perineurial development.|$|E
50|$|For this reason, in <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> the {{accompanying}} hormonal failure also prevents {{the development of}} secondary sex characteristics in either sex, resulting in a sexually infantile female appearance and infertility.|$|E

50|$|XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> {{is related}} to the Swyer {{syndrome}} inasmuch as both conditions have the same phenotype and clinical issues; however in Swyer syndrome the karyotype is 46,XY, and thus gonadectomy is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Thus Swyer {{syndrome}} {{is referred to}} as PGD, 46,XY, and XX <b>gonadal</b> <b>dysgenesis</b> as PGD, 46,XX. Patients with PGD have a normal karyotype but may have defects of a specific gene on a chromosome.|$|E
