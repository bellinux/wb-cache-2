40|$|There remains {{considerable}} confusion as to {{how exactly}} the MiFID and UCITS directives will interact in the long run. This uncertainty reflects the growing pains of a regulatory transformation that represents no less than a tectonic shift from intense and prescriptive product regulation to a more flexible, principles-based regulation of management functions. Unlike UCITS, MiFID is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>directive</b> that cuts across the entire financial services industry (except for insurance). Precisely because the two directives are rooted in diverging regulatory philosophies, they are not natural partners, and the exercise of trying to fit the two together will likely be neither effortless nor seamless. This paper attempts {{to shed light on}} the complex interaction between UCITS and MiFID and gives some preliminary indications of how MiFID might impact on the asset management industry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give a broad {{analysis}} of changes in the field of consumer protection law in the European Union over three decades. In 2004, the European Commission launched a project of reviewing consumer law in order to strengthen consumers’ confidence in the internal market and to encourage businesses to conduct cross-border trading. The EU consumer protection regulatory framework is based on directives including a minimum harmonization clause. This clause allows Member States to maintain or adopt stricter consumer protection rules and leads to fragmentation in their national laws. For instance, it was found that the notion and definition of a consumer has been designed for use by a specific directive, depending on which area is covered by the regulation of the personal scope. The definition of the so-called weaker party in a contractual relationship is understood in a narrow way, which is highlighted in the established line of the European Court of Justice case law. A brief outline of the history of the shaping of consumer protection policy in the European Union is presented to demonstrate how the problem of amending consumer protection law has evolved in the EU as well as increased in importance; this has been demonstrated in several programs and resolutions of the European Parliament and communications of the European Commission, which discuss the need to reform consumer contract law. The Proposal for a <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Directive</b> on Consumer Rights is the result of a review of consumer law acquis communautaire, referred to as the Consumer Acquis, and aims at introducing a full harmonization clause where feasible. Until recently, the norms governing the determination of the law applicable to consumer contracts have been defined by the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contract relations. Due to its overly casuistic nature and outdated provisions relating to consumer contracts, it was decided to amend the Convention, which was changed into the Rome I Regulation...|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{designated}} TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as {{an expansion}} of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal resolution advisory capability. TCAS III was the [...] "next generation" [...] of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as Honeywell. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using horizontal as well as vertical manouevring directives to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, [...] "turn right, climb" [...] while the other would be directed [...] "turn right, descend." [...] This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and vertical aspects. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>directives</b> would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.|$|R
40|$|The area of {{interest}} of the thesis is the horizontal liberalisation of the free movement of services based on Directives No. 2006 / 123 /EC on services in the internal market, No. 2005 / 36 /EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, No. 96 / 71 /EC concerning the posting of workers {{in the framework of}} the provision of services and No. 2000 / 31 /EC on electronic commerce. More precisely the main subject matter can be defined as the shift in the basic legal regime of free movement of services achieved through these four directives compared to the original state, i. e. the general regime under EU primary law as interpreted by the ECJ. The main objective is to analyze and critically assess the extent and significance of this shift. The basic questions are: To what extent is the resulting legal framework formed by the four <b>horizontal</b> <b>directives</b> different from the original situation? Is it merely a codification of the case law of the ECJ or a result of legislator's efforts to liberalise further the regime? To what extent does the liberalised regime enable or support abuse of free movement of services in order to circumvent the national law of the host state? The conclusions are as follows: Owing to the four directives most cross-border services are now covered by EU secondary law. All of these [...] ...|$|R
40|$|After the {{adoption}} of the EU pension funds directive, the regulatory framework for asset management in the EU is complete. The single licence and home country control will now be applicable across the board for the different lines of asset management business. However, considering that asset management can be governed by 5 different regulatory regimes in the EU: banking, investment services, insurance, pension funds and investment funds, some parties have started to argue for a <b>horizontal</b> asset management <b>directive</b> as a single regime for all asset management business. This new CEPS report analyses the asset management industry in the EU and the consistency of the different regulatory regimes governing it. It concludes {{there is no need for}} a <b>horizontal</b> asset management <b>directive</b> to supersede the current directives, but that priority should be given to focus on “level 2 and 3 ” issues, this is to ensure uniform implementation and a harmonised approach in secondary legislation and in supervisory practices in the member states. The key outstanding issue on which policy makers should focus is taxation. The wide difference in tax regimes increases the cost of asset management and reduces returns to investors. Further convergence is therefore needed in the way member states tax fund management and a consensus should be reached on how to tax non-residents’ savings income...|$|R
40|$|In a {{large number}} of cases, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has held that the {{principle}} of equality and non-discrimination is a general and fundamental principle of Community law, the observance of which the ECJ has to ensure. This article argues that the ECJ has, in a number of recent cases concerning the Equality Directives of 2000, taken further steps towards the development of this principle and has bestowed on these <b>Directives</b> <b>horizontal</b> direct effect {{based on the fact that}} they are specific expressions of the, both horizontally and vertically, directly effective principle of equality...|$|R
40|$|Mutual {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most appreciated innovations of the EU. The idea is that one can pursue market integration, indeed "deep' market integration, while respecting 'diversity' amongst the participating countries. Put differently, in pursuing 'free movement' for goods, mutual recognition facilitates free movement by disciplining the nature and scope of 'regulatory barriers', whilst allowing some degree of regulatory discretion for EU Member States. This BEER paper attempts to explain the rationale and logic of mutual recognition in the EU internal goods market, its working in actual practice for about three decades now, culminating in a qualitative cost/benefit analysis and its recent improvement in terms of 'governance' in the so-called New Legislative Framework (first denoted as the 2008 Goods package) thereby ameliorating the benefits/costs ratio. For new (in contrast to existing) national regulation, the intrusive EU procedure to impose mutual {{recognition is}} presented as well, with basic data so as to show its critical importance to keep the internal goods market free. All this is complemented by a short summary of the scant economic literature on mutual recognition. Subsequently, the analysis is extended to the internal market for services. This is done in two steps, first by reminding the debate on the origin principle (which goes further than mutual recognition EU-style) and how mutual recognition works under the <b>horizontal</b> services <b>directive.</b> This is followed by a short section on how mutual recognition works in vertical (i. e. sectoral) services markets...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews ECJ {{case law}} on the {{conceptualization}} and legal circumscription {{of the doctrine of}} consistent interpretation, reflecting its fundamental importance as a mode of giving effect to Community law before national authorities. Legal uncertainty, an inherent characteristic of the technique, should be reduced, it is argued, by improving the reasoning of the ECJ's judgments. In particular, a highly critical discussion of the Arcaro judgment concludes that its precedent value is very limited. A parallelism in approach to both consistent interpretation and direct effect is suggested. Partly, this has already been achieved insofar as the issue of expiry of the transposition period of directives is concerned. In addition, the article suggests a reform of the case law on consistent interpretation in actions by the State versus individuals and offers explanations for the seemingly inconsistent nature of the cases producing a <b>horizontal</b> impact of <b>directives</b> despite the lack of horizontal direct effect properly so-called (incidental effects). In considering whether the doctrine gives rise to unacceptable legal uncertainty, a comparison with the interpretive obligation under the UK Human Rights Act 1998 is made, which produces similar results...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the ways}} in which Community law influences national laws in order to ascertain effective and uniform protection of individual Community rights. Two levels of influence were examined: first, the one at which the techniques and principles of bestowing the rights on individuals were developed, and second, the one at which national provisions on remedies and judicial procedures are influenced. The theoretical context within which the analysis was placed was Hohfeld's analysis of legal rights. Placed within this theoretical context, the inconsistencies in Community principles bestowing rights on individuals were found. The differentiation between vertical and <b>horizontal</b> effects of <b>Directives</b> cannot be justified from the Hohfeldian perspective. Apart from this inconsistency, it is concluded that the doctrine of direct effects developed as a criterion for justifiability of individual rights in national courts. At the level of remedies and procedures, it is concluded that the legal framework developed by the European Court which limits national procedural autonomy is capable of providing for the effective protection of individual Community rights. However, this framework does not guarantee uniformity in judicial protection. In order to achieve the equality of European citizens before the courts, it is suggested that Community legislation harmonizing national laws is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} of the European Commission for a Consumer Rights Directive in 2008 marked {{the culmination of}} the review of the acquis communautaire in the area of consumer contract law within the EU, launched in 2003 with the Action Plan for European Contract Law. Even though it was not initially restricted to consumer contract law, but concerned the contract law as a whole and targeted toward achieving a more coherent regu-latory framework without making a sharp distinction between B 2 B and B 2 C transactions, {{the final version of the}} Consumer Rights Directive has the specific aim of creating a real business-to-consumer Internal Market. This is to be achieved through the merging of a number of Directives in the area of consumer contract law into a single horizontal instrument that regulates common aspects in a systematic fashion through maximum harmonization, and will result in simplification and completion of the existing regulatory framework. The three main reasons as to why the Commission want to intervene in the consumer contract law of the Member States is, in other words, that differences in national legislation hinder the development of the Internal Market, that maximum harmonization would put an end to the legal fragmentation in the area of consumer contract law and that the EU is in need of a higher level of consumer protection. These three arguments put forward by the Commission as to why the European legislator should be active in the area of consumer contract law are, however, not motivating such far reaching interventions in the national legislation of the Member States and does not manage to find equilibrium between the competitiveness of businesses and the protection of consumers. Rather on the contrary, maximum harmonization does not seem to put an end to legal fragmentation at the same time as it is hard to reconcile with consumer protection. Legal fragmentation is, furthermore, far from the main reason as to why domestic trade has increased more than international trade within the EU during the past years. In the Green Paper on the Review on the Consumer Acquis, the Commission presented two options for the scope of the Consumer Rights Directive of interest for this Master’s thesis. The first was a horizontal instrument of maximum harmonization applicable to both national and international consumer transactions within the EU and the second a horizontal instrument limited to cross-border contracts. Whereas the first option was the one finally chosen for the Consumer Rights Directive, it seems as if the Commission neither considered the second option nor the alternative of applying a Regulation instead of a Directive in depth. The instrumental measure of a cross-border-only Regulation is more in line with the with the proper interpretation of the constitutional framework that is the European Treaties, and would have contributed to a general im-provement of the Consumer Rights Directive when it comes to the effectiveness of reaching the overall objective. The main reasons for this are that it is effective straight away, only affects them wishing to participate in the Internal Market and thereby take into consideration the different national preferences of the Member States at the same time as it is considerably less costly. Parallel legal regimes therefore seem to be even more in line with the objective of simplification of the regulatory framework of the EU than a Consumer Rights Directive of maximum harmonization. The problems associated to the definition of a cross-border-only Regulation can, together with the private international law issues, be solved through the use of Transnational Commercial Law and the Rome-I Regulation. The instrumental measure formally adopted by the Member States on the 10 th of October 2011 was, however, a <b>horizontal</b> Consumer Rights <b>Directive</b> of maximum harmonization which is to be transposed into the national consumer contract laws by the 13 th of December 2013 and applied in all Member States no later than the 13 th of June 2014. The specific aim of creating a business-to-consumer Internal Market along with the narrow personal and broad substantive scope make it well suited for the plausible development of that it is heading toward a European Consumer Code. This is especially so if it is allowed to get influenced by the Common Frame of Reference, which contain all characteristics of a European Civil Code and therefore has a great potential of contributing in making European contract law more coherent overall and bridge the sharp distinction between B 2 B and B 2 C transactions. Since the Commission has not made its intentions clear in this matter, it is for the future to reveal whether this will become reality...|$|R
