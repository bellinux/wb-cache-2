5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover {{the nature of the}} Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years ago. It is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and igneous platform which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical unit that binds together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the rhythmic mode.|$|E

5|$|Marginal {{abatement}} cost curves attempt {{to compare the}} financial costs of different options for reducing pollution in a region and are used in emissions trading, policy discussions and incentive programs. McKinsey & Company released its first marginal {{abatement cost}} (MAC) curve for greenhouse gas emissions in February 2007, which was updated to version two in January 2009. McKinsey & Company's MAC curve {{has become the most}} widely used and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for McKinsey’s consulting on climate change and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|Plants serve many {{functions}} in culture. The reliable provision of food through agriculture <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of civilization. The study of plant uses by native peoples is ethnobotany, while economic botany focuses on modern cultivated plants. Plants {{are used in}} medicine, providing many drugs from the earliest times to the present, and as the feedstock for many industrial products including timber and paper {{as well as a}} wide range of chemicals. Plants give millions of people pleasure through gardening.|$|E
5|$|The English law legal system, {{developed}} over the centuries, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now {{being part of the}} United Kingdom, the legal system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E

It is being investigated for possible use as a microbial insecticide for locust control. The microsporidian fungus Nosema locustae, once {{considered to be a}} protozoan, can be lethal to grasshoppers. It has to be consumed by mouth and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for a bait-based commercial microbial pesticide. Various other microsporidians and protozoans are found in the gut.|$|E
5|$|The {{second source}} of over-provisioning {{comes from the}} manufacturer, {{typically}} at 0%, 7% or 28%, based on {{the difference between the}} decimal gigabyte of the physical capacity and the decimal gigabyte of the available space to the user. As an example, a manufacturer might publish a specification for their SSD at 100, 120 or 128GB based on 128GB of possible capacity. This difference is 28%, 7% and 0% respectively and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the manufacturer claiming they have 28% of over-provisioning on their drive. This does not count the additional 7.37% of capacity available from the difference between the decimal and binary gigabyte.|$|E

5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to Ovid during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, Ovid recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for many later works.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolYb and atomic number70. It is the fourteenth and penultimate {{element in the}} lanthanide series, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the relative stability of its +2 oxidation state. However, like the other lanthanides, its most common oxidation state is +3, as in its oxide, halides, and other compounds. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules. Because of its closed-shell electron configuration, its density and melting and boiling points differ significantly from those of most other lanthanides.|$|E
