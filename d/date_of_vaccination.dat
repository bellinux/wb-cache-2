40|$|Background. Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) –infected persons {{have a high}} incidence of pneumonia and pneumococcal disease. Benefits <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> with the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) among these patients continue to be debated. Methods. The impact <b>of</b> PPV <b>vaccination</b> on the incidence of pneumonia events (i. e., the composite of pneumococcal pneumonia and pneumonia due to nonspecified organisms) was examined among participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort 5 -Site Study, an ongoing prospective study of HIV-infected patients matched to an HIV-uninfected control group. <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> PPV <b>vaccination</b> and pneumonia were determined by retrospective review of electronic medical records. Time to events was measured for up to 2 years from PPV vaccination or from enrollment for vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression methods were used to examine the incidence of pneumonia by HIV infection and PPV vaccination status. Results. Among 692 HIV-uninfected and 934 HIV-infected study participants, 59 % were vaccinated with PPV. The 2 -year incidence of pneumonia was 6 % (97 participants developed pneumonia).

40|$|Abstract Background During the 2009 {{influenza}} A/H 1 N 1 pandemic, adjuvanted {{influenza vaccines}} {{were used for}} the first time on a large scale. Results on the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing 2009 influenza A/H 1 N 1 -related hospitalisation are scanty and varying. Methods We conducted a matched case-control study in individuals with an indication for vaccination due to underlying medical conditions and/or age ≥ 60 years in the Netherlands. Cases were patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza infection between November 16, 2009 and January 15, 2010. Controls were matched to cases on age, sex and type of underlying medical condition(s) and drawn from an extensive general practitioner network. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE = 1 - OR). Different sensitivity analyses were used to assess confounding by severity of underlying medical condition(s) and the effect of different assumptions for missing <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Results 149 cases and 28, 238 matched controls were included. It was estimated that 22 % of the cases and 28 % of the controls received vaccination more than 7 days before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> onset of symptoms in cases. A significant number of breakthrough infections were observed. The VE was estimated at 19 % (95 %CI - 28 - 49). After restricting the analysis to cases with controls suffering from severe underlying medical conditions, the VE was 49 % (95 %CI 16 - 69). Conclusions The number of breakthrough infections, resulting in modest VE estimates, suggests that the MF- 59 ™ adjuvanted vaccine may have had only a limited impact on preventing 2009 influenza A/H 1 N 1 -related hospitalisation in this setting. As the main aim <b>of</b> influenza <b>vaccination</b> programmes is to reduce severe influenza-related morbidity and mortality from influenza in persons at high risk of complications, a more effective vaccine, or additional preventive measures, are needed. </p...|$|R

50|$|In these studies, data on {{childhood}} vaccinations {{were typically}} collected in periodic surveys, {{and the information}} on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated {{at the time of}} the second visit.

This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children - thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{season on the}} {{antibody}} response after Hepatitis B (HB), Measles and Rubella vaccination in humans was investigated. In view of the immunosuppressive effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), especially the B-waveband (UVB), it was hypothesised that a lower antibody response after vaccination procedures that were started in summer might be detectable. IgG assessments and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> were available 1. from a survey on the formation of anti-HB antibodies (anti-HBs) after vaccination to HB among paramedical students in Utrecht, 2. from an experimental study {{on the effect of}} artificial UVB on the immune response to HB vaccine, and 3. from a cross-sectional serosurveillance study on various vaccinations in a random sample of the Dutch population. In the surveys on HB the antibody formation {{in the course of a}} standard HB vaccination procedure (Engerix-B, SB; standard 0, 1, 6 months) was analysed by season of first vaccine injection. In the serosurveillance study the anti-Measles and anti-Rubella IgG titers in children who were aged 2 - 7 years at the time of the survey, and who had received their Mumps-, Measles-, Rubella-vaccination only once (MMR- 1, at 14 months of age) were analysed by age and season. The data from the survey among paramedical students indicated a slightly retarded antibody response during vaccinations that were started in a sunny season. However, this finding was not consistently found after breaking down the data by calendar year and at the end of the procedure equal levels of anti-HBs were found. In the other surveys no seasonal influences on the formation of antibodies could be established. These data support the hypothesis of a reduced immunoprotection due to high ambient UVR during sunny season only to a limited extent. The study design may have been too crude with respect to both personal differences in exposure and susceptibility to UVR and the immune responses following immunisation for demonstrating the postulated effect of UVR. An advice for the general population to avoid the starting <b>of</b> a <b>vaccination</b> procedure during sunny season appears to be premature at present...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Since March 2014, the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) {{outbreak}} in West Africa disrupted {{health care systems}} - especially in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – with a consequential stress on the area’s routine immunization programs. To address perceived decreased vaccination coverage, Sierra Leone conducted a catch-up vaccination campaign during 24 – 27 April 2015. We conducted a vaccination coverage survey and report coverage estimates surrounding {{the time of the}} EVD outbreak and the catch-up campaign. Methods We selected 3 villages from each of 3 communities and obtained <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> birth and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> with measles vaccine (MV) and the 3 rd dose of Pentavalent vaccine (Pentavalent 3) of all children under 4  years of age in the 9 selected villages. Vaccination data were obtained from parent-held health cards. We calculated the children’s MV and Pentavalent 3 coverage rates at 3 time points, 1 August 2014, 1 April 2015, and 1 May 2015, representing coverage rates before the EVD outbreak, during the EVD outbreak, and after the Maternal and Child Health Week (MCHW) catch-up campaign. Results The final sample size was 168 children. MV coverage among age-eligible children was 71. 3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 62. 1 % - 80. 4 %) and 45. 7 % (95 % CI: 29. 2 % - 62. 2 %) before and during the outbreak of EVD, respectively, and was 56. 8 % (95 % CI: 40. 8 % - 72. 7 %) after the campaign. Pentavalent 3 coverage among age-eligible children was 79. 8 % (95 % CI: 72. 6 % - 87. 0 %) and 40. 0 % (95 % CI: 22. 5 % - 57. 5 %) before and during the outbreak of EVD, and was 56. 4 % (95 % CI: 39. 1 % - 73. 4 %) after the campaign. Conclusions Coverage levels of MV and Pentavalent 3 were low before the EVD outbreak and decreased further during the outbreak. Although the MCHW catch-up campaign increased coverage levels, coverage remained below pre-outbreak levels. High-quality supplementary immunization activities should be conducted and routine immunization should be strengthened to address gaps in immunity among children in this EVD-affected area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This study aimed {{to provide a more}} individual, micro-level appreciation of infant mortality data. Previously, the focus of these data had been aggregative, at a fairly high level of aggregation - the country, county registration district. To that end, a team of research students at the Open University has examined vaccination registers at the sub-registration district level for 22 such districts. In 1853 vaccination was made compulsory and in 1871 legislation was introduced requiring all poor law unions to appoint vaccination officers and to set up a system of registration; this system, with only minor alterations, lasted until 1948. Under the 1871 Act, vaccination officers took over all the functions of the local registrars except for giving parents the statutory notice <b>of</b> compulsory <b>vaccination.</b> The vaccination registrar recorded the following: (i) the registration number in the civil birth register; (ii) <b>date</b> <b>of</b> birth; (iii) place of birth; (iv) name of child; (v) sex; (vi) name of father, or if illegitimate, mother; (vii) occupation of father or if illegitimate, mother; (viii) <b>date</b> <b>of</b> notice to vaccinate given to parent; (ix) <b>date</b> <b>of</b> successful <b>vaccination,</b> postponement or insusceptibility to vaccination; (x) name of medical man who signed the certificate; (xi) <b>date</b> <b>of</b> death of any child who died before vaccination; (xii) reference number in vaccination officer's report book on problem cases. From the monthly information on infant deaths, the vaccination officer compiled an infant death register on children dying under the age of one year. Medical historians have begun to recognise the historical importance of the compulsory provisions <b>of</b> Victorian <b>vaccination</b> legislation, which entailed the growth of a complex administrative structure necessary for its implementation. This can been seen as a forerunner of the Welfare State, particularly as regards the development of the public health movement. It is generally agreed that civil registration had reached a high standard of reliability by 1872, and as the vaccination birth registers and infant death registers are copies of the civil registers for the period 1872 - 1948, they constitute an unrivalled source of information on infant mortality for the period. Main Topics : The data consist of transcriptions from a sample <b>of</b> English <b>vaccination</b> registers, at the sub-registration district level, for selected years within the period 1871 - 1913. The variables differ slightly due to local custom and the transcribing methods employed but broadly, for each district, they consist of number in birth register; <b>date</b> <b>of</b> birth; address; gender; legitimacy; parents' occupation; <b>date</b> <b>of</b> vaccination; <b>date</b> <b>of</b> exception; <b>date</b> <b>of</b> death.

Whether the TIV can induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses that can cross-recognize divergent influenza virus strains is unknown. We immunized 6 influenza-naive pigtail macaques twice with the 2011 - 2012 season TIV and then challenged the macaques, along with 12 control macaques, serially with H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 viruses. We measured ADCC responses in plasma to {{a panel of}} H 1 and H 3 hemagglutinin (HA) proteins and influenza virus-specific CD 8 T cell (CTL) responses using a sensitive major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer reagent. The TIV was weakly immunogenic and, although binding antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), did not induce detectable influenza virus-specific ADCC or CTL responses. The H 1 N 1 challenge elicited robust ADCC to both homologous and heterologous H 1 HA proteins, but not influenza virus HA proteins from different subtypes (H 2 to H 7). There was no anamnestic influenza virus-specific ADCC or CTL response in vaccinated animals. The subsequent H 3 N 2 challenge did not induce or boost ADCC either to H 1 HA proteins or to divergent H 3 proteins but did boost CTL responses. ADCC or CTL responses were not induced by TIV vaccination in influenza-naive macaques.

In a previous retrospective study, 11 of 14 patients with so-called vaccine encephalopathy had Dravet syndrome that {{was associated with}} de-novo mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN 1 A. In this study, we aimed to establish whether the apparent association of Dravet syndrome with vaccination was caused by recall bias and, if not, whether vaccination affected the onset or outcome of the disorder. Methods We retrospectively studied patients with Dravet syndrome who had mutations in SCN 1 A, whose first seizure was a convulsion, and for whom validated source data were available. We analysed medical and vaccination records to investigate whether there was an association between <b>vaccination</b> and onset <b>of</b> seizures in these patients. Patients were separated into two groups according to whether seizure onset occurred shortly after vaccination (vaccination-proximate group) or not (vaccination-distant group). We compared clinical features, intellectual outcome, and type of SCN 1 A mutation between the groups. Findings <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and seizure onset were available from source records for 40 patients. We identified a peak {{in the number of}} patients who had seizure onset within 2 days after vaccination. Thus, patients who had seizure onset on the day of or the day after vaccination (n= 12) were included in the vaccination-proximate group and those who had seizure onset 2 days or more after vaccination (n= 25) or before vaccination (n= 3) were included in the vaccination-distant group. Mean age at seizure onset was 18 · 4 weeks (SD 5 · 9) in the vaccination-proximate group and 26 · 2 weeks (8 · 1) in the vaccination-distant group (difference 7 · 8 weeks, 95 % CI 2 · 6 – 13 · 1; p= 0 · 004). There were no differences in intellectual outcome, subsequent seizure type, or mutation type between the two groups (all p values > 0 · 3). Furthermore, in a post-hoc analysis, intellectual outcome did not differ between patients who received vaccinations after seizure onset and those who did not. Interpretation Vaccination might trigger earlier onset of Dravet syndrome in children who, because of an SCN 1 A mutation, are destined to develop the disease. However, vaccination should not be withheld from children with SCN 1 A mutations because we found no evidence that vaccinations before or after disease onset affect outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} factors {{associated}} with measles vaccine effectiveness {{and the effect of}} two doses of vaccine on measles susceptibility during an outbreak. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A secondary school in the City of Toronto. SUBJECTS: The entire school population (1135 students 14 to 21 years of age). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of measles during an outbreak associated with age at first measles vaccination, length of time since vaccination, vaccination before 1980 and whether <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> was estimated; vaccine efficacy of one dose versus two doses. RESULTS: Eighty-seven laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed cases of measles were identified (for an attack rate of 7. 7 %). The measles vaccination rate was 94. 2 %, and 10 % of the students had received two doses of measles vaccine before the outbreak. Among those who had received only one dose of vaccine, vaccination at less than 15 months of age was associated with vaccine failure (relative risk 3. 62, 95 % confidence interval 2. 32 to 5. 66). There was no increased risk of vaccine failure associated with length of time since vaccination once the relative risk was adjusted for age at vaccination in a stratified analysis. Vaccination before 1980 and an estimated <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> were not associated with increased risk of vaccine failure. Administration of a second dose of vaccine during the outbreak was not protective. Two doses of vaccine given before the outbreak conferred significant protection, and the relative risk of failure after one dose versus two doses was 5. 0 (95 % confidence interval 1. 25 to 20. 15). Of the 87 cases, 76 (87 %) could have been prevented had all the students received two doses of measles vaccine before the outbreak, with the first at 12 months of age or later. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed primary measles vaccination (at 15 months of age or later) significantly reduced measles risk at later ages. However, revising the timing of the current 12 -month dose would leave children vulnerable during a period in which there is increased risk of complications. The findings support a population-based two-dose measles vaccination strategy for optimal measles control and eventual disease elimination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV, genus: Phlebovirus, family: Bunyaviridae), is an {{arbovirus}} {{which causes}} significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in animals and humans. RVFV was introduced {{for the first time}} in Egypt in 1977. In endemic areas, the insect vector control and vaccination is considering appropriate measures if applied properly and the used vaccine is completely safe and the vaccination programs cover all the susceptible animals. Egypt is importing livestock and camels from the African Horn & the Sudan for human consumption. The imported livestock and camels were usually not vaccinated against RVFV. But in rare occasions, the imported livestock were vaccinated but with unknown <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and the unvaccinated control contacts were unavailable for laboratory investigations. Also, large number of the imported livestock and camels are often escaped slaughtering for breeding which led to the spread of new strains of FMD and the introduction of RVFV from the enzootic African countries.

In a previous retrospective study, 11 of 14 patients with so-called vaccine encephalopathy had Dravet syndrome that {{was associated with}} de-novo mutations of the sodium channel gene SCN 1 A. In this study, we aimed to establish whether the apparent association of Dravet syndrome with vaccination was caused by recall bias and, if not, whether vaccination affected the onset or outcome of the disorder. METHODS: We retrospectively studied patients with Dravet syndrome who had mutations in SCN 1 A, whose first seizure was a convulsion, and for whom validated source data were available. We analysed medical and vaccination records to investigate whether there was an association between <b>vaccination</b> and onset <b>of</b> seizures in these patients. Patients were separated into two groups according to whether seizure onset occurred shortly after vaccination (vaccination-proximate group) or not (vaccination-distant group). We compared clinical features, intellectual outcome, and type of SCN 1 A mutation between the groups. FINDINGS: <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and seizure onset were available from source records for 40 patients. We identified a peak {{in the number of}} patients who had seizure onset within 2 days after vaccination. Thus, patients who had seizure onset on the day of or the day after vaccination (n= 12) were included in the vaccination-proximate group and those who had seizure onset 2 days or more after vaccination (n= 25) or before vaccination (n= 3) were included in the vaccination-distant group. Mean age at seizure onset was 18. 4 weeks (SD 5. 9) in the vaccination-proximate group and 26. 2 weeks (8. 1) in the vaccination-distant group (difference 7. 8 weeks, 95 % CI 2. 6 - 13. 1; p= 0. 004). There were no differences in intellectual outcome, subsequent seizure type, or mutation type between the two groups (all p values > 0. 3). Furthermore, in a post-hoc analysis, intellectual outcome did not differ between patients who received vaccinations after seizure onset and those who did not. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination might trigger earlier onset of Dravet syndrome in children who, because of an SCN 1 A mutation, are destined to develop the disease. However, vaccination should not be withheld from children with SCN 1 A mutations because we found no evidence that vaccinations before or after disease onset affect outcome.

40|$|Background: Whether seroresponse to {{a vaccine}} such as {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) vaccine {{can provide a}} measure of the functional immune status of HIV-infected persons is unknown. This study evaluated the relationship between HBV vaccine seroresponses and progression to clinical AIDS or death. Methods and Findings: From a large HIV cohort, we evaluated those who received HBV vaccine only after HIV diagnosis and had anti-HBs determination 1 – 12 months after the last vaccine dose. Non-response and positive response were defined as anti-HBs, 10 and $ 10 IU/L, respectively. Participants were followed from <b>date</b> <b>of</b> last <b>vaccination</b> to clinical AIDS, death, or last visit. Univariate and multivariable risk of progression to clinical AIDS or death were evaluated with Cox regression models. A total of 795 participants vaccinated from 1986 – 2010 were included, of which 41 % were responders. During 3, 872 person-years of observation, 122 AIDS or death events occurred (53 % after 1995). Twenty-two percent of non-responders experienced clinical AIDS or death compared with 5 % of responders (p, 0. 001). Non-response to HBV vaccine was associated with a greater than 2 -fold increased risk of clinical AIDS or death (HR 2. 47; 95 % CI, 1. 38 – 4. 43) compared with a positive response, after adjusting for CD 4 count, HIV viral load, HAART use, and delayed type hypersensitivity skin test responses (an in vivo marker of cell-mediated immunity). This association remained evident among those with CD 4 coun...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} and analyse {{a mathematical}} model describing immune response to avascular tumour {{under the influence of}} immunotherapy and chemotherapy and their combinations as well as vaccine treatments. The effect of vaccine therapy is considered as a parametric perturbation of the model. In the case of a weak immune response, neither immunotherapy nor chemotherapy is found to cause tumour regression to a small size, which would be below the clinically detectable threshold. Numerical simulations show that the efficiency of vaccine therapy depends on both the tumour size and the condition of immune system {{as well as on the}} response of the organism to vaccination. In particular, we found that vaccine therapy becomes more effective when used without time delay from a prescribed <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> after surgery and is ineffective without preliminary treatment. For a strong immune response, our model predicts the tumour remission under vaccine therapy. Our study of successive chemo/immuno, immuno/chemo and concurrent chemoimmunotherapy shows that the chemo/immuno sequence is more effective while concurrent chemoimmunotherapy is more sparing...|$|E
40|$|Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV, genus: Phlebovirus, family: Bunyaviridae), is an {{arbovirus}} {{which causes}} significant {{morbidity and mortality}} in animals and humans. RVFV was introduced {{for the first time}} in Egypt in 1977. In endemic areas, the insect vector control and vaccination is considering appropriate measures if applied properly and the used vaccine is completely safe and the vaccination programs cover all the susceptible animals. Egypt is importing livestock and camels from the African Horn & the Sudan for human consumption. The imported livestock and camels were usually not vaccinated against RVFV. But in rare occasions, the imported livestock were vaccinated but with unknown <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination</b> and the unvaccinated control contacts were unavailable for laboratory investigations. Also, large number of the imported livestock and camels are often escaped slaughtering for breeding which led to the spread of new strains of FMD and the introduction of RVFV from the enzootic African countries. This article provide general picture about the present situation of RVFV in Egypt to help in controlling this important disease...|$|E

Monitoring adverse events following 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccination in {{pregnant women}} was a priority for the mass immunization campaign beginning November 2009. Methods/FindingsWe characterized reports to the national passive surveillance from November 2009 through August 2010 involving adverse events following 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccines among pregnant women. Reports from the passive surveillance were matched to a large-linked database on a unique identifier, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccination,</b> and date of diagnosis in a capture-recapture analysis to estimate the true number of spontaneous abortion after 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccination. We verified 16 spontaneous abortions, 11 stillbirths, 4 neonatal deaths, 4 nonpregnancy-specific adverse events, and 2 inadvertent immunizations in recipients who were unaware of pregnancy at time of vaccination. The Chapman capture-recapture estimator of true number of spontaneous abortion after 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccination was 329 (95...|$|E

40|$|Quantified in {{the study}} are the extent of missed {{opportunities}} for immunization and the potential increases in vaccination coverage and timeliness that could be achieved by using all health centre visits to administer childhood vaccinations in the Central African Republic. The data were collected during a national <b>vaccination</b> coverage survey <b>of</b> 642 children aged 12 - 23 months from three areas: rural, urban, and the capital, Bangui. <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> all <b>vaccination</b> visits and other health centre visits were obtained from combined vaccination/health cards. Nationwide, 70 % of all opportunities for valid measles <b>vaccination</b> were missed. <b>Of</b> these, 28 % occurred at visits when at least one vaccine was given, while 72 % occurred at other health centre visits. If {{there had been no}} missed opportunities to administer all vaccinations due when at least one vaccine was given, the coverage would have increased from 53 % to 67 % for the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus series, from 54 % to 70 % for measles, and from 34 % to 59 % for all antigens. If there had been no missed opportunities at any visit, the corresponding increases would have been to 70 %, 76 %, and 65 %. For measles, 46 % of the potential increase depends on recognizing that an earlier dose of the vaccine was invalid and on revaccinating. Days-at-risk for measles (after the age of 270 days) would have been reduced by a mean of 74 days per subject with a health card had no opportunities been missed. The method used serves as a valuable adjunct to evaluations of missed opportunities based on exit interviews at health facilities. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
