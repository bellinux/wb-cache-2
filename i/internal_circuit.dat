40|$|On-chip {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) protection circuits {{had been built}} in IC chips to protect the devices and circuits against ESD damage. But, ESD protection circuits constructed with the scaled-down CMOS devices are very weak to ESD stress. Therefore, novel ESD protection solutions must be developed to overcome this reliability challenge for integrated circuits fabricated in the nano-scale CMOS technology. In this paper, the whole-chip ESD protection strategy for CMOS integrated circuits in nanotechnology has been proposed with two main methods. One is the substrate- triggered circuit technique used to effectively improve ESD robustness of devices in the nano-scale CMOS technology. The other is the novel design concept of “ESD Buses ” used to solve the internal ESD damage issue of CMOS IC with multiple and separated power lines. The <b>internal</b> <b>circuits</b> or interface circuits, realized by nano-scale CMOS devices, are more sensitive to such internal ESD damage issue. By using ESD buses, ESD current can be quickly discharged {{far away from the}} <b>internal</b> <b>circuits</b> or interface circuits of CMOS IC to achieve the goal of whole-chip ESD protection. 1...|$|R

50|$|DFT {{techniques}} {{have been used}} {{at least since the}} early days of electric/electronic data processing equipment. Early examples from the 1940s/50s are the switches and instruments that allowed an engineer to “scan” (i.e., selectively probe) the voltage/current at some internal nodes in an analog computer scan. DFT often is associated with design modifications that provide improved access to <b>internal</b> <b>circuit</b> elements such that the local internal state can be controlled (controllability) and/or observed (observability) more easily. The design modifications can be strictly physical in nature (e.g., adding a physical probe point to a net) and/or add active circuit elements to facilitate controllability/observability (e.g., inserting a multiplexer into a net). While controllability and observability improvements for <b>internal</b> <b>circuit</b> elements definitely are important for test, they are not the only type of DFT. Other guidelines, for example, deal with the electromechanical characteristics of the interface between the product under test and the test equipment. Examples are guidelines for the size, shape, and spacing of probe points, or the suggestion to add a high-impedance state to drivers attached to probed nets such that the risk of damage from back-driving is mitigated.|$|E
50|$|A salt bridge, in electrochemistry, is a {{laboratory}} device used {{to connect the}} oxidation and reduction half-cells of a galvanic cell (voltaic cell), a type of electrochemical cell. It maintains electrical neutrality within the <b>internal</b> <b>circuit,</b> preventing the cell from rapidly running its reaction to equilibrium. If no salt bridge were present, the solution in one half cell would accumulate negative charge and the solution in the other half cell would accumulate positive charge as the reaction proceeded, quickly preventing further reaction, and hence production of electricity.|$|E
40|$|With {{downscaling}} of device {{dimensions in}} integrated circuits (ICs), {{the risk of}} circuit failure due to electrostatic discharge (ESD) is increasing. In particular, the increased usage of automated handlers is causing charged device model (CDM) ESD induced failures to become more prominent. Gate oxide failure is the primary signature of CDM ESD. During CDM, the IC is the source {{as well as the}} path for the static charge. Therefore, it is important to include the circuit elements representing the package, ESD circuits and the silicon substrate of the packaged ICs. Power domain crossing circuits, also known as internal I/Os, are susceptible to gate oxide damage during CDM events. In this thesis, circuit-level simulations of <b>internal</b> I/O <b>circuits</b> are used to elucidate the roles of the package, power clamp placement, anti-parallel diode placement and decoupling capacitors in determining the amount of stress at the <b>internal</b> I/O <b>circuits.</b> This thesis will also provide design recommendations for preventing CDM failures in the <b>internal</b> I/O <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

Modern DFT techniques, hence, have to offer options that allow next generation chips and assemblies to be tested on existing test equipment and/or reduce the requirements/cost for new test equipment. As a result, DFT techniques are continually being updated, such as incorporation of compression, in order to make sure that tester application times stay within certain bounds dictated by the cost target for the products under test.|$|E

50|$|A {{striplight}} is a multi-circuit stage lighting instrument. Striplights {{are one of}} {{the most}} basic types of lighting fixtures available. They usually consist of row of lamps. A single striplight is usually wired internally into either 3 or 4 circuits. Each <b>internal</b> <b>circuit</b> consists of several lamps evenly spaced within the unit. Often, a lighting designer will use roundels (colored glass lenses) or gels to make these lights different colors. The unit can then be wired into several different circuits, allowing each bank of colored lights to be controlled by a separate dimmer on the lighting board. Striplights are often used to color a cyclorama, or can alternately be positioned behind the proscenium arch to provide a general overhead color wash.|$|E

A voltage-fed inverter with a series connection to a parallel load is also known as a third order system. Basically this is similar to solid state, but in this system the series connected internal capacitor and inductor are connected to a parallel output tank circuit. The principal advantage of this type of system is the robustness of the inverter due to the <b>internal</b> <b>circuit</b> effectively isolating the output circuit making the switching components less susceptible to damage due to coil flash-overs or mismatching.|$|E
