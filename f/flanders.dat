5|$|In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, {{appointed}} <b>Flanders</b> to the Business Advisory Council, {{which was}} created to provide input to the administration on matters affecting business. The Council then made <b>Flanders</b> chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. <b>Flanders</b> reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President Roosevelt was preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that <b>Flanders</b> felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 {{calendar}} he {{won gold}} at the Summer Olympics {{in the individual}} time trial event and the Milan–San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of <b>Flanders.</b> Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster two-year period, Cancellara again won the Tour of <b>Flanders</b> and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of <b>Flanders.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Flanders</b> {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, <b>Flanders</b> described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the machine tool industry for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont. In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where <b>Flanders</b> became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. <b>Flanders</b> and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{he moved}} to Springfield, Vermont {{to work as a}} {{mechanical}} engineer for the Fellows Gear Shaper Company. He was already friendly with James Hartness, the president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company (J), another company in town. In 1911, <b>Flanders</b> married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired <b>Flanders</b> as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic lathe. <b>Flanders</b> redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Vermont Governor George Aiken {{appointed}} <b>Flanders</b> to two commissions: first, the Special Milk Investigative Committee {{to study}} ways to modernize dairying in Vermont; and second, the Flood Control Commission, which chose <b>Flanders</b> as its chairman. This commission was {{to negotiate with}} other New England states a means of sharing costs {{in a system of}} flood-control dams.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, <b>Flanders</b> became {{involved}} in the Committee for Economic Development (CED), an offshoot of the Business Advisory Council, whose purpose was to help re-align the nation to a peacetime economy after the war. <b>Flanders</b> reported helping to shape the CED’s recommendations to Congress on roles for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.|$|E
5|$|In October 1916, the <b>Flanders</b> Flotilla {{was finally}} {{reinforced}} by the German Admiralty with two full torpedo boat flotillas. The transfer of the 3rd and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas to <b>Flanders</b> had immediate consequences to {{the balance of power}} in the Dover Strait. Whereas before, the <b>Flanders</b> Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats and several of the smaller inferior A-class torpedo boats, they now possessed 23large torpedo boats capable of meeting the British Dover Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the <b>Flanders</b> Flotilla had not sortied against the Dover Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} many other National Trust properties, Little Moreton Hall is {{available}} for hire as a film location; in 1996 {{it was one of}} the settings for Granada Television's adaptation of Daniel Defoe's Moll <b>Flanders,</b> The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll <b>Flanders.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} and winter of 1382, <b>Flanders</b> had been invaded by Charles VI of France. Philip Van Artevelde had fallen at the Battle of Roosebeke {{and the country}} had been {{compelled}} {{to submit to the}} French king, who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII. In response to events in <b>Flanders,</b> Pope Urban issued bulls for the proclamation of a crusade, choosing Bishop Despenser to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in <b>Flanders.</b> He granted Despenser extraordinary powers for the fulfillment of his mission and plenary indulgence to those who should take part in or contribute support to it.|$|E
5|$|Ned <b>Flanders</b> - (Unlockable) Ned <b>Flanders</b> is a weak {{character}} with very strong special attacks. His prayer attack {{is the most}} damaging in the game as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix is {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} other famous cobbled race, the Tour of <b>Flanders</b> in Belgium. Paris–Roubaix is flatter and has more difficult cobbles while the Tour of <b>Flanders</b> contains a series of hills, many on cobbles, like the Koppenberg or Kapelmuur.|$|E

5|$|The first Type UBI {{to enter}} service was UB-10, which formed {{the nucleus of}} the <b>Flanders</b> Flotilla, on 27 March 1915. By the end of April five more Type UBI boats had become operational. UB-10 was {{eventually}} joined in the <b>Flanders</b> Flotilla by UB-2, UB-4, UB-5, UB-6, UB-12, UB-13, UB-16, and UB-17; of these, only UB-2 made the journey to <b>Flanders</b> by sea rather than rail.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Flanders</b> {{finds out}} that the {{children}} were not baptized, he takes {{it upon himself to}} give the kids an emergency baptism. When Homer and Marge are declared decent parents, they quickly head for the Springfield River to stop <b>Flanders.</b> Just as <b>Flanders</b> is about to pour holy water on Bart, Homer shoves Bart over to prevent the water from hitting him. The Simpson family is reunited, and they head home together.|$|E
5|$|Wilders {{has also}} revived the old idea of reuniting <b>Flanders</b> with the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on <b>Flanders</b> in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed seaworthy to sail to Germany when the bases in <b>Flanders</b> were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E
5|$|Due to her honesty, Marge {{does not}} sell any homes. Hutz informs {{her to use}} more {{positive}} descriptions when selling the houses, and also informs Marge if she does not sell {{a house in the}} first week, she will be fired. Marge tries to bend the truth, but fails as she just cannot lie to others. Marge does not disclose the entire truth of the house she sells to Ned <b>Flanders</b> and his family, which had been the site of a multiple homicide. The <b>Flanders</b> purchase the house and bid farewell to the Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, <b>Flanders</b> {{received}} more than sixteen honorary degrees from institutions that included Dartmouth College, Harvard University (LL.D.), Middlebury College (D. Sc.) and the University of Vermont (D. Eng.).|$|E
5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of <b>Flanders</b> and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he {{was finally able to}} sail for <b>Flanders,</b> at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flanders</b> died in 1970 and he {{is buried}} in the Summer Hill Cemetery in Springfield, Vermont, {{alongside}} his wife, Helen, {{and members of the}} Hartness family.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{conflict}} {{broke out}} in 1127, when Charles, the childless Count of <b>Flanders,</b> was murdered, creating a local succession crisis. Backed by King Louis, William Clito was chosen by the Flemings to become their new ruler. This development potentially threatened Normandy, and Henry began to finance a proxy war in <b>Flanders,</b> promoting the claims of William's Flemish rivals. In an effort to disrupt the French alliance with William, Henry mounted an attack into France in 1128, forcing Louis to cut his aid to William. William died unexpectedly in July, removing the last major challenger to Henry's rule and bringing the war in <b>Flanders</b> to a halt. Without William, the baronial opposition in Normandy lacked a leader. A fresh peace was made with France, and the King {{was finally able to}} release the remaining prisoners from the revolt of 1123, including Waleran of Meulan, who was rehabilitated into the royal court.|$|E
5|$|His wife, Helen Hartness <b>Flanders,</b> was a {{folk song}} {{collector}} {{and author of}} several books on New England ballads.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned <b>Flanders</b> becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When <b>Flanders</b> discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When <b>Flanders</b> thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of <b>Flanders,</b> called the cobbled classics, other spring races like Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Gent–Wevelgem feature extensive cobbles.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1946, Vermont Governor Mortimer R. Proctor {{appointed}} <b>Flanders</b> to the U.S. Senate as a Republican {{to complete}} the term of Republican Senator Warren Austin. Austin had just been appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman as Ambassador to the United Nations. Flanders's appointment gave him seniority over the freshman Senators who would be elected four days later on November 5. <b>Flanders</b> ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.|$|E
