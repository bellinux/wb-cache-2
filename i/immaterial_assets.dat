There are straight forward ways of establishing {{the value of the}} material assets and stakeholders can easily find this information in either the income statement or the balance sheet. However modern businesses are increasingly reliant on their <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets</b> in order to generate value, since there is no equivalent to the balance sheet for <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets</b> - where do stakeholders find information on the subject, and how do the businesses themselves value intellectual capital? Purpose: In order to understand where and how companies disclose and value their intellectual capital, this thesis has analyzed the annual reports of three leading Swedish knowledge-companies from a two year period, and interviews have been conducted with key individuals at said companies. Methodology: Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in this study. The qualitative part consists of primary data which was gathered through a questionnaire that was collected by e-mail, and secondary data was gathered from websites and financial reports of the selected companies. Qualitative data was gathered through the questionnaires alone, and processed through Spearman’s coefficient of rank correlation. Conclusion: The chosen companies have chosen not to disclose much of their intellectual capital in their annual reports, one company even removing the subsection intellectual capital from their annual report. It was found that human capital is the most valued component on intellectual capital. We have found that the selected companies do not use any specific method to valuate their intellectual capital.

40|$|The {{concept of}} "intellectual {{property}} " {{has gained a}} lot of attention recently. Several conflicting trends make it a focal point of controversy. The global trend towards an "information society " gives an increasing role to information, knowledge and other <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets</b> in production. Therefore the economy also needs ways of controlling, identifying and using <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets.</b> This happens largely through the concept of intellectual property. In economical terms, the notion of intellectual property and the connected immaterial property rights are a way of regulating free markets, setting up limited monopolies in the name of economic incentive for innovation and creativity [1]. A conflict readily arises, because our cultural traditions include deep-seated convictions and practices that emphasize the fact that intellectual "things " are immaterial also {{in the sense that they}} can not or should not be made into property or into commodities. Just to mention one example, the ideal of modern science has been that knowledge or at least scientific knowledge is by definition something that can not be owned, something that by definition is open to all.

Included among these are also the so-called citizenship behaviours. The {{purpose of the study}} was to expand knowledge on the connections between company reputation and citizenship behaviours. Commitment and loyalty are constructs known to be influenced by reputation, and likewise to influence citizenship behaviours. One of the objectives was to confirm their status. The focal point of the study was to expand the model to include customers’ identification with the company. Generic citizenship behaviours and word of mouth intentions were measured as outcomes. Trust was also tested as moderator for reputation-commitment and reputation-identification connections. The study was constructed as a quantitative survey set into online fashion retail context. The data acquisition was executed over approximately two weeks and resulted in 211 valid responses from Facebook followers of the co-operating company. The analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics and AMOS; structural equation modelling was used to test the viability of the model and hypotheses. The results were partly in accord with the previous literature. Factors measuring commitment and trust were removed from the model due to validity issues, thus remaining untested. Reputation had significant influence on loyalty and identification, as well as both outcome variables. These were as literature suggested. Loyalty notably influenced word of mouth intentions, but not citizenship behaviours. Identification in turn influenced citizenship behaviours, but not word of mouth intentions.

The main results are: (1) despite growing population, the fraction of labor engaged in spying activities tends to be constant; (2) in economies in which the R D process is more vulnerable to ideas theft, growth rates are lower but product differentiation will be more intense; (3) intellectual misappropriation neutralizes the positive growth effect of R D subsidies but not their positive level effects. ...|$|R

This new kind of competiveness is able to think the opposing movement of competition and cooperation and also needs {{a new way of}} thinking to transform information into useful knowledge and a new way of acting defined by a pro-active management able to use useful information, knowledge and skills in concrete actions. In using informational competitiveness, companies have understood that the useful information for acting has changed of nature {{with the arrival of the}} world knowledge economy founded on <b>immaterial</b> capital <b>assets.</b> In order to increase their competitiveness, companies need to build a qualitative analysis of information, in being able to capture and analyze all the weak signals among the world environment, in order to be able to make correct expectations about future markets.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to assess the potential economic consequences of the G 4 + 1 proposed changes to lease accounting by examining companies in the UK retail sector over the 1994 - 99 period. The magnitude {{of the impact of}} lease capitalisation is assessed by examining the effect on nine key accounting ratios that are used in decision-making and in financial contracts. A 'constructive capitalisation' procedure is used to estimate the unrecorded lease liability and asset. Operating lease finance is shown to be very important in the retail sector, with a long-term liability approximately 3. 3 times higher than on-balance sheet long-term debt; by contrast, finance leases are <b>immaterial.</b> Operating leased <b>assets,</b> the major part of which is 'land and buildings' (98 %), represent a significant proportion (28 %) of reported total assets. Capitalisation of operating leases would {{have a major impact on}} all nine ratios. Further, the ranking of companies changes markedly for asset turnover, interest cover and the three capital-based gearing measures, and especially for general retailers. Using credit-risk adjusted discount rates would lessen slightly the impact of capitalisation, but would have little impact on intra-sector ranking of company performance. Anticipation of future lease rental increases would have a significant impact on the level of operating lease assets/liabilities and on profit after tax. While the use of renewable short lease contracts (or break clauses) would reduce the level of operating lease assets and liabilities, substantial amounts would remain to be reported on-balance sheet. These findings contribute to the assessment of the economic consequences of a policy change requiring operating lease capitalisation. Prior research suggests that individual users of financial statements are not efficient information processors, and also that company managers do not believe that users, even in aggregate (e. g. the stock market) are efficient processors. Consequently, the significant changes in the magnitude of key accounting ratios and the major shift in company performance rankings suggest that interested parties' economic decisions are likely to be affected...|$|R

The empirical results quantify the contribution of material, immaterial (information technology and advertising) and intangible (organization capital) assets to economic value of Spanish banks, separated from the contribution of market power.

This paper discusses this evolutionary institutional process, and stresses how CSR is not only a fiction but starts having real effects by creating new institutions to respond to risks.

In particular, different regions are differently endowed with what has been labelled ‘territorial capital’, so that the endowment of public and private, material and <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets</b> significantly varies across regions, including infrastructure, private capital, human and social capital. This set of territorial conditions, enabling economic development to take place, is here assumed to impact the outcome of cohesion policies as well. This paper is hence aimed at assessing the role of specific territorial conditions on the efficient implementation of cohesion policies in CEE NUTS 3 regions. The analysis points out the mechanisms through which the endowment of specific territorial assets affects the outcome of Cohesion policies.

However, in contrast to other value-creating factors, human capi-tal {{is more difficult to}} measure, evaluate and manage. Due to human capital’s great importance for economic value creation, a series of studies on human capital evalua-tion have been published during the last few years. This paper discusses why so many traditional evaluation methods are only partly appropriate for categorizing, analyzing and evaluating human capital’s special characteristics. In particular, it is difficult for many traditional approaches to integrate notions of flexibility and options with regard to the human capital of companies. Our result shows that the real options theory provides a theoretical framework for the evaluation of human capital and allows a differentiated analysis that, on a qualitative basis, enables investments in uncertainties that are associated with human capital. This theory thus forms the foundation for the quantification of human capital’s inherent opportunities and risks. Consequently, this paper provides approaches for the future evaluation of human capital and a conceptual context for empirical studies.

The enterprises of “fourth capitalism " are the set of medium and medium-large enterprises who seem to be stronger on foreign markets, either through exports or through foreign direct investment. The paper uses the data set from Mediobanca Research Unit to provide a descriptive analysis of the performance of Italian multinational enterprises of the "fourth capitalism", showing the complex approach to the internationalization of these enteprises, where innovation plays a key role. Flexibility and specialization in the production are also important elements that drive the decision to invest and produce abroad for these enterprises. The commercial dimension also plays a key role for the firms of the "fourth capitalism", as it leads to the direct control of foreign markets. The study points out that one of the strategic objectives of Italian multinationals of the “fourth capitalism” is their strong customer focus and organizational effort to provide their services to the customers, which require substantial investment in <b>immaterial</b> <b>assets.</b> Finally, the work highlights some external constraints that penalize the Italian multinational enterprises of the “fourth capitalism”, as the high cost of bureaucracy, excessive and unfair taxation, lack of support to internationalization by public institutions. ...|$|E

After an accurate literature examination we suppose relational goods are social relations of second order. In the hypotesis {{they come from the}} emergence of two distinct social relations: interpersonal and reflexive relations. We describe empirical evidences of these emergent assets in social life and we test the effects they produce with a model. In the work we focus on four targets. First of all we describe the emergence of relational goods through a mathematical model. Then we individualize social realities where relational goods show evident effects and we outline our scientific hypotesis. The following step consists in the formulation of empirical tests. At last we explain final results. Our aim is to set apart the constitutive structure of relational goods into a checkable model coherently with the empirical evidences shown in the research. In the study we use multi-variate analysis techniques to see relational goods in a new way and we use qualitative and quantitative strategies. Relational goods are analysed both as dependent and independent variable in order to consider causative factors acting in a black-box model. Moreover we analyse effects of relational goods inside social spheres, especially in third sector and capitalistic economy. Finally we attain to effective indexes of relational goods in order to compare them with some performance indexes...|$|E
