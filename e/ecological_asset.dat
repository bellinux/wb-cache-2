40|$|AbstractThis paper applies Ecological Footprint {{accounting}} to Mediterranean {{countries to}} track <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> balances and investigate the long-term feasibility of fulfilling natural resource and service needs. Our findings {{are that the}} Mediterranean region currently uses approximately 2. 5 times more natural resources and ecological services than their ecosystems can provide. We argue that when consumption exceeds local availability, countries either resort to depletion of ecological assets or turn to international trade {{in order to satisfy}} their demands. Access to outside resources is however limited by (a) the availability of resources on international markets and (b) their affordability. Countries highly dependent on natural resource imports therefore expose their economies to the macroeconomic consequences of price volatility. We find that trade-related effects of natural resource price volatility are significant for Mediterranean economies as a 10 % increase in the price of natural resources corresponds with a change in the trade balance between + 7 % and − 2. 4 % of the GDP. We conclude that, in a world characterised by the existence of physical limits to the availability of global ecological assets, a systemic risk may exist for Mediterranean economies due to the concurrence of (1) <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> scarcity, (2) increasing prices and (3) challenging financial situations...|$|E

40|$|The {{invasive}} species have increasingly been acknowledged {{as a global}} threat, since they could fundamentally destroy indigenous ecosystem after its establishment [8]. Many governmental at-tempts {{have been made to}} eradicate the established {{invasive species}}. Unfortunately, however, only a few succeeded, and most of them failed especially when the habitat is sufficiently large [2]. That is, the management official ends up halting eradication attempts [6, 2]. When the invasive species are widespread in a large habitat, then catchability could be decreasing in the invasive species stock. This implies that the cost of removing the last 1 - 10 % population becomes prohibitively expensive, and thus achieving extermination appears to be extremely difficult [6, 2]. Given the historical fact, many researchers and practitioners sometimes recommend “area-wise control, ” which includes attempts for local extermination. Such regimes in invasive species management are that removal operations for invasive species are made only in some part of the whole habitat where some important industry or <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> is located such as agriculture. Whereas area-wise controls have recently emerged as a management scheme in invasive species management, a series of literature, which analyze the management strategy in this vein, mainly focus upon a situation where invasive species are reproduced and removals are implemented in...|$|E

A citywide survey assessed wall and tree characteristics to understand wall-tree relationships and identify conservation candidates. Nonparametric correlations were computed between 28 wall attributes versus tree count, tree biomass, and species-vegetation factors. Most of the 245 walls, with 1275 trees, were in residential areas. Moraceae dominated the 30 tree species, predominantly genus Ficus, and especially F. microcarpa. Natives formed the overwhelming majority, largely with pioneer and ruderal traits. The positive effect of adjacent built-up {{land use and}} negative effect of wall exposure indicated sheltering from wind could facilitate tree growth. Wall height was a key determinant as taller walls furnished more surfaces free from human disturbance and conducive to seed deposition by frugivorous birds and bats. Stone width offered more horizontal microsites for seeds to lodge. Stone roughness operated at the microscale to encourage nonarboreal vegetation. Joint attributes exerted strong influence on tree growth and less so on nontree affiliates.

Rebuilding relationships with nature and strengthening conservation education are key priorities of Japan’s biodiversity conservation agenda to improve outcomes for threatened species and local communities. This paper examines community engagement with the critically endangered Okinawa Rail (Hypotaenidia okinawae), an endemic bird of the Yanbaru forests of northern Okinawa, {{with reference to the}} conservation context in Japan. Since discovery of the Okinawa Rail in 1981, communities in Yanbaru have developed a strong relationship with this species, recognising it as an important symbol of regional cultural identity and as a unique <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> that attracts visitors and underpins community events. This has translated into investment by government and community stakeholders in conservation education facilities and public awareness campaigns for the Okinawa Rail in Yanbaru. To improve the long-term value of facilities to support science-based conservation efforts in this Japanese context, it could be advantageous to increase opportunities for social learning that incorporate both educational and conservation goals, and which encourage stakeholder partnerships. The complex socio-economic and political context in Okinawa, and the significant impact human activities have on the Okinawa Rail population, also highlight the importance of community cooperation in conservation activities and reinforce the value of interdisciplinary approaches that negotiate cross-cultural differences in biodiversity conservation...|$|E

This way this study aims to analyze the association between neighborhood <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> categorized into 4 dimensions: human, physical or institutional, social or collective activity, accessibility, and the individual functioning. A 3 % sample of residents aged 65 years and older in 2 downtown and 3 uptown parishes stratified by age and sex was interviewed at home using a protocol that included the Portuguese version of the Barthel Index in basic activities of daily living (BADL), the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale- 15 items (GDS) for evaluating functionality, cognitive performance and depression. The 162 participants were aged on average 75 y (sd= 7. 0), 54 % were women and 90 % had less than 7 years of education. The majority of participants were independent in BADL (M= 90; sd= 17. 7) and moderately dependent in IADL (M= 13, sd= 6. 0), 20 % showed cognitive impairment and a mean score of 8 (sd= 2. 1) in GDS- 15. After controlling for the effect of socio-demographic characteristics, functionality and cognitive performance decreases in persons with worst outdoor mobility.

Different dimensions of the family, school, and neighborhood settings had the most comprehensive impact on the different developmental outcomes, specifically collective activity in the family, accessibility in school, and human resources in the neighborhood. This research establishes a baseline for the empirical inquiry into the impact of observed resources present within families, school, and neighborhoods. Contemporary developmental science recognizes that human development is a bidirectional, individual ↔ context relational process (Lerner, 2006). Just as there are multiple levels of organization within the in-dividual (e. g., genes, motivation, and cognitive abili-ties) that influence one’s developmental course, so too are there different levels of organization within the so-cial ecology (e. g., families, schools, and neighbor-hoods) that contribute to development.

40|$|After {{water and}} light, {{nitrogen}} and phosphorus are the major elements limiting plant production worldwide. The use of fertilizers to offset these deficiencies is now actively disapproved because of their high price, their effect on climate change and their negative environmental impact. One solution could be to exploit plants that have acquired the ability to adapt to deficient environments. One example is given by plants that develop symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in order {{to benefit from the}} large reservoir of atmospheric nitrogen. Two groups of plants are known to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules: legumes that associate with rhizobia and plants belonging to eight angiosperm families, called actinorhizal plants, that associate with the actinomycete Frankia. These plants can thrive on nitrogen-poor soil and have long been used to increase soil fertility. Among them, Casuarina a tropical tree originating from Australia, presents a very important <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> for Southern countries due to its high ability to colonize deficient soils. Our team has focused on the cellular and molecular studies of the plant genes involved at different steps of the interaction between Frankia and Casuarina glauca. Several candidate genes from Casuarina have been characterized, including cg 12, a subtilase gene expressed during early infection events, CgMT 1 a metallothionein gene involved in stress responses and CgSymRK, a gene from the signalling pathway involved {{at the beginning of the}} symbiosis. More recently, a genomic approach has been initiated in order to sequence the ESTs from roots and nodules of Casuarina. Comparison between our data and legumes EST databases should reveal molecular mechanisms that are common and unique to the two endophytic root nodule symbioses and bring new information to further our understanding of the evolution of plant endosymbiosis across the plant kingdom...|$|E

Bayesian approaches {{have the potential}} to address the modelling needs of environmental management. However, to date many Bayesian networks (Bn) developed for environmental management have been parameterised using knowledge elicitation only. Not only are these models highly qualitative, but the time and effort involved in elicitation of a complex Bn can often be overwhelming. Unfortunately in environmental applications, data alone are often too limited for parameterising a Bn. Consequently, there is growing interest in how to parameterise Bns using both data and elicited information. At present, there is little formal guidance on how to combine what can be learned from the data with what can be elicited. In a previous publication we proposed a detailed methodology for this process, focussing on parameterising and evaluating a Bn.

40|$|A GIS-based {{assessment}} {{has been}} conducted to identify <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> in high salinisation hazard areas in the NAP region of the Tasmanian Midlands. Relative hazard to aquatic ecosystems, wetlands, water bodies and streams, {{as well as to}} vegetation communities from salinisation was evaluated. The hazard analysis was based on the presence of particular groundwater flow systems, and on rainfall and vegetation clearance. Hazard ratings were applied to these factors, and then to mapped polygons describing each asset type by GIS overlay. Rule sets were applied to attribute each asset polygon or streamline with an integrated hazard rating. High hazard ratings were combined with information on asset features (e. g. wetland size, the presence of threatened species etc) to develop a prioritised list of <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> in high salinisation hazard areas. 148 wetlands (15 % of the total) were rated as occurring in areas of highest hazard. 45 of these wetlands and two water bodies were rated as occurring in areas of highest hazard and being of high priority for management and/or monitoring. Around 7 - 8 % of all stream sections in the study area (ca 1 100 km) were rated as occurring in areas of high hazard at low and median flows. These were primarily small headwater catchments of several smaller river, creek and rivulet systems; and small floodplain or valley floor tributaries of the lower Coal and Jordan and middle South Esk Rivers. Field evaluation confirmed that high levels of stream salinity at baseflow were related to high hazard ratings. Relatively small areas of priority vegetation (848 ha) or numbers of threatened species (100 populations) were located in areas of highest hazard. Only four of the highest priority vegetation types (endangered/rare) were in the highest hazard category - lowland Poa and Themeda native grasslands, Eucalyptus ovata forest and woodland, and riparian vegetation. There are seven vulnerable communities occurring in areas of highest hazard, with only inland Eucalyptus amygdalina forest with more than 50 ha in high hazard areas. Critical <b>Ecological</b> <b>Assets</b> v Davies and Barker In comparison, relatively large areas of cleared agricultural land occur in areas of highest hazard (39 139 ha).

40|$|The {{majority}} of rivers in the Australian tropics possess near-natural flow regimes and are an <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> of global significance. We examined flow variability in large floodplain rivers in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, {{and the potential}} ecological impacts of future water resource development (WRD). Flow metrics based on long-term records were used to classify flow regimes and predict hydrological drivers of ecological function. Flow regimes of selected rivers were then compared with those simulated for pre- and post-WRD flows in the Darling River, a highly modified river in Australia's south-east. Generally, rivers were classified as typically 'tropical' (more permanent, regular flows) or 'dryland' (more ephemeral, with greater flow variability). In addition, all rivers displayed wet-dry seasonality associated with changes in flow magnitude or number of zero-flow days. We propose that these features (flow permanence and regularity; flow variability and absence; wet-dry seasonality) are the key hydrological drivers of biodiversity and ecological function in the floodplain rivers of Australia's north. In terms of WRD, inter-annual flow variability was predicted to increase or decrease depending on rivers' natural flow regimes, specifically their tendency toward lower or higher flow magnitudes. Either outcome {{is expected to have}} adverse effects on the biodiversity and ecological function of these relatively pristine rivers and floodplain habitats. In particular, reduced and homogenised habitat, loss of life-history cues, inhibited dispersal and shifts in community composition, as a result of WRD, threaten the ecological integrity of rivers adapted to the three hydrological drivers above. These findings serve as a caution for careful consideration of water resource development options for rivers in the Australian tropics and for those with similar flow regimes the world over.

40|$|Riparian environments have {{degraded}} world-wide as {{a consequence}} of human development and climatic change. The native floodplain tree communities of semi-arid river systems are under stress from reduced flooding frequencies {{as a consequence}} of water extractions, river regulation and climate change. In regions with saline aquifers, river regulation and land management have also caused soil salinisation, further impacting on floodplain tree health. The lower River Murray in south-eastern Australia is a major <b>ecological</b> <b>asset</b> considered as an area of international significance. The dominant floodplain vegetation is suffering severe decline in health, with approximately 80 % of floodplain trees reported as being in poor condition or dead. A reduction in water availability from reduced flooding and soil salinisation, has been identified as the primary cause. This has resulted from large irrigation extractions across the Murray-Darling Basin and elevated saline groundwater levels due to river regulation and land clearance. Management of these ecosystems needs to address both surface and groundwater changes. Increasing flooding regimes from environmental flow management and lowering of groundwater in regions of shallow saline aquifers are the most common scenarios adopted world-wide. Traditionally the assessment of management options for floodplain habitats has focussed on changes in river flow with no consideration given to surface water and groundwater interactions. In addition groundwater has been treated as a single homogenous unit. Wide floodplains have high spatial variability of habitats due to historic meandering anabranch creek systems that cause changing elevations and soil types. This in turn creates a highly variable pattern of surface and groundwater interactions. This thesis investigates the major causes of floodplain tree decline and develops methods for predicting the spatial impacts on floodplain tree health from a range of management scenarios. Surface and groundwater changes are often highly inter-connected but are usually considered separately at regional scales because of the complexity of management and modelling of surface and groundwater interactions over large areas. This thesis addresses the surface and groundwater changes at the regional scale of the lower River Murray. A floodplain inundation model for the River Murray (RiM-FIM) is developed to predict the extent of flooding at various magnitudes of flow and river regulation and a ‘drought index’ was used to indicate the risk to floodplain tree health of changing flow regimes. A floodplain impacts model (FIP) was applied spatially to predict groundwater discharge onto the floodplain and model vegetation risk. At the floodplain scale, surface and groundwater need to be integrated to assess detailed management scenarios. This thesis develops a method for assessing soil water availability from surface and groundwater interactions using a spatial and temporal model of salt accumulation and recharge (WINDS). This model is then used to predict floodplain tree health. The thesis contributes to the science of floodplain processes and develops a number of innovative modelling techniques for predicting the spatial variability of floodplain tree impacts, improving on traditional broad assessment methods. The tools are applicable to other saline semi-arid rivers and are useful for environmental flow and groundwater management decision making. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Executive summaryNorthern Australia {{boasts a}} range of {{significant}} aquatic ecosystems and ecosystem types, including estuaries, rivers, lakes and wetlands. These ecosystems not only provide clean water, food and recreation but have important intrinsic ecological and cultural values. These ecosystems also support high biodiversity, including many unique species of aquatic plants and animals. To increase knowledge about these aquatic ecosystems, the Australian Government commissioned the Northern Australia Aquatic <b>Ecological</b> <b>Assets</b> Project {{as part of the}} Northern Australia Water Futures Assessment (NAWFA). The objective of the NAWFA is to provide an enduring knowledge base to inform the protection and development of northern Australia’s water resources, so that any development proceeds in an ecologically, culturally and economically sustainable manner. This project, one of a number under the NAWFA, was tasked to identify key aquatic <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> (i. e. highly valued components of the environment) in northern Australia. The Northern Australia Aquatic <b>Ecological</b> <b>Assets</b> Project was undertaken by the Tropical Rivers and Coastal Knowledge (TRaCK) Commonwealth Environmental Research Facility in collaboration with the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPaC) and the National Water Commission (NWC). The project consisted of three phases: 1. Contributions to the Northern Australia Land and Water Science Review 2009 The project contributed to the Northern Australia Land and Water Science Review 2009 by determining theimpact of development alternatives on northern Australia aquatic ecosystems and aquatic biodiversity. Theoutcomes of this assessment are available in Pusey & Kennard (2009) and synthesised here (Chapter 2). 2. Broad‐scale assessment and prioritisation of aquatic <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> across northern AustraliaThis component of the project aimed to identify key aquatic <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> in northern Australia and trialthe draft Framework developed by the Aquatic Ecosystem Task Group (AETG) to identify High ConservationValue Aquatic Ecosystems (HCVAEs 1). This involved: 1. Identifying, mapping and evaluating aquatic ecosystem characteristics in northern Australia   based on the draft Australian National Aquatic Ecosystem (ANAE) classification scheme (Auricht,   2010) 2. developing a method to apply and assess the draft HCVAE Framework that is based on the best    available science and knowledge 3. defining key knowledge gaps and making recommendations for further work to refine the draft    HCVAE Framework 4. utilising a mixture of GIS analysis, systematic conservation planning methods, coupled with   expert system approaches to further rank and validate the <b>ecological</b> value of <b>assets,</b> and to   provide a comparison of these results against those derived from the HCVAE Framework. Chapter 3 synthesises the outcomes of the broad‐scale assessment and prioritisation of aquatic  <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> across northern Australia (reported in full in Kennard 2010). This includes an evaluation of  the HCVAE Framework and an application of alternative approaches to identifying high conservation value aquatic ecosystems. Geodatabases containing aquatic ecosystem mapping, classifications and  all HCVAE attributes, together with metadata and attribute tables are held by the Australian Government (DSEWPaC) and are synthesised in Appendices 8. 1 – 8. 2. 3. Fine‐scale assessment and prioritisation of regional aquatic ecosystem assetsIn collaboration with the State and Territory jurisdictions and DSEWPaC, the project team held a series of regional expert panel workshops. The purpose of these workshops was to identify Natural Heritage Values of wetlands in northern Australia and undertake fine scale assessments for key focal regions (or specific catchments) identified by jurisdictions as high priority or planned development areas. The fine scale assessment had a number of key aims including to identify high priority aquatic <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> and understand <b>ecological</b> thresholds in relation to flow regimes and maintenance of aquatic ecosystem assets. In undertaking the fine scale assessments, the following approach was applied:- For the Gulf of Carpentaria Drainage Division, work cooperatively with the Queensland  Government Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) to utilise  AquaBAMM and Queensland Wetland Mapping to identify and assess HCV <b>assets</b> and  <b>ecological</b> thresholds in focal Gulf catchments. - For the NT Arafura Sea portion of the Timor Sea Drainage Division, work cooperatively with NT  Government Department of Natural Resources, Environment, The Arts and Sport (NRETAS) to  identify and assess HCV assets in the Daly River catchment and possibly other high conservation  value areas (i. e. contributing to ongoing work with the “Sites of Conservation Significance”  project). - For the Kimberley portion of the Timor Sea Drainage Division, work cooperatively National  Heritage Assessment section of DSEWPaC (e. g. using the Australian Natural Heritage  Assessment Tool – ANHAT) as well as the Western Australian Government Department of  Environment and Conservation (e. g. through the Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy). A summary of the outcomes of these fine scale assessments and workshops is presented in Chapter 4 and full reports are presented in Appendices 8. 3 – 8. 6 and Rollason & Howell (2010). In Chapter 5 we canvas some key challenges for sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems in northern Australia. In particular, we evaluate the concept of ecological thresholds and how useful it is for informing environmental management to sustain ecosystem values. Managers of high conservation value areas must achieve a balance between taking conservation action, evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken, and monitoring the general status of biodiversity conservation targets and the threats they face. We review approaches to estimating socioeconomic costs of different management actions and how these can be prioritised in a systematic and hierarchical framework (the concept of multiple management zones). Monitoring is a key component of adaptive management and can inform the decisions of managemen agencies. Unfortunately however, monitoring practices have generally been poorly connected with decision‐making and this has led to an inability to assess the effectiveness or efficiency of the conservation management actions. We therefore present several frameworks to guide if, why, when and how monitoring should be implemented and how the outcomes of the monitoring will feed into adaptive management of aquatic <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> in northern Australia. Finally, in Chapter 6 we identify and synthesise key knowledge gaps and next steps. 1 At their meeting in October 2010, the AETG agreed to change the name of the “High Conservation Value AquaticEcosystem” Framework to the “High Ecological Value Aquatic Ecosystem” (HEVAE) Framework...|$|R

40|$|As {{the largest}} {{freshwater}} lake in northern China, Lake Baiyangdian provides {{a diversity of}} ecosystem services: it guarantees water flow {{to a number of}} beneficiaries and is an important component of sustainable regional development. However, the flows of sustainable ecosystem services from Lake Baiyangdian mainly depend on upstream hydrological and nutrient retention functions. For sustainable land management, it is important to explore the implications of upstream land-use changes by humans on the ecosystem services supplied by Lake Baiyangdian. In this study, <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> and hydrological time series were analysed, and the InVEST model was used to investigate the implications of land management on the delivery of ecosystem services. The results showed that significant changes in <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> occurred in the Baiyangdian river basin during the period 1980 - 2007, characterised particularly by an increase in forested area and a decline in wetland area. A significant decline in the ecological status of the Baiyangdian river basin, expressed as an abrupt change in stream flow time series 1970 - 2011, was also noted. Water yield and surface run-off functions were mainly influenced by precipitation, but changes in land-cover patterns exacerbate the impacts of these two factors. Nutrient retention was influenced more by altered land cover than by precipitation. Due to data gaps, {{it was not possible to}} link upstream ecosystem functions to the ecosystem services contributed by Lake Baiyangdian. It will be necessary to establish a long-term ecological monitoring programme in order to gather the data needed to gain a deeper understanding of the interconnections between ecosystem function and services. The ultimate aim of such a programme must be to incorporate ecosystem services into ecosystem management and policy-making...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of financial reporting {{is to provide a}} mechanism hy which management can report matters concerning custodianship of resources entrusted to them hy the stakeholders. One of these categories of stakeholders is the general public, which currently requires more information about the way the entity has discharged itself of its responsibility towards the ecology. However, the traditional financial accounting model is unable to account fo r ecologial <b>assets</b> and <b>ecological</b> capital. Several rather pragmatic suggestions have been made by researchers as to how to account fo r these aspects. One of these suggestions is quoted in this article, followed by a possible alternative by which <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>ecological</b> capital are introduced into the primary financial statements...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the expanding literature on ecosystem service assessment by considering its integration with economic analyses of such services. Focussing upon analyses for future orientated policy and decision making, we initially consider a single period during which ecological stocks are maintained at sustainable levels. The flow of ecosystems services and their contribution to welfare bearing goods is considered and methods for valuing resultant benefits are reviewed and illustrated via a case study of land use change. We then broaden our time horizon to discuss the treatment of future costs and benefits. Finally we relax our sustainability assumption and consider economic approaches to the incorporation of depleting <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> with a particular focus upon stocks which exhibit thresholds below which restoration is compromised...|$|R
40|$|Since {{long the}} {{economic}} debate {{is characterized by}} an ever growing amount of contributions dealing with questions of environmental protection, resource management or, recently, {{with the concept of}} Sustainable Development. Despite this nature - understood here as the total of all natural or <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> - has till now been neglected more or less as an autonomous factor in the textbooks of economics. This article attempts to show that in early epochs economic thinking has developed important insights how to treat nature as an essential part of economic theory. It is this specific knowledge derived from the history of economic thought that can and should be used today to (re-) integrate nature as a fundamental element into the modern theories of economic science. ...|$|R
50|$|With {{valuable}} <b>ecological</b> <b>assets,</b> Clove Lakes Park has a rich {{natural history}} and a few remnants of the past. Chief among them are the park's lakes and ponds, outcroppings of serpentine rocks, and Staten Island's largest living thing, a 119 ft tulip tree. Clove Lakes Park is home to many species of indigenous wildlife. Visitors can see fish such as black crappie, brown bullhead, bluegill, emerald shiner, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, and carp; birds such as red-tailed hawk, belted kingfisher, double-crested cormorant, red-winged blackbird, Canada goose, and mallard: as well as reptiles and amphibians, like the common snapping turtle, eastern painted turtle, red-eared slider, and occasionally even the red-backed salamander. The park {{is also home to}} mammals such as eastern gray squirrel, muskrat, eastern cottontail, and eastern chipmunk.|$|R
40|$|Peri-urban {{development}} {{pressure on}} and near Australian coastlines is {{resulting in the}} conversion of agricultural land for rural-residential use. The impact of larger and more diverse human populations upon the <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> remaining in agricultural landscapes has consequently become a policy concern. This paper contributes to these policy debates by integrating the results of parallel social and ecological research projects commissioned to improve natural resource management in peri-urbanising regions. The research was undertaken in the case study region of South East Queensland, the region supporting Australia’s most rapid population growth. Our results indicate that both social and ecological communities cross a fragmentation threshold due to peri-urban development whereby they become ecologically simple and socially heterogeneous in a coupling that cedes a poor diagnosis for biodiversity retention. stored soil water, dryland grain cropping, extension, social systems, RD&E, differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Sustainable {{development}} {{based on an}} integrated view of environmental policies and development strategies intends to minimize the risks and hazards to the environment. The {{time has come for}} efforts to be made on the environmental front towards sustainable development without endangering the <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> of the future generation. In this paper we analyze the effects of health hazards in sustainable development of agriculture using Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM). We arrive at the conclusions by this study how sustainable development is being affected by the pollutions. This paper has four sections. In section one we recall the notion of Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM) and its properties. In section two we describe the problem. In Section three we adopt FAM to this problem and analyze the problem. Section four gives the conclusions based on our study...|$|R

I propose an Asset Based Design approach, integrated with Ecological Design and practiced through Design Activism. A Transformational Landscape Design [TLD] framework has been developed to activate social and <b>ecological</b> <b>assets.</b> The main driver is Design Activism. The completion of a comprehensive literature review, its analysis, and a final synthesis with knowledge gained through the study of three specific precedent projects, allows the [TLD] framework to be applied, and hypothetically test a real marginalized community.

40|$|International audienceSubjective {{well-being}} {{is determined}} by several types of sources of satisfaction, defined as forms of capitals. Most of research {{has been focused on}} the links between economic capital and well-being, neglecting the contribution of other forms of capital as source of satisfaction. Here, we bring natural capital into the equation and explore the relations between economic and natural capital and subjective well-being. We approach well-being as a multidimensional concept and then focus on three of its dimensions: subsistence, security, and reproduction and care. Working with tribal communities from Kodagu (Karnataka, India), we found positive associations between economic and natural capital and subjective well-being. Nevertheless, the two types of capitals differed on their relative contribution to (a) overall subjective well-being and (b) the three selected dimensions. Natural capital can be more important than economic capital in fulfilling human well-being. Findings support ongoing calls for explicitly incorporating <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> and ecosystem services in the design of policies oriented to measure and improve well being...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{hydrothermal}} vent research has progressed immensely, resulting in higher-quality samples and long-term studies. With time, scientists are becoming {{more aware of the}} impacts of sampling on the faunal communities and are looking for less invasive ways to investigate the vent ecosystems. In this perspective, imagery analysis plays a very important role. With this study, we test which factors can be quantitatively and accurately assessed based on imagery, through comparison with faunal sampling. Twelve instrumented chains were deployed on the Atlantic Eiffel Tower hydrothermal edifice and the corresponding study sites were subsequently sampled. Discrete, quantitative samples were compared to the imagery recorded during the experiment. An observer-effect was tested, by comparing imagery data gathered by different scientists. Most factors based on image analyses concerning Bathymodiolus azoricus mussels were shown to be valid representations of the corresponding samples. Additional <b>ecological</b> <b>assets,</b> based exclusively on imagery, were included. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} {{of individual and}} <b>ecological</b> <b>assets</b> for positive development was assessed through data derived from individual interviews with 45 African American adolescent male members of inner-city Detroit gangs and 50 African American adolescent males liv-ing in the same communities but involved in community-based organizations (CBOs) aimed at promoting positive youth development. The CBO youth had higher levels of both domains of assets. However, all gang members possessed at least one asset, and 15. 6 % of the gang youth had a total mean asset score that was above the total mean asset score of the CBO youth. In turn, the asset scores for the former group {{were significantly more likely}} to be correlated than was the case for the later group. The implications of these findings are discussed in regard to the idea that all youth possess the potential for positive development and to the nature of policies and programs pertinent to enhancing the life chances of diverse youth...|$|R
30|$|The {{level of}} {{sustainability}} of resource use {{is another important}} finding of this study. The result indicates that the existing practice of detached residential building construction is not sustainable as compared to local ecological supply capacity. The deficit {{is found to be}} 1.277  gha/capita. Unmaintainable pattern of resource use with local ecological supply explains that the City is importing biocapacity through trade or liquidating regional <b>ecological</b> <b>assets,</b> or emitting wastes into the atmosphere. The observed level could be due to the absence of appropriate guideline to support sustainable resource use. In Adama City, the standards set in urban plan are deliberated on ensuring minimum criteria such as building area ratio and height regulation whereas the criteria to guide the resource consumption is lacking. Consequently, the developers are free to adopt any design as far as it meets minimum standard. In this case, the construction depends on the interest and economic potential of developers regardless of the type and the amount of resources to be used which can lead to over-utilization of natural capital.|$|R
