2500|$|A team must skate {{a minimum}} of three attackers on the ice at all times. If an {{accumulation}} of penalties would otherwise force a team to fall below this minimum, the situation becomes known as [...] "stacked penalties". This means that the new penalty will start when one of the already-penalized players causing the disadvantage is allowed back onto the ice, whether the time expires or the opposing team scores on the Power Play. This also means that the player whose penalty <b>expires</b> <b>first</b> <b>out</b> of the three must wait for a stoppage in play, or the expiration of the second penalty, before leaving the penalty box so that it is appropriately 5 on 3, 5 on 4, and 5 on 5 in succession for each respective situation. Penalties that allow for immediate substitution (certain coincidental penalties and misconduct penalties) do not produce a disadvantage and thus do not count for stacked penalties. Stacked penalties still apply in shorthanded overtimes because two penalties still result in a five-on-three situation regardless of the initial lineup due to the rules allowing an extra attacker as needed.|$|R

TDD: {{in the case}} that channel reciprocity between the uplink and downlink holds, each of the relays is able to know its own CSI. With this information, a possible selection strategy is that proposed in [20]. Those relays belonging to the decoding subset start a timer. The timer of each relay adopts as initial value a parameter inversely proportional to its instantaneous SNR. Then, the timer that <b>first</b> <b>expires</b> is that belonging to the best relay. In order to avoid collision, this relay signals its presence {{to the rest of}} relays via a flag packet before the relaying procedure is started (further details about strategies to avoid collision can be found in [20]). Clearly, channel reciprocity holds in TDD when the time coherence of the channel is higher than the time difference between uplink and downlink time slots. In the opposite case, the methodology adopted for the FDD case should be considered as well. With this information, a possible selection strategy is that proposed in [20]. Those relays belonging to the decoding subset start a timer. The timer of each relay adopts as initial value a parameter inversely proportional to its instantaneous SNR.

30|$|When {{the timer}} has expired, the relay node is {{expected}} to broadcast a channel reservation message to neighboring relays to prevent other relays from transmission. The relay whose timer <b>expired</b> <b>first</b> broadcasts a channel reservation message to the neighbors. Contrast to [12], in our model, {{we do not need}} to consider the channel between the source and the relay node since only the relay performs retransmission. This will reduce processing delay in relay node selection. Based on this idea, we propose a new distributed relay node selection algorithm combined with OPNC for the topology of multiple relays and multiple sink nodes. If we use channel state as the only variable to choose a relay node as in the opportunistic relaying algorithm, the system performance may be poor.|$|R

30|$|In [20], the SB {{protocol}} is devised which assigns a distance-based contention {{window to}} each road segment. A source node first sends a RTB message containing {{information about the}} contention window, segment size, and the message direction. The relay vehicle is selected as the one whose contention window <b>expires</b> <b>first</b> and it sends a CTB message that informs other vehicles to cancel their rebroadcast. On hearing the CTB message, the source node then sends the warning message to be forwarded by the selected relay node. A possible weakness of this protocol is the packet collisions caused by the selection of same backoff value for multi-hop transmission. Another proposal in [10] uses a binary partition mechanism to iteratively divide the transmission range into small segments and select the furthest relay vehicle. However, the iterative partition mechanism results in an increase of the warning notification time. For other interesting work related to routing and broadcast communication, readers are referred to [24 – 34].|$|R
30|$|Like counter-based protocols, distance-based {{broadcast}} protocols[11] use {{the notion}} of expected additional coverage to determine {{the value of a}} node’s retransmission. Instead of counting neighbour retransmissions, they look at the signal strength of these retransmissions to estimate additional coverage. They assume that signal strength (captured from the Received Signal Strength Indicator - RSSI) is an indication of a transmitter’s distance to the receiving node. The greater the distance (i.e. the lower the first message’s RSSI), the more additional nodes the receiving node can cover with its retransmission. To exploit this notion, distance-based protocols wait for a random but bounded time after the first message reception listening to further retransmissions. If the maximum signal strength of all received retransmissions falls below a certain threshold, the node is allowed to retransmit. Both counter-based and distance-based broadcast protocols use random listening periods which can be counter-productive: nodes of higher topological importance may be preempted from retransmitting if the listening timer of less ‘important’ nodes in their vicinity <b>expires</b> <b>first.</b>|$|R

When the cache is full and space is required for a more recent context item, the OF policy removes the oldest item from the cache.

The SE policy removes the context item from the cache store whose expiry time will be up the soonest. In the case of LU policy, the context item which has been accessed the least number of times. For this policy to be applicable, the caching function in our system has to record each context item’s access frequency.

40|$|Abstract—The timer-based {{selection}} scheme is a popular, simple, and distributed scheme {{that is used}} to select the best node from a set of available nodes.

We derive the optimal timer mapping that maximizes the average success probability for the practical scenario in which the number of nodes in the system is unknown but only its probability distribution is known. We show that it has a special discrete structure, and present a recursive characterization to determine it.

To minimize memory usage, message replicas are deleted when the corresponding time-to-live (TTL) fields <b>expires.</b> <b>First,</b> we consider a sparse network. We propose a Time-Based (TB) and a Hop-Based (HB) TTL schemes for message replication and deletion. Analysis and simulation results based on a Poisson node encounter model show that HB schemes are superior to TB schemes. We also consider feedback schemes to notify mobile nodes to delete message replicas upon successful message delivery. With feedback, we obtain a further 100 -fold and 5 -fold cost reduction for TB and HB schemes, respectively. We then consider a dense network. We propose a modified HB- 2 scheme and compare it with the vanilla HB- 1 scheme. Simulation results based on a simple mobility model show that the HB- 2 scheme is superior. For both sparse and dense networks, a HB(b, 2) scheme is near optimal, where 2 and b denote depth and breadth of the data dissemination tree. b is chosen such that a designated probability of message delivery is attained.
