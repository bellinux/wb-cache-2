5|$|The Battle of Torvioll, {{also known}} as the Battle of Lower Dibra, was fought on 29 June 1444 on the Plain of Torvioll, in what is modern-day Albania. Skanderbeg was an Ottoman Albanian captain who <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his native land and take the reins of a new Albanian rebellion. He, along with 300 other Albanians {{fighting}} at the Battle of Niš, deserted the Ottoman army to head towards Krujë, which fell quickly through a subversion. He then formed the League of Lezhë, a confederation of Albanian princes united in war against the Ottoman Empire. Murad II, realizing the threat, sent one of his most experienced captains, Ali Pasha, to crush the rebellion with a force of 25,000 men.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1871 life in Paris had {{returned}} to normal, and Offenbach ended his voluntary exile. His new works Le roi Carotte (1872) and La jolie parfumeuse (1873) were modestly profitable, but lavish revivals of his earlier successes did better business. He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> into theatre management and took over the Théâtre de la Gaîté in July 1873. His spectacular revival of Orphée aux enfers there was highly profitable; an attempt to repeat that success with a new, lavish version of Geneviève de Brabant proved less popular. Along with the costs of extravagant productions, collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou culminated in financial disaster. An expensive production of Sardou's La haine in 1874, with incidental music by Offenbach, failed to attract the public to the Gaîté, and Offenbach was forced to sell his interests in the Gaîté and to mortgage future royalties.|$|E

5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes of Galaxy FM, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy FM encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.|$|E
5|$|With López gone, {{control of}} the CNOC was now fought over by anarchists and Communists. By 1930-1, CNOC had {{been taken over by}} the Communists, with anarchists being turned over to the police, still under the control of Machado. Many of the Spanish anarchists {{involved}} <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Spain. Following the new government's passage of a law dictating that at least half of an employer's employees be Cuban-born, a large number of Cuba's Spanish-born anarchists were forced by economic necessity to return to Spain, which greatly diminished the clout of the anarchist movement in Cuba. However, soon the Juventud Libertaria (Libertarian Youth) was founded by a younger generation of anarchists, and by 1936, after the start of the Spanish Civil War, Cuban anarchists had founded the Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA), to help send money and arms to the CNT and FAI. Many Cuban-born anarchists went to Spain to join the fight, alongside many Spanish-born anarchists exiled from Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for her son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the deep of the lagoon.
