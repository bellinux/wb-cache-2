5|$|The {{composition}} of Julian's army at Strasbourg {{can only be}} partially reconstructed. Ammianus gives the names of only five regiments in <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the battle itself. But at other points of Ammianus' narrative of Julian's campaigns in Gaul, and also in Zosimus' history, there are mentions of other regiments in his comitatus, which were very likely at Strasbourg also.|$|E
5|$|The late 5th-century Byzantine chronicler Zosimus's Nova Historia {{deals with}} the battle, and Julian's Gallic {{campaign}} in a summary fashion and adds little to Ammianus' account. But Zosimus is useful because <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the revolt of Magnentius (350-3) survives, unlike Ammianus', which was contained in the 13 lost books of his history.|$|E

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|Bligh {{had landed}} in England on 14 March 1790 to public acclaim, and was quickly {{promoted}} to post-captain. In the following months he wrote <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the mutiny, and on 22 October was honourably acquitted at court martial {{of responsibility for}} the Bounty's loss. Early in 1791 he was appointed to command a new breadfruit expedition, which left London on 3 August of that year, before any news of the capture of Heywood and the others had reached London. Bligh would be gone for more than two years, and would thus be absent from the court martial proceedings that awaited the returned mutineers.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of}} the interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|On Bates's {{return to}} England, he was {{encouraged}} by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|One last Scottish attempt {{against the}} king's person {{occurred}} in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the Earl of Gowrie's younger brother, at Gowrie House, {{the seat of}} the Ruthvens.

Given James's history with the Ruthvens {{and the fact that he}} owed them a great deal of money, <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the circumstances was not universally believed.|$|E

5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This {{contains some}} {{details about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there is a contradiction.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight.

5|$|For {{a number}} of items {{relating}} to works of art near the coast of Asia Minor and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian Gaius Licinius Mucianus, who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), but much of his information about the position of such works in Rome is from books, not personal observation. The main merit of <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, {{is that it is}} a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of Xenocrates and on the biographies of Duris and Antigonus.|$|E

5|$|In Vijayanagara, Madhura was {{the court}} poet of King HariharaII and King Deva RayaI under the {{patronage}} {{of their respective}} prime ministers. He is famous for <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the 15th tirthankar titled Dharmanatha Purana (1385), written in a style {{similar to that of}} Jain poets of earlier centuries. Madhura is also credited with a poem about Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola. Ayata Varma, who is tentatively dated to 1400, translated from Sanskrit a champu (mixed prose-verse) titled Ratna Karandaka describing Jain ideologies. Manjarasa, a feudatory king of Kallahalli and a Vijayanagara general of rank, wrote two books. Nemijinesa Sangata, completed in 1508, was an account {{of the life of the}} 22nd Jain tirthankar; Samyukta Koumudi, written in 1509, comprised 18 short stories on religious values and morals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the myth of Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Intact and {{relatively}} detailed histories of Greece, such as Herodotus's The Histories, Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, and Xenophon's Hellenica cover {{the period from}} roughly 500–362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant period of Greek history (359–336 BC), although it is included within various universal histories. The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source. Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the period of Philip's reign, but the action is much compressed, and due to {{the scope of the}} work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same period elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; <b>his</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> the period therefore contains many gaps.|$|E

He is considered by many to have been the first Briton to do a Grand Tour of Europe; a practice which became a mainstay of the education of upper class Englishmen in the 18th century.|$|R
