25|$|The {{trend in}} some European {{countries}} (for instance Germany, Finland and the Netherlands) {{is to allow}} both genders to bathe together naked. Many German spas allow mixed nude bathing.

Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer FKK (clothing-optional) areas. In general, continental <b>Europeans</b> <b>have</b> a more relaxed attitude about nudity than {{is seen in the}} British-influenced world.

25|$|The New England states, {{being among}} the first to be settled by <b>Europeans,</b> <b>have</b> one of the oldest traditions of old-time music.

Primary instruments include the fiddle, piano, and guitar, with the wooden flute sometimes also used. As with Appalachian folk, a number of classical composers have turned to New England folk music for melodic and harmonic ideas, most famously Charles Ives, as well as Aaron Copland, William Schuman, and John Cage, among others. Rhythmically, this style is more diverse than most southern old time, featuring schottisches, hornpipes, and waltzes in addition to reels.|$|E
500|$|Population {{movements}} of Ottawa speakers since {{the arrival of}} <b>Europeans</b> <b>have</b> been complex, with extensive migrations and contact with other Ojibwe groups. Many Ottawa speakers in southern Ontario are descended from speakers of the Southwestern Ojibwe dialect (also known as [...] "Chippewa") who moved into Ottawa-speaking areas during the mid-19th century. Ottawa today is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Chippewa" [...] or [...] "Ojibwe" [...] by speakers in these areas. As part of a series of population displacements during the same period, an estimated two thousand American Potawatomi speakers from Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana moved into Ottawa communities in southwestern Ontario. The non-Ottawa-speaking Ojibwes who moved to these areas shifted to speaking Ottawa, as did the Potawatomi migrants. As a result of the migrations, Ottawa came to include Potawatomi and Ojibwe loanwords.|$|E
