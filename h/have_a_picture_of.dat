25|$|The 1978 album Hot Streets was {{produced}} by Phil Ramone. It was Chicago's first album with a title rather than a number; and was the band's first LP to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) featured prominently on the cover (with the ubiquitous logo downsized). These two moves were {{seen by many as}} indications that the band had changed following Kath's death. To a degree, the band returned to the old naming scheme on its subsequent releases, although most titles would now bear Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. Hot Streets, the band's 12th album, peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts; it was Chicago's first release since their debut to fail to make the Top 10. The release also marked a move somewhat away from the jazz-rock direction favored by Kath and towards more pop songs and ballads. Dacus stayed with the band through the 1979 album Chicago 13, and is also featured in a promotional video on the DVD included in the Rhino Records Chicago box set from 2003. Again produced by Ramone, it was the group's first studio album not to contain a Top 40 hit. Dacus departed from the band shortly after the album's release.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} of Illmatic {{features}} {{a picture of}} Nas as a child, which was taken after his father, musician Olu Dara, returned home from an overseas tour. The original cover was intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Nas holding Jesus Christ in a headlock, reflecting the religious imagery of Nas's rap on [...] "Live at the Barbeque"; [...] "When I was 12, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus".|$|E
500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's [...] "side" [...] in the battle between dunces and men of wit.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} in the United States proved to be less favourable. In a review published in Virginia in January 1983, Edward Jones of The Free-Lance Star offered praise for the [...] "novel touch" [...] of casting a would-be-mother as the principal villain, commenting, [...] "In {{what has to be}} a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach. What a time to have twins!" [...] Nevertheless, Inseminoid is discarded as [...] "no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again." [...] In a November 1983 edition of the Floridian newspaper Boca Raton News, Skip Sheffield branded the film [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "cheapo", suggesting that his readers [...] "Imagine Alien without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, and you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Horror Planet." [...] He added his opinion that brutal violence does not guarantee narrative suspense, punning on the name Run Run Shaw in his downbeat conclusion that [...] "Horror Planet is a film to run, run away from—fast." ...|$|E

2500|$|The trial resumed on Monday, October 16 {{with the}} playing of the {{recorded}} {{negotiations between the}} FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and Saldívar. The tape began with Saldívar stating how badly she wanted to die. During the conversation, the jury heard Larry Young try to persuade her to lower her gun; Saldívar said {{that she could not}} do so. Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Saldívar then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued to whine [...] "I just wanna die" [...] as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Saldívar that if she would give herself up, he would place a jacket over her so that the media would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Saldívar that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: [...] "They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!" [...] Anchor newswoman, María Celeste Arrarás, wrote in her 1997 investigative book, that she found it [...] "curious" [...] for a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die: [...] "would be afraid that someone might make her wish come true." [...] The New York Times also commented that: [...] "she alternately begged to be killed and expressed fear that she would be killed if she left the truck." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E
