25|$|The 1923 general {{election}} was fought on the Conservatives' protectionist proposals but, although they <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> votes and remained the largest party, {{they lost their}} majority in parliament, necessitating {{the formation of a}} government supporting free trade. Thus, with the acquiescence of Asquith's Liberals, Ramsay MacDonald became the first ever Labour Prime Minister in January 1924, forming the first Labour government, despite Labour only having 191 MPs (less {{than a third of the}} House of Commons).|$|E

25|$|Durham saw off Somerset's Fast bowler Andrew Caddick {{to win a}} match {{where all}} four innings were worth between 240 and 300 runs. Somerset chose to bat after winning the toss at Stockton-on-Tees, and England fast bowler Steve Harmison {{continued}} his return to form after 12 wickets in the previous two games, removing both Somerset openers, but conceded 72 runs from 18 overs in the process. It was England ODI all-rounder Paul Collingwood who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wickets, dismissing the Somerset top-scorers James Hildreth (caught by Gareth Breese for 70) and Ian Blackwell (bowled for 48) {{in addition to the}} three last lower-order wickets.

25|$|Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine {{and veteran}} wicket-keeper Nic Pothas {{made the most}} {{important}} contributions as Hampshire overpowered Glamorgan at Cardiff. Only Michael Powell showed some sort of resistance, scoring 56 in Glamorgan's 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his ten overs - admittedly mostly tail-enders, but he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wickets. Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball. England prospect Kevin Pietersen continued his fine form with 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare.|$|E

25|$|India won the toss and captain Rahul Dravid {{elected to}} field first, after five overs {{were cut off}} each side's innings due to heavy {{overnight}} rain. West Indies hit 251 runs for 6 wickets, with Chris Gayle contributing nearly half the total, 123, before he was out with five overs remaining to Ajit Agarkar, who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wickets for India, claiming two for 38. However, India also had an opener contributing a century, with Rahul Dravid bringing up his hundred in 99 balls, eventually ending with 105 off 102. Dravid paired up with Mohammad Kaif to add 123 for the fourth wicket, before Dwayne Bravo had Dravid caught, leaving India with 43 {{to get from the}} last 37 balls; with two fours and a six from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Kaif hitting 16 off his last 16 deliveries, India made it to the target with a ball to spare.|$|E
25|$|Andy Flower {{took the}} Gloucestershire Gladiators' bowlers for 127 runs in 93 balls at The County Ground in Chelmsford {{as he and}} Ronnie Irani paired up for 139 to send Essex Eagles to a final score of 271 for 7. Upul Chandana <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{expensive}} figures, with 64 runs off nine overs, but James Averis also conceded six an over – and unlike Chandana, {{he did not take}} a wicket. In reply, Alex Tudor snared out a couple of wickets in the first 20 minutes, and Gloucestershire lost nine men for 182 after three wickets from Pakistani spinner Danish Kaneria. Even a hit-out from Chandana – who scored 32 off 30 balls, his highest score in six innings in 2005 – was not enough to take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine and wicket-keeper Nic Pothas {{made the}} most impact with ball and bat {{respectively}} for Hampshire as they defeated Glamorgan at Cardiff.

Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball - Hampshire were 89 for 4 before England prospect Kevin Pietersen came in to hit 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas.

25|$|In 1922, Overturf {{decided to}} run for re-election. By that time, District 21 had grown enough that a third {{representative}} was added to the district. In the Republican primary, Overturf was one of the three Republicans to advance to the general election along with Denton Burdick and J. M. Ezell. The Democratic Party nominated two candidates. All five candidates appeared on the general election ballot. However, a month before the election the state’s World War Veterans’ State Aid Commission fired Overturf from his position as a veteran loan appraiser. The commission alleged that Overturf had inflated the value of some appraisals. This became a state-wide scandal that undermined Overturf’s credibility and threatened to derail his re-election campaign. In the general election, the other two Republicans (Burdick and Ezell) <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> votes, easily winning two of the three District 21 seats. Overturf was also re-elected to the House, but for him it was a very close race. The final vote count, gave Overturf a margin of only 27 votes over Democrat, R. E. Bradbury, 3,675 to 3,648.|$|E
25|$|In a low-scoring thriller at The County Ground, Derby, Dominic Cork had the {{pleasure}} of beating his old county, though it became a tougher task than expected, considering that Derbyshire had not won a Championship match since 2004. Winning the toss and batting, Derbyshire had a good opening partnership between Australian Michael Di Venuto and Ben France, but Greg Chapple put the pressure on with some patient, economical bowling and reaped the rewards with three wickets for 29. However, it was Cork who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wickets, after taking the last three of the innings to finish with four for 40 and send Derbyshire off for 191. Lancashire lost two quick wickets in reply, and were in trouble when Warren Hegg departed at 128 for 6, but a fine innings worth 64 from Cork down the order - along with 24 from Muttiah Muralitharan - sent Lancashire into a 50-run lead. Muralitharan was, indeed, in contention for Man of the Match, bowling 27 overs in succession and taking six for 50 as Derbyshire collapsed to 185, setting a target of 136 to win. Lancashire thought that would be a walk in the park, especially as Iain Sutcliffe and Mal Loye paired up for 53 for the second wicket, but they then lost seven men for sub-12 scores and were in trouble at 131 for 9. Only Sutcliffe kept his head calm, carrying his bat to 62 not out, and he and Muralitharan managed to add the required five runs.|$|E
25|$|Kamran Akmal {{made his}} second century {{in three days}} to help Pakistan take a 2–1 lead in the series with two games to play, and their highest ODI victory by runs since their group match with Hong Kong at the 2004 Asia Cup. It was also their highest ODI win against a Full Member nation of the ICC since a 182-run win over South Africa in December 2002. England equalled their {{heaviest}} defeat ever with this loss. Pakistan were put in to bat after Marcus Trescothick won the toss, but England's bowlers did not back up the faith Trescothick had in them, not taking a wicket in the first 15 overs, before Liam Plunkett took two wickets in three balls, dismissing Younis Khan for the lowest score of the match, with 0. However, Plunkett was taken for 61 in his seven overs, and though he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wickets he was the least economical. Neither he nor Steve Harmison could stop the Pakistani pair of Akmal and Mohammad Yousuf, as the two added 104 in 16.2 overs before Kamran was caught off Paul Collingwood for 109. Mohammad Yousuf, who batted well for 68 off 65, was then responsible for two run-outs – his own, {{and that of the}} big-hitting Shahid Afridi, who creamed 31 off 14 balls. However, this was surpassed by Abdul Razzaq, who battered five fours and three sixes in a blazing 51 off 22 balls. At one stage, Razzaq looked poised to get the fastest ODI fifty, but some good death-over bowling from Andrew Flintoff, who was the best of the English bowlers, ensured that this at least would not happen. The Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq provided Razzaq with good support as he made 45 off 35.|$|E
