5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous <b>forward</b> <b>flow</b> of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and immunoglobulin secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective <b>forward</b> <b>flow</b> in AI.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} (MHV) are {{prosthetics}} designed {{to replicate the}} function of the natural valves of the human heart. [...] The human heart contains four valves: tricuspid valve, pulmonic valve, mitral valve and aortic valve.

[...] As a result of a number of disease processes, both acquired and congenital, any one of the four heart valves may malfunction and result in either stenosis (impeded <b>forward</b> <b>flow)</b> and/or backward flow (regurgitation).

2500|$|In general, blood damage affects valves in {{both the}} mitral and aortic positions. [...] High {{stresses}} during leakage flow in aortal valves result from higher transvalvular pressures, and high stresses occur during <b>forward</b> <b>flow</b> for mitral valves. [...] Valvular thrombosis is most common in mitral prosthetics. [...] The caged-ball model {{is better than the}} other two models in terms of controlling this problem, because it is at a lower risk for thrombosis and it is gradual when it does happen. [...] The bileaflet is more adaptable to this problem than the tilting-disc model because if one leaflet stops working, the other can still function.

Furthermore, a bottleneck transmission scheduling scheme is introduced to provide fairness between local and <b>forwarding</b> <b>flows.</b> The proposed mechanism is modeled and evaluated using the well-known 20 -sim dynamic system simulator. Experimental results show that a fairer and more efficient bandwidth utilization can be achieved than without the feedback mechanism.
