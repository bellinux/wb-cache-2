500|$|Zinc is the <b>fourth</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> {{metal in}} use, {{trailing}} only iron, aluminium, and copper {{with an annual}} production of about 10 million tonnes. Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy. Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide: For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at [...] into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid: After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.|$|E
50|$|Bali has a {{caste system}} {{similar to the}} Indian system in its ancient form. In ancient India, caste was called varna, meaning {{coloring}} of the neutral or transparent soul or the propensity of the soul to behave according to certain tendencies based on its innate nature. Based on this propensity people selected their profession. Later this process through erosion became a family lineage/birth based system. This same system has been adopted in Bali and it is called 'Wangsa' which {{is related to the}} professions of the ancestors. However, even in Bali today, irrespective of the profession of the individual, they claim to belong to their family wangsa. There are four basic wangsa or professions, known collectively as caturwangsa—all Balinese belong to this group. The top three wangsa are, Brahmana, Satria (or Ksatriya) and Wesia (or Wesya) represent nobility, and are known as triwangsa. The <b>fourth</b> and <b>most</b> <b>common</b> wangsa is Sudra.|$|R

Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013.

40|$|Summary A {{study was}} made of the {{incidence}} of p 53 mutations in Japanese males with prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used as a primary screening technique with gene sequencing being carried out in positive cases. Two out of 21 prostate cancers (9. 5 %) were found to have p 53 mutations. These were stage B 2 and D 2 prostate cancers. No abnormalities were found in the remaining cases or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Mutations of the p 53 gene would thus appear infrequent in the tumourigenesis of primary prostate cancer. Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the <b>fourth</b> and second <b>most</b> <b>common</b> cause of cancer death among men in the UK (Davies & Eaton, 1991) and United States (Silverberg et al., 1990), respectively.

30|$|Urachal {{congenital}} anomalies are {{secondary to}} an abnormal involution of the allantois. Bauer and Retik [13] described {{four types of}} anomalies according to the portion of this embryonic structure that remains patent. If the urachus remains patent from the bladder to the umbilicus, it forms a urachal fistula. However, when a patent urachus communicates with the umbilicus but not the bladder, this is called urachal-umbilical sinus. On the contrary, a vesicourachal diverticulum defines a communication between the patent urachus and {{the dome of the}} bladder. Finally, the <b>fourth</b> and <b>most</b> <b>common</b> type of urachal remnant is a urachal cyst, which results from the accumulation of mucinous and serous secretions in a cavity suspended at any level of the urachus without communication to either the bladder or to the umbilicus. The most relevant complications of urachal cysts include infection with possible rupture in the peritoneal cavity leading to peritonitis [4] and the risk of malignant degeneration. The most accepted treatment for congenital patent urachus is the excision of the urachal tract, including the parietal peritoneum, from the umbilicus to the bladder. Partial resections of patent urachus may recur up to 30 % [14]. Several authors perform a partial colpectomy, including the dome of the bladder to prevent malignant degeneration. However, we did not consider necessary this practice as the estimated risk of malignancy is lower than 0.1 % [15] and other authors have reported favorable outcomes without resection of the bladder cuff in all the cases [16].|$|R

No data are {{available}} for HIV-positive patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate and to compare clinical presentation and outcome between HIV-positive and HIV-negative PC patients. METHODS: From April 1988 to June 2010, the Italian Cooperative Group on AIDS and Tumors identified 16 cases of HIV-positive PC patients. Each HIV-positive patient from our institution was randomly matched (ratio 1 : 2) with HIV-negative patients (32 controls) based on sex and year of PC diagnosis. Differences in clinical presentation, treatment, and overall survival were assessed. RESULTS: At multivariate analysis, HIV-positive patients compared with HIV-negative patients had a higher risk of an unfavorable performance status (PS ≥ 2) and a younger age (< 50 years) at cancer diagnosis. At multivariate analysis, HIV-positive status and PS of 2 or greater were the only 2 features that significantly reduced PC patients' survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, for the first time, that HIV-positive PC patients, compared with HIV-negative patients, are younger at cancer diagnosis.
