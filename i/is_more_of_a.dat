5|$|From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's {{position}} {{at the mouth of}} the river was an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21stcenturies, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and {{it is unlikely that}} anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits. What follows <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> discussion than a definitive account.|$|E

5|$|The house stands {{mostly as}} it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was {{screened}} in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At {{the rear of the house}} a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low-shed type.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to {{be less likely to}} suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E
5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor would view as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) {{through the use of}} flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, tapirs, peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within {{the territory of the}} United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E
5|$|Pospisil <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{contemporary}} {{rather than}} a rival of Raonic. Owing to their similarity in age—Pospisil is six months older—and {{the fact that both}} are successful products of Tennis Canada's development programs, they have been linked as the leaders {{of a new generation of}} Canadian tennis players. They partnered in doubles frequently early in their careers, winning doubles titles together in junior and ATP Challenger events. Between 2011 and 2015, Raonic and Pospisil have been the two top-ranked Canadian men in year-end rankings. As well as four ATP Challenger and Futures matches, they have played each other in two ATP World Tour matches: Raonic beat Pospisil in the first all-Canadian semifinal at an ATP 1000 tournament, and in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. They are frequent Davis Cup teammates, and they planned to play doubles together at the 2016 Rio Olympics until Raonic withdrew.|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} {{is similar}} to neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them. Neuroeconomics <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> academic field while neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> applied science. Neuromarketing focuses {{on the study of}} various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies. Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.|$|R

25|$|In Surat an-Nās, {{there are}} evils which are whispered to people. If people act upon these whisperings, which call towards evil actions, {{people will be}} the ones who are sinful.

25|$|Neither {{of these}} {{mechanisms}} explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystery, {{especially given the}} complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' deoxyribose analogue, {{which suggests that the}} drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. Ribavirin 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP.|$|E
25|$|Introducing product differentiation, as {{proposed}} by Jean-Pascal Benassy. This <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> synthesis of monopolistic competition with the Bertrand–Edgeworth model, but Benassy showed that if the elasticity of demand for the firms output is sufficiently high, then any pure strategy equilibrium that existed would {{be close to the}} competitive outcome.|$|E
30|$|The {{corporate}} venture could potentially cannibalize the mainstream business and hence there <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incentive for fierce competition {{than there is}} for productive collaboration and future integration.|$|R

25|$|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: {{a pair of}} schoolmates and {{childhood}} friends of Hamlet. They forget who they are quite often. Rosencrantz is simple-minded and is okay with taking things at face value and letting other people do the thinking.

25|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} on the taxonomy of helminths; it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commonly used term to describe certain worms with superficial similarities. These are flatworms (platyhelminthes), namely cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes), and roundworms or nemathelminths (nematodes) – both of these are parasitic worm types – and the annelida, which are not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches.|$|E
25|$|Swimming <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minor sport at Epsom College, as it {{is often}} chosen as an {{alternative}} to the more popular team sports, such as Rugby. In the 5th form, choice is given to all pupils not included in 1st teams. Practice and occasional galas take place in the College's 25-metre swimming pool. Training is supervised by teachers at the school and external coaches.|$|E
