50|$|Old Bagalakote {{consisted}} of Halepeth, Jainpeth, Killa, Hosapeth and Venkatapeth. Before {{the arrival of}} the railway line only Halepeth, Jainpeth and Killa existed. On 1 August 1984 traffic opened on the Hutagi-Gadag Meter gauge railway line. Cotton starts moving to Bagalakote from villages around. Cotton Gins developed close to railway station. Typical Gin consists of a <b>ginning</b> <b>machine</b> to separate cotton seeds from cotton. And a brahma (hydraulic) press with vast area for storage and parking of bullock carts. Bagalakote was an important cotton export hub on the Hutagi-Gadag railway line. New industries and new businesses arrived in the town. At the same time, new settlements were established south of the old town called Hosapeth. Migration started to Hosapeth from around villages. This boom attracted migrants from Gujarat and Rajasthan too. After the Independence of India, Bagalkote Udhyog ltd. started a cement factory 3 km away on west side. To hold the increased population one more new settlement was established close to the town on the West side of town named Venkatapeth, named after an ancient Venkateshwara temple.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{realizes the}} hazards of {{chromium}} contamination and pollution caused {{by the use of}} Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers commonly used in cotton roller ginning industries and attempts to eliminate the chromium contamination and pollution during the complete process. Most of the cotton ginning operations are performed by using double roller (DR) <b>ginning</b> <b>machines</b> which serve {{an important role in the}} cotton ginning industries. The rollers used in these industries are made of Chrome Composite Leather-Cladding (CCLC) covering fixed to a shaft. The CCLC coverings contain about 18 000 to 36 000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in DR <b>ginning</b> <b>machines,</b> the lint cotton is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the cotton ginning process due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationary knife the chromium particles are carried into lint cotton such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance and are vulnerable to health hazards. To offset thi...|$|R
50|$|Many spinners {{differentiate}} between worsted preparation and worsted spinning. Worsted preparation {{refers to the}} way the fibre is prepared before spinning, using <b>ginning</b> <b>machines</b> which force the fibre staples to lie parallel to each other. Once these fibres have been made into a top, they are then combed to remove the short fibres. The long fibres are combined in subsequent gilling machines to again make the fibres parallel. This produces overlapping untwisted strands called slivers. Worsted spinning refers to using a worsted technique, which produces a smooth yarn in which the fibres lie parallel.|$|R

25|$|Production {{capacity}} in Britain and the United States was improved by {{the invention of}} the modern cotton gin by the American Eli Whitney in 1793. Before the development of cotton gins, the cotton fibers had to be pulled from the seeds tediously by hand. By the late 1700s, a number of crude <b>ginning</b> <b>machines</b> had been developed. However, to produce a bale of cotton required over 600 hours of human labor, making large-scale production uneconomical in the United States, even with the use of humans as slave labor. The gin that Whitney manufactured (the Holmes design) reduced the hours down to just a dozen or so per bale. Although Whitney patented his own design for a cotton gin, he manufactured a prior design from Henry Odgen Holmes, for which Holmes filed a patent in 1796. Improving technology and increasing control of world markets allowed British traders to develop a commercial chain in which raw cotton fibers were (at first) purchased from colonial plantations, processed into cotton cloth in the mills of Lancashire, and then exported on British ships to captive colonial markets in West Africa, India, and China (via Shanghai and Hong Kong).|$|R
50|$|The area of {{cultivated}} land under cotton in 1914 was three million acres (12,000 km²), {{and most of}} the cotton was grown in the Marathwara districts, where the soil was peculiarly well suited to it. The opening of the Hyderabad-Godavari Railway, in October 1900, gave a great impetus to the growth of cotton in the Nizamabad, Nander, Parbhani and Aurangabad Districts, where many ginning and pressing factories came into existence as soon as heavy machinery could be brought there by rail. Bombay buyers then began to arrive in considerable numbers during the cotton season, which lasted from October to December, and as they paid cash for the cotton and would even send coolies to cut it and bring it to the cotton marts, more and more land began to be put down in cotton by the farmers. Hand gins gave place to <b>ginning</b> <b>machines,</b> and the farmers ceased to weed their fields carefully, and to cultivate only the best cotton. Grain and pulses then became more expensive, so much of the best land being laid down in cotton, and Marathwara entered upon a critical period of its existence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} the pollution caused by Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers {{commonly used in}} cotton roller ginning industries and suggests an alternative roller material. The CCLC rollers contain about 18000 to 36000 mg/kg (ppm) total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in Double Roller (DR) <b>ginning</b> <b>machines,</b> the lint is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the ginning process due to persistent rubbing of leather over stationary knife, chromium particles are carried into the lint such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance. To offset this problem, pollution-free Rubberized Cotton Fabric (RCF) rollers have been fabricated, used and experimented in roller gins. RCF roller covering is made of multiple layers of fabrics bonded together using white rubber compounding which has a surface finish conducive to high ginning efficiency. This nullifies chromium contamination and pollution during the ginning process. On {{the basis of the}} design and development of various rollers with subsequent performance evaluation studies, pollution-free RCF washers / rollers have been demonstrated with reference to techno-commercial and eco-friendliness in ginneries.

Firstly the gray-scale processing is carried on to the original cotton foreign fibers image. Moreover, some other treatment such as adaptive threshold method, filter technique and enhancement processing, are used to complete the image segmentation in order to obtain clear binary image; then hollowed inner point method and neighborhood search method are used to extract the contours in order to obtain the characteristic parameters of foreign fibers. Finally the category identification and weight statistics of foreign fibers is completed based on rough sets theory. It’s proved by experiments that the detection speed of this new instrument can achieve 40 m/h and the recognition precision of this analyzer can achieve 90 %...|$|R
2500|$|The cotton <b>gin</b> is a <b>machine</b> that {{separates}} cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand. These seeds are either used again {{to grow more}} cotton or, if badly damaged, disposed of. The cotton gin uses {{a combination of a}} wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen, while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. In 1793, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin and later received a patent on March 14, 1794. Whitney's cotton gin could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of [...] "King Cotton" [...] as the main cash crop in the South. However, it never made him rich. Instead of buying his machine, farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the increasing need for African-American slave labor.|$|R
5000|$|A cotton <b>gin</b> is a <b>machine</b> {{that quickly}} and easily {{separates}} cotton fibers from their seeds, allowing for much greater productivity than manual cotton separation. The fibers are then processed into various cotton goods such as linens, while any undamaged cotton is used largely for textiles like clothing. Seeds {{may be used to}} grow more cotton or to produce cottonseed oil. Handheld roller gins had been used in India and then other countries since at earliest 500 CE. The Indian worm-gear roller gin, invented some time around the sixteenth century, has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time. A modern mechanical cotton gin was created by American inventor Eli Whitney in 1793 and patented in 1794. Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears.|$|R
