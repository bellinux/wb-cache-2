40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method for}} the design of turbomachinery blade profile to obtain best performance has been demonstrated for its practical use. As an example a typical turbine blade profile based on conventional method of design was analyzed theoretically for surface velocity distribution, boundary layer growth and associated profile loss. The surface velocity distribution was obtained uisng singularity method based on Martensens's approach, assuming the flow to be two dimensional and incompressible. The boundary layer parameters are predicted using standard momentum integral and improved entrainment method. The theoretically estimated velocity distribution and profile loss are compared with experimentally measured values. The velocity distribution was reshaped to get better boundary layer growth and lower loss. By extending the Martensen's approach a theoretical method was developed to <b>design</b> the blade <b>profile</b> which will have the above reshaped velocity distribution. The newly <b>designed</b> <b>profile</b> was analyzed theoretically for the same fluid inlet angles for which the initial conventional profile was analyzed earlier. Both the profiles were compared to assess their performance. The <b>designed</b> <b>profile</b> was found to be better than conventional profile with respect to velocity distribution,boundary layer growth and profile loss...|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of scale model design, there are at present many {{possibilities}} for advanced <b>design.</b> <b>Profile</b> gliders encounter a limitation for improvement of flight performance based on their wing types, which are typically curved-plate aerofoils. In addition, fuselages are either balsa-paper or paper laminates, prone to warping or breakage over a very short time.Improvement in performance is possible through modelling three-dimensional fuselages which encourage laminar flow, and in internally braced wings which can then have high-lift aerofoil profiles, such as the Clark Y or NACA 4 or 6 series, for high lift.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2011 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a {{few miles}} from the Olympic Stadium, was {{commissioned}} to make the bell. [...] The Foundry completed its <b>design,</b> <b>profile,</b> lettering and tuning. However, it was no longer able to cast such a large bell (its furnace capacity is 8 tonnes, as the large Victorian era bells had gone out of fashion), and so subcontracted casting to Royal Eijsbouts of the Netherlands. There was some controversy over using a non-British firm, as Taylor’s Bell Foundry in Loughborough had also tendered to cast the bell. The hammer mechanism and hanging framework were made by other firms and twenty companies in three countries were eventually involved with its production. The bell was installed and tested in the stadium at midnight on 1 June 2012. It was designed to be as large as possible but needed to fit through the athletes’ tunnel; when it arrived there were only a few inches to spare.|$|E
50|$|In early 1941, the Italian Army {{requested}} that Fiat and Ansaldo develop {{a low profile}} 15 to 16 tonne LT tank to counter the faster and more heavily armed A-13 series tanks exemplified by the Crusader tank. Fiat-Ansaldo began the new tank project in June 1941 by creating a wooden mock-up on a M14/41 medium tank chassis, inclining the tanks armour plates to create a glacis. The armour remained, like other contemporary Italian tanks of the period, bolted rather than welded together and generally thinner than tanks of other countries. Many different engines, including petrol-fueled aircraft engines, were tested on the chassis before development of the Sahariano tank was halted. At the time of cancellation a 275 hp gasoline engine was being tested. An elongated M14/41 turret housing a 47 mm 47/40 L40 was tested on the Sahariano tank and would also {{be used by the}} M15/42 medium tank. There were plans to later fit a 75 mm gun on the production model of the Sahariano tank as well. The Sahariano was the first Italian tank to feature a modified Christie suspension system, a more robust and faster suspension system than the leaf spring bogies used on previous Italian tank designs. Ansaldo based the Saharianos suspension on British tanks encountered in North Africa and a captured Soviet BT-5 from the Spanish Civil War. By the time of the projects cancellation, the design looked very similar to their British counterparts but with a notably lower <b>design</b> <b>profile,</b> making the tank easier to conceal and more difficult to hit.|$|E

40|$|In {{its most}} simple terms, traffic calming is about {{preserving}} {{the functions of}} local streets. As local streets are intended to provide primarily land-access services, hence, when traffic begins to use local streets for through movements, traffic volume and speed levels become incompatible with this primary function. To respond, {{a study on the}} effectiveness of traffic calming measures in reducing vehicles speed at Taman Setapak residential area was undertaken. Field observations and spot speed survey were conducted to collect primary data. The field observation was carried out to collect data on road geometrics and design characteristics of the road humps. The spot speed survey was administered to collect vehicles speed at different points near the road humps. The major findings include first, the road humps proved effective in reducing the speed of the vehicles and second the design characteristics of the road humps {{is an important factor in}} reducing the speed of the vehicles. The average speed of the vehicles before approaching the road humps was about 30 km/hr and at the road humps below 10 km/hr.
