5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the <b>inquest</b> to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario. Presiding Coroner Dr. Carlisle dismissed this motion {{at the same time as}} that of the Correctional Service of Canada motion, but subsequently granted the out-of-province doctors standing at the <b>inquest</b> when they agreed to testify voluntarily at the <b>inquest</b> proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The first coroner's <b>inquest</b> into Smith's suicide {{began in}} May 2011. The <b>inquest,</b> {{initially}} led by deputy chief coroner Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial; {{it was originally}} scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As {{a result of this}} challenge, the scope of the <b>inquest</b> was broadened to cover the entire 11-month period of Smith's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the <b>inquest</b> were suspended until 12 September; the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding coroner, apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011; the replacement presiding coroner was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief coroner of interfering in the <b>inquest</b> with no legal basis; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The <b>inquest</b> resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new coroner to continue the <b>inquest,</b> and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the <b>inquest</b> and dismissed the jury.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an <b>inquest</b> into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The <b>inquest</b> lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E

5|$|Following the <b>inquest,</b> {{evidence}} came {{to light}} to contradict the version of events presented by the British government at the <b>inquest.</b> Six weeks after {{the conclusion of the}} <b>inquest,</b> a Gibraltar Police operations order leaked; the document listed Inspector Revagliatte, who had claimed to be on routine patrol, unaware of Operation Flavius, and whose siren apparently triggered the shootings, as the commander of two police firearms teams assigned to the operation. In February 1989, British journalists discovered that the IRA team operating in Spain must have contained more members than the three killed in Gibraltar. The staff at the agencies from which the team rented their vehicles gave the Spanish police descriptions which did not match McCann, Savage, or Farrell; Savage's white Renault, meanwhile, was rented several hours before Savage himself arrived in Spain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, {{awakening}} him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the <b>inquest</b> jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study <b>inquest</b> law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the <b>inquest</b> be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the <b>inquest</b> himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.|$|E

The indictment charged More with having taken the fees on July 17 and 24. A capias, returnable at the December 1802 term, was issued. The members of the <b>Inquest</b> included five other D.C. justices of the peace: Daniel Carrol, Daniel Reintzell, Joseph Sprigg Belt, Thomas Corcoran, and Anthony Reintzell. Another member of the <b>Inquest</b> was Thomas Beall, a confirmed Adams appointee who had not received a commission from Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inquest</b> {{determined}} that Kehoe murdered Superintendent Emory Huyck {{on the morning}} of May 18. It was also the jury's verdict that the school was blown up as part of a plan and that Kehoe alone, without the aid of conspirators, murdered 43 people in total, including his wife Nellie. Suicide was determined to be the cause of Andrew Kehoe's death, which brought the total number of dead to 44 {{at the time of the}} <b>inquest.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>inquest</b> was {{frequently}} interrupted by multiple legal challenges {{and a change}} of coroner, before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011; a new <b>inquest</b> into Smith's death began on 19 September 2012. On 2 December 2013, the presiding coroner instructed the jury to begin their deliberations {{with respect to a}} verdict on Smith's death.|$|E

Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his <b>inquest</b> noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|An <b>inquest</b> into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be sure how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The <b>inquest</b> jury returned an open verdict.|$|E

The chief coroner of the province stated that a provincial <b>inquest</b> was possible, though it would take some time to come to any decision on the matter.

5|$|Soon after {{assuming}} the throne, Edward set about restoring order and re-establishing royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father. To accomplish this, he immediately ordered an extensive change of administrative personnel. The {{most important of}} these was the appointment of Robert Burnell as chancellor, a man who would remain in the post until 1292 as one of the King's closest associates. Edward then replaced most local officials, such as the escheators and sheriffs. This last measure was done in preparation for an extensive <b>inquest</b> covering all of England, that would hear complaints about abuse of power by royal officers. The <b>inquest</b> produced the set of so-called Hundred Rolls, from the administrative subdivision of the hundred.|$|E
