50|$|Citation {{forms of}} {{inalienable}} nouns are usually indicated with a preceding dummy possessor noun. For human possession this is du “his, its” or khaa “person's”, {{and for all}} other nouns it is at or a “its”. If an inalienable noun is not distinguished in this manner {{it is difficult for}} nonnative speakers to determine the noun's class. In dictionaries the dummy possessor noun is ignored for <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sorting.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In This paper, {{the authors}} present a {{positional}} algorithmic approach for <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sort.</b> Results are achieved in linear time. Within this approach two embedded algorithms, Binary Search and Counting Sort are executed in parallel {{to achieve the}} goal. In this approach a Pre-Processor or Priority Queue is used, which minimizes time complexity. The algorithm is linear in speed. Time Complexity of this newly proposed algorithm is Θ (n). The interesting feature of this algorithm is that the order of alphabets is not change and the approach is too much simple...|$|R
5000|$|The radical-and-stroke {{system is}} {{cumbersome}} {{compared to an}} alphabetical system {{in which there are}} a few characters, all unambiguous. The choice of which components of a logograph comprise separate radicals and which radical is primary is not clear-cut. As a result, logographic languages often supplement radical-and-stroke ordering with <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sorting</b> of a phonetic conversion of the logographs. For example, the kanji word Tōkyō (東京) can be sorted as if it were spelled out in the Japanese characters of the hiragana syllabary as [...] "to-u-ki-yo-u" [...] (とうきょう), using the conventional sorting order for these characters.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrogen is {{the only}} element whose {{isotopes}} have different names that are in common use today. The 2H (or hydrogen-2) isotope is usually called deuterium, while the 3H (or hydrogen-3) isotope is usually called tritium. The symbols D and T (instead of 2H and 3H) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium. The IUPAC states in the 2005 Red Book that while the use of D and T is common, it is not preferred because it can cause problems in the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sorting</b> of chemical formulas. The ordinary isotope of hydrogen, with no neutrons, is sometimes called [...] "protium". (During the early study of radioactivity, some other heavy radioactive isotopes were given names, but such names are rarely used today.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new design of an Arabic keyboard layout for effective text entry on touch screen mobile phones. Our approach {{is based on}} Pareto front optimization using three metrics: minimizing finger travel distance {{in order to maximize}} speed, minimizing neighboring key error ambiguities in order to maximize the quality of spell correction, and maximizing familiarity for less technologically literature users through approximate <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sorting.</b> In our short user studies, the new layout showed an observed improvement in typing speed in comparison to a common Arabic layout. We believe the opportunity is now ripe to research new optimized keyboard designs where there is less usage experience than Qwerty has in mainstream Western European languages. Pareto optimisation can produce high quality keyboards for alphabet based laguages that could give real benefits where there is less reluctance to change from Qwerty.

30|$|Thus, the {{following}} protocol {{was designed and}} used for testing with both datasets: subjects for whom the dataset contained fewer than four images were discarded. For each of the remaining subjects, a set of four images were chosen by an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>sort</b> on the names given in the original dataset. Of these four images, the first three comprised a subject’s gallery; the last {{was used as a}} probe image. These subsets have been dubbed FERET 240 and LFW 610, respectively. For FERET, this ordering means the gallery generally included images from the FA and FB subsets while the probe is from the one of the more difficult sets (DUP 1 or DUP 2). For LFW, this ordering has no relation to standard sets or collection process. Because we use a multiple-image gallery for building the SVM, it was necessary to deviate from the published protocols for each data set. In addition, our effort is focused on recognition.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} data {{structures}} {{have been proposed}} to solve anagrams in constant time. Two {{of the most commonly}} used data structures are the Alphabetic map and the Frequency map. The Alphabetic map maintains a hash table of all the possible words that can be in the language (this {{is referred to as the}} lexicon). For a given input sting, sort the letters in <b>alphabetic</b> order. This <b>sorted</b> string maps onto a word in the hash table. Hence finding the anagram requires sorting the letters and a looking up the word in the hash table. The sorting can be done in linear time by the counting sort and hash table look up can be done in constant time.|$|R

Lorin In this paper, we restrict the word sorting to mean the ordering of data by a digital computer. Given a collection of data entries and an ordering key, various processes can be invoked to arrange the entries into a desired order. The order is commonly an ascending or <b>descending</b> numerical or <b>alphabetic</b> sequence, but other orders are possible. At one time, {{the meaning of the}} word sortin...|$|R
40|$|It is {{desirable}} to store text {{data in a}} database so that the basic functions are provided by the underlying database management system (DBMS). However, most DBMSs use English-like semantics as the query language for data manipulation. Although they can be localized to users' preferred languages, text processing under database systems are still far short of support for handling ideographic characters, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean [2]. Usually, sorting and indexing in a database system use the internal code sequence defined in the given codeset. For alphabet-based languages, such as English and French, sorting and indexing is quite straight forward because the internal code sequence naturally reflects the <b>alphabetic</b> order. But, <b>sorting</b> and indexing ideographic characters such as Chinese based on internal code sequence does not reveal relationships among data. Therefore, browsing data indexed based on internal code sequence cannot reveal the relationships among the neighbouring d [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The ACTINIDES 2013 {{conference was}} {{dedicated}} to providing a platform for discussion and information exchange for current research in the physics and chemistry of the actinide and the transactinide elements. Specific topics included fundamental materials science, chemistry, physics, environmental science, and application technologies. The conference consisted of presentations of new scientific results in plenary lectures, invited and contributed talks and presentations in poster formats. The ACTINIDES 2013 Conference also offered an excellent opportunity to establish or renew contacts with colleagues during the scientific program, 2 poster sessions and the conference banquet program.
