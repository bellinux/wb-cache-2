Analysis provides exact formulae {{for the cost of}} searching when batching is applied {{as a function of the}} magnitude of the query and time. The analysis takes into account (a) accesses to the overflow area only, and (b) accesses to both primary and overflow area, as well as whether the records of the query are (a) distinct, or (b) nondistinct. Batched search is compared with the simple on-line search and a proposal is stated concerning the reorganization of <b>index</b> <b>sequential</b> files...|$|R

5000|$|Locality often {{occurs because}} code {{contains}} loops {{that tend to}} reference arrays or other data structures by <b>indices.</b> <b>Sequential</b> locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when relevant data elements are arranged and accessed linearly. For example, the simple traversal of elements in a one-dimensional array, from the base address to the highest element would exploit the sequential locality of the array in memory. [...] The more general equidistant locality occurs when the linear traversal is over a longer area of adjacent data structures with identical structure and size, accessing mutually corresponding elements of each structure rather than each entire structure. This is the case when a matrix is represented as a sequential matrix of rows and the requirement is to access a single column of the matrix.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{to determine the}} best locations of DG units mainly based on reliability <b>indices.</b> <b>Sequential</b> Monte Carlo simulation (sMCs) is utilized to calculate the reliability indices. One of the main advantages of using sMCs in bulk power system reliability analysis is the ability to provide reliability index probability distributions in addition to the expected values of the index. This method can also provide information about the uncertainty related to a definite level of system reliability. Then, the AHP method is used to select the best plans based on reliability indices and some other alternatives including power loss and voltage profile. The results show that the proposed method finds the optimal locations of DG units considering enhancement of criteria with and without uncertainties of reliability and load demand...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} operation performed on database is searching. To perform this operation we have different kinds of searching algorithms, {{some of which are}} Binary Search, <b>Index</b> <b>Sequential</b> Access Method (ISAM), but these and all other searching algorithms work only on data, which are previously sorted. An efficient algorithm is required {{in order to make the}} searching algorithm fast and efficient. This research paper presents a new sorting algorithm named as “Optimized Selection Sort Algorithm, OSSA”. OSSA is designed to perform sorting quickly and more effectively as compared to the existing version of selection sort. The introduction of OSSA version of selection sort algorithm for sorting the data stored in database instead of existing selection sort algorithm will provide an opportunity to the users to save almost 50 % of their operation time with almost 100 % accuracy...|$|R

Such results reveal departures from rationality, determined by structured and unstructured uncertainty, which the Fed systematically attempts at reducing by administering inflation scares and misinformation about the actual Phillips curve, {{in order to keep}} the output and equity markets under control. ...|$|R

40|$|NMR and CD {{spectroscopy}} {{have been}} used to characterize, both structurally and dynamically, the 82 -amino-acid ParD protein of the post-segregational killing module of the broad-host-range plasmid RP 4 /RK 2. ParD occurs as a dimer in solution and exercises two different control functions; an autoregulatory function by binding to its own promoter P(parDE) and a plasmid-stabilizing function by inhibiting ParE toxicity in cells that express ParD and ParE. Analysis of the secondary structure based on the chemical-shift <b>indices,</b> <b>sequential</b> nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) and (3) J(Halpha-NH) scalar coupling constants showed that the N-terminal domain of ParD consists of a short beta-ribbon followed by three alpha-helices, demonstrating that ParD contains a ribbon-helix-helix fold, a DNA-binding motif found in a family of small prokaryotic repressors. (15) N longitudinal (T(1)) and transverse (T(2)) relaxation measurements and hetero nuclear NOEs showed that ParD is divided into two separate domains, a well-ordered N-terminal domain and a very flexible C-terminal domain. An increase in secondary structure was observed upon addition of trifluoroethanol, suggested to result from the formation of structured stretches in the C-terminal part of the protein. This is the first experimental evidence that the DNA-binding domain of ParD belongs to the ribbon-helix-helix fold family, and this structural motif is proposed to be present in functionally similar antidote proteins...|$|R
