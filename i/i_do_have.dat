My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> {{to think about it}} more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember {{to get rid of the}} old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E

500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E

She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a home. I have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E

500|$|City of Death {{is one of}} five Doctor Who serials {{from the}} series' {{original}} run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are The Pirate Planet, Shada, Resurrection of the Daleks, and Revelation of the Daleks. Target approached Douglas Adams {{on a number of occasions}} with a view to commissioning a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied saying, [...] "I don't want to be embarrassing but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a tendency to be a best-selling author". Target, concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms, refused to change their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000– double what was the standard advance at the time– but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead.|$|E
500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook. Radke stated that he chose not to write any songs about love because, [...] "...I'm not going to lie ... and try to write songs on how much I love somebody. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> love, but {{there will be a lot}} of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating in an interview that he believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was premiered on Aguilera's {{official}} channel on YouTube on August 29, 2013. The clip was official released {{few hours after}} she posted a 2000-word thank you message to fans on her official website on August 28, 2013. A part of the letter reads,I may get quiet at times, but when <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> something to say, I mean every word. I decided to share my thoughts with you at length and tell you openly how I feel. Thank you for filling my soul with melody and song … lyrics and love … and giving me a safe place I feel comforted in being brave enough to always bare my soul and come from an honest and genuine place. Be fearless {{enough to be a}} conversation piece … Speak your own truth… As always, thank you for accepting me for who I am. Being human – flaws and all. The music video for [...] "Let There Be Love" [...] was filmed in a DIY style. In the music video, Aguilera is seen in her one-piece swimsuit with the world [...] "love" [...] written all over it. It also featured guest appearances from Nicole Richie, Christina Milian, Chris Mann, Aguilera's son, Max Bratman, and her current boyfriend Matthew Rutler. The video begins with Aguilera' message, [...] "Hey everybody Chrisitina here just thanking you guys so much for filling my life and my heart with so much love continued throughout the years... Standing by me, I appreciate all your support, this one is just for you". Everybody is seen joking around with another friend as they make the [...] "L" [...] sign for [...] "love" [...] with their hands, as well as holding up signs with positive messages such as [...] "Don't judge", [...] "Equality", [...] "Racism sucks", [...] "Accept", and [...] "Amo a mi hijo gay" [...] ("I love my gay son"), while Aguilera's son Bratman [...] "excitedly" [...] "shows off his dancing chops".

All this time we were all living in a house and keeping pretty regular hours together, so the next day we started running it down. There was only one place where there was a slight rerun.

2500|$|ABC news {{consultant}} and retired army Major General William Nash was quoted by ABC news {{as saying he}} had [...] "no problem" [...] with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to United States troops.

[...] Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) president Mikey Weinstein said that a private company can do whatever it wants to, but when a company becomes a defense contractor, responsibilities change. MRFF, one of the lead organizations in publicizing the problem—helping to break the stories on ABC news and Nightline—was initially criticized by Trijicon as a [...] "non-Christian" [...] group, but criticism of the verses on military weapons was quickly leveled by numerous secular and religious groups, including Christian and interfaith organizations.

2500|$|His {{experiences}} in Manchuria were also deeply influential on his writing, imprinting terrors and fever dreams {{which are now}} surrealist hallmarks of his works.

[...] The trash of the marsh was a truth of life, as were the crows, yet Abe's recollections of them tie them distinctly. Further experiences with the swamp centered around its use as a staking ground for condemned criminals with [...] " [...] heads--now food for crows-- appearing suddenly out of the darkness and disappearing again, terrified and attracted to us." [...] These ideas are present in much of Abe's work.|$|E

2500|$|The British press have widely publicised various {{statements}} made by UKIP activists and candidates which have been regarded as racist, sexist or otherwise bigoted. Among the [...] "countless examples" [...] of UKIP representatives and supporters embarrassing the party have been an MEP who called for {{a ban on the}} construction of mosques and for all British Muslims to sign a code of conduct, a councillor who suggested that shops should be allowed to refuse service to women and homosexuals, and a candidate councillor who compared Islam to Nazism and told black comedian Lenny Henry to leave Britain after the latter called for greater ethnic diversity within the UK's creative industries. In 2015, a documentary called Meet the Ukippers filmed activists making racist statements; one stated [...] "the only people <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a problem with are negroes". For many years such individuals were internally tolerated within the party, although as part of Farage's push to professionalise the party a number of its members—such as MEP Godfrey Bloom—were expelled for making comments that brought UKIP into disrepute.|$|E

2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move! Fuck!” Of the seven shots fired by Yanez at point blank range, five hit Castile and two of those hit and pierced his heart.|$|E
