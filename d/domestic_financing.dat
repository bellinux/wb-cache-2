50|$|The {{banking system}} {{operated}} {{within the framework}} of the financial plan. Major elements of the financial plan included allocation to consumption and investment, foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>financing</b> of investment, and wage and price changes. Planning authorities were in a position to use the centralized banking system to carry out major corrective measures, as occurred in 1953 when inflationary pressures became serious and the population's accumulated savings were largely wiped out by a conversion of the currency. After this experience, officials placed stricter controls on investments, permitting real wages and the standard of living to rise gradually. But in the late 1970s, and particularly in the early 1980s, the worsening terms of trade, bottlenecks in the economy, and the need for large investments in energy and industry combined to limit the allocations for consumption.|$|E
50|$|The {{tax system}} under the Marcos {{administration}} was generally regressive {{as it was}} heavily dependent on indirect taxes. Indirect taxes and international trade taxes accounted for about 35% of total tax revenue, while direct taxes only accounted for 25%. Government expenditure for economic services peaked during this period, focusing mainly on infrastructure development, with about 33% of the budget spent on capital outlays. In response to the higher global interest rates and to the depreciation of the peso, the government became increasingly reliant on <b>domestic</b> <b>financing</b> to finance fiscal deficit. The government also started liberalizing tariff policy during this period by enacting the initial Tariff Reform Program, which narrowed the tariff structure {{from a range of}} 100%-0% to 50%-10%, and the Import Liberalization Program, which aimed at reducing or eliminating tariffs and realigning indirect taxes.|$|E
50|$|Duan's {{strategy}} now was {{to negotiate}} financial loans with Japan, {{in exchange for}} concessions, to fund a military buildup for the conquest of the south. The political cover for this army was the entry of China into the First World War. With the poor state of the government's credit and European wartime expenses making both Western and <b>domestic</b> <b>financing</b> impossible, he secretly negotiated {{the first of the}} Nishihara Loans with Japan on September 29, 1917. In exchange he offered Japan the right to station troops in Shandong province--then a German concession--as well as the right to build and run two new Shandong railroads. There would be a high political price to pay when these negotiations came to light later on, but in the meantime Duan got the money for his army. This later became {{part of the reason for}} the Shandong Problem.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies how {{financial}} globalization affects debt {{structure in}} emerging markets.

These effects are stronger in economies with less developed domestic financial systems.

Benefits decline with <b>domestic</b> <b>financing</b> and real fertilizer price increases. Abstracting from extreme events, Malawi's programme potentially generates double dividends through higher and more drought-resilient yields.
