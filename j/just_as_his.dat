5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Britain was {{challenged}} again by France under Napoleon, {{in a struggle}} that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. It was not only Britain's position {{on the world stage}} that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|James Turner Morehead (May 24, 1797 – December 28, 1854) was a United States Senator and the 12th Governor of Kentucky.

A member of Henry Clay's National Republican Party, Morehead entered politics <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party's dominance in the state.|$|E

Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed {{that he was still}} alive.

5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to see the world. The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a state dinner at the White House.|$|E
5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E

5|$|Gromek was {{immediately}} {{hired by the}} Tigers after his playing career ended to manage the Erie Sailors of the New York–Penn League. As a player-manager, the team had 53 wins and 72 losses, and Gromek pitched in 17 games for the team as well. After managing in the minors for one season, Gromek retired from the game of baseball, {{and worked as a}} car insurance sales representative. He and his wife, Jeanette, had three sons, Carl, Greg and Brian. Greg and Carl both pitched for the Florida State Seminoles baseball team, and Greg, who pitched in the Tigers' organization for four years, made the transition from infielder to pitcher after college <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> father had. In 1981, Gromek {{became a member of the}} National Polish-American Hall of Fame. He died on March 12, 2002 of complications from diabetes, a stroke and pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. He had been the custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E
5|$|In 678, after Wilfrid {{was removed}} from the bishopric of York and banished from Northumbria, the diocese of York was divided into three. Bosa was {{appointed}} to the now greatly reduced diocese of York, which included the sub-kingdom of Deira, thanks to the support of King Ecgfrith of Northumbria and Theodore of Tarsus, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bosa was consecrated in his cathedral at York in 678 by Theodore, but Wilfrid declared that he was unable to work with Bosa because he did not consider him {{to be a member of}} the Catholic Church. Bosa's episcopate lasted nine years, but with Wilfrid back in favour, in 687 Bosa was removed <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> predecessor had been. He returned to York in 691, after Wilfrid was once again expelled. While bishop, Bosa introduced a communal life for the clergy of the cathedral, and set up a continuous liturgy in the cathedral.|$|E

Later, in December, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan {{at the behest}} of Khan. On 27 December a KGB unit killed Amin. Babrak Karmal, the leader of the Parcham faction, was chosen by the Soviet leadership as Amin's successor {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet intervention. Unfortunately for the Soviet leadership Karmal did not turn out to be the leader they expected, and he, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> predecessors had arrested and killed several Parcham-members, arrested and killed several high-standing and low-standing Khalq members simply because they supported the wrong faction. With Soviet troops still in the country, however, he was forced to bow to Soviet pressure, and released all Khalq prisoners. To make matters even worse for Karmal several of the previously arrested Khalq-members were forced to join the new government. At the time of Brezhnev's death, the Soviet Union was still bogged down in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Leyland {{missed a}} {{substantial}} amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> batting form returned, and when he was likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.|$|E

60|$|No, he {{was never}} old--Patrick. He came to us thirty-six years ago. He was my coachman on the morning that I drove my young bride to our new home. He was a young Irishman, slender, tall, lithe, honest, truthful, and he never changed in all his life. He really was with us but twenty-five years, for {{he did not go}} with us to Europe, but he never {{regarded}} that as separation. As the children grew up he was their guide. He was all honor, honesty, and affection. He was with us in New Hampshire, with us last summer, and <b>his</b> hair was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> black, <b>his</b> eyes were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> blue, <b>his</b> form <b>just</b> <b>as</b> straight, and <b>his</b> heart <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good as on the day we first met. In all the long years Patrick never made a mistake. He never needed an order, he never received a command. He knew. I have been asked for my idea of an ideal gentleman, and I give it to you Patrick McAleer.|$|R

25|$|In November 1960, Cantwell joined Manchester United for £29,500 {{which at}} the time was a record for a full back.
