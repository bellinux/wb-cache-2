Although an improved understanding of the genetic causes of CHD would {{provide insight into the}} underlying pathobiology, the genetic etiology of most CHD remains unknown. Here we show that mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor GATA 6 cause CHD characteristic of a severe form of cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defect, namely persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA). Two different GATA 6 mutations were identified by systematic genetic analysis using DNA from patients with PTA. Genes encoding the neurovascular <b>guiding</b> <b>molecule</b> semaphorin 3 C (SEMA 3 C) and its receptor plexin A 2 (PLXNA 2) appear to be regulated directly by GATA 6, and both GATA 6 mutant proteins failed to transactivate these genes. Transgenic analysis further suggests that, in the developing heart, the expression of SEMA 3 C in the OFT/subpulmonary myocardium and PLXNA 2 in the cardiac neural crest contributing to the OFT is dependent on GATA transcription factors. Together, our data implicate mutations in GATA 6 as genetic causes of CHD involving OFT development, {{as a result of the}} disruption of the direct regulation of semaphorin-plexin signaling...|$|E

Such dynamic temporo-spatial regulation of Sema 3 c plays a role in the fine tuning of migration of neural crest cells into the outflow tract to give rise to the septum.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The {{inflammatory}} cytokine interleukin- 1 beta {{has been considered}} to be an immune effector molecule in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. As such, we examined its role on chemokine receptors which, when expressed in the pancreas, have also been associated with the development of type I autoimmune diabetes. DESIGN AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of membrane and cytoplasmic levels of CCR 3 and CCR 5 expression is assessed by immunofluorescence in control and interleukin- 1 beta-treated RIN- 5 AH cells. The cytoplasmic expression is also shown by confocal microscopy as assessed by the brightness of the cells whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detects secreted CCR 3 and CCR 5 molecules by comparing optical density values as these derive from the control and the treated cells. Cell-fractionation experiments show the exact location of the intracellular pools of the chemokine receptors by using the rab 7 monoclonal antibody as a <b>guiding</b> <b>molecule.</b> RESULTS: Interleukin- 1 beta down-regulates constitutively expressed surface CCR 3 and CCR 5 levels implying receptor internalization for re-utilization or destruction, secretion or both. Cytoplasmic immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy demonstrate cellular retention of chemokine receptors by interleukin- 1 beta which may be released in the absence of interleukin- 1 beta as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, cell-fractionation shows the presence of both receptors in endosomes exhibiting an increasing density after interleukin- 1 beta treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Given the association of chemokine receptors with progression to diabetes, it appears that interleukin- 1 beta-induced down-regulation of CCR 3 and CCR 5 promotes a protective mechanism against cellular destruction. The major role of interleukin- 1 beta is to maintain these molecules within the endosomes. Thus, interleukin- 1 beta modulates the movement and the expression of constitutively expressed chemokine receptors and does not accentuate the total destructive effect suffered by the cells...|$|E
40|$|Cell-cell {{communication}} {{is key to}} coordinated cellular functions in multicellular organisms. In addition to the signaling molecules found in animals, plants also frequently recruit mobile transcription factors to deliver positional information. The best studied example is SHORT-ROOT (SHR), a transcription factor which moves outward from the central vasculature to specify the cell fates of quiescent center (QC), the stem cell cortex/endodermis initial and its daughter (CEI/D) and endodermis in the adjacent cell layer in {{the root of the}} model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. SHR is required together with its downstream target SCARECROW (SCR) for the formative divisions of CEI/D and separation of endodermis and cortex. Intensive studies have revealed that SHR intercellular mobility is linked to its subcellular localization, while formative divisions at the CEI/D position is determined by a regulatory network involving SHR and SCR. Despite these advances, additional regulatory mechanisms are needed to fully explain the regulation of SHR movement and action range. SHR movement is regulated by a zinc finger protein JACKDAW (JKD). We described the function of three JKD homologs and members of the “BIRD protein family” – BALDIBIS (BIB), MAGPIE (MGP) and NUTCRACKER (NUC) – and observed that they constrain SHR movement through nuclear retention while fine-tuning transcription of key SHR targets including SCR and CYCLIN D 6 (CYCD 6). JKD and the studied BIRD proteins promote tissue specifications to continuously stabilize tissue boundaries in the root meristem, highlighting the developmental plasticity in plants. SHR, SCR and the BIRD proteins are largely present in the QC, CEI/D and endodermis, yet different cell types are specified by their interplay. They are also likely to form protein complexes thanks to their inter-binding capacity. We hypothesized that they might form distinct protein complexes in different cells to precisely regulate their behaviors. We optimized the imaging technique Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measured by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) for Arabidopsis roots, and observed that SHR-SCR interaction is enriched in the CEI/D. We then confirmed that enhanced SHR-SCR interaction correlates with formative divisions, while JKD binds SHR and SCR in spatially complementary manners to repress undesired divisions outside CEI/D. Binding competition assays suggest that SHR, SCR and BIRD proteins are incorporated in higher order protein complexes. Together, these data indicate that differential protein interactions are associated with different cell fate specifications, and suggest how multicellular organisms might employ a limited set of regulatory factors to trigger various developmental processes. JKD can act as a <b>guiding</b> <b>molecule</b> for SHR into specific subnuclear bodies. We generated two JKD mutant variants with opposite effect on SHR regulation: one enhances SHR subnuclear body localization while repressing SCR and CYCD 6 expression, the other fails to enrich SHR into subnuclear structures but enhances target transcription. Our data provide evidence of JKD subnuclear compartmentalization as a means to regulate target gene expression. We also described the function of SCARECROW-LIKE 23 (SCL 23), the closest homolog of SCR in Arabidopsis. SCL 23 is also a mobile protein and that it restricts SHR movement without nuclear retention, adding more complexity towards SHR regulation during root development...|$|E

The genome of M. kandleri harbors two CRISPR-Cas systems that use CRISPR RNA (crRNA) as <b>guide</b> <b>molecules</b> to target foreign nucleic acids. RNAseq analysis revealed a high abundance and processing of crRNAs in M. kandleri that indicated that CRISPR-Cas systems are highly active at extreme temperatures. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the CRISPR-associated protein Csm 3 was solved in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Elena Conti (MPI Martinsried). Csm 3 was found to bind crRNAs and was shown to function as the crRNA-binding backbone protein in type III-A CRISPR-Cas interference complexes. A recently discovered nucleic acid-guided mechanism uses prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) proteins. In M. kandleri, a pAgo protein was found to be encoded within a potential operon of CRISPR-associated genes and the analysis of recombinant pAgo protein production revealed a high toxicity in Escherichia coli that might correlate with its potential defense function against plasmid DNA. Methylation of rRNA is regulated by a different sRNA-guided mechanism that utilizes C/D box sRNAs to target a ribonucleoprotein complex to the rRNA methylation site. In M. kandleri, a record number of 126 C/D box sRNAs were detected by RNAseq analysis and indicate an increased potential for rRNA methylation reactions. Furthermore, most of the C/D box sRNAs were detected as circular molecules. Taken together, the circularization of C/D box sRNAs and the high requirement for rRNA methylation are suggested to be adaptations to the hyperthermophilic lifestyle of M. kandleri. Finally, RNAseq analyses were used to identify tRNA precursors in M. kandleri that feature a unique C-to-U editing reaction of base 8.

Interestingly, there is a lot of variation among these prokaryotic Argonaute (pAgo) proteins with respect to domain architecture: some resemble the eukaryotic Ago (long pAgo) containing a complete or disrupted catalytic site, while others are truncated versions (short pAgo) that generally contain an incomplete catalytic site. Prokaryotic Agos with an incomplete catalytic site often co-occur with (predicted) nucleases. Based on this diversity, and on the fact that homologs of other RNAi-related protein components (such as Dicer nucleases) have never been identified in prokaryotes, it has been predicted that variations on the eukaryotic RNAi theme may occur in prokaryotes...|$|R

In the Netrin/DCC chemoattraction pathway the C. elegans homologs are Unc-6/Unc-40 and Unc-5 while the Drosophila homologs are Netrin-A and Netrin-B/Frazzled and Dunc5. In the Slit/Robo chemoreppelant pathway the C. elegans homologs are Slt-1/Sax-3 whereas the Drosophila homologs are also known as Slit/Robo(1-3).|$|R
40|$|The present {{disclosure}} {{provides a}} viral-mediated genome-editing platform that facilitates multiplexing, obviates stable transformation, and is applicable across plant species. The RNA 2 genome {{of the tobacco}} rattle virus (TRV) was engineered to carry and systemically deliver a <b>guide</b> RNA <b>molecules</b> into plants overexpressing Cas 9 endonuclease. High genomic modification frequencies were observed in inoculated as well as systemic leaves including the plant growing points. This system facilitates multiplexing {{and can lead to}} germinal transmission of the genomic modifications in the progeny, thereby obviating the requirements of repeated transformations and tissue culture. The editing platform of the disclosure is useful in plant genome engineering and applicable across plant species amenable to viral infections for agricultural biotechnology applications...|$|R
40|$|Trunk {{neural crest}} cells migrate through the somites in a {{striking}} segmental fashion, entering the rostral but not caudal sclerotome, via cues intrinsic to the somites. Attempts {{to define the}} molecular bases of these cues have been hampered {{by the lack of}} an accessible assay system. To examine trunk neural crest migration over time and to perturb candidate <b>guiding</b> <b>molecules,</b> we have developed a novel explant preparation. Here, we demonstrate that trunk regions of the chicken embryo, placed in explant culture, continue to develop apparently normally for 2 days. Neural crest cells, recognized by prelabeling with DiI or by poststaining with the HNK- 1 antibody, migrate in the somites of the explants in their typical segmental pattern. Furthermore, this paradigm allows us to follow trunk neural crest migration in situ for the first time using low-light-level videomicroscopy. The trajectories of individual neural crest cells were often complex, with cells migrating in an episodic mode encompassing forward, backward and lateral movements. Frequently, neural crest cells migrated in close-knit groups of 2 – 4 cells, moving at mean rates of migration of 10 – 14 µm/hour. Treatment of the explants with the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) both slowed the rate and altered the pattern of neural crest migration. Neural crest cells entered both the rostral and caudal halves of the sclerotome with mean rates of migration ranging from 6 to 13 µm/hour. These results suggest that peanut agglutinin-binding molecules are required for the segmental patterning of trunk neural crest migration. Because this approach permits neural crest migration to be both observed and perturbed, it offers the promise of more direct assays of the factors that influence neural crest development...|$|R
