5|$|Construction of Evstafi {{began on}} 13 July 1904, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 23 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 3 November 1906. <b>Fitting-out,</b> however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War and she was not completed until 28 May 1911.

5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and {{built at the}} AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 4. Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 5 May 1913. At her launching ceremony, Prince Oskar of Prussia christened the ship. Due to the heightening political tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the final construction work was accelerated, so {{the first set of}} dockyard trials were conducted on 15 July, and <b>fitting-out</b> work was completed by the 30th, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. Grosser Kurfürst cost the Imperial German Government 45 million Goldmarks.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the Russian Navy sought {{builders}} {{for a pair}} {{of light}} cruisers; the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig won the contract. The two ships were originally ordered by the Russian Navy as Maraviev Amurskyy and Admiral Nevelskoy from the Schichau-Werke that year. The two ships were laid down in 1913; Maraviev Amurskyy was launched on 11 April 1914, after which <b>fitting-out</b> work commenced.

The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company. The two navies agreed that Germany would be responsible for naval escort, which included destroyers and smaller vessels. Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation. Feige then led an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship.|$|E
