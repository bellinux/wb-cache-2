500|$|When the Kilmers' {{daughter}} Rose (1912–1917) was {{stricken with}} poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, {{they turned to}} their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Father James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Roman Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters Kilmer writes that he [...] "believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time," [...] and he [...] "wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith." [...] Kilmer would stop [...] "every morning for months" [...] on his way [...] "to the office and prayed for faith," [...] claiming that when [...] "faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think <b>her</b> <b>tiny</b> feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and {{it gives me a}} selfish pleasure to write it down." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2015, Chopra {{starred in}} Zoya Akhtar's Dil Dhadakne Do, an {{ensemble}} comedy-drama alongside Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, [...] Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar. The film {{tells the story}} of a dysfunctional Punjabi family (the Mehras), who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary. She portrayed the role of Ayesha Mehra, a successful entrepreneur and the eldest child. Both the film and her performance attracted positive reviews. Pratim D. Gupta from The Telegraph considered Chopra to be one of the winners of the film and wrote [...] "From the propah body language to the measured speech [...] shows the kind of depth she is able to bring to her lines and characters these days. Rajiv Vijayakar of India-West wrote, [...] "Topping the [...] is the nuanced, magnificent work of Priyanka Chopra as Ayesha. <b>Her</b> <b>tiny</b> expressions and nuances, as well as her vocal inflections truly bring her character alive." [...] The cast of Dil Dhadakne Do won the Screen Award for Best Ensemble Cast, and Chopra was nominated for a Screen Award, IIFA Award, and Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress.|$|E

She was quickly rescued from temporary refugee accommodation, having met an old English friend who had an [...] "absurdly grandiose" [...] flat in the city and invited her to keep house for him. She and Cowan amicably went their separate ways, and she moved into the grand flat. She engaged a cook, Kyriacou, a Greek refugee, whose eccentricities (sketched in a chapter of Is There a Nutmeg in the House?) did not prevent him from producing magnificent food: [...] "The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten." [...] In 1942 she caught an infection that affected her feet. She spent some weeks in hospital and felt obliged to give up her job in the cipher office. She then moved to Cairo, where she was asked to set up and run a reference library for the British Ministry of Information. The library was open to everyone and was much in demand by journalists and other writers. Her circle of friends in this period included Alan Moorehead, Freya Stark, Bernard Spencer, Patrick Kinross, Olivia Manning and Lawrence Durrell.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Julia Seaton, a rich heiress, has two suitors, Dr. John Seymour, a wealthy physician, and Richard Calhoun, a poor lawyer. They both propose in the same evening, but while inclined to prefer John, Julia has not yet made a definite choice, and tells both {{to come back in}} a month for their answer. The scene shifts to the squalid home of the charwoman, Mrs. Smith, who, ill in bed and unable to earn the rent money, is about to be evicted with <b>her</b> <b>tiny</b> daughter May. The mother faints from weakness, and May rushes for a doctor. She sees Seymour's sign in a window, and asks him to help her mother. Then the man shows his caliber. Because she has no money, he turns her away. Calhoun, the lawyer, meets May, learns of her plight, and, although poor, pays the overdue rent, and the family moved back in the house. But the privation she has suffered proved fatal to the mother and tiny May is left an orphan. On her death bed, Mrs. Smith is found by Miss Seaton, who is visiting the poor quarters on charity work, and on the charwoman's passing, society girl adopts poor little May. The child becomes a happy member of the Seaton family {{and at the end of}} the month is a fast friend of the kind-hearted Julia. At the end of a month, too, Julia prepares to decide who shall be her life partner, as promised. But it is little May who really decides. At sight of Seymour, she recalls the physician who turned her away, and denounces him to his own and Miss Julia's face. May recognizes Calhoun as the friend in need, and tells Miss Julia so. The latter feels that Calhoun is a real man and would make a splendid husband, so it's a cinch that 'the best man wins.'" ...|$|E

But this is the Nicky Silver edition of such a play; the expected things happen here, but happen quite differently ... Lavin's performance might be what holds these contradictory elements in perfect balance. Blessed with the magic power to make every moment onstage embody truth, she's a purveyor of gigantic nuances, comic or tragic as needed: <b>Her</b> <b>tiniest</b> gestures seem epic; her minutest shifts of vocal tone ring out grandly." ...|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 13, 1910. It states: [...] "The story centers on Harry Willard, a plodding farmer. A city gentleman promises Harry's frivolous wife a life of ease and luxury - {{and it is the}} old, old story. She takes <b>her</b> <b>tiny</b> daughter, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note announcing the fact for Harry. The young farmer, who loves his wife and child with an all-consuming love, loses his reason as he reads the announcement of his betrayal. Although without the bare means for his subsistence, he searches for days for his loved ones. Eventually the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he comes out of it all a maniac. His wrath takes the form of an aversion to all mankind. He wants to forget the world that has treated him so ill - he decides to become a hermit and betakes himself to a desolate cave, where he spends the years execrating humanity. A quarter century goes by. Rarely in that time does he venture on beaten paths for fear that he may meet a hated human, but one day he forgets his resolve long enough to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clatter of hooves and sights a horse tearing toward him with a swaying carriage and screaming occupants - runaway! As the carriage passes by him, a woman flings a bundle to him; he catches it and finds it a pink and white bit of humanity. Dazed he runs into the wilderness with a baby and makes for his cave. Arrived at the cave the maniac resolves to even his score with society by taking the babe's life. But his eyes light on the baby's locket and his hand is stayed. For the locket bears a picture of the child of the wife who betrayed him!" ...|$|E

2500|$|By late 1932, Rădulescu was in {{correspondence}} with N. Crevedia, an admirer and like-minded humorist-writer, who visited {{her at her}} second home in Pitești. Crevedia may have also acted as her literary agent, arranging the text for print, and instructing her on how to polish her style. Reportedly, Rădulescu was taking courses at the literature and philosophy faculties of Bucharest University, but did not graduate. She began writing her self-styled [...] "fantasy reportage pieces", collectively grouped as Sunt studentă! ("I Am a Student!"). According to Pavel Dan, the pieces included here were too self-referential, even [...] "surfeited": [...] " [...] writes {{about the fact that}} she is now an author. Of course, this fact unsettles the entire universe.

2500|$|Like her godmother, Consuelo Vanderbilt {{attracted}} numerous title-bearing suitors {{anxious to}} trade social position for cash. Her mother reportedly {{received at least}} five proposals for her hand. Consuelo was allowed to consider the proposal of {{just one of the}} men, Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg, but she developed an instant aversion to him. None of the others, however, was good enough for Alva Vanderbilt, herself the daughter of a cotton factor. Consuelo Vanderbilt was a great beauty, with a face compelling enough to cause the playwright Sir James Barrie, author of Peter Pan, to write, [...] "I would stand all day in the street to see Consuelo Marlborough get into her carriage." [...] Oxford undergraduate Guy Fortescue later described how he and his friends were captivated by her [...] "piquante oval face perched upon a long slender neck, her enormous dark eyes fringed with curling lashes, her dimples, and <b>her</b> <b>tiny</b> teeth when she smiled."
