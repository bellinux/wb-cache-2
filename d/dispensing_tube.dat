40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} the effects of protease inhibitors and holding times and temperatures before processing on the stability of substance P in bovine blood samples. Samples—Blood samples obtained from a healthy 6 -month-old calf. Procedures—Blood samples were <b>dispensed</b> into <b>tubes</b> containing exogenous substance P and 1 of 6 degradative enzyme inhibitor treatments: heparin, EDTA, EDTA with 1 of 2 concentrations of aprotinin, or EDTA with 1 of 2 concentrations of a commercially available protease inhibitor cocktail. Plasma was harvested immediately following collection or after 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours of holding at ambient (20. 3 ° to 25. 4 °C) or ice bath temperatures. Total substance P immunoreactivity was determined with an ELISA; concentrations of the substance P parent molecule, a metabolite composed of the 9 terminal amino acids, and a metabolite composed of the 5 terminal amino acids were determined with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results—Regarding blood samples processed immediately, no significant differences in substance P concentrations or immunoreactivity were detected among enzyme inhibitor treatments. In blood samples processed at 1 hour of holding, substance P parent molecule concentration was significantly lower for ambient temperature versus ice bath temperature holding conditions; aprotinin was the most effective inhibitor of substance P degradation at the ice bath temperature. The ELISA substance P immunoreactivity was typically lower for blood samples with heparin versus samples with other inhibitors processed at 1 hour of holding in either temperature condition.

40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of esculin in {{the presence}} of bile has been utilized for many years for the identification of bacteria. It is especially useful in differentiating species of the genus Streptococcus. The procedure is a two-step one. First, the bacterium must grow in a particular concentration of bile, and second, it must hydrolyze esculin. The hydrolysis of esculin has traditionally been determined by the brown-black color that results when one of the hydrolysate products, esculetin, reacts with iron in the medium. The procedure requires incubation for 24 h or more. A method was developed based on the measurement of constitutive beta-glucosidase (esculinase) with the repression of this enzyme by bile equivalent (sodium desoxycholate) that required only 30 min. p-Nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was the esculinase substrate, and sodium desoxycholate was substituted for bile salts. After inoculation, a yellow color was equivalent to the brown-black seen in the 40 % bile-esculin reaction. The reagent was <b>dispensed</b> in test <b>tubes</b> and was stable for 6 months.

Recently, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay has been proposed as a new generation of QFT-GIT. QFT-Plus includes two tubes, TB 1 and TB 2 with Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens to elicit a specific immune response. TB 1 contains peptides derived from the antigens 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT- 6) and 10 kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP- 10) (TB- 7. 7, present in QFT-GIT, has been removed), and it is {{designed to}} induce a specific CD 4 T-cell response.

40|$|Okra (Abelmuschus esculentus (L) Moench.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular crops within the Malvaceae family of plants. It is a common {{vegetable}} eminently cultivated in regions experiencing constraints to manage climate change. In South Africa climate change coupled with aluminium-enriched soils are responsible to drawbacks crop performance. Therefore, it is worthwhile to whether okra will thrive as an alternative crop in the country. Many studies have identified potential of okra to improve yields of resource poor farmers in Africa. The physiological responses of okra seed to variations in aluminium ions and temperature were not determined. Therefore, a study with okra, cv. Clemson Spineless, seed coated and uncoated with B. subtilis, was initiated to assess germination on moist filter paper in 90 mm diameter Petri plates. Germination medium consisted of various concentrations of aluminium chloride (AlCl 3), 0 M, 0. 001 M, 0. 01 M, 0. 05 M and 0. 1 M. Each aluminium treatment was allocated into incubators adjusted to 22 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C temperatures. This resulted into a 5 x 3 x 2 factorial experiment with five replicates and was conducted in three cycles. Daily scores of germinated seeds were assessed from the second to the fifth day after initiation of germination. During termination, five days after the initiation of the experiment 10 seeds with the longest coleoptiles had their coleoptiles measured using a digital caliper. At the fifth day after initiation of the experiment, coleoptile lengths from 10 seeds per treatment were measured using digital caliper. A total of 50 plates (10 from 37 °C in Cycle 1; 30 from 22 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C from Cycle 2; 10 from 37 °C in Cycle 3), were selected and germinated were ground and stored at - 20 °C before 1 H NMR analysis. Metabolites were extracted from 50 mg ground seed material with 750 μL methanol-D 4 and 750 μL buffer (deuterium oxide + potassium dihydrogen phosphate). The mixture was vortexed for three minutes, sonicated for 20 minutes, centrifuged at 18000 rpms for 20 minutes and the supernatant filtered through cotton wool. Then the supernatant was <b>dispensed</b> into NMR <b>tubes</b> for further 1 H NMR spectroscopic processing using a 600 MHz NMR xiii Varian spectrometer to generate magnetic spectra of the fifty samples. Results of this study demonstrated that in all the experimental cycles, regardless of aluminium concentration and bacterial seed coating, 37 °C inhibited germination percentages and coleoptile lengths in okra seed germination. Germination percentages and coleoptile lengths of bacteria-coated seeds growing in 25 °C were most stimulated at all aluminium concentrations, but not at 0. 1 M. In this temperature germination percentages and coleoptile lengths were highly influenced by the interaction of aluminium concentrations and bacterial coating, respectively. 1 H NMR metabolomic association showed no distinct grouping, but clusters across treatments showed to be linked through a subset of metabolites amongst aluminium concentrations, bacterial seed coating and temperatures, respectively. This infers that treatment variations in both seed and bacterial physiological responses were associated through shared metabolic pathways.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the culture media used in the {{presumptive}} diagnosis of suspiciuous colonies from plates inoculated with stools for isolation of enteric organisms do not always correctly indicate the major groups of enterobacteria. In an effort to obtain a medium affording more exact indications, several media (1 - 9) have been tested. Modifications of some of these media have also been tested with the result that a satisfactory modification of Monteverde's medium was finaly selected. This proved to be most satisfactory, affording, as a result of only one inoculation, a complete series of basic indications. The modification involves changes in the formula, in the method of preparation and in the manner of storage. The formulae are: A. Thymol blue indicator: NaOH 0. 1 /N [...] 34. 4 ml; Thymol blue [...] 1. 6 g; Water [...] 65. 6 ml. B. Andrade's indicator. C. Urea and sugar solution: Urea [...] . 20 g; Lactose [...] . 30 g; Sucrose [...] . 30 g; Water [...] 100 ml. The mixture (C.) should be warmed slightly in order to dissolve the ingredients rapidly. Sterilise by filtration (Seitz). Keep stock in refrigeratior. The modification of Monteverde's medium is prepared in two parts. Semi-solid part - Peptone (Difco) 2. 0 g; NaCl 0. 5 g; Agar 0. 5 g; Water 100. 0 ml. Boil to dissolve the ingredients. Adjust pH with NaOH to 7. 3 - 7. 4. Boil again for precipitation. Filter through cotton. Ad indicators "A" 0. 3 ml and "B" 1. 0 ml. Sterilise in autoclave 115 ºC, 15 minutes in amounts not higher than 200 ml. Just before using, add solution "C" asseptically in amounts of 10 ml to 200 ml of the melted semi-solid medium, maintained at 48 - 50 ºC. Solid part - Peptone (Difco) 1. 5 g; Trypticase (BBL) 0. 5 g; Agar 2. 0 g; Water 100, 00 ml. Boil to dissolve the ingredients. Adjust pH with NaOH to 7. 3 - 7. 4. Boils again. Filter through cotton. Add indicators "A" 0. 3 ml and "B" 1. 0 ml; ferrous ammonium sulfate 0. 02 g; sodiun thiosulfate 0. 02 g. Sterilise in autoclave 115 ºC, 15 minutes in amounts not higher than 200 ml. Just before using, add solution "C" asseptically in amounts of 10 ml to 200 ml of the melted solid medium, maintained at 48 - 50 ºC. Final medium - The semi-solid part is <b>dispensed</b> first (<b>tubes</b> about 12 x 120 mm) in 2. 5 ml amounts and left to harden at room temperature, in vertical position. The solid part is dispensed over the hardened semi-solid one in amounts from 2. 0 ml to 2. 5 ml and left to harden in slant position, affording a butt of 12 to 15 mm. The tubes of medium should be subjected to a sterility test in the incubator, overnight. Tubes showing spontaneous gas bubbles (air) should then be discarded. The medium should be stored in the incubator (37 ºC), for not more than 2 to 4 days. Storage of the tubes in the ice-box produces the absorption of air which is released as bubbles when the tubes are incubated at 37 ºC after inoculation. This fact confirmed the observation of ARCHAMBAULT & McCRADY (10) who worked with liquid media and the aplication of their observation was found to be essential to the proper working conditions of this double-layer medium. Inoculation - The inoculation is made by means of a long straight needle, as is usually done on the triple sugar, but the needel should penetrate only to about half of the height of the semi-solid column. Indol detection - After inoculation, a strip of sterelized filter papaer previously moistened with Ehrlich's reagent, is suspended above the surface of the medium, being held between the cotton plug and the tube. Indications given - In addition to providing a mass of organisms on the slant for serological invetigations, the medium gives the following indications: 1. Acid from lactose and/or sucrose (red, of yellowsh with strains which reduce the indicators). 2. Gas from lactose and/or sucrose (bubbles). 3. H[2]S production, observed on the solid part (black). 4. Motility observed on the semi-solid part (tubidity). 5. Urease production, observed on solid and semi-solid parts (blue). 6. Indol production, observed on the strip of filter paper (red or purplish). Indol production is not observed with indol positive strains which rapidly acidify the surface o the slant, and the use of oxalic acid has proved to give less sensitive reaction (11). Reading of results - In most cases overnight incubation is enough; sometimes the reactions appear within only a few hours of incubation, affording a definitive orientation of the diagnosis. With some cultures it is necessary to observe the medium during 48 hours of incubation. A description showing typical differential reaction follows: Salmonella: Color of the medium unchanged, with blackening of the solid part when H[2]S is positive. The slant tends to alkalinity (greenish of bluish). Gas always absent. Indol negative. Motility positive or negative. Shigella: Color of the medium unchanged at the beginning of incubation period, but acquiring a red color when the strain is late lactose/sucrose positive. Slant tending to alkalinity (greenish or purplish). Indol positive or negative. Motility, gas and H[2]S always negative. Proteus: Color of the medium generally changes entirely to blue or sometimes to green (urease positive delayed), with blackening of solid part when H[2]S is positive. Motility positive of negative. Indol positive. Gas positive or negative. The strains which attack rapidly sucrose may give a yellow-greenish color to the medium. Sometimes the intense blue color of the medium renders difficult the reading of the H[2]S production. Escherichiae and Klebsiellae: Color of the medium red or yellow (acid) with great and rapid production of gas. Motility positive or negative. Indol generally impossible to observe. Paracoli: Those lactose of sucrose positive give the same reaction as Esherichia. Those lactose or sucrose negatives give the same reactions as Salmonellae. Sometimes indol positive and H[2]S negative. Pseudomonas: Color of the medium unchanged. The slant tends to alkalinity. It is impossible to observe motility because there is no growth in the bottom. Alkaligenes: Color of the medium unchanged. The slant tends to alkalinity. The medium does not alter the antigenic properties of the strains and with the mass of organisms on the slant we can make the serologic diagnosis. It is admitted that this medium is somewhat more laborious to prepare than others used for similar purposes. Nevertheless it can give informations generally obtained by two or three other media. Its use represents much saving in time, labor and material, and we suggest it for routine laboratory work in which a quick presumptive preliminary grouping of enteric organisms is needed...|$|R
