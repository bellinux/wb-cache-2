40|$|Background Soil-transmitted {{helminthiasis}} (STH) is {{an important}} public health problem in Indonesia. Objective To find out factors influencing the transmission of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> two different communities in North Sumatera, Indonesia. Methods A cross sectional study was done on 96 primary school children in Suka village (located on a mountain area) and 96 pri- mary school children in Pantai Cermin village (a coastal area). Sub- jects were recruited by simple random sampling. Kato Katz and centrifuge floatation methods were used for stool and soil exami- nations, respectively. Data were collected by interviewing parents of children using a questionnaire and were analyzed using chi– square test by SPSS program version 11. 0. Results There {{was no difference in}} the prevalence of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> both villages (p> 0. 05). Parents’ knowledge and economic status had significant relationships with the prevalence of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> Suka vil- lage (p 0. 05). In both villages, parents’ education did not have a significant relation with STH, while there were significant relations between STH and hygiene, environment, or soil contamination by worm eggs (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STh) {{is a small}} {{subcortical}} structure which is involved in regulating motor as well as cognitive functions. Due to its small size and close proximity to other small subcortical structures, {{it has been a}} challenge to localize and visualize it using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Currently there are several standard atlases available that are used to localize the <b>STh</b> <b>in</b> functional MRI studies and clinical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an increasingly common neurosurgical procedure that has been successfully used to alleviate motor symptoms present in Parkinson's disease. However, current atlases are based on low sample sizes and restricted age ranges (Schaltenbrand and Wahren, 1977), and hence the use of these atlases effectively ignores the substantial structural brain changes that are associated with aging. In the present study, ultra-high field 7 tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans was used to visualize and segment the <b>STh</b> <b>in</b> young, middle-aged, and elderly participants. The resulting probabilistic atlas maps for all age groups show that the <b>STh</b> shifts <b>in</b> the lateral direction with increasing age. In sum, {{the results of the present}} study suggest that age has to be taken into account in atlases for the optimal localization of the <b>STh</b> <b>in</b> healthy and diseased brains...|$|R

40|$|Background. School age {{children}} {{are at high}} risk of soil-transmitted helminth (<b>STH)</b> worldwide. <b>In</b> Kenya, <b>STH</b> infections <b>in</b> children remain high despite the periodic administration of anthelmintic drugs. Our study assessed the prevalence and intensity of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> primary school-aged children in Kakamega County, western Kenya. Methodology. We carried out a cross-sectional study on a population of 731 children attending 7 primary schools in March 2014. Children aged 4 – 16 years were examined for STH by the quantitative Kato-Katz technique. Infection intensities were expressed as eggs per gram (epg) of faeces. Findings. Among 731 school children examined for STH, 44. 05 % were infected. Highest prevalence of <b>STH</b> was <b>in</b> Shitaho primary school where 107 participants were examined and 62. 6 % were infected with mean intensity of 11667 [*]epg.

Methods: Children randomly selected from urban and rural schools in Southern Belize provided one stool sample each, analysed by the Kato-Katz method to assess {{prevalence and}} intensity of STH infections. Epi Info software was used for data analysis; Chi-square test and Fischer exact test were applied to compare group proportions; P< 0. 05 was considered of statistical significance; descriptive statistics were expressed as percentages. Results: A total of 500 children from 10 schools participated in the study from May to December 2005. Prevalence of STH ranged between 40 % and 82 % among schools, with a median of 59. 2 %; the majority of light intensity, and with 2. 2 % high intensity infection. Trichuris and Ascaris infections presented similar frequency in children aged from 6 to 9 years old; hookworm infections tended to be more frequent in the older group 10 to 12 years old. Statistical significances (P≤ 0. 01) were found in children in rural schools infected with any species of <b>STH,</b> <b>in</b> moderate Trichuris infections, in hookworm infections in rural areas with strong Mayan presence and in Ascaris infections in children of Mayan origin.

40|$|Background: The Kato-Katz thick smear (Kato-Katz) is the {{diagnostic}} method recommended for monitoring large-scale treatment programs implemented {{for the control}} of soil-transmitted helminths (<b>STH)</b> <b>in</b> public health, yet {{it is difficult to}} standardize. A promising alternative is the McMaster egg counting method (McMaster), commonly used in veterinary parasitology, but rarely so for the detection of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> human stool. Methodology/Principal Findings: The Kato-Katz and McMaster methods were compared for the detection of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> 1, 543 subjects resident in five countries across Africa, Asia and South America. The consistency of the performance of both methods in different trials, the validity of the fixed multiplication factor employed in the Kato-Katz method and the accuracy of these methods for estimating 'true' drug efficacies were assessed. The Kato-Katz method detected significantly more Ascaris lumbricoides infections (88. 1 % vs. 75. 6 %, p 0. 32) in FEC between both methods, and indicated no significant difference in FEC, except for A. lumbricoides, where the Kato-Katz resulted in significantly higher FEC (14, 197 eggs per gram of stool (EPG) vs. 5, 982 EPG). For the Kato-Katz, the fixed multiplication factor resulted in significantly higher FEC than the multiplication factor adjusted for mass of feces examined for A. lumbricoides (16, 538 EPG vs. 15, 396 EPG) and T. trichiura (1, 490 EPG vs. 1, 363 EPG), but not for hookworm. The McMaster provided more accurate efficacy results (absolute difference to 'true' drug efficacy: 1. 7 % vs. 4. 5 %). Conclusions/Significance: The McMaster is an alternative method for monitoring large-scale treatment programs. It is a robust (accurate multiplication factor) and accurate (reliable efficacy results) method, which can be easily standardized...|$|R

40|$|The {{acceleration}} of the control of soil-transmitted helminth (<b>STH)</b> infections <b>in</b> Nigeria, emphasizing preventive chemotherapy, has become imperative {{in light of the}} global fight against neglected tropical diseases. Predictive risk maps are an important tool to guide and support control activities. STH infection prevalence data were obtained from surveys carried out in 2011 using standard protocols. Data were geo-referenced and collated in a nationwide, geographic information system database. Bayesian geostatistical models with remotely sensed environmental covariates and variable selection procedures were utilized to predict the spatial distribution of <b>STH</b> infections <b>in</b> Nigeria. We found that hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura infections are endemic in 482 (86. 8 %), 305 (55. 0 %), and 55 (9. 9 %) locations, respectively. Hookworm and A. lumbricoides infection co-exist in 16 states, while the three species are co-endemic in 12 states. Overall, <b>STHs</b> are endemic <b>in</b> 20 of the 36 states of Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. The observed prevalence at endemic locations ranged from 1. 7 % to 51. 7 % for hookworm, from 1. 6 % to 77. 8 % for A. lumbricoides, and from 1. 0 % to 25. 5 % for T. trichiura. Model-based predictions ranged from 0. 7 % to 51. 0 % for hookworm, from 0. 1 % to 82. 6 % for A. lumbricoides, and from 0. 0 % to 18. 5 % for T. trichiura. Our models suggest that day land surface temperature and dense vegetation are important predictors of the spatial distribution of <b>STH</b> infection <b>in</b> Nigeria. In 2011, a total of 5. 7 million (13. 8 %) school-aged children were predicted to be infected with <b>STHs</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. Mass treatment at the local government area level for annual or bi-annual treatment of the school-aged population in Nigeria in 2011, based on World Health Organization prevalence thresholds, were estimated at 10. 2 million tablets.

40|$|Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) {{cause some}} of the most {{prevalent}} infections worldwide, and are fundamentally associated with poor sanitation and hygiene conditions. The worm eggs require soil to develop into infectious stages, and soil contamination is thus the link between sanitation and infection. Children are particularly susceptible to <b>STHs.</b> <b>In</b> theory, {{it is likely that the}} sanitation, hygiene and soil contamination of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> schools would be associated with the level of infection among the learners. This is however a severely neglected area of research, where the few studies conducted only to a limited extent have succeeded in providing evidence for an association. The Ugu District of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, is highly burdened with helminthiasis. It is a suggested study area as it already has data of the learners level of infection available. This project sought to develop an approach for research of the association between toilet and hand washing facilities in primary schools and infection with A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura among the learners.

Examination of soil can be used to estimate the risk of <b>STH</b> infection <b>in</b> humans. We carried out this survey to clarify the current status of soil contamination by parasite eggs and to assess the risk of STH infection. During survey periods, we examined soil, faeces, and the lifestyle of residents. Six genera and eight species of parasite eggs including Ascaris lumbricoides, Toxocara cati, Toxocara canis, and Trichuris trichiura were recovered from 85 out of 120 soil samples (71 %). Contamination of soil by parasite eggs had spread widely throughout the village, and 50 % of eggs recovered had already developed into fertilized eggs. It is remarkable that Ascaris eggs were recovered from inside the houses. Prevalence of <b>STH</b> <b>in</b> school children was 63 %. This may indicate that school or preschool children cause soil contamination. Some of the eggs recovered were not only from humans but also from dogs and cats. From the results obtained, the need for health education with regards to zoonoses was revealed because 77 % of fertilized Toxocara spp. eggs were detected.

40|$|Globally, about 1. 5 {{billion people}} are {{infected}} {{with at least one}} species of soil-transmitted helminth (STH). Soil is a critical environmental reservoir of STH, yet there is no standard method for detecting <b>STH</b> eggs <b>in</b> soil. We developed a field method for enumerating <b>STH</b> eggs <b>in</b> soil and tested the method in Bangladesh and Kenya. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method for enumerating Ascaris eggs in biosolids was modified through a series of recovery efficiency experiments; we seeded soil samples with a known number of Ascaris suum eggs and assessed the effect of protocol modifications on egg recovery. We found the use of 1 % 7 X as a surfactant compared to 0. 1 % Tween 80 significantly improved recovery efficiency (two-sided t-test, t = 5. 03, p = 0. 007) while other protocol modifications-including different agitation and flotation methods-did not have a significant impact. Soil texture affected the egg recovery efficiency; sandy samples resulted in higher recovery compared to loamy samples processed using the same method (two-sided t-test, t = 2. 56, p = 0. 083). We documented a recovery efficiency of 73 % for the final improved method using loamy soil in the lab. To field test the improved method, we processed soil samples from 100 households in Bangladesh and 100 households in Kenya from June to November 2015. The prevalence of any STH (Ascaris, Trichuris or hookworm) egg in soil was 78 % in Bangladesh and 37 % in Kenya.

40|$|International audienceTo {{study the}} folding of human Escherichia coli {{heat-stable}} enterotoxin STh, {{we used the}} major protein subunit of CS 31 A fimbriae (ClpG) as a marker of STh secretion and a provider of a signal peptide. We established that STh genetically fused to the N or C terminus of ClpG was able to mobilize ClpG to the culture supernatant while still retaining full enterotoxicity. These features indicate that the STh activity was not altered by the chimeric structure and suggest that spatial conformation of <b>STh</b> <b>in</b> the fusion is close {{to that of the}} native toxin, thus permitting recognition and activation of the intestinal <b>STh</b> receptor <b>in</b> vivo. In contrast to other studies, we showed that disulfide bond formation did not occur in the periplasm through the DsbA pathway {{and that there was no}} correlation between DsbA and secretion, folding, or activity. This discrepancy was not attributable to the chimeric nature of STh since there was no effect of dsbA or dsbB mutations on secretion and activity of recombinant STh from which ClpG had been deleted. Periplasmic and lysate fractions of dsbA(+) and dsbA(-) cells did not have any <b>STh</b> activity. <b>In</b> addition, the <b>STh</b> chimera was exclusively found in an inactive reduced form intracellularly and in an active oxidized form extracellularly, irrespective of the dsbA background. Subsequently, a time course experiment in regard to the secretion of STh from both dsbA(+) and dsbA(-) cells indicated that the enterotoxin activity (proper folding) in the extracellular milieu increased with time.

In fact it {{is the leading cause}} of anaemia and protein deficiency in developing nations, affected an estimated 740 million people. N. americanus is the more common hookworm, while A. duodenale is more geographically restricted. Unlike other <b>STHs,</b> <b>in</b> which school-age children are most affected, high-intensity hookworm infections are more frequent in adults, specifically women. Roughly, 44 million pregnant women are estimated to be infected. The disease causes severe adverse effects in both the mother and infant, such as low birth weight, impaired milk production, and increased risk of mortality.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{randomized}} open-label trial, including 834 pregnant women, examined {{efficacy and}} recorded adverse events of ivermectin (ivc) and albendazole (alb) alone and combined (comb) on soil-transmitted helminth infections (<b>STHs)</b> <b>in</b> the second trimester of pregnancy. One abortion {{occurred in the}} alb group and 10 stillbirths (1, 5, 3, and 1) in the ivc, alb, comb, and the reference group (ref) with no STHs, respectively. Two babies were born with congenital abnormalities (1 [ivc] and 1 [ref]). The prevalence of anemia at first antenatal care (ANC) visit was 20. 6 % (23. 7 % [ivc], 21. 1 % [alb], 22. 2 % [comb], and 16. 1 % [ref]). Anemia was reduced to 8. 5 % at 36 weeks of gestation with 10. 9 % (ivc) ...|$|R
