Over {{the last}} two decades a large number of {{countries}} worldwide have adopted a gender quota to increase women’s political representation in the legislature. While quotas are designed to improve women’s representation in legislative positions, it is unclear if electing more women to legislative office is sufficient to accomplish institutional incorporation. Once women are elected to office, are they being incorporated into the legislative body and gaining their own political power, or are they being marginalized? Using an original data set that tracks committee appointments in the twenty-two Argentine legislative chambers over an eighteen-year period (from 1992 - 2009), I evaluate the extent to which women have access to powerful committee appoint-ments –beyond traditional women’s <b>domains</b> <b>committees</b> – and how women’s access to committee appoint-ments changes over time. I hypothesize that while women may initially be sidelined, as they gain more experi-ence in the legislature they may overcome institutional barriers and develop institutional knowledge that will better equip them to work within the system to gain access to valuable committee appointments...|$|R
40|$|Welcome to the December {{issue of}} EBLIP, the final issue {{of my first}} year as Editor-in-Chief. A year which I have {{thoroughly}} enjoyed and one where the fears over what to write in my editorials haven’t materialised. This quarter, ethics has featured quite heavily in my working life so I decided to make this {{the topic of the}} editorial, sharing some of my thoughts regarding evidence, ethics and how ethical principles are implemented within the EBLIP journal. Ethics are “principles of conduct or standards of behaviour governing an individual or profession” (Library and Information Science Editorial Committee, 2010), and as individuals or professionals we may be governed by various ethical codes. As I'm sure you know, EBLIP originated in the health domain, where ethical values and ethical research feature strongly. Indeed, by its formal definition, research cannot take place unless “ethical approval” from an appropriate committee has been granted. The practicalities of taking research through the ethical approval process can often be time consuming, and those involved in research need to bear this in mind when planning a project. Each committee will have a slightly different form and process (which can add to the frustration of the researcher), but basically will make their decision to approve on the basis that the research includes obtaining informed consent from participants (i. e., participants know what the research is about and what their involvement will mean); that the research will not cause harm to participants; that confidentiality will be maintained; and that the research undertaken is methodologically rigorous and worthwhile. Preparing a proposal for ethical approval, whilst time consuming, makes the researcher think about all aspects of the research and how {{it is going to be}} operationalized, which can save lots of time and effort in the long run and may well also improve the research design. These principles are the same whatever discipline the research takes place in, and should be something that we are aware of as consumers of evidence. Within LIS in the UK, ethical principles have been put to the fore within a new professional framework (CILIP Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, 2012 a). The framework outlines the broad range of skills required by workers across the LIS profession, placing these on a wheel with ethics and values in the centre, as they underpin the profession. Placing ethics and values at the core in this way helps us set our knowledge into a wider context and, I believe, is one of the ways that we can make a difference as LIS professionals. At the same time, our ethical values and principles help to differentiate us from other professions and help to define what we do as LIS professionals. These ethical principles are outlined in a code (CILIP Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, 2012 b), which sets out professional responsibilities in relation to users, colleagues, and the information community and society. The elements which are particularly relevant to EBLIP, and which are espoused in the scope and mission of the journal, include maintaining and enhancing professional knowledge and competence, sharing results of research and development, encouraging best practice, and promoting equitable access to information. There are also ethical codes of practice for journal editors, these include one for LIS editors (Library and Information Science Editorial Committee, 2010) and a more general one which originated in the medical and health <b>domain</b> (<b>Committee</b> on Publication Ethics: COPE, 2011). Both of these guide journal editors in relating to readers, authors, reviewers, and publishers, and both seek to establish best practice for journal publishing. For the EBLIP journal, these codes of practice provide a useful framework for ensuring the journal operates in a professional and ethical way. A recent example where the codes have been used in EBLIP is in dealing with a submission from one of the editorial team (Koufogiannakis, 2012). Strong ethical principles have been at the heart of the EBLIP journal since its inception, but decision making is quite informal and based on the agreement of the editorial team members who meet monthly and communicate regularly by email. In keeping with our informal decision making structure the editorial team discussed how to deal with the submission by an editorial team member and decided that it should be treated in exactly the same way as any other submission (i. e., subject to double blind peer review and would need to adhere to the decision of the appropriate editor). To do this we also needed to adjust the Open Journal System, so that the submitting editor did not have access to the area where submissions and reviews are stored. In line with the COPE code (2011), we then made this procedure explicit on our web site ([URL] as well as documenting the decision on our internal wiki. As the journal grows and develops, it is important that our decision making and principles maintain consistency and are made explicit. We also need to plan for the future and ensure that the journal is open to as wide a range of people as possible. To this end all our positions are advertised widely, and each application is reviewed by at least two members of the team. Terms of office and a policy for succession planning have also been established. The criteria and policies are stored on a wiki, which hosts a wide range of guidelines, procedures, and documents and is used by all members of the editorial team. As the team grows and similar issues are faced by new members of the editorial team, we have a reference point, policy, or guide to ensure that the decisions made are consistent. As appropriate these can be reflected in the policies which are stated on the journal website and are available to all our users. In this way, we hope that the journal maintains its strong professional and ethical ethos and continues to ensure that the best available evidence about LIS research is made available to help practitioners in their decision making...|$|E

From this perspective, we {{characterize}} the challenges SEOs may face in this area and show that the situation can be much improved by following proper knowledge management practices. In response to these challenges and considering the various software development activities in this area, we propose a Collaborative Knowledge Management Framework (CKMF). The framework has four components: data model, knowledge management database, constraints, and management committee. Data model has three layers and is the central knowledge repository and acts as knowledge transfer media. Knowledge management database stores and manages information about concepts and relationships captured in the data model layers. It can also support version management. Constraints encode the semantic integrity of the application <b>domain.</b> Managing <b>committee</b> is an elected body or committee in charge of defining and enforcing constraints and version management. Deploying the proposed framework, we can better identify, preserve, and institutionalize the knowledge possessed by the software developers.

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform collegial {{governance}} is a cornerstone of modern universities in the United States and Canada. This idea of governance is well practiced among faculty members but is not often practiced {{to the same extent}} with librarians in those same institutions. In this chapter, I will look at a popular form of collegial governance called the Library Council. Further, I will examine how the Library Council at Brock University has enabled librarians there to perform meaningful collegial self-governance. Collegial Governance & the Library Council Most, if not all, universities and colleges in North America practice some form of collegial self-governance. This is often instantiated though the development of various committee structures that serve to govern the academic function of the institution. In the case of the lives of traditional faculty members, this can include a departmental committee governed by a departmental chair, a faculty committee governed by a dean, or a committee matched to an appropriate organizational unit chaired by an administrator. In cases of unionized work environments these structures are almost always codified in collective agreements and are the result of collective bargaining between the institution’s faculty association and its Administration. The basic concept behind collegial governance is that the fundamental functions of the academic institution are split into a bicameral division where the management function of the institution rests {{in the hands of the}} Administration, while matters involving the academic function fall in the hands of the faculty. For considerations that overlap between the two <b>domains,</b> joint <b>committees</b> are struck. The tradition of bicameralism traces its origins to British universities in the late 19 th century and expanded to North America. As pointed out by Andrew M.

40|$|The annular-return {{flow and}} {{the utility of}} small-scale, combustion-based {{actuators}} for its control are investigated experimentally. The annular return flow is generated by an axial primary round jet, which impinges normally on a bounded end wall of a concentric tube, subsequently reverses direction, and exits the tube in a countercurrent flow to the primary jet. The combustion-based actuator generates a momentary (pulsed) jet that is produced by the ignition of a mixture of gaseous fuel and oxidizer in a small (cubic centimeter scale) combustion chamber. The operating frequency and the phase can be continuously varied by independently controlling the flow rate of the fuel/oxidizer and the ignition frequency. Two radially-opposing actuators are mounted {{on the wall of}} the annular return tube and are used to trigger flow transients that alter the global flow through strong feedback. The characteristics of the baseline flow and the effects of actuation are investigated using particle image velocimetry (PIV) as well as static and unsteady pressure measurements. The baseline flow is highly unstable, exhibiting very high rates of flow recirculation. The actuator jet acts as an azimuthal obstruction deflecting the primary jet and causing it to flow around the actuator jet. Furthermore, the interaction of the primary jet with the actuator jets generates large-scale circulation <b>domains.</b> M. S. <b>Committee</b> Chair: Ari Gleze...|$|R
40|$|Background Trainee {{research}} collaboratives (TRCs) {{have been}} revolutionary {{changes to the}} delivery of high-quality, multicentre research. The {{aim of this study}} was to define common roles in the conduct of collaborative research, and map these to academic competencies as set out by General Medical Council (GMC) in the United Kingdom. This will support trainers and assessors when judging academic achievements of those involved in TRC projects, and supports trainees by providing guidance on how to fulfil their role in these studies. Methods A modified Delphi process was followed. Electronic discussion with key stakeholders was undertaken to identify and describe common roles. These were refined and mapped to GMC educational <b>domains</b> and International <b>Committee</b> of Medical Journal Editors authorship (ICJME) guidelines. The resulting roles and descriptions were presented to a face-to-face consensus meeting for voting. The agreed roles were then presented back to the electronic discussion group for approval. Results Electronic discussion generated six common roles. All of these were agreed in face-to-face meetings, where two further roles identified and described. All eight roles required skills that map to part of the academic requirements for surgical training in the UK.

40|$|Many {{problems}} of social choice take the following form. There are n voters {{and a set}} of k objects. These objects may be bills considered by a legislature, candidates to some set of positions, or the collection of characteristics which distinguish a social alternative from another. The voters must choose a subset of the set of objects. Sometimes, any combination of objects is feasible: for example, if we consider the election of candidates to join a club which is ready to admit as many of them as the voters choose. It is for these cases that Barbera, Sonnenschein, and Zhou (1991) provided characterizations of all voting procedures which are strategy-proof and respect voter's sovereignty when voters' preferences are additively representable, and also when these are separable. For both of these restricted <b>domains,</b> voting by <b>committees</b> {{turns out to be the}} family of all rules satisfying the above requirements. Most often, though, some combinations of objects are not feasible, while others are: if there are more candidates than positions to be filled, only sets of size less than or equal to the available number of slots are feasible. Our purpose in this paper is to characterize the families of strategy-proof voting procedures when not all possible subsets of objects are feasible, and voters' preferences are separable or additively representable. Our main conclusions are the following. First: all rules that satisfy strategy-proofness must still be voting by committees. Second: the committees for different objects must be interrelated, in precise ways which depend on what families of sets of objects are feasible. Third: unlike in Barbera, Sonnenschein, and Zhou (1991), the class of strategy- proof rules when preferences are additively representable can be substantially larger that the set of rules satisfying the same requirement when voter' preferences are separable. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Inconsistent {{reporting}} of outcomes {{in clinical trials}} of patients with non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) hinders comparison of findings and the reliability of systematic reviews. A core outcome set (COS) can address this issue as it defines a minimum set of outcomes that should be reported in all clinical trials. In 1998, Deyo et al. recommended a standardized set of outcomes for LBP clinical research. The {{aim of this study}} was to update these recommendations by determining which outcome domains should be included in a COS for clinical trials in NSLBP. Methods An International Steering Committee established the methodology to develop this COS. The OMERACT Filter 2. 0 framework was used to draw a list of potential core domains that were presented in a Delphi study. Researchers, care providers and patients were invited to participate in three Delphi rounds and were asked to judge which domains were core. A priori criteria for consensus were established before each round and were analysed together with arguments provided by panellists on importance, overlap, aggregation and/or addition of potential core <b>domains.</b> The Steering <b>Committee</b> discussed the final results and made final decisions. Results A set of 280 experts was invited to participate in the Delphi; response rates in the three rounds were 52, 50 and 45 %. Of 41 potential core domains presented in the first round, 13 had sufficient support to be presented for rating in the third round. Overall consensus was reached for the inclusion of three domains in this COS: ‘physical functioning’, ‘pain intensity’ and ‘health-related quality of life’. Consensus on ‘physical functioning’ and ‘pain intensity’ was consistent across all stakeholders, ‘health-related quality of life’ was not supported by the patients, and all the other domains were not supported by two or more groups of stakeholders. Weighting all possible argumentations, the Steering Committee decided to include in the COS the three domains that reached overall consensus and the domain ‘number of deaths’. Conclusions The following outcome domains were included in this updated COS: ‘physical functioning’, ‘pain intensity’, ‘health-related quality of life’ and ‘number of deaths’. The next step for the development of this COS will be to determine which measurement instruments best measure these domains...|$|R
40|$|Analyzing massive-data {{sets and}} streams is {{computationally}} very challenging. Data sets in systems biology, network analysis and security use network abstraction to construct large-scale graphs. Graph algorithms such as traversal and search are memory-intensive and typically require very little computation, with access patterns that are irregular and fine-grained. The increasing streaming data rates in various domains such as security, mining, and finance leaves algorithm designers {{with only a}} handful of clock cycles (with current general purpose computing technology) to process every incoming byte of data in-core at real-time. This along with increasing complexity of mining patterns and other analytics puts further pressure on already high computational requirement. Processing streaming data in finance comes with an additional constraint to process at low latency, that restricts the algorithm to use common techniques such as batching to obtain high throughput. The primary contributions of this dissertation are the design of novel parallel data analysis algorithms for graph traversal on large-scale graphs, pattern recognition and keyword scanning on massive streaming data, financial market data feed processing and analytics, and data transformation, that capture the machine-independent aspects, to guarantee portability with performance to future processors, with high performance implementations on multicore processors that embed processorspecific optimizations. Our breadth first search graph traversal algorithm demonstrates a capability to process massive graphs with billions of vertices and edges on commodity multicore processors at rates that are competitive with supercomputing results in the recent literature. We also present high performance scalable keyword scanning on streaming data using novel automata compression algorithm, a model of computation based on small software content addressable memories (CAMs) and a unique data layout that forces data re-use and minimizes memory traffic. Using a high-level algorithmic approach to process financial feeds we present a solution that decodes and normalizes option market data at rates an order of magnitude more than the current needs of the market, yet portable and flexible to other feeds in this domain. In this dissertation we discuss in detail algorithm design challenges to process massive-data and present solutions and techniques that we believe can be used and extended to solve future research problems in this <b>domain.</b> Ph.
