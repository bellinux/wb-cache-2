50|$|<b>Dimefox</b> is an {{organophosphate}} pesticide. It {{is considered}} an extremely hazardous substance {{as defined by the}} United States Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylamine is a {{precursor}} to several industrially significant compounds. It reacts with carbon disulfide to give dimethyl dithiocarbamate, {{a precursor}} to a family of chemicals widely used in the vulcanization of rubber. The solvents dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide are derived from dimethylamine. It is raw material {{for the production of}} many agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals, such as <b>dimefox</b> and diphenhydramine, respectively. The chemical weapon tabun is derived from dimethylamine. The surfactant lauryl dimethylamine oxide is found in soaps and cleaning compounds. Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, a rocket fuel, is prepared from dimethylamine.|$|E
40|$|Enzymes that {{efficiently}} hydrolyze {{highly toxic}} organophosphorus nerve agents {{could potentially be}} used as medical countermeasures. As sufficiently active enzymes are currently unknown, we synthesized twelve fluorogenic analogues of organophosphorus nerve agents with the 3 -chloro- 7 -oxy- 4 -methylcoumarin leaving group as probes for high-throughput enzyme screening. This set included analogues of the pesticides paraoxon, parathion, and <b>dimefox,</b> and the nerve agents DFP, tabun, sarin, cyclosarin, soman, VX, and Russian-VX. Data from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, in vivo toxicity tests of a representative analogue (cyclosarin), and kinetic studies with phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta, and a mammalian serum paraoxonase (PON 1), confirmed that the analogues mimic the parent nerve agents effectively. They are suitable tools for high-throughput screens for the directed evolution of efficient nerve agent organophos-phatases...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} four organophosphorous compounds, three oximes and {{atropine}} sulphate, injected through an indwelling cannula {{into the third}} ventricle of unanaesthetized dogs were examined. The effects of 200 μg of dyflos were involuntary micturition, defaecation, akinesia of hind limbs and pronounced disturbances of awareness; those of 100 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate were tremor, restlessness and signs of fear; 500 μg to 5 mg of dyflos and 250 μg to 500 μg of ethyl pyrophosphate caused vomiting, salivation, twitches of facial muscles and recurrent epileptiform seizures. The injection of 40 to 80 mg of <b>dimefox</b> and of 50 mg of schradan elicited involuntary micturition, vomiting, salivation and defaecation. These effects occur probably after these substances have passed into the blood stream and have been converted in the liver to potent anticholinesterases. This view {{is supported by the}} finding of reduced blood cholinesterase activity. At a dose level of 12. 5 mg, 1, 1 '-trimethylenebis(4 -hydroxyiminomethylpyridinium bromide) produced strong convulsions. At this dose level pralidoxime iodide and diacetyl monoxime produced no observable effects. Atropine sulphate in a dose of 1 mg caused disturbances in consciousness and behaviour followed by convulsions. Intraventricular atropine and to a minor extent intraventricular oximes were able to antagonize the effects of intraventricular ethyl pyrophosphate. Pralidoxime iodide exerted a strong antagonistic effect also on intravenous injection...|$|E
