3000|$|Knowing {{whether the}} <b>default</b> <b>time</b> is a predictable, accessible, or totally {{inaccessible}} stopping time {{is very important}} in a mathematical credit risk model. A predictable <b>default</b> <b>time</b> is typical of structural credit risk models, while totally inaccessible <b>default</b> <b>times</b> {{are one of the most}} important features of reduced-form credit risk models. In the first framework, market agents know when the default is about to occur, while in the latter default occurs by surprise. The fact that financial markets cannot foresee the <b>time</b> of <b>default</b> of a company makes the reduced-form models well accepted by practitioners. In this sense, totally inaccessible <b>default</b> <b>times</b> seem to be the best candidates for modelling times of bankruptcy. We refer, among others, to the papers of Jarrow and Protter (2004) and of Giesecke (2006) on the relations between financial information and the properties of the <b>default</b> <b>time,</b> and also to the series of papers of Jeanblanc and Le Cam (2008, 2009, 2010). It is remarkable that in our setting the <b>default</b> <b>time</b> is a totally inaccessible stopping time under the common assumption that it admits a continuous density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Both the hypothesis that the <b>default</b> <b>time</b> admits a continuous density and its consequence that the default occurs by surprise are standard in mathematical credit risk models, but in the information-based approach there is the additional feature of an explicit model for the flow of information which is more sophisticated than the standard approach. There, the available information on the default is modelled through [...] (I_{τ≤ t}, t≥ 0), the single-jump process occurring at τ, meaning that people only know if the default has or has not occurred. Financial reality can be more complex and there are actually periods in which default is more likely to happen than in others. In the information-based approach, periods of fear of an imminent default correspond to situations where the information process is close to 0, while periods when investors are relatively sure that the default is not going to occur immediately correspond to situations where β [...]...|$|R

40|$|A basic reduced-form {{counterparty}} risk modeling approach hinges {{on a standard}} immersionhypothesis between a reference filtration and the filtration progressively enlarged by the <b>default</b> <b>times</b> of the two parties, also involving the continuity {{of some of the}} data at <b>default</b> <b>time.</b> This basic approach is too restrictive for applicationto credit derivatives, which are characterized by strong wrong-way risk, i. e. adverse dependence between the exposure and the credit riskiness of the counterparties, and gap risk, i. e. slippage between the portfolio and its collateral during the so called cure period that separates default from liquidation.

40|$|Portfolio credit {{derivatives}} are contracts that {{are tied to}} an underlying portfolio of defaultable reference assets and have payoffs that depend on the <b>default</b> <b>times</b> of these assets.

The payoff of a credit derivative is often discontinuous in the underlying <b>default</b> <b>times,</b> and this complicates the accurate estimation of sensitivities. Discontinuities introduced by changes in one <b>default</b> <b>time</b> can be smoothed by taking conditional expectations given all other <b>default</b> <b>times.</b> We use this to derive estimators and to give conditions under which they are unbiased.

In order to ensure an efficient evaluation of F we apply suitable recursion schemes. Independently of the chosen copula, the resulting quadrature offers a very fast convergence and a complexity of at worst O(N^ 2 d^ 2) by using N nodes. If the underlying m–th to Default Swap does not depend on the m–th smallest <b>default</b> <b>time</b> solely, we will develop new Monte–Carlo methods in this thesis. For this, we extend existing importance sampling methods regarding the Gaussian copula to the usage of any Archimedean copula.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} dynamize the static Gaussian copula model of {{portfolio}} credit risk, we introduce a model filtration {{made of a}} reference Brownian filtration progressively enlarged by the <b>default</b> <b>times.</b> This yields a multidimensional density model of <b>default</b> <b>times,</b> where, {{as opposed to the}} classical situation of the Cox model, the reference filtration is not immersed into the enlarged filtration. In mathematical terms this lack of immersion means that martingales in the reference filtration are not martingales in the enlarged filtration. From {{the point of view of}} financial interpretation this means default contagion, a good feature in the perspective of modeling counterparty wrong-way risk on credit derivatives. Computational tractability is ensured by invariance of multivariate Gaussian distributions through conditioning by some components, the ones corresponding to past defaults. Moreover the model is Markov in an augmented state-space including past <b>default</b> <b>times.</b> After a discussion of different notions of deltas, the model is applied to the valuation of counterparty risk on credit derivatives. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk model {{to characterize the}} difference between the economic and recorded <b>default</b> <b>times</b> for a firm.

In our model, the probability distribution for the time span between economic and recorded defaults follows a mixture of Arcsine Laws, which is consistent with the results contained in Guo, Jarrow, and Lin. In addition, we show that the classical structural model is a limiting case of our model as the time period between debt repayment dates goes to zero. As a corollary, we show how the firm value process’s parameters can be estimated using the tail index and correlation structure of the firm’s return...|$|R
40|$|We build {{a general}} model for pricing defaultable claims.

We prove that under this assumption, in some standard market filtrations, <b>default</b> <b>times</b> are totally inaccessible stopping times; we therefore proceed to a systematic construction of <b>default</b> <b>times</b> with particular emphasis on totally inaccessible stopping times. Surprisingly, this abstract mathematical construction, reveals a very specific and useful way in which default models can be built, using both market factors and idiosyncratic factors. We then provide all the relevant characteristics of a <b>default</b> <b>time</b> (i. e. the Azéma supermartingale and its Doob-Meyer decomposition) given the information about these factors. We also provide explicit formulas for the prices of defaultable claims and analyze the risk premiums that form in the market in anticipation of losses which occur at the default event. The usual reduced-form framework is extended in order to include possible economic shocks, in particular jumps of the recovery process at the <b>default</b> <b>time.</b> This formulas are not classic and we {{point out that the}} knowledge of the default compensator or the intensity process is not anymore a sufficient quantity for finding explicit prices, but we need indeed the Azéma supermartingale and its Doob-Meyer decomposition. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} of mutually dependent <b>default</b> <b>times</b> of several credit names through the intensity-based approach.

The issue of the arbitrage valuation of related basket credit derivatives is also briefly examined. We argue that our approach permits in some cases to reduce significantly the dimensionality of the valuation problem at hand. 1 Dependent Intensities of <b>Default</b> <b>Times</b> In the case of mutually dependent defaults, it is natural to assume that the default probability of a certain entity increases as soon as a related firm defaults on its obligations. Within the socalled reduced-form approach to the modeling of credit risk, this kind of dependence is reflected in the jump of the default intensity of a given firm at the <b>default</b> <b>time</b> of another entity. This specific method of modeling mutually dependent <b>default</b> <b>times</b> was examined by, among others, Schmidt (1998), Kusuoka (1999), Jeanblanc and Rutkowski (2000, 2001), Kijima and Muromachi (2000), Schonbucher and Schubert (2000), and Jarrow and Yu (2001).
