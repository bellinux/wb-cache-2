25|$|Industrial {{application}} of CSP to software design has usually focused on dependable and safety-critical systems. For example, the Bremen Institute for Safe Systems and Daimler-Benz Aerospace modeled a <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> system and avionics interface (consisting of some 23,000 lines of code) {{intended for use}} on the International Space Station in CSP, and analyzed the model to confirm that their design was free of deadlock and livelock. The modeling and analysis process was able to uncover a number of errors {{that would have been}} difficult to detect using testing alone. Similarly, Praxis High Integrity Systems applied CSP modeling and analysis during the development of software (approximately 100,000 lines of code) for a secure smart-card Certification Authority to verify that their design was secure and free of deadlock. Praxis claims that the system has a much lower defect rate than comparable systems.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two primary}} ways to perform <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> - these are active and passive. Passive <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> {{is done by}} {{collecting}} alarms from devices (normally via SNMP traps) when something happens in the devices. In this mode, the <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> system only knows if a device it is monitoring is intelligent enough to generate an error and report it to the management tool. However, if the device being monitored fails completely or locks up, it won't throw an alarm and the problem will not be detected. Active <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> addresses this issue by actively monitoring devices via tools such as ping {{to determine if the}} device is active and responding. If the device stops responding, active monitoring will throw an alarm showing the device as unavailable and allows for the proactive correction of the problem.|$|E
