40|$|Structures and {{properties}} of nitrile imines were investigated computationally at B 3 LYP and CCSD(T) levels. Whereas NBO analysis at the B 3 LYP DFT level invariably predicts a propargylic electronic structure, CCSD(T) calculations permit {{a clear distinction}} between propargylic, allenic, and carbenic structures. Nitrile imines with strong <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> above ca. 2150 cm- 1 have propargylic structures with a CN triple bond (RCNNSiMe 3 and R 2 BCNNBR 2), and those with <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> below ca. 2150 cm- 1 are allenic (HCNNH, PhCNNH, and HCNNPh). Nitrile imines lacking significant cumulenic <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> at 1900 - 2200 cm - 1 are carbenic (R-(C:) -N=N-R′). Electronegative but lone pair-donating groups NR 2, OR, and F stabilize the carbenic form of nitrile imines in the same way they stabilize "normal" singlet carbenes, including N-heterocyclic carbenes. NBO analyses at the CCSD(T) level confirm the classification into propargylic, allenic, and carbenic reactivity types. Carbenic nitrile imines are predicted to form azoketenes 21 with CO, to form [2 + 2] and [2 + 4] cycloadducts and borane adducts, and to cyclize to 1 H-diazirenes of the type 24 in mildly exothermic reactions with activation energies in the range 29 - 38 kcal/mol. Such reactions will be readily accessible photochemically and thermally, e. g., under the conditions of matrix photolysis and flash vacuum thermolysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{structures}} and reactivities of nitrile imines are subjects of continuing debate. Several nitrile imines were generated photochemically or thermally and investigated by IR spectroscopy in Ar matrices at cryogenic temperatures (Ph-CNN-H 6, Ph-CNN-CH 3 17, Ph-CNN-SiMe 3 23, Ph-CNN-Ph 29, Ph 3 C-CNN-CPh 3 34, and the boryl-CNN-boryl derivative 39). The effect of substituents on the {{structures and}} <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> of nitrile imines was investigated computationally at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* level. IR spectra were analyzed {{in terms of}} calculated anharmonic vibrational spectra and were generally in very good agreement with the calculated spectra. Infrared spectra were found to reflect the structures of nitrile imines accurately. Nitrile imines with <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> above 2200 cm(- 1) have essentially propargylic structures, possessing a CN triple bond (typically PhCNNSiMe 3 23, PhCNNPh 29, and boryl-CNN-boryl 39). Nitrile imines with <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> below ca. 2200 cm(- 1) {{are more likely to}} be allenic (e. g., HCNNH 1, PhCNNH 6, HCNNPh 43, PhCNNCH 3 17, and Ph 3 C-CNN-CPh 3 34). All nitrile imines isomerize to the corresponding carbodiimides both thermally and photochemically. Monosubstituted carbodiimides isomerize thermally to the corresponding cyanamides (e. g., Ph-N=C=N-H 5 [...] > Ph-NH-CN 8), which are therefore the thermal end products for nitrile imines of the types RCNNH and HCNNR. This tautomerization is reversible under flash vacuum thermolysis conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested and}} applied a laser-induced {{oxidation}} method for identifying the IR-active stretching mode absorptions of linear C 2 n+ 1 molecules which have known strong UV-vis absorptions. For this purpose, we trapped the molecules of carbon vapor in non-inert matrices (pure O 2 and Ar-O 2 mixtures) at temperatures providing molecular growth. The matrix {{was exposed to}} laser light tuned to the wavelength of the UV-vis transition of a specific carbon species. We observed a bleaching of that UV-vis absorption and a correlated decrease of lines in the IR spectra for C 9, C 11, C 13, C 15, and C 21. The {{data suggest that the}} strongest <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> of the C 2 n+ 1 (n≧ 4) chains form a regular pattern with increasing n. To obtain information about <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> of carbon chain oxides, oxygen matrices with replaced 16 O -> 18 O isotopes were applied. Our data revise some of the IR assignments existing in the literature...|$|R
5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} can {{be attributed}} to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic <b>IR</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1. The latter is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related <b>IR</b> <b>absorption</b> peaks are documented.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong <b>IR</b> <b>absorption</b> at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E
40|$|The <b>IR</b> and UV–vis <b>absorptions</b> of oxides of long carbon chains {{trapped in}} {{cryogenic}} matrices were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Some of the IR-lines {{were assigned to}} the oxides of certain carbon chains using the method of isotopic substitution of matrix material (16 O 2 / 18 O 2, 12 CO/ 13 CO) and the technique of selective UV–vis photo-bleaching. Our data, along with quantum chemical calculations suggest that the wavelength positions of the major UV–vis and <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> of the oxides CnO, OCnO, and of the parent carbon chains Cn are located in close vicinity...|$|R
30|$|We {{estimated}} {{an amount}} of 4 -hexylresorcinol compound from its composite form with hydroxyapatite using FT-IR and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopies. Because of the majority <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> of HA, the precise estimation of 4 HR concentration in the 4 HR-HA composite is a little ambiguous using FT-IR spectroscopy. On the other hand, the 4 HR-HA composite showed clear absorption for 4 HR in the ultraviolet region. Based on UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, we effectively estimated the micromolar quantity of the loaded 4 HR in the 4 HR-HA composite.|$|R
30|$|The band at 1680  cm− 1 may be {{attributed}} to the H-bond C=O stretching modes in isocyanurates, while the absorption at 1455  cm− 1 probably results from to the CH 2 bending in the backbone of the HDI monomer. The thin and sharp peak commonly observed at 765  cm− 1 may be explained by the C–N skeleton stretch in HDI trimers with a cyclic structure [27]. As consequence, the <b>IR</b> <b>absorptions</b> occurring at ca. 765  cm− 1 may be used as a marker for identifying isocyanurate based PU systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{deuteron}} has spin +1 ("triplet") {{and is thus}} a boson. The NMR {{frequency of}} deuterium is significantly different from common light hydrogen.

2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths.

As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific <b>IR</b> <b>absorption</b> bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light.
