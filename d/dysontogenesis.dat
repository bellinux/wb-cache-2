40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the actual problem of {{clinical}} psychology studies of cognitive <b>dysontogenesis</b> in schizophrenic conditions. Evaluation results of particularity of association activity and selectivity of thinking in normal and schizophrenic primary school age children are given. Two samples were examined: 60 schizophrenic children and 60 mentally healthy children at the age from 7 to 11 years old. Experimental psychological author’s complex of techniques for evaluation of verbal associations in response to stimuli of different modalities (olfactory, audio-verbal, visual, tactile) along with evaluation of thinking selectivity and cognitive development level were used. Present research results are discussed in relations with particularity of cognitive deficiency and manifestation of cognitive <b>dysontogenesis</b> in schizophrenic primary school age children. Connections between thinking selectivity disorder and particularities of association activity in different modalities of schizophrenic young schoolchildren are demonstrated. The key research result is following: thinking selectivity disorder in schizophrenia condition is also manifested in the association process of schizophrenic children and doesn’t depend on modality...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme is}} the {{specifics}} of mental <b>dysontogenesis</b> in autism which is linked to disruption {{in the development of}} affectiv¬ity, which normally defines active relationships of a child with people and environment in general. It is shown that one condition of psychological support for an autistic child is working towards normalizing their affective development, an emotional/notional approach is suggested, directed towards solving this task. Resource is sought in establishing emotional contact and interaction with the child and entraining them in cohabitation and comprehension of their surroundings. During developmental communication the child’s endurance in contacts grows, interest forms successively, the mutual organization of the child’s life experience happens, which gives them greater freedom and constructivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{formation}} of self-regulation {{is of interest}} to various psychological disciplines. The uncorrected violations {{of the formation of}} self-regulation can lead to school disadaptation. We presented results of applying the methodology of sensorimotor correction in work with self-regulation disorder in children of primary school age. The level of development of self-regulation was defined in the neuropsychological examination. The effect of sensorimotor correction for this type of deviation in mental development is due to the orientation on the mechanism of impaired mental <b>dysontogenesis,</b> through the influence on motor and sensory components of the whole psychic of the child. The result of the work conducted was a pronounced increase in the level of self-regulation in experimental group compared to the control. The features of individual stages of the correctional program are described. Additional ways of work to develop the skills of self-regulation are proposed. Particular attention is paid to the importance of parental involvement in the correctional process...|$|E
40|$|The article {{contains}} results of comparison of level of intellectual development and features of verbal association measurements of young schoolchildren in normal and schizophrenia conditions {{in response to}} stimuli of different modalities. There have been examined two selections: schizophrenic children and mentally healthy children (60 schizophrenic children and 60 mentally healthy children at the age from 7 to 11 y. o.). There have been used experimental-psychological author’s complex of methods to research verbal associations in response to stimuli of different modalities (olfactory, audio-verbal, visual, tactile), as well as battery of K-ABC tests. The research results {{are discussed in the}} context of particularity of cognitive deficiency and manifestation of cognitive <b>dysontogenesis</b> of young school schizophrenic children. The {{article contains}} description of various combinations of connection/ absence of connection between intelligence level (according to Kauffman’s battery of K –ABC tests) and various measurements of association activity (productiveness, temporary indications of activity, commonality coefficient). The principal research result is relative independence of particularity of association activity of schizophrenic children (according to commonality coefficient) of their cognitive development level...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the level of conceptual and metacognitive abilities and their interaction in adolescents with different forms of <b>dysontogenesis.</b> The total sample (N= 173) included four groups of young adolescents (11 - 12 years old) : with normal development, with infantile cerebral palsy (CP), with {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), and with delayed intellectual development (DID). We measured the adolescents’ performance on tests of conceptual abilities (the use of categories at different grades of generalization, the discovery of abstract meaning and implicit connections between concepts) and metacognitive abilities (attention selectivity, as measured by Mtinsterberg’s test and the understanding of hidden pictures, and attention organization, as measured by indices of cognitive styles). The results showed, first, that in comparison with normal adolescents, the adolescents with CP and ADHD had a deficit of metacognitive abilities, but they did not differ in rates of conceptual abilities. As for adolescents with DID, even though they had lower rates of conceptual abilities and attention selectivity, they did not differ from the “norm” group on some indices of attention organization. Second, a tendency for the disintegration of conceptual and metacognitive abilities (as measured by correlation and factor analysis) was most clearly seen in the adolescents with ADHD and DID. The adolescents with CP and ADHD had conceptual (categorial and generative) abilities as a mental resource, and the adolescents with DID had metacognitive abilities as a mental resource. The resource function of conceptual and metacognitive abilities was determined not only by their level but also by the extent of their interaction (integration). ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: juniour {{schoolchildren}} {{with special}} needs should {{take into account the}} existing system of norms and rules in the school space. They should understand both their own inner world and that of surrounding people, but in conditions of deficiency <b>dysontogenesis,</b> the inability to forecast the outcome of any situation and the use of irrational behavioural strategies reduce the opportunities for successful social adaptation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the specifics of forecasting and understanding normative situations by juniour schoolchildren with musculoskeletal system disorder, as well as with vision, hearing and speech impairment. Materials and Methods: to study the forecasting specifics of juniour schoolchildren, we used the guessing game methodology by L. I. Peresleni. We studied the specific character of normative behaviour using a set of methodologies: Perception of the normative situation by A. K. Pashchenko, Anticipation of the outcome with violation of the norm by V. P. Ulyanova, and Identification of the cultural congruity of juniour schoolchildren by L. F. Bayanova. Results: the study made it possible to identify the forecasting characteristics of juniour schoolchildren with normative development and with vision, hearing, speech impairments and musculoskeletal disorder. Students with developmental disabilities experienced forecasting difficulties, associated with decreasing sustainability of voluntary attention and its distribution in the course of the activity. The perception of norms by schoolchildren with developmental disorders often depended on random, brightly coloured emotional events or objects. The norms were differentiated more successfully in a situation of communication, than in educational activity. Discussion and Conclusions: the obtained data are consistent with the results of the studies by national and foreign scientists, who note that children with health limitations lack understanding of the need to comply with social norms. They follow irrational strategies for forecasting and assessing their own actions and the behaviour of people around them. However, these studies are fragmentary; not all types of deficiency development have been studied. The aspects of forecasting normative behaviour of schoolchildren with health limitations in the situations of social interaction revealed in the study can be useful in the development of diagnostic tools that make it possible to evaluate the prognostic ability of a child with developmental disorders and to assess the risks of socialisation disorders...|$|E
