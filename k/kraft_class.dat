The 10,500-seat {{southeast}} (home side) stands were built first; the 6,500-seat northwest stands opened two years later. The stadium is named for Lawrence Wien, class of 1925, a former trustee, philanthropist, lawyer and entrepreneur. After a $5 million donation by Robert <b>Kraft,</b> <b>class</b> of 1963, the field was named in his honor on October 13, 2007. For the first 11 seasons, Wien Stadium had grass and then AstroTurf from 1995 to 2004 but as of 2005 has since switched to FieldTurf.|$|E
30|$|The {{material}} of this study study {{is represented by the}} trees which were removed during the thinning operation. On each aspect a total of 36 random trees from different blocks (treatment replication) were selected (NNE[*]=[*] 36, NSW[*]=[*] 36, Ntotal[*]=[*] 72). The selected trees are equally distributed in different social classes, according to the <b>Kraft</b> <b>class.</b> From each tree a stem disc at a height of 1.3  m from the ground was removed and analysed in the laboratory. The surface of all cross sections was prepared with a diamond fly cutter (Spiecker et al. 2000) and four radii per sample were measured for tree-ring width and wood density.|$|E
30|$|At {{each site}} 4 {{sampling}} plots were established, each located at 25 -m {{step away from}} the site center along one of the four cardinal directions. Each of the plots was circularly shaped with the radius determined by particular local forest stand: it was selected in such a manner that each plot contained 6 trees of the dominant species. Only those trees that belong to 1 – 3 Kraft classes were counted (Eitingen 1959; Assmann 1970). Thus, the total number of dominant trees in all 4 plots at each site was always equal to 24. Apart of those dominant species trees, all trees of other species (also belonging to 1 – 3 <b>Kraft</b> <b>class)</b> within the determined plots were recorded. In the case when the dominant species trees were particularly remotely located and the established sampling plots overlapped, the 25 -m step from the center of site was replaced by 50 -m (or 75 -m) step and the same plot establishing procedure was repeated. For each counted tree we recorded diameter, height, age and crown characteristics. Along with these we recorded plot fundamental properties: site’s ecotope, slope exposition and local relief characteristics.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) forests in Chongqing, {{southwest}} China, have increasingly declined. Soil acidification {{was believed to}} be an important cause. Liming is widely used as a measure to alleviate soil acidification and its damage to trees, but little is known about long-term effects of liming on the health and growth of declining Masson pine forests. Soil chemical properties, health condition (defoliation and discoloration), and growth were evaluated following application of limestone powder (0 (unlimed control), 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha 21) in an acidified and declining Masson pine stand at Tieshanping (TSP) of Chongqing. Eight years after liming, in the 0 – 20 cm and 20 – 40 cm mineral soil layers, soil pH values, exchangeable calcium (Ca) contents, and Ca/Al molar ratios increased, but exchangeable aluminum (Al) levels decreased, and as a result, length densities of living fine roots of Masson pine increased, with increasing dose. Mean crown defoliation of Masson pines (dominant, codominant and subdominant pines, according to <b>Kraft</b> <b>classes</b> 1 – 3) decreased with increasing dose, and it linearly decreased with length densities of living fine roots. However, Masson pines (<b>Kraft</b> <b>classes</b> 1 – 3) in all treatments showed no symptoms of discoloration. Mean current-year twig length, twig dry weight, needle number per twig, needle length per twig, and needle dry weight per twig increased with increasing dose. Over 8 years, mean height increment of Masson pines (<b>Kraft</b> <b>classes</b> 1 – 3) increased from 5. 5 m in the control to 5. 8, 6. 9, 8. 3, and 9. 5 m in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 t ha 21 lime treatments, and their mean DBH (diameter at breast height) increment increased from 3. 1 to 3. 2, 3. 8, 4. 9, an...|$|R

40|$|Spruce bud scale (Physokermes piceae Schrnk.) affects {{tree growth}} {{directly}} and indirectly. Direct injury {{appears in the}} form of tissue damage, as insects suck sap from tree phloem. Indirect injury appears as “honeydew”, which results in negative effects on tree growth. Plant sap is saturated with various carbohydrates called photosynthates that are difficult for scaly insects to digest. Therefore it is secreted in excrements, which are subsequently a food source for the black sooty mold (Apiosporium pinophilum Fuckel). The fungus covers needles blocking stomata, causing decreased transpiration and photosynthesis. An inexplicable wither of Norway spruce was reported in Latvia during 2010 due to black sooty mold. However, spruce bud scale was not evident. In 2011, mass propagation of spruce bud scale was observed following the 2010 Norway spruce loss. One objective of this research was to determine if Kraft tree growth classes could be applied to establish the factors responsible for tree foliage damage. Six 21 - 40 year old (second age class) Norway spruce stands were evaluated. Two circular sample plots with a 7. 98 m radius, and a 200 -m 2 area were randomly established per each forest stand hectare. Diameter at breast height (dbh, 1. 3 m), and height of approximately 30 trees was measured to model a trend. For all trees, <b>Kraft</b> <b>class,</b> and foliage damage level caused by spruce bud scale and black sooty mold were determined. Significant differences were not observed in tree damage levels among stands, however significant differences among damage levels in different Kraft classes were detected (F = 3. 45 > Fcrit. = 2. 80, α = 0. 05 > P = 0. 02) found. Overall damage intensity was 29. 3 %. Total forestry loss was 1153 LVL (1640 EUR) for all surveyed stands (10 ha), and 115 LVL (164 EUR) per hectare...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an attempt to}} apply measurable traits of a tree – crown projection area, crown length, diameter at breast height and tree height for classification of 135 -year-old oak (Quercus L.) trees into <b>Kraft</b> <b>classes.</b> Statistical multivariate analysis was applied to reach the aim. Empirical material was collected on sample plot area of 0. 75 ha, located in 135 -year-old oak stand. Analysis of dimensional traits of oaks from 135 -year-old stand allows quite certain classification of trees into three groups: pre-dominant, dominant and co-dominant and dominated ones. This seems to be quite promising, providing a tool for the approximation of the biosocial position of tree with no need for assessment in forest. Applied analyses do not allow distinguishing trees belonging to II and III <b>Kraft</b> <b>classes.</b> Unless the eye-estimation-based classification is completed, principal component analysis (PCA) method provided simple, provisional solution for grouping trees from 135 -year-old stand into three over-mentioned groups. Discriminant analysis gives more precise results compared with PCA. In the analysed stand, the most important traits {{for the evaluation of}} biosocial position were diameter at breast height, crown projection area and height. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R

30|$|First of all it {{is worth}} noting that ICP Forests data have some {{limitations}} when used for analysis of tree species diversity (Tröltzsch et al. 2009). The plot density 16  km[*]×[*] 16  km to 32  km[*]×[*] 32  km provides only for coarse estimation of current species distribution at the regional level. Furthermore the ICP Forests plot network includes not all trees with stems exceeding a certain diameter but those related to 1 – 3 <b>Kraft’s</b> <b>classes.</b> Also plot areas may be not sufficient for adequately measure tree species diversity (Latham and Ricklefs 1993). However in general ICP Forests plot data are considered to be representative at the regional level and there is positive experience of their use for biodiversity assessment (Tröltzsch et al. 2009; Meier et al. 2012). Finally, as it was already mentioned, for a large area in Northwest Russia these data are the only available for analysis with regular survey grid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The study {{compared}} basic density, {{compressive strength}} along the grain, {{static bending strength}} and modulus of elasticity of juvenile wood in pines from different <b>Kraft’s</b> <b>classes.</b> Analyses were conducted in 8 mature pine monocultures in north-western Poland. In each experimental site a total of 9 trees were selected, thus the analyses were conducted on 72 model trees (with 24 for each social class of tree position in the stand). The highest values of analysed technical parameters were recorded for wood of co-dominant trees, the lowest were found for predominant trees, while intermediate values were recorded for wood of dominant trees. All the reported differences were statistically significant. Similar dependencies were observed when comparing wood from different sections of stems, with the greatest disproportions, frequently statistically significant, found in their lower sections. Key words: social classes of tree position in the stand, basic density, compressive strength along the grain, static bending strength, modulus of elasticit...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the pine tree growth increments (height increment, dbh increment, basal area increment and volume increment) for a 5 -year period. The study involved Scots pine trees of <b>Kraft’s</b> <b>class</b> 1, 2 and 3 (dominant stand) in stands of different age classes (II, III, V) growing in fresh mixed coniferous (BMśw) and fresh coniferous (Bśw) forest habitats. The multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess the statistical significance of age and dominance of trees within a stand on their increment. The dominance position was classified for each tree using Kraft’s criteria. The following characteristic were also measured: dbh of the trunk in two directions (N-S and W-E), and crown projection area {{on the basis of the}} characteristic tree crown points, projected using of a crown projector, characteristic points in tree crowns (7 to 14 on average). The actual height was determined after trees were felled. The following measurements of the single tree growing space were selected and determined: crown projection area – pk (m 2), crown diameter – dk (m), Seebach’s growth space number – dk / d 1. 3, crown projection area to basal area ratio d 2 k / d 21. 3, crown deflection coefficient dk / h, single tree space ppd = pk·h (m 3). We assessed the strength of the relationships between tree growth parameters and tree growth space, crown length, relative crown length and slenderness. Both the age and dominance position of trees within the stand affected the growth increments. The strongest correlation among measured traits was between the 5 -year volume increment and decreasing slenderness...|$|R
40|$|On {{permanent}} {{sample plots}} in young, middle-aged and mature, pure pine stands of the same age, the effectiveness of cuttings of different intensities was studied, to ensure intensive forest growing. Existing standards on the intensity of cutting and relative density do not fully provide the optimal parameters of stands after cutting. Meanwhile, the remaining part of the stand determines growth and productivity of the stand formed by the felling. The sample plots have been established in the «Pogorelsky Bor» experimental forest of V. N. Sukachev Institute of Forest SB RAS, territorially entering the Krasnoyarsk island forest-steppe. In the studied stands, the felling led {{to an increase in}} current radial increment, which depends on the area of the dominance square (Sod), which determines the amount of available resources for the tree after felling. Based on the analysis of the dynamics of radial growth and its relationship with the values of Sod for pine forest stands at different age stages and with different density, the optimum value of Sod is determined, which provides forming of trees of the 2 – 3 rd <b>Kraft</b> <b>classes</b> of growth. Optimum values of the OD area were calculated depending on the values of the stem DBH and taking into account the habitat conditions. With a density that is lower than optimal, higher tree growth values can be obtained, but this does not mean achieving the maximum productivity of the stand as a whole. The studies allow, {{within the framework of the}} proposed approach, to provide intensive forest growing and formation of the stand structure that ensure the fulfillment of both economic and environmental functions of forests. The obtained data can be used in the development of recommendations for carrying out thinning in pine stands at different age stages of their formation...|$|R
40|$|Siberian fir seeds often {{lose their}} germinating {{capacity}} during storage. This results from, among other factors, changing contents of nitrogen compounds in the seeds, {{especially those of}} protein fractions. This paper focuses on analyzing changes of these compounds in nonviable seeds of the species depending on ecological and conditions and stand location, {{as well as on}} tree growth <b>class</b> (<b>Kraft</b> growth <b>classes</b> I and IV). The contents of the total and protein nitrogen in the nonviable seeds of the trees of growth classes I and IV appeared to vary widely and to depend on stand location and seed location in the tree crown. The maximum contents were in the seeds located in {{the upper part of the}} crown. The seeds from the middle and lower crown parts contained much less total and protein nitrogen. The hard-to-solve protein fraction dominated over other protein fraction in the seeds from the upper part of the crowns of the trees of growth classes I and IV. However, this fraction, like prolamines, changed uniformly throughout the crowns, whereas seed glutelin content varied insignificantly among the crown parts. Albumins and globulins showed a uniform crown top-to-bottom decrease. A comparison of viable seed with unviable seeds for contents of the nitrogen forms revealed a marked decrease in the total and protein nitrogen in the latter, especially for the trees of growth class IV. The seeds that lost their germinating capacity exhibited increasingly hard-to-solve protein fraction and drastically decreasing albumins and globulins wherever the seeds were in the crown. Their glutelin and prolamine contents changed inconsiderably. The changes of the quantitative ratio between the protein fractions found by the study cause, along with other physiological and biochemical factors, the loss of viability of Siberian fir seeds during storage...|$|R

30|$|The {{research}} site was planted in 1997 with 1 [*]+[*] 1 stock. The site layout was planted in a randomised block design. The initial {{aim of the}} research plot was to investigate the growth of different tree species within a widely spaced planting design. Beside wild cherry, other broadleaf species such as European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), pedunculate oak (Q. robur L.), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.) and European hornbeam are grown in the mixture. The initial spacing of all trees on the research plot was 1.5  m[*]×[*] 7.5  m and 1.5  m[*]×[*] 15.0  m. Trees were sampled during regular thinning treatments {{at the end of the}} 2012 (n [*]=[*]  20) and 2013 (n [*]=[*]  19) growing seasons, the total number of sampled trees (n [*]=[*]  39) is in the range of that suggested by Roxburgh et al. (2015). Since the trees were felled during the period of winter dormancy, biomass refers to leafless above ground biomass. The sample trees are representative of all social <b>classes</b> (<b>Kraft</b> 1884) ranging from dominant and co-dominant individuals to dominated and suppressed individuals. The dominated and suppressed trees were additionally sampled to augment the allometric curve at the lower end, as is common practice to cover the entire spread of tree sizes on the plot (Cifuentes Jara et al. 2015). Up to the point of sampling no management operations such as thinning or pruning were applied to the sampled trees.|$|R
