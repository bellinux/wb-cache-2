5000|$|Shearing or {{singeing}} smooths {{the fabric}} {{by removing the}} fine protruding fibers {{on the surface of}} the fabric. <b>Flame</b> <b>singeing</b> is the standard process: the wet fabric is passed through an array of gas burners at a suitable distance to burn the pills off of its surface.|$|R
25|$|On {{that famous}} day in Melbourne in 1956 the torch spluttered and sparked, {{showering}} Clarke with hot magnesium, burning {{holes in his}} shirt. When he dipped the torch into the cauldron it burst into <b>flame</b> <b>singeing</b> him further. In {{the centre of the}} ground, John Landy, the fastest miler in the world, took the Olympic oath and sculler Merv Wood carried the Australian flag.|$|R
60|$|In {{writing to}} his son he did not really hope that {{anything}} would come of it. Since the ball at Roger's he had seen too clearly how the land lay--he could put {{two and two together}} quicker than most men--and, with the example of his own son before his eyes, knew better than any Forsyte of them all that the pale <b>flame</b> <b>singes</b> men's wings whether they will or no.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why couldn't {{you leave}} the cat alone?" [...] I shouted at him in idiotic remonstrance, for my brain had gone, and all I knew {{was that we were}} about to be thrown into the fiery pit. Already I was over it; I felt the <b>flames</b> <b>singe</b> my hair and saw its red caverns {{awaiting}} me, when of a sudden the brutal hands that held me were unloosed and I fell backwards to the ground, where I lay staring upwards.|$|R
5000|$|John Marston {{includes}} {{reference to}} Phaeton in 'The Malcontent' whereby Mendoza's monologue describes the '...sparkling glances (of women), ardent as those <b>flames</b> that <b>singed</b> {{the world by}} heedless Phaeton!' - Act 1, Scene 5 ...|$|R
60|$|The Chimæra, by this time, {{after losing}} its second head, had {{got into a}} red-hot passion of pain and rampant rage. It so flounced about, half on earth and partly in the air, that it was {{impossible}} to say which element it rested upon. It opened its snake-jaws to such an abominable width, that Pegasus might almost, I was going to say, have flown right down its throat, wings outspread, rider and all! At their approach it shot out a tremendous blast of its fiery breath, and enveloped Bellerophon and his steed in a perfect atmosphere of <b>flame,</b> <b>singeing</b> the wings of Pegasus, scorching off one whole side of the young man's golden ringlets, and making them both far hotter than was comfortable, from head to foot.|$|R
5000|$|Mercerising {{results in}} the {{swelling}} of the cell wall of the cotton fibre. This causes {{an increase in the}} surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel. An optional last step in the process is passing the thread over an open <b>flame,</b> or <b>singeing.</b> This incinerates stray fibers, improving the fabric's appearance. This is known as [...] "gassing the thread" [...] because of the gas burner that is typically used.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one market-age swine {{slaughtered}} in the University of Kentucky abattoir were inoculated with fecal slurry containing two {{strains of}} nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella typhimurium on the ham, belly, and jowl regions {{on each side}} of the carcass. Trial 1 revealed that a 10 s hot water spray was just as effective as the 20 s spray in removing S. typhimurium, as there was no distinguishable difference in population. The shorter <b>flame</b> <b>singe</b> (10 s) was as effective as the 20 s application and the two chlorine solutions (100, 200 ppm) had similar results. The 2 % lactic acid spray reduced S. typhimurium populations significantly more than the 1 % treatment. Trial 2 compared the four most efficient levels of each intervention method. Efficacy of the intervention methods was observed in the following order: Hot water (10 s) > Chlorine (50 ppm) = Lactic acid (2 %) > Flame (10 s). The effect of carcass area was significant following the post treatment hot water rinse. The jowl area was least accessible by the high pressure water spray. However after the treatment applications, hot water rinse, and 24 h chill (2 ºC) there was no significant difference between treated and untreated carcasses or between carcass areas...|$|R

The <b>flames</b> haven't even <b>singed</b> his insolence. He dreams that when this philosophic {{aberration}} is at an end, there will be serfs to rebuild it for him." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} impart the {{required}} functional properties to the fiber or fabric, it is customary to subject {{the material to}} different types of physical and chemical treatments. For example, wash and wear finish for a cotton fabric is necessary to make it -free or wrinkle-free. In a similar way, mercerising, <b>singeing,</b> <b>flame</b> retardant, water repellent, waterproof, anti-static and peach finishing achieve various fabric properties desired by consumers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people bring}} {{clothing}} to special experts who are employed {{to detect the}} presence of shatnez. A linen admixture can be detected {{during the process of}} dyeing cloth, as wool absorbs dye more readily than linen does. Wool can be distinguished from linen by four tests—feeling, burning, tasting, and smelling; linen burns in a <b>flame,</b> while wool <b>singes</b> and creates an unpleasant odor. Linen thread has a gummy consistency if chewed, due to its pectin content; a quality only found in bast fibers.|$|R
60|$|But the horses, meanwhile, were {{in danger}} of being suffocated, and the dry moss under foot was burning so {{fiercely}} that the fire threatened to spread in spite of their exertions. Seeing this, Bunco and Larry--first casting loose the horses--ran with their kettles and mugs to a neighbouring stream for water, which they poured on the moss. By this time they were nearly surrounded by fire and smoke; the flames roared with appalling fury; the horse that had done all the mischief got burnt about the legs, threw himself down in the very midst of the fire and rolled in agony. Axes and kettles were instantly dropped, and all sprang to the rescue; grasped the creature by the head and tail, but could not drag him out. In desperation, Larry seized a stick, and so belaboured him that he leaped up and rushed out of the smoke and <b>flames,</b> terribly <b>singed,</b> indeed, but not much hurt otherwise. After this the fire was again attacked, and gradually its progress was cut off, so that our travellers were ultimately enabled to remove to a place of safety. But the flames had only been checked; they soon spread again, and, away to leeward of them, set the whole region on fire. From their new encampment that night, they could see rolling clouds of smoke mingling with tongues of flame which shot up, ever and anon, above the trees, and brought out in strong relief, or cast into deep shadow, the crags, gorges, and caverns of the mountains--presenting a scene of terrible devastation and indescribable sublimity.|$|R
6000|$|The {{thermometer}} {{showed an}} altitude of 3,350 feet: under the tree's cool shade, the climate reminded me of Southern Italy in winter. I found a butter-cup, and heard a wood-pecker [18] tapping on the hollow trunk, a reminiscence of English glades. The Abban and his men urged an advance in the afternoon. But my health had suffered from the bad water of the coast, and the camels were faint with fatigue: we therefore dismissed the hired beasts, carried our property into a deserted kraal, and, lighting a fire, prepared to [...] "make all snug" [...] for the night. The Bedouins, chattering with cold, stood closer to the comfortable blaze than ever did pater familias in England: they smoked their faces, toasted their hands, broiled their backs with intense enjoyment, and waved their legs to and fro through the <b>flame</b> to <b>singe</b> away the pile, which at this season grows long. The End of Time, who was surly, compared them to demons, and quoted the Arab's saying:--"Allah never bless smooth man, or hairy woman!" [...] On the 8th of December, at 8 A.M., we travelled slowly up the Halimalah Valley, whose clayey surface glistened with mica and quartz pebbles from the hills. All the trees are thorny except the Sycamore and the Asclepias. The Gub, or Jujube, grows luxuriantly in thickets: its dried wood is used by women to fumigate their hair [19]: the Kedi, a tree like the porcupine,--all spikes,--supplies the Bedouins with hatchet-handles. I was shown the Abol with its edible gum, {{and a kind of}} Acacia, here called Galol. Its bark dyes cloth a dull red, and the thorn issues from a bulb which, when young and soft, is eaten by the Somal, when old it becomes woody, and hard as a nut. At 9 A.M. we crossed the Lesser Abbaso, a Fiumara with high banks of stiff clay and filled with large rolled stones: issuing from it, we traversed a thorny path over ascending ground between higher hills, and covered with large boulders and step-like layers of grit. Here appeared several Gudabirsi tombs, heaps of stones or pebbles, surrounded by a fence of thorns, or an enceinte of loose blocks: in the latter, slabs are used to make such houses as children would build in play, to denote the number of establishments left by the deceased. The new grave is known by the conical milk-pails surmounting the stick {{at the head of the}} corpse, upon the neighbouring tree is thrown the mat which bore the dead man to his last home, and hard by are the blackened stones upon which his funeral feast was cooked. At 11 A.M. we reached the Greater Abbaso, a Fiumara about 100 yards wide, fringed with lovely verdure and full of the antelope called Gurnuk: its watershed was, as usual in this region, from west and south-west to east and north-east. About noon we halted, having travelled eight miles from the Holy Tree.|$|R

Nations sprang up and {{disappeared}} before me;--but I remained and did not die. From cloud-encircled cliffs did I precipitate myself into the ocean; but the foaming billows cast me upon the shore, and the burning arrow of existence pierced my cold heart again. I leaped into Etna's flaming abyss, and roared with the giants for ten long months, polluting with my groans the Mount's sulphureous mouth--ah! ten long months. The volcano fermented, and in a fiery stream of lava cast me up. I lay torn by the torture-snakes of hell amid the glowing cinders, and yet continued to exist.--A forest was on fire: I darted on wings of fury and despair into the crackling wood. Fire dropped upon me from the trees, but the <b>flames</b> only <b>singed</b> my limbs; alas! it could not consume them.--I now mixed with the butchers of mankind, and plunged in the tempest of the raging battle. I roared defiance to the infuriate Gaul, defiance to the victorious German; but arrows and spears rebounded in shivers from my body. The Saracen's flaming sword broke upon my skull: balls in vain hissed upon me: the lightnings of battle glared harmless around my loins: in vain did the elephant trample on me, in vain the iron hoof of the wrathful steed! The mine, big with destructive power, burst upon me, and hurled me high in the air--I fell on heaps of smoking limbs, but was only singed. The giant's steel club rebounded from my body; the executioner's hand could not strangle me, the tiger's tooth could not pierce me, nor would the hungry lion in the circus devour me. I cohabited with poisonous snakes, and pinched the red crest of the dragon.--The serpent stung, but could not destroy me. The dragon tormented, but dared not to devour me.--I now provoked the fury of tyrants: I said to Nero, 'Thou art a bloodhound!' I said to Christiern, 'Thou art a bloodhound!, I said to Muley Ismail, 'Thou art a bloodhound!'--The tyrants invented cruel torments, but did not kill me. Ha! {{not to be able}} to die--{{not to be able to}} die--not to be permitted to rest after the toils of life--to be doomed to be imprisoned for ever in the clay-formed dungeon--to be for ever clogged with this worthless body, its lead of diseases and infirmities--to be condemned to [be]hold for millenniums that yawning monster Sameness, and Time, that hungry hyaena, ever bearing children, and ever devouring again her offspring!--Ha! not to be permitted to die! Awful Avenger in Heaven, hast Thou in Thine armoury of wrath a punishment more dreadful? then let it thunder upon me, command a hurricane to sweep me down to the foot of Carmel, that I there may lie extended; may pant, and writhe, and die.!"' ...|$|R
