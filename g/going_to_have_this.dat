6000|$|... "The bioscope," [...] Louise decided firmly, [...] "I {{refuse to}} have {{anything}} to do with. You have had all the entertainment you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> evening, Mr. Countryman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{simply will}} not have him sit with you again, and you must not advise any one to put a cent into his concern. Where are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> performance?" ...|$|E

50|$|Global {{climate change}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the probability of extreme weather events and environmental disturbances around the world, needless to say, future human populations are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> confront <b>this</b> issue. Every society around the world differs in its capacity with regards to combating climate change because of certain pre-existing factors such as having the proper monetary and institutional mechanisms in place to execute preparedness and recovery plans. Despite these differences, communities {{around the world are}} on a level-playing field with regards to building and maintaining at least some degree “human resilience”.|$|R
5000|$|Jean B. Smit did [...] "Llegarás" [...] (You'll Come), {{which was}} {{supposed}} to be the first single for the album, since the telenovela that Lucero was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot <b>had</b> <b>this</b> name initially, but since the title of the novela was changed to [...] "Mi Destino Eres Tú," [...] the track was not released as a single.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is absurd!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Lenora, go {{down and}} ask Macdougal to come up for a minute. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> thing explained. Hurry, there's a good girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} all right, Paddy," [...] said she softly. [...] "These little folks {{are trying to}} gain a little {{knowledge}} of themselves and other folks, and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> morning's lesson right here because {{it is to be}} about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Walters, seeing {{he could}} expect {{no help from}} him. [...] "But I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> wooden-faced Scotchman in my room. The fool won't let me move. If you don't take him away, I'll break the furniture. I can do that, {{although}} I'm not able to throw the big brute out." ...|$|E
60|$|Pan now shot a {{straight}} level gaze into the hard gray {{eyes of the}} sheriff. He knew he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dealings with <b>this</b> man, and the sooner they began the better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither do I, sir." [...] The other assented eagerly. [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> another try <b>this</b> afternoon. Perhaps there'll be {{some more}} letters in then {{and we can}} tell whether there's any similarity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gorges {{was widely}} praised for his {{performances}} in the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs, with Don Cherry declaring he [...] "should be (Canadiens) captain; if they are ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a captain; <b>this</b> guy is the captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to do a single useful thing for a year," [...] she had told Mrs. Boyd gaily. [...] "Just think of it--a whole {{delightful}} year of vacation, to go and come at will, to read, travel, dream, rest. After that, I mean to see if I can find something to do for other folks, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> one golden year. And the first thing in it is our trip to Vancouver. I'm so glad I have the chance to go with you. It's a wee bit short notice, but I'll be ready when you want to start." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHNNY. [collaring him]. No: you dont run away. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> {{out with}} you. Sit down: d'y' hear? [Bentley {{attempts}} {{to go with}} dignity. Johnny slings him into {{a chair at the}} writing table, where he sits, bitterly humiliated, but afraid to speak lest he should burst into tears]. Thats the advantage of having more body than brains, you see: it enables me to teach you manners; and I'm going to do it too. Youre a spoilt young pup; and you need a jolly good licking. And if youre not careful youll get it: I'll see to that next time you call me a swine.|$|E
6000|$|The {{transport}} {{broke in}} tears; the denunciation {{had turned to}} entreaty in everything but words; but Bartley had hardened his heart now past all entreaty. The idiotic penitent {{that he had been}} a few moments ago, the soft, well-meaning dolt, was so far from him now as to be scarce within the reach of his contempt. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> thing over once for all; he would have no mercy upon himself or upon her; the Devil was in him, and uppermost in him, and the Devil is fierce and proud, and knows how to make many base emotions feel like a just self-respect. [...] "And did you believe a woman like that?" [...] he sneered.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Professor. He took {{quite an}} active interest." [...] Gross {{turned to the}} Pilot. [...] "Let's get <b>going.</b> We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take <b>this</b> out past gravity for the test they tell me. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Are you ready?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sharp himself devised and {{drafted a}} new edict {{empowering}} any officer or sergeant to kill {{on the spot}} any armed man whom he found returning from or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a conventicle, {{and he was on}} the point of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> London <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> edict confirmed when his murderous career was suddenly terminated.|$|R
6000|$|... (Staggering weakly, and sinking {{back into}} chair.) Let me rest a moment, Connie. I'll be better. (To Starkweather, who takes no notice.) Anthony, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> {{been too much}} for me. I shall be sick. I shall never catch that train to-day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, Colonel," [...] Hilda said, trying to repress a smile. [...] "I was {{quite sure that}} from your {{friendship}} for my dear uncle you {{would be ready to}} give us your assistance, but so far there has been no way in which you could have aided us in the inquiries that we have made. Indeed, as Dr. Leeds has impressed upon us, the fewer there are engaged in the matter the better; for if this man knew that we were making all sorts of inquiries about him, he might think it necessary for his safety either to put Walter out of the way altogether, or to send him to some place so distant that there would be practically no hope whatever of our ever discovering him. At present I think that we have fairly satisfied ourselves that this man is an impostor, and that the real John Simcoe was drowned, as supposed, in the ship in which he sailed from India. Who this man is, and how he became acquainted with the fact that John Simcoe saved my uncle's life in India, are mysteries that so far we have no clew to; but these matters are at present of minor importance to us. Before anything else we want to find where Walter is hidden, and to do this we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> man watched. He cannot have carried off Walter by himself, and, no doubt, he meets occasionally the people who helped him, and who are now hiding Walter. It is scarcely probable that they come to his lodgings. He is not likely to put himself into anyone's power, and no doubt goes by night in some disguise to meet them. As, of course, he knows you perfectly well, it would be worse than useless for you to try to follow him. That is going to be done by Tom Roberts." ...|$|E
5000|$|When we {{realized}} that Kristoff was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> relationship with the trolls which {{was kind of the}} key discovery {{we realized}} that {{it was kind of like}} okay, he’s bringing this girl that he’s not dating home to this big, ruckus family and they’re gonna misinterpret the situation. So we thought oh, gee it’s gotta have that kind of New York dating song cabaret feel and so that’s how the music kind of came about.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the season}} 2 episode of Gilmore Girls, [...] "The Roadtrip to Harvard," [...] Lorelai and Rory are {{staying in a}} bed and breakfast in New Hampshire and are hiding out in their room while a group of dentists staying there sing [...] "Gypsys, Tramps, and Thieves". When Rory {{wants to talk about}} Lorelai calling off her wedding, Lorelai shouts [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> fight in a flowery bedroom with dentists singing [...] "Gypsys, Tramps and Thieves" [...] in the background. It's too David Lynch" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen. Gee, {{this thing}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the biggest ever. I gotta new idea. It just came to me. Your saying that put it into my head. Do you know what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cable over to Betty to come right along here, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her marry <b>this</b> prince guy. Yes, sir!" ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{learning}} of Listers sentence, Rimmer is furious that his nemesis is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all <b>this</b> time in stasis without getting older, and prepares {{to work on}} an immediate appeal. He never gets the chance, {{as one of the}} ships nuclear reactors fails, letting loose a wave that kills everyone except Lister. Just before he dies, Rimmer (who was literally a few seconds away from the safety of the stasis booth where he planned to spend the evening) finds himself thinking of gazpacho. In the hold, Listers cat and her kittens are safe from the radiation too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jee-hoshaphat, Harry!" [...] Jerry exclaimed as {{he stepped}} out; [...] "that was worse nor a cyclone. I would rather sit {{on the back of}} the worst kind of bucker than jump over those waves again. If we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> much of <b>this</b> I should say let us find our way back and ask the Utes to finish us off." ...|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth sends Danny {{the diaries}} of Ruth Whitlow. Through the diaries, {{we see that}} Ruth's {{relationship}} with John Robert Anderson leads to marriage ("Be My Bride"). John Robert is stationed in France. Ruth writes of her longing for him and her pride in his service ("Ruth's Letters"). John Robert challenges a hostile airman to a bet and teaches him a lesson ("Anique's Tavern Song"). Another letter from Ruth reveals that she is pregnant ("I'm <b>Going</b> <b>To</b> <b>Have</b> <b>This</b> Child"). John Robert continues his service in France ("The Dogfight") and his life ends there ("Act I Finale").|$|E
5000|$|Murray {{became the}} [...] "best-known, best-loved and also most cordially disliked person in Fort St. John" [...] for her folksy and outspoken editorials, {{including}} {{attacks on the}} local power and telephone companies, and her solution to a town water shortage:"There has been a terrible waste of water in this small town. ... We sure as hell need to use less if we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> modern convenience. To head off this catastrophe, only flush for No. 2, curtail bathing to the Saturday night tub, {{go back to the}} old washrag which could always remove a lot of B.O. if applied often enough. ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{choosing}} {{the members of}} the team, Riley stated [...] "The qualities came first. If we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> superhero team, we want them to be fierce and brave and strong and fast and keen of sight. Those are the qualities of our five animals in the Lion Guard... The lion {{is going to be the}} fiercest. The bravest is the honey badger, hippo the strongest, cheetah the fastest, and the egret - egrets have sort of binocular vision which gives them depth perception which most birds who have eyes on either side of their head don’t, so Ono our egret is the keenest of sight. They’re the best of the best within the Pride Lands." ...|$|E
5000|$|Now I am {{very happy}} that in the great Confessions of the Christian world, our Confession—the Westminster Confession—has its Chapter 1 on the Word of God. … Now the Lord says, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep my Word—it is like silver that has been tried. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep that to all generations, all generations." [...] That means {{that no matter what}} the {{conditions}} are, God is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on <b>this</b> earth some churches and some pastors until the last generation were taken away who will maintain this Word like we are doing here and like we are seeking to do throughout the whole Christian world.|$|R
2500|$|Matsuzaka {{made his}} next start on May 22, 2009, against the New York Mets after being {{activated}} off the DL. He gave up five runs over five innings, receiving another loss. Matsuzaka gained his first win {{of the season}} against the Detroit Tigers on June 2, 2009, but failed to produce any quality starts. After a loss against the Atlanta Braves on June 19, 2009, Matsuzaka was once again placed on the disabled list. Red Sox manager Terry Francona stated that Matsuzaka {{was placed on the}} DL due to [...] "weakness" [...] in his throwing arm possibly caused by the extensive pitching he did in the World Baseball Classic. Francona also made it clear {{that it would not be}} a [...] "two-week DL" [...] stating [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure <b>this</b> out. We <b>have</b> a lot of work ahead of us trying to get him back to being Daisuke." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Gingrich reaffirmed {{his support}} for giving the death penalty to some drug smugglers, such as cartel leaders, and said [...] "we need to think through a {{strategy}} that makes it radically less likely that we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> drugs in <b>this</b> country". [...] He commented that places with [...] "very draconian" [...] drug policies like Singapore {{have been the most}} successful at doing that.|$|R
5000|$|Alice N' Chains soon disbanded and Staley {{joined a}} funk band, {{which at the}} time also {{required}} a guitarist. He asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, {{which at the time}} didn't have a name and included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr. They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The final straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper in front of him - he decided to join the band after that. Cantrell said about Staley's voice: [...] "I knew that voice was the guy I wanted to be playing with. It sounded like it came out of a 350-pound biker rather than skinny little Layne. I considered his voice to be my voice." [...] Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. The band had names like [...] "Fuck" [...] and [...] "Diamond Lie", the latter being the name of Cantrell's previous band. Diamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley's previous band, Alice N' Chains, then renamed Alice in Chains. Staley explained the name Alice in Chains saying, [...] "The name came from a side project of my old group. We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> band that dressed in drag and played heavy metal as a joke." [...] Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E
6000|$|He raved aloud. The China boys {{hung back}} with the dishes {{at the foot of}} the ladder. He yelled from the bridge down at the deck, [...] "Aren't we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any chow <b>this</b> evening at all?" [...] then turned violently to Captain Whalley, who waited, grave and patient, at the head of the table, {{smoothing}} his beard in silence now and then with a forbearing gesture.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any of <b>this</b> dam sentimental {{nonsense}} and humbug here, sir," [...] {{the father}} cried out. [...] "There shall be no beggar-marriages in my family. If {{you choose to}} fling away eight thousand a year, which you may have for the asking, you may do it: but by Jove you take your pack and walk out of this house, sir. Will you do as I tell you, once for all, sir, or will you not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|First, {{the federal}} {{government}} uses [...] "faith-based groups," [...] for refugee placement. The local communities that receive the refugees {{are not included in}} the decision-making process. Receiving new refugees into a community requires numerous resources from the local government, but these local governments are not given enough funding from {{the federal government}}. They are also not informed as to how many new refugees they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> receive. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> been a heavy burden for the local governments.|$|R
6000|$|... "No fear. I'll {{have him}} {{steering}} {{in a few}} days. I refer to the misfits. If we rolled {{a dozen of them}} together they wouldn't make one real man. I'm not saying it to alarm you, for there's nothing alarming about it; but we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> proper hell <b>this</b> voyage." [...] He broke off to stare reflectively at his broken knuckles, as if estimating how much drive was left in them, then sighed and concluded, [...] "Well, I can see I've got my work cut out for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1935, Starace, a Colonel, took a {{leave of}} absence as PNF Party Secretary to {{participate}} in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and fought on the northern front. In March 1936, after the Battle of Shire, he was given command of a mixed group of Blackshirts and Bersaglieri being assembled in Asmara, Eritrea. Later that month, Starace and his truck-transportable [...] "mechanized column" [...] prepared to advance over rough tracks to seize Gondar, the capital of Begemder Province. Before setting out, [...] "the Panther Man" [...] (L'uomo pantera) gave the following speech to his men: [...] Soldiers, this is the most risky, most difficult and most important venture of the campaign. Don't waste a shot. We are carrying all the ammunition we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on <b>this</b> trip. This column must be like an electric live wire. Death to the touch!
