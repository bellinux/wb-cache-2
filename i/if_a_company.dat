50|$|If {{the market}} is not efficient, the company's shares may be underpriced.

5000|$|A {{significant}} {{element in}} Kohan {{are the three}} zones: Zone of Control (ZoC), Zone of Supply (ZoS) and Zone of Population (ZoP). Each <b>company</b> has <b>a</b> ZoC, {{which is based on}} formation. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company's</b> ZoC overlaps with <b>an</b> enemy <b>company's</b> ZoC, they will engage in combat. The ZoS is the area in which companies can be healed; it is provided by settlements, unless the settlement is under siege, and is based on a settlement's size and components. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company's</b> ZoC overlaps with a friendly ZoS, the company is considered [...] "in supply" [...] and will heal when out of combat. Each settlement also has a ZoP, representing the lands already inhabited. New settlements must be built outside the ZoP.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> becomes insolvent, {{then the}} board of {{directors}} ceases to owe its duties to the shareholders - it owes its duty to act {{in the best interests of}} the creditors, being the persons who are beneficially entitled to the company's assets.|$|E

25|$|Often {{business}} transfers take place {{when a company}} has plunged into an insolvency procedure. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> enters liquidation, which aims to wind down the business and sell off the assets, TUPER 2006 regulation 8(7) states that the rules on transfer will not apply.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1961 Fundamentals, legal {{entities}} such as companies could also hold copyrights. Examples of such corporate copyright ownership included photo studios {{who held the}} copyright on their photos, publishers of encyclopedias or periodicals, who held a copyright on the compilation as a whole, film studios, who owned the copyrights on movie scripts and the movies they produced, and select news agencies (TASS, on January 15, 1935, was granted the copyright on all the information it disseminated. Novosti was later also granted this right.). In the case of compilations such as encyclopedias or periodicals, the publishing company owned only a copyright on the work in its entirety; the copyright on the individual contributions {{that made up the}} compilation remained with the individual authors. Copyrights held by {{legal entities}} were defined to be perpetual; <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> was reorganized, its legal successor entity took over the copyrights, and <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> ceased to exist, the copyrights passed to the state.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>company’s</b> post-tax outlays {{consist of}} CPLTD of $90M and $10M in unfinanced CAPEX, and its noncash {{expenses}} are $100M,then {{the company can}} apply $100M of cash inflow from operations to post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $100M cash inflow. In this case, the pretax cash that the borrower must set aside for post-tax outlays would simply be $100M.|$|R
50|$|If {{most or all}} {{operative}} {{functions are}} outsourced to a 3PL provider, there is usually {{no need for the}} client to own its own warehouse or transport facilities, lowering the amount of capital required for the client's business.

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> {{carries on}} a {{business}} of leasing plant or machinery, is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business {{and there is a}} qualifying change of ownership in relation to the company, then an accounting period of the company ends on the day of that qualifying change in ownership, and a new accounting period begins on the following day.

25|$|Corporate finance {{concerns}} the two money raising options for limited companies. Equity finance involves the traditional method of issuing shares {{to build up}} a company's capital. Shares can contain any rights the company and purchaser wish to contract for, but generally grant the right to participate in dividends after a company earns profits and the right to vote in company affairs. A purchaser of shares is helped to make an informed decision directly by prospectus requirements of full disclosure, and indirectly through restrictions on financial assistance by companies for purchase of their own shares. Debt finance means getting loans, usually {{for the price of a}} fixed annual interest repayment. Sophisticated lenders, such as banks typically contract for a security interest over the assets of a company, so that in the event of default on loan repayments they may seize the company's property directly to satisfy debts. Creditors are also, to some extent, protected by courts' power to set aside unfair transactions before a company goes under, or recoup money from negligent directors engaged in wrongful trading. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, UK insolvency law requires an administrator to attempt a rescue of the company (if the company itself has the assets to pay for this). If rescue proves impossible, a company's life ends when its assets are liquidated, distributed to creditors and the company is struck off the register. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> becomes insolvent with no assets it can be wound up by a creditor, for a fee (not that common), or more commonly by the tax creditor (HMRC).|$|E

25|$|Without a body to {{be kicked}} or a soul to be damned, a {{corporation}} does not itself suffer penalties administered by courts, but those who stand to lose their investments will. A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> {{does not have enough}} assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors. Yet if business remains successful, a company can persist forever, even as the natural people who invest in it and carry out its business change or pass away.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Australian {{government}} {{promised that}} the government-owned ASC, the company responsible for building the Collins class, would build the new submarines. In a May 2009 announcement about plans to release a request for tender, the Labor government indicated that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> other than ASC was the successful tenderer, that company would be granted access to ASC's shipyard in Osborne, South Australia. Despite ongoing support for the submarines {{to be built in}} South Australia by successive Coalition and Labor governments, in July 2014, the Abbott-led Coalition government abandoned their pre-election commitment to ASC-based construction and opened up the likely possibility of building the submarines at a foreign shipyard. In February 2015 the Abbott Government in announcing a 'competitive evaluation process' noted that the government would not approach the submarine decision with an 'open cheque book', but would rather allow a competitive process in which various construction options would be explored, including construction in Australia, overseas, or a 'hybrid approach' of foreign and local construction, along with estimated costs and schedules.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> {{has gone}} into an {{insolvency}} procedure, administrators or liquidators should aim to realise the greatest amount in assets to distribute to creditors. The effect is to alter orthodox private law rules regarding consideration, creation of security and limited liability. The freedom to contract for any consideration, adequate or not, is curtailed when transactions are made for an undervalue, or whenever it comes after the presentation of a winding up petition. The freedom to contract for any security interest is also restricted, as a company's attempt to give an undue preference to one creditor over another, particularly a floating charge for no new money, or any charge that is not registered, can be unwound. Since the Cork Report's emphasis on increasing director accountability, practitioners may sue directors by summary procedure for breach of duties, especially negligence or conflicts of interest. Moreover, and encroaching on limited liability and separate personality, a specific, insolvency related claim was created in 1986 named wrongful trading, so if a director failed to put a company into an insolvency procedure, and ran up extra debts, when a reasonable director would have, he can be made liable {{to contribute to the}} company's assets. Intentional wrongdoing and fraud is dealt with strictly, but proof of a mens rea is unnecessary in the interest of preventing unjust enrichment of some creditors at others' expense, and to deter wrongdoing.|$|E
