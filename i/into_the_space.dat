5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Sibley's parent, May Co., merged {{operations}} with Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Kaufmann's. That same year, local chain AM's (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) {{moved from the}} nearby Thruway Mall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> originally planned for B. Altman. The owner of the Thruway Mall sued the AM's chain, claiming breach of contract; the chain would later be declared liable for damages to the Thruway Mall, which was subsequently torn down and rebuilt as a strip mall in the early 1990s. Finally, Hoyts sold the Walden Galleria theater complex to General Cinemas {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E

5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> capsule that will return {{him to his}} home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Amazon {{continued}} to occupy their floors during {{rehabilitation of the}} structure. In 2003, the clinical group practice of the PHPDA officially split off to form a 501(c)3 health care organization, PacMed Clinics(doing business as Pacific Medical Centers or PMC). The Pacific Medical Center Clinic continues {{to operate in the}} first two floors of the building. In 2010, Amazon.com ended its sub-lease with WRC.Com Tower LLC and began the move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space.</b> The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> {{between two}} {{adjacent}} base pairs, {{this is called}} intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to antiporters, symporters move ions or molecules {{in the same}} direction. [...] In this case both ions being transported will be moved either from <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> or from <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space.</b> An example of a symporter is the sodium-glucose linked transporter or SGLT. The SGLT functions to couple the transport of sodium in <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> down its concentration gradient (again, established by the active transport of sodium out of the cell by <b>the</b> sodium-potassium pump) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> to <b>the</b> transport of glucose in <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> against its concentration gradient <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space.</b> <b>The</b> SGLT couples the movement of 1 glucose ion with the movement of 2 sodium ions.|$|R

5000|$|Antiporters use the {{mechanism}} of cotransport (coupling the movement of one ion or molecule down its concentration gradient with the transport of another ion or molecule up its concentration gradient), to move the ions and molecule in opposite directions. [...] In this situation one of the ions will move from <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> while <b>the</b> other ion will move from <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space.</b> An example of an antiporter is the sodium-calcium exchanger. The sodium-calcium exchanger functions to remove excess calcium from <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> against its concentration gradient by coupling its transport with the transport of sodium from <b>the</b> exoplasmic <b>space</b> down its concentration gradient (established by the active transport of sodium out of the cell by <b>the</b> sodium-potassium pump) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasmic <b>space.</b> <b>The</b> sodium-calcium exchanger exchanges 3 sodium ions for 1 calcium ion and represents a cation antiporter.|$|R
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, less than three years after it opened, due to an inability to pay off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the space}} between the opponent's {{defensive}} line and midfielder line ('the hole'): A common build-up of attacks is to pass the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> between the opponent's defenders and midfielders. Normally, an attacker {{with his back to the}} goal will receive the pass. He will seek to turn with the ball, or distribute it to a player facing the goal, who optimally also is in front of the opponent's midfielders - or even on the move <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> behind the opponent's defenders.|$|E
