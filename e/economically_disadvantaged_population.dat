The funding allocation for the JTPA is determined using a formula that is outlined in Title II. One-third of the funding is allotted based on the relative number of unemployed individuals living in areas of substantial unemployment, one-third {{is based on the}} relative excess number of the unemployed, and one-third is based on the relative number of economically disadvantaged individuals. A final stipulation of JTPA is that no state is allowed to receive below a minimum of one quarter of one percent of the total allotment. The money is further divided within the state based on the same criteria. (8) Inconsistencies are likely due to political variables that influenced the formula at the time these policies were developed. These variables include the legislative power of a state’s own representatives, a state’s ability to influence voters of legislators in other states and executive branch interests. The results of the study conducted by Svorny clearly demonstrate the importance of a state’s political power in influencing the votes of representatives (8).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{relative}} income hypothesis {{by considering the}} relationship between mortality, income and relative deprivation in South Africa using individual-level data on income and five measures of relative deprivation each with a different reference group. We find that income tends to be protective of, and relative deprivation detrimental to health, but the latter often gives a better account of mortality than does income alone. For some population groups the fit is improved in specifications which include both income and relative deprivation. Overall, {{there seems to be}} solid evidence in support of the relative income hypothesis, particularly for the more <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> groups. Relative deprivation is especially significant when age is the reference group, suggesting that the comparison of socio-economic standing that has an impact on health tends to happen within cohorts. The results are robust to splitting the sample into urban/rural subsamples and to looking at the incidence of illness as the health outcome rather than mortality. While {{little is known about the}} mechanisms underlying the effect of relative deprivation on health and mortality, the consistent evidence in favor of age as a reference group, particularly in a context like South Africa's suggests that intra-cohort comparisons should be an avenue for more in depth investigation.

30|$|The {{concept of}} EJ has been {{classified}} as four-fold (Kopnina 2010). The first conception refers to inequitable distribution of environmental burdens such as hazardous and polluting industries to vulnerable {{groups such as}} ethnic minorities or the <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>populations</b> (e.g. Carter 2007). The second conception refers to the developed and developing countries’ unequal exposure to environmental risks and benefits, such as the consequences of climate change. This is {{due in large part}} to the fact that the poorest people tend to live in the most polluted environments since in the rural areas of the developing world, they have been forced onto marginal areas by the process of enclosure, leading to deforestation, soil erosion, and agricultural failure (Singer and Evans 2013). A related concept is environmental racism, which typically involves placement of <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> or minority communities in proximity to environmentally degraded environments (Melosi 1995). Environmental racism includes any policy or practice that negatively affects the living environment of low-income or ethnically marginalized communities at a higher rate than affluent communities (Holifield 2001).|$|R
40|$|A 2. 5 × Selsi {{achromatic}} Galilean focusable {{telescope was}} calibrated for refraction at 6 m. In its calibration, minus power trial lens was {{placed at the}} objective of the telescope to simulate vergence of a target at a finite distance, before the back vertex power (BVP) of the telescope at each setting (telescope length) was measured by a focimeter. By using a graphical presentation of the results, the BVP of the telescope at each setting could be determined at different selected target distances. For a target vergence of − 0. 167 D or a distance of 6 m, the common testing distance in clinical practice, this calibrated telescope had a BVP or refraction measuring range of − 7. 27 –+ 7. 52 D. When this telescope was used to measure simulated manifest refractive errors at 6 m, it yielded a mean error of + 0. 13 D with a 95 % confidence limit of agreement of − 0. 38 –+ 0. 64 D. These results indicated that the accuracy and precision of telescopic refraction were comparable to that of retinoscopy. Therefore, the calibrated telescope could be considered as a reliable and inexpensive instrument for determining spherical refractive errors. Telescopic refraction is applicable in refracting <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> in under-served areas where modern equipment and electricity are not available. In addition, it provides an alternative subjective refraction method for low vision population because the magnification of this calibrated telescope has the advantage of allowing low vision patients to be refracted at the common 6 m testing distance in clinical practice.

40|$|While {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) are prevalent across economic strata, the <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> is disproportionately affected {{due to the}} high cost of traditional CVD management. Accordingly, developing an ultra-low-cost alternative, affordable even to groups {{at the bottom of the}} economic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative. Against this backdrop, we propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram(ECG) monitoring service. Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could indicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia. Note that a traditional telecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional diagnostic centre without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic accuracy of a bedside setup, albeit at high bandwidth cost. In this context, we aim at reducing cost without significantly sacrificing reliability. To this end, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that detects with high sensitivity the anomalous beats only which are then transmitted. We further compress those transmitted beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable reconstruction/diagnostic fidelity. Such a scheme would not only reduce the overall bandwidth requirement, but also localising anomalous beats, thereby reducing physicians' burden. Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system. In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC in one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than 9 % (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99. 15 % reduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118 -fold savings over traditional telecardiology.

Classroom observations and participant involvement in the field setting raised additional areas of interest. Thus, the focal point of this qualitative participant observation research included examining the classroom environment of an underrepresented and <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> when provided classroom experiences to prepare for the ACT. Settings were a public inner-city community college and a public urban university. The participants were African American students, the majority of whom were high school sophomores. The rest were high school graduates. The research question looks at what happens among students, computer-based learning, learning materials, and the instructor in a classroom environment when African American high school students and graduates accept an opportunity to be provided study skills and materials to prepare for the ACT. The research was conducted over two sessions [...] -an eight-week session and a four-week session [...] -involving two groups of students. The instructors and participant observer along with 26 student participants were engaged in teaching and learning in an ACT preparation course. The primary data sources were the observations, interviews, and the initial and post surveys completed by students. For this study's population, based upon data analysis, it appears that several situations occur among students, computer-based learning, instructional materials, and the instructor in a classroom environment when African American high school students and graduates accept an opportunity to be provided study skills and materials to prepare for the ACT. Older and more mature students seem to be more motivated than younger students. These older students were more focused on their career and life goals and found pleasure from a well-conducted, organized, and professional course. Last, it was determined that an instructor must be well prepared academically and have instructional strategies in place prior to entering the classroom for this group.

But incarceration is associated with modestly lower rates of social welfare receipt, especially for the less advantaged among the population of offenders. Further, bans on TANF receipt for drug felons enacted as part of welfare reform have not significantly affected this population’s attachment to the social welfare system.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to examine the}} negative effects of the current formal educational policy in Cape Verde and to recommend to the Ministry of Education some educational alternatives {{in order to deal with}} the out-of-school youth 2 ̆ 7 s problem in the country. Problem: The Legal system places outside secondary school the young who are considered overage (16 years old and above) to get her/his first application. actually and annually approximately one thousand young people leave middle school without possibility to pursue their secondary education. Generally, speaking, the out-of-school youths belong to the socially and <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>population</b> in the country. The state 2 ̆ 7 s obligation with national educational care is only for a period of six years of schooling comprised by four years of primary school and two years of middle school, addressed to pupils at ages 6 / 14 years old. High schools in Cabo Verde are located in the main islands, main cities, and urban areas. So, due to the lack of financial support to early move from small islands and from rural areas to secondary schools, this segment of young population cannot afford to pursue her/his education. Added to this problem, the legal and the minimum age for employment by the state is 18 years old and above. The state is the major employer in the country and requires as the minimum school 2 ̆ 7 s certification, the general course of high school, i. e. the first part (three years) of secondary education. Consequently the current practice is leaving a large portion of the young population unpowered, unskilled, and marginalized. It is also condemning them to poverty, illiteracy and to unprepared emigration. Underlying the idea of creating appropriate aged programs in order to meet the needs of out-of-school youth in Cape Verde, which is the purpose of this paper, are three basic assumptions. First, the Cape Verdean 2 ̆ 7 s strategy of development has one of its branches in the schooling access for all. Secondly, the educational reform in place in the country is trying to formulate a comprehensive and coherent educational development program which includes improving the curriculum with specified cognitive achievement.

40|$|Purpose - This paper explores how {{entrepreneurship}} education interacts with knowledge transfer and entrepreneurial behaviour {{in a conflict}} sub-Saharan African context. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth telephone interviews of 20 participants who benefited from {{entrepreneurship education}} knowledge transfer were used to document and analyse the effect of entrepreneurship education on their behaviours as micro-entrepreneurs in a conflict zone. Findings – These participants exhibited rare forms of innovative behaviour, through their business skills, gained from their involvement in entrepreneurship education. In relation {{to the effect of}} the conflict on their entrepreneurial behaviours, whereas it emerged the conflict was not the major barrier to entrepreneurial intentions, it however affected how they made strategic decisions about downsizing, advertising and future business plans. Consequently, these decisions altered at different junctures because of the conflict and therefore defined their coping strategies. Policy implications – The paper advocates a policy shift towards a more collaborative sub-regional approach to tackling the underlying causes of conflict in sub-Saharan Africa through investment in EE strategies as a spur to economic development. Central to this are a priori assumptions about <b>economically</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>populations</b> and their symbiotic relationship with conflict, a phenomenon frequently exploited by armed groups with deviant agenda.
