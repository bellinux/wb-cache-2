5000|$|It was {{previously}} called the <b>deltoideus</b> (plural deltoidei) {{and the name}} is still used by some anatomists. It is called so because {{it is in the}} shape of the Greek capital letter delta (Δ). It is also known as the common shoulder muscle, particularly in other animals such as the domestic cat. Deltoid is also further shortened in slang as [...] "delt".|$|E
50|$|The chest fly or {{pectoral}} fly (abbreviated to pec fly) primarily {{works the}} pectoralis major muscles {{to move the}} arms horizontally forward. If medially (internally) rotated, it is assisted in this by the anterior (front) head of the <b>deltoideus</b> in transverse flexion.

5000|$|Chiappe {{maintained}} that Rahonavis could probably fly, noting that its ulna {{was large and}} robust compared to Archaeopteryx, and that this fact, coupled with the prominent quill knobs, suggest that Rahonavis had larger and more powerful wings than that earlier bird. Additionally, Rahonavis shoulder bones show evidence of ligament attachments allowing the independent mobility needed for flapping flight. Chiappe concluded that Rahonavis was capable of flight, though {{it would have been}} more [...] "clumsy in the air than modern birds." [...] Agnolín and Novas (2013) noted that, like Microraptor, a bat-like flightstroke using the <b>deltoideus</b> complexes seems to have been likely in R. ostromi.|$|E
50|$|The {{arm socket}} faces {{backwards}} and downwards from a bone {{in the shoulder}} girdle called the coracoid, suggesting that the arms were held beneath the body. The large articular surface {{on the head of}} the humerus implies that the arms had a wide range of movement, but restricted to a parasagittal axis. The deltopectoral crest {{on the front of the}} humerus would have anchored large arm muscles to bring the arm forward while walking. Modern crocodilians also have a deltopectoral crest, but it is positioned laterally and anchors to muscles that pull the arms up to the sides, not forward. The muscle thought to have facilitated forward movement in Stratiotosuchus is called the <b>deltoideus</b> clavicularis; it is also present in modern crocodilians, which use it for high walking.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonography {{is a tool}} {{to detect}} a fatty {{degenerative}} atrophy of the teres minor and shows in affected muscles increased echogenicity and betimes a slight reduction in muscle bulk. MR imaging helps to consolidate the diagnosis of neurogenic muscle atrophy. Extracellular edema after traumatic events causing neural damage show an increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI sequences and normal intensity on T1-weighted sequences. Posterior humeral circunflex artery compression and reduced blood flow in stressful arm positions and or maneuvers can be diagnosed by a Doppler ultrasonography. The nerve should be detected adjacent to the vessel. In an elevated arm position the axillary neurovascular bundle {{can be seen at}} the posterior axillary fold just before it perforates the <b>deltoideus,</b> while the posterior course is well visible in the neutral position. For a detailed assessment of the artery, a MR angiography is required. The major task of an ultrasonographic examination is to rule out any space occupying mass. Additional electromyography is helpful to reveal any decelerated nerve conduction velocity, and thus denervation of the concerned muscle.|$|E

The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.In the pelvis, the ilium is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the Musculus iliofemoralis, the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus {{can be seen as a}} separate [...] "medial blade" [...] that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable [...] "foot" [...] with a convex lower profile.The thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

METHODS: We quantified muscle effort and fatigue using EMG {{analysis methods}} during powered wheelchair manoeuvres by 10 multiple sclerosis patients. Video {{recordings of the}} different sub-tasks were related to information on surface EMG amplitude (rectified EMG) and spectral information (Median frequency) from M. trapezius, M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars medius), M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars anterior), M. pectoralis, M. biceps, M. triceps, wrist extensors and flexors, using Joint Analysis of EMG Spectrum and Amplitude (JASA analysis). FINDINGS: Task durations and subjective data indicated that tasks requiring finer motor control took longer and were perceived as more difficult. Kinesiological functions of all muscle groups identified forward steering {{to be associated with}} activation of M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars anterior), M. pectoralis, M. trapezius and M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars medius); backwards steering with predominant activation of M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars medius), M. biceps brachii and wrist flexors; left steering with maximal activation of M. biceps and wrist flexors, and right steering with maximal activation of M. triceps and wrist extensors. These profiles were confirmed in analysis of the functional tasks. JASA analysis documented muscle fatigue in the wrist extensors, whereas increased activation was found in M. trapezius, M. <b>deltoideus</b> (pars anterior) and wrist flexors.

No difference was noted in enzyme activities of oxidative metabolism (citrate synthase, 3 -hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and glycolysis (hexokinase, lactate dehydrogenase). Electron microscopy showed a decrease in the volume density of lipids but no change in mitochondrial volume density and distribution. The results indicate that bedrest induces no major morphological and biochemical changes in <b>deltoideus</b> muscle, contrary to what was previously reported in vastus lateralis muscle. This lack of changes is probably related to an unaltered <b>deltoideus</b> muscle use...|$|E

We demonstrate a two- to six-fold overexpression of enzymes associated with glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and substrate transport in vastus lateralis compared to <b>deltoideus.</b> Expression levels of contractile protein isoforms correlated to the proportion of slow-twitch fibers in <b>deltoideus</b> compared to vastus lateralis are consistent with the different contractile properties of the two muscles. Two proteins involved in free radical homeostasis were differentially expressed, suggesting a direct relationship between radical scavenging and the muscle function. The application of 2 -DE and MS to studies of muscle physiology thus offers a more comprehensive assessment of the molecular determinants of muscle function than traditional approaches...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHandcycling, as a {{competitive}} sport, {{has been a}} Paralympic discipline since 2004 and is performed by handicapped athletes with impairments of the spine or brain. In this work a musculoskeletal model of a handcyclist is developed in the software AnyBody using kinematic data from a previous study of handcycling of one male elite handbiker (class: H 3. 2). The on- and offset timing of several muscles of the upper body (left and right of: m. pectoralis, m. <b>deltoideus,</b> m. biceps brachii and m. triceps brachii) were calculated with different thresholds and compared to results from surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements recorded during the previously mentioned subject study. It could be shown, that the mean overlap of muscle activation times was between a satisfying 64 % and 75 % depending on the threshold used. However, especially for m. <b>deltoideus</b> a very different on- offset behaviour was observed in the simulation than in the sEMG measurements resulting from the positioning of the electrodes in the subject study on one specific branch of the m. <b>deltoideus</b> and insufficient knowledge about the actual course of the crank torque for this specific athlete.

40|$|Cílem této studie bylo prozkoumat rozdíly mezi forehandovými horními točivými údery s 38 mm a 40 mm míčky ve stolním tenise. Účastník byl při provádění úderů filmován. Za účelem zajištění totožných podmínek při veškerých výkonech (stejné trajektorie přibližujícího se míčku) byl použit nahrávací stroj pro stolní tenis. Vzhledem k hráčově pravorukosti byly elektrody umístěny na pravé straně hráčova těla. Absolutní svalové zapojení bylo odhadováno na základě zprůměrovaných EMG signálů (mV) měřených ve všech svalech (m. biceps brachii, m. <b>deltoideus,</b> m. pectoralis major). Pro výpočet rozdílů mezi celkovými středními hodnotami zprůměrovaných EMG signálů mezi všemi svaly byla použita analýza rozptylu (ANOVA). Vrcholová amplituda EMG m. <b>deltoideus</b> {{anterior}} dosahovala u úderu s 38 mm míčkem hodnoty 2, 5 mV. U m. <b>deltoideus</b> medialis byly dosaženy s míčky obou velikostí srovnatelné hodnoty kontrakce: vrcholové hodnoty se pohybovaly v rozmezí 2, 3 a 2, 8 mV u 38 mm míčku a v rozmezí 2, 2 a 3, 0 mV u 40 mm míčku. U m. biceps brachii se vrcholová amplituda EMG pohybovala mezi 1 až 2, 2 mV u úderů s 38 mm míčky a od 1, 3 do 2, 4 mV u úderů s 40 mm míčky. Podobného výsledku bylo dosaženo u kontrakcí m. pectoralis major. U úderů s 38 mm míčkem byla dosahována poměrně nerovnoměrná intenzita kontrakcí, a to v rozmezí od 1, 5 mV do 2, 6 mV. Vyváženějších hodnot bylo dosaženo u úderů s 40 mm míčky, kdy se tyto pohybovaly mezi 1, 6 až 2, 2 mV. Tato zjištění nám ukázala, že u třech sledovaných svalů (m. <b>deltoideus</b> anterior, m. biceps brachii, m. pectoralis major) existují významné rozdíly v intenzitě EMG signálů, a můžeme tedy učinit závěr, že hráč při úderu s větším míčkem používá více svalové aktivity a že kontrakce m. pectoralis major je při úderu do většího míčku silnější. The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the differences between forehand top spin strokes with 38 mm and 40 mm balls in table tennis. The participant was filmed as he executed the strokes. To ensure the same condition for all the performances (the same approaching ball trajectory), a table tennis machine was used. Electrodes were placed on the right side of the player’s body due to his right-handedness. Absolute muscle involvement was estimated on the basis of averaged EMG signals (mV) measured in all muscles (m. biceps brachii, m. <b>deltoideus,</b> m. pectoralis major). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for calculating differences between overall mean values of averaged EMG signals among all muscles. The peak EMG amplitude of the m. <b>deltoideus</b> anterior reached a value of 2. 5 mV, for the 38 mm ball stroke. The comparable contraction values in strokes with balls of both sizes were obtained with the m. <b>deltoideus</b> medialis: the peak values ranged between 2. 3 and 2. 8 mV with a 38 mm ball and between 2. 2 and 3. 0 mV with a 40 mm ball. For the m. biceps brachii the peak EMG amplitude ranged from 1 to 2. 2 mV and from 1. 3 to 2. 4 mV for the 38 mm and 40 mm ball strokes, respectively. A similar result was obtained for the m. pectoralis major contractions. Rather uneven intensities of contractions were obtained for the 38 mm ball strokes, ranging from 1. 5 mV to 2. 6 mV. More balanced values were obtained for the 40 mm ball strokes ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 2 mV. These findings showed us that in three observed muscles (m. <b>deltoideus</b> anterior, m. biceps brachii, m. pectoralis major) differences in the intensity of EMG signals are significant, so we can conclude that the player uses more muscle activities in a stroke with the larger ball, and also we conclude that the contraction of m. pectoralis major is more powerful when the player hits the larger ball...|$|E
