5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E

By {{the end of}} 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The Kwilu Rebellion broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of Idiofa and Gungu in Kwilu Province. Further disruption and uprisings then spread to Kivu {{in the east and}} later to Albertville, sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger Simba Rebellion. The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advances northwards, capturing Port-Émpain, Stanleyville, Paulis and Lisala between July and August.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great <b>Disruption</b> <b>in</b> the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E

The loss of their mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at The Lambs, a New York actors' club.|$|E

On January27, the cyclone crossed 80°E into the southwest Indian Ocean, at which time it was renamed Fanja. While in the basin, the storm reached peak winds of 80km/h (50mph). It continued moving to the southwest before dissipating on January30.|$|E
5|$|As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, {{thousands}} of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights {{in and out of the}} area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9million (2006USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103km/h (63mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193km/h (119mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbour. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1in (207.5mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71m (8.89ft) was recorded.|$|E
