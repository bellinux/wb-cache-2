40|$|ABSTRACT. Matchmaking is a {{key issue}} in {{electronic}} negotiation scenarios, and is often defined as the automatic ranking {{of a set of}} offers with reference to a set of requests. Once such an initial ranking has been achieved, individual negotiations between participants making offers and requests can be launched. Matchmaking is often an important phase in any e-negotiation system, as it enables the selection of suitable participants between which negotation should take place. We describe a generic MatchMaking Shell, which enables service independent matchmaking, and one which is able to support matching via user defined algorithms. Moreover, this shell can cater for domain specific data models (defined in XML). A definition of this shell and a prototype implementation are described. Finally, an evaluation to determine its effectiveness by measuring the performance and the matchmaking quality within a on-line bookshop is presented. RÉSUMÉ.

Her sympathetic nature showed itself in this as in other things; she was always sending bonnes bouches to her friends, and trying to communicate to them her science and taste {{in the affairs of}} the table. Madame de Longueville, who had not the luxurious tendencies of her friend, writes: “Je vous <b>demande</b> au nom de Dieu, que vous ne me prépariez aucun ragoût. Surtout ne me donnez point de festin. Au nom de Dieu, qu’il n’y ait rien que ce qu’on peut manger, car vous savez que c’est inutile pour moi; de plus j’en ai scrupule.” But other friends had more appreciation of her niceties. Voiture thanks her for her melons, and assures her that they are better than those of yesterday; Madame de Choisy hopes that her ridicule of Jansenism will not provoke Madame de Sablé to refuse her the receipt for salad; and La Rochefoucauld writes: “You cannot do me a greater charity than to permit the bearer of this letter to enter into the mysteries of your marmalade and your genuine preserves, and I humbly entreat you to do everything you can in his favor. If I could hope for two dishes of those preserves, which I did not deserve to eat before, I should be indebted to you all my life.” For our own part, being as far as possible from fraternizing with those spiritual people who convert a deficiency into a principle, and pique themselves on an obtuse palate as a point of superiority, we are not inclined to number Madame de Sablé’s friandise among her defects.

Sur toutes les eaux clarifiées ultrafiltrées, la fraction supérieure à 1 kd reste majoritaire.

The following paper {{presents the}} work being carried out in a general study of natural organic matter. The three lines of work chosen by SAUR concern:- The fluorescence of natural waters or humic substances (SlMON et al., 1993); - The determination of dissolved hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances on each step of a water treatment plant (CROUE et al, 1992 a and b); - The molecular weight fractionation of dissolved organic matter, subject of this paper. The different raw or clarified waters (respectively rw and cw) were sampled in SAUR water plants. Some inorganic analytical characteristics of some raw waters are given in table 1. All raw and clarified water samples were characterized according to total organic carbon (TOC), UV absorbance (254 nm) and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) under the following conditions: about 20 °C, 4 mg Cl 2 /mg TOC, and a 72 -hour contact time in the dark. A Dohrmann DC 80 and a Uvikon 930 {{were used for the}} determination of TOC (DOC) and UV-absorbance at 254 nm, respectively. When a preoxydation step was employed at the water plant, the clarification treatment was performed with a laboratory apparatus described in another paper (LEFEBVRE and LEGUBE, 1990). Bioeliminable Organic Dissolved Carbon in water was determined by the method described by JORET and LEVI (1986). Cl 2 and ClO 2 demands of raw and clarified waters were conducted as batch operations with oxidant doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg oxidant per mg TOC. Residual chlorine and chlorine dioxide in solutions were determined respectively by spectrophotometric measurements by two colorimetric methods: the DPD and ACVK methods. Ultrafiltration was conducted on raw and clarified waters to determine apparent molecular weight distribution (AMW). Organic matter distribution was determined with an Amicon system (stirred cell) with membranes characterized by nominal cutoff limits of 10, 1 and 0. 5 kilodaltons. For each cutoff membrane, we took the initial water and a new membrane was used for each filtration. All permeates were characterized according to TOC and UV absorbance. In the case of clarified waters, the results included all the data, whatever the coagulant salt and its applied dosage. As shown in figures 1 and 2, no relation exists between UVrw absorbance or the ratio UVrw/TOCrw and TOCrw. For the same raw water, the ratio UVrw/TOCrw fluctuates according to a change between fulvic, humic and hydrophilic acids during the seasons (fg. 3). A better relation between UVcw and TOCcw was obtained: UVcw (254 nm, 5 cm) = 0. 1091 TOCrw - 0. 0231 (r 2 = 0 758), demonstrating that organic matter, which resists coagulation, has quite the same aromaticity whatever the water source (fig. 9). An approximation of TOCcw can be done by a simple measurement of UVcw at 254 nm. Figure 4 shows a correlation between DOCrw and TOCrw (DOCrw (mg/l) = 0. 888 TOCrw + 0. 094; r 2 : 0. 945). Except for 2 waters, UV absorbance removal was greater than TOC removal (fig. 13). The AMW distribution of all the studied waters was influenced in the same degree by clarification, with a shift in DOC and UV absorbance to the 10 kd fraction can represent at most 49. 7 % and 57. 3 % respectively of TOCcw and UVcw absorbance. All of the coagulants (ferric chloride, aluminium sulfate or prepolymerised alum salts) were completely in effective in removing dissolved organic matter with an AMW of legs than 500 daltons. The significant removal of high molecular weight compounds is followed by a small reduction in the THMFP expressed in µg per mg of TOC. The THM formation potential (THMFP) of raw waters is affected by the water source. Chloroform accounted for 85. 4 % of the THMFPrw and its average value was 63 µg per mg TOCrw. The clarified waters showed a marked difference in their THMFP distribution. Chloroform percentage was very different, ranging between 30 and 93 % of THMFPcw. Clarification treatment slightly reduced the Cl 2 and CIO 2 demands of the waters: 2. 7 mg Cl 2 /mg TOCrw and 23 mg Cl 2 /mg TOCcw; 25 mg ClO 2 /mg TOCrw amd 2. 3 mg ClO 2 /mg TOCcw. An estimation of TOC removal by coagulation with aluminium salts can be done by ultrafiltration of this unknown water with a nominal cutoff of 10 kd (fig. 15). The value of the fraction above 10 kd or below 1 kd could be a useful parameter for the determination of the type of an unknown water, whatever the analytical parameters (tables 3 a and 3 b). In the case of reservoir raw waters, the order of fractions distribution was logical, whatever the analytical parameters (TOC or UV absorbance) : the > 10 kd fraction; the 10 kd >> 1 kd fraction and the < 1 kd fraction (fig. 6 and 7). Figures 6 and 7 do not show the same sequence in the case of river water (e. g. : Mayenne, Garonne, Thames, [...] .). No relation exists between BDOCrw and TOCrw or UVrw/TOCrw ratio (Fis. 5 a and 5 b). BDOCrw represents 0 to 36. 4 percent of TOCrw. BDOC removal by coagulation is very different from one water to another (table 5), varying from 35 % to 100 %...|$|R

EXTENDED ABSTRACTGestural control of speech or singing synthesis is difficult, because of the very fast articulators motions encountered in speech and singing. For singing, another difficult question is accurate rhythmic coordination and precision, because syllables must coincide with musical beats, at a given tempo. Then, the precise location of beats for different syllables must be controlled. Two singing synthesis instruments are presented : Digitalis Cantor and Digitartic. Both instruments use bimanual writing or drawing gestures on graphic tablets. The voice signal is computed {{with the help of}} a parametric synthesizer, including a voice source model, consonantal noise models and series/parallel formant filters. Cantor Digitalis is a vowel and semi-vowel singing instrument. Digitartic is an extension of Cantor Digitalis and allows for singing syllables, including plosives, fricative, liquid and nasal consonants. Any in-between canonical place of articulation is possible by linear interpolation of the consonant parameters, for each mode of articulation. In this paper, the focus is given on Digitartic through the issue of consonant gestures and musical beat synchronization. Three modes of Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV) articulation are discussed according to three levels of rhythmic precision and musical context. A VCV articulation is composed of the onset phase (articulators approaching the position of maximum constriction), the medial phase (maximum of constriction) and the offset phase (constriction release). Offset phase of plosives is very short compared to other consonants. The first control mode consists of triggering the syllable at the beginning of the onset phase. However, when the syllable starts on the musical beat, it is perceived with a delay depending on the duration of articulation phases. Anticipating precisely this delay is very difficult. The second control mode of control allows for triggering the VCV dissyllable in two steps. In the first step, the onset phase is triggered, and in the second step, the offset phase is triggered. In this way, plosives can be synchronized with musical beats without any delay. The third control mode is a continuous control of the phases of articulation, without any triggering. This requires a fast synthesis engine, a high interface sampling rate, as well as an expert control gesture, fast and precise enough to reproduce speech articulation phases. The continuous control mode of articulation is performed by a back-and-forth gesture with the pen of the non-preferred hand, along the vertical dimension of the graphic tablet. Place of articulation is continuously controlled along the horizontal dimension, and the mode of articulation is assigned to different areas on the tablet. This back-and-forth gesture is analog to the somewhat symmetric articulation of the VCV dissyllable. The gesture amplitude allows for different degrees of articulation (hypoarticulation to hyperarticulation). Controlling durations of each phase of articulation is another mean to increase expressiveness. The preferred hand is controlling pitch, vocal effort and vowel quality on another graphic tablet. Then it is possible to modify pitch and vocal effort during each phase of articulation. Cantor Digitalis and Digitartic allow for expressive musical performances. They are regularly used for concerts. Deux instruments de synthèse vocale sont présentés : le Cantor Digitalis et le Digitartic. Ces deux instruments utilisent des gestes bimanuels dérivés de l’écriture ou du dessin sur une tablette graphique. Le signal est calculé par un synthétiseur vocal paramétrique, comprenant des modèles de source voisée et de bruits consonantiques et une structure à formants série/parallèle, pour le conduit vocal. Le Cantor Digitalis permet de chanter des voyelles et des semi-voyelles. Le Digitartic permet de chanter des syllabes, avec des consonnes plosives, fricatives, liquides et nasales. La question de la synchronisation des gestes consonantiques et des appuis rythmiques <b>demandés</b> par la musique est discutée. Ces instruments permettent un jeu musical expressif et sont régulièrement utilisés en concert...|$|R
