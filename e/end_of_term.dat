5|$|The Security Council {{is made up}} {{of fifteen}} member states, {{consisting}} of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>term</b> date)—Bolivia (term ends 2018), Egypt (2017), Ethiopia (2018), Italy (2018), Japan (2017), Kazakhstan (2018), Senegal (2017), Sweden (2018), Ukraine (2017), Uruguay (2017). The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.|$|E

When this script too failed, it was replaced in turn by Pip & Jane Baker's Terror of the Vervoids. It was later adapted as Paradise 5 by Andy Lane for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in March 2010.|$|E

3000|$|Overall, the {{direction}} of the relationship between social identification and knowledge and performance remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, the next set of research questions asked: (a) to what extent does physics identification at the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>term</b> in an introductory physics course predict various achievement outcomes (outlined below) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>term?</b> (research question 4); (b) To what extent does academic achievement predict STEM identification at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>term?</b> (research question 5). Drawing on previous research, the following hypotheses were tested: controlling for pre-term physics knowledge (FCI scores), higher physics identification at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>term</b> will be related to higher scores on a physics knowledge test (FCI scores) (hypothesis 4 a) and higher physics course grades (hypothesis 4 b) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>term.</b> Additionally, controlling for pre-term physics knowledge (FCI scores), higher post physics knowledge scores (hypothesis 5 a) and physics course grades (hypothesis 5 b) will be related to more physics identification at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>term.</b> 1 [...]...|$|R
25|$|The Court {{announced}} its decision in July, near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>term.</b> Harry Blackmun wrote for a five-justice majority that affirmed the First Circuit's holding that the statutory claims were arbitrable and reversed it by holding the antitrust claims arbitrable as well. John Paul Stevens' lengthy dissent argued primarily that the arbitration clause was inapplicable to the dispute, and the precedent against arbitrating antitrust claims was far {{stronger than the}} majority represented it to be. Justice Lewis Powell took no part in the case.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>term.</b> Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies {{a wide variety of}} agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; Sweet Corn - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary - Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.|$|E

Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to}} him {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E

2500|$|On May 2 the Turkish Constitutional Court ruled (9-2) {{that the}} first round of the presidential {{elections}} as void due to insufficient participation.
