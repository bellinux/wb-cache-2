5|$|In January, Lee lost in {{the final}} of Korea Open to Chen Long, his fourth {{straight}} defeat by the Chinese. He recorded his tenth Malaysia Open title a week later. Soon after the triumph, he announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last Malaysia Open outing, as he would assess his condition after the Asian Games and might retire if the results were not good.|$|E
5|$|Frost {{also met}} RAF Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox, who {{had volunteered to}} {{accompany}} C Company for the operation; as an expert radio mechanic, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> job to locate the Würzburg radar set, photograph it, and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain. Derek Garrard of Jones' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox, as {{he would be the}} object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform, but the War Office were obdurate.|$|E
5|$|In early 2016, at {{a meeting}} with Pope Francis, he gave a charity {{donation}} and spoke about environmental issues. A few days later, possibly influenced by his meeting with DiCaprio, the Pope said he would act in a planned faith-based charity film, Beyond the Sun. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> first acting experience, and would also {{be the first time}} in history that a Pope appeared in a feature film.

5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> break-out role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> final {{match for}} the Red and Whites, though, as {{at the end of}} the season he agreed to sign for Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach. He made 120 {{appearances}} for Atlético Madrid over the course of a four-year span, scoring six goals and earning three winners' medals. Domínguez later revealed that the club's lack of trust in academy players had contributed to his decision to sign for Gladbach.|$|E
5|$|Somerset were captained for {{the third}} {{successive}} season by their Australian overseas player, Justin Langer, who announced during the season that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last with Somerset.

5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his.</b>|$|E
5|$|Such was his {{influence}} that Mertens was named new club captain for the 2008–09 Eerste Divisie season. Mertens excelled {{in his new}} role and contributed a further 13 goals for the season which contributed to him being awarded the Golden Bull award for the most talented player in the Eerste Divisie. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last season with the club, however, as {{at the end of}} the season he agreed to join Eredivisie side Utrecht. Mertens made 110 appearances across all competitions for AGOVV during his three seasons at the club and netted 31 goals.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to the Bruins {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not as sharp as he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided the Bruins to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. The Bruins were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October when he learned it was cancer, {{possibly}} caused by his frequent cigar smoking. Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last public appearance. In March of the following year, the New York Times announced that Grant was dying of cancer and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him {{to the rank of}} General of the Army with full retirement pay (Grant's assumption of the Presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his pension).|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{retained}} the League title in 1982–83, 11 points above Watford. Liverpool exited the FA Cup and European Cup {{in the fifth}} round and quarter-final respectively. A 1983 Football League Cup Final, 2–1 win over Manchester United meant Liverpool won that trophy for a third straight year. Alan Kennedy's late equaliser of Norman Whiteside's goal took the final to extra-time. Whelan scored the winner. Pre-season, Paisley announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last before retiring from management aged 64. Paisley won six League titles, three European Cups and three League Cups during his managerial reign, the most successful in Liverpool's history. His assistant, Joe Fagan, took over.|$|E
5|$|Mertens {{added to}} his {{silverware}} {{at the start of}} the following season as PSV beat Ajax 4–2 to lift the Johan Cruyff Shield. On 30 September 2012, Mertens and Jürgen Locadia, who was making his Eredivisie debut, both scored hat-tricks as PSV defeated VVV-Venlo 6–0. Mertens ultimately scored 14 league goals, and 16 across all competitions as PSV ended the season as runners-up to Ajax in the Eredivisie. He also aided his side's cause with a further 17 assists. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> final season in the Eredivisie, however, as at the conclusion of the campaign PSV accepted an offer from Serie A side Napoli for his signature. Mertens departed Eindhoven having made 88 appearances and scored 45 goals over the course of two seasons.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> longest relationship.|$|E
5|$|Ranking {{fourth in}} the Eastern Conference going into the 1996 playoffs, Jovanovski helped the Panthers advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. He scored his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal in Game 2 {{of the first round}} against Boston Bruins goaltender Craig Billington. Facing the Colorado Avalanche in the Finals, the Panthers were {{defeated}} in four-straight games. Jovanovski contributed a goal and nine points in 22 post-season games. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> only Stanley Cup Finals appearance. In the off-season, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. He was also nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League's rookie of the year, alongside Chicago Blackhawks forward Éric Dazé and Ottawa Senators forward Daniel Alfredsson, who ultimately won the award.|$|E
5|$|Ocampos' first {{opportunity}} with River Plate's senior side came in 2011 following the club's relegation to the Nacional B {{for the first}} time in their history. He was awarded his first-team debut by manager Matías Almeyda on 16 August 2011, aged 17, against Chacarita Juniors and scored his first goal for the club in the following match, netting River's opener in a 3–1 win over Independiente Rivadavia. Ocampos and Almeyda's paths had previously crossed at Quilmes where Almeyda had been a player at the time of the Ocampos' arrival at the academy. Ocampos soon established himself as a regular in the starting eleven and was instrumental in River securing the club's promotion back to the Primera División, ending the season with 7 goals to his name in 38 appearances. His form throughout the season had also seen him named by FIFA as one of the Players to Watch in 2012. He made his Primera División debut on the opening day of the following season against Belgrano. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> final appearance for the club, however, as on 6 August 2012 he completed a transfer to French club Monaco.|$|E

5|$|On November 12, 2010, Garland {{made his}} career debut with Virginia Tech against the Campbell Fighting Camels, seeing one minute of playing {{time on the}} court and going 0-of-1 from the field. However, the Hokies easily won the game, 70–60. Garland scored his first points as a Hokie on November 26, vs Oklahoma State, putting up 6 in spite of very limited playing time. He was allowed to play more than 20 minutes {{for the first time in}} his collegiate career against Mount St. Mary's. The {{opposing}} team was easily defeated, 99–34. Seven of the ten Hokies that appeared throughout the contest played more than 20 minutes, and Garland–who recorded 16 points–was one of five to score double digits. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> season-high performance and also the only time he scored more than 10 points as a freshman. On March 16, 2011, Garland played a career-high 23 minutes vs Bethune-Cookman in the first round of the 2011 National Invitational Tournament (NIT), recording seven points and having perfect free throw shooting. In 6.8 minutes per game in his first season, he averaged 2.8 points, 0.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs began 1930 in good form, and, with Rhodes, {{was added}} to the {{selection}} panel again for the Ashes series that season. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 and 74; he top-scored in both innings, but failed in the next two Tests. Before the third and fourth Tests, feeling tired and concerned by his form, he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion. When he batted in the fourth Test, he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final Test was to be played to a finish, but before it began, Hobbs announced that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>his</b> last. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record career-aggregate of 54,896 first-class runs. Before the deciding Test, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. The press speculated that Hobbs would replace him, but Bob Wyatt was chosen; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors. In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, {{in the face of a}} large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him three cheers. Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed, and Australia won the match and series. In his final series, he scored 301 runs at 33.44. In 61 Tests, he had scored 5,410 runs at an average of 56.94. He retired as the leading run-scorer in Test matches, a record he held until it was passed by Wally Hammond in 1937. Maintaining his form for the rest of the season, Hobbs scored 2,103 first-class runs in 1930 at 51.29.|$|E
