Price differentials over regions depend in part upon the number and locations of firms which sell to these regions, and on the demand curves of buyers. The present paper evaluates the price policy of a firm selling over a set of linearly extended buying points. It derives the optimal spatial prices under alternative assumptions of consumer behavior and demand. It demonstrates mathematically as well as graphically that a spatial monopolist maximizes profits by subdividing his market into economic submarkets, utilizing <b>fob</b> mill <b>prices</b> for some submarkets, and optimal discriminatory prices for the remaining ones.

40|$|A novel {{energy and}} cost {{effective}} transport chain for stranded natural gas utilized for power production with CO 2 capture and storage is developed. It includes an offshore section, a combined gas carrier, and an integrated receiving terminal. In the offshore process, natural gas (NG) is liquefied to LNG by {{liquid carbon dioxide}} (LCO 2) and liquid inert nitrogen (LIN), which are used as cold carriers. The offshore process is self-supported with power, hot and cold utilities and can operate with little rotating equipment and without flammable refrigerants. In the onshore process, the cryogenic exergy in LNG is used to cool and liquefy the cold carriers, which reduces the power requirement to 319 Â kWh/tonne LNG. Pinch and exergy analyses are used to determine thermodynamically optimized offshore and onshore processes with exergy efficiencies of 87 % and 71 %, respectively. There are very low emissions from the processes. The estimated specific costs for the offshore and onshore process are 8. 0 and 14. 6 <b>EUR</b> per <b>tonne</b> LNG, respectively, excluding energy costs.

30|$|The {{facts and}} {{arguments}} in the recent trade literature with which our model is consistent can be summarized as follows. Firm heterogeneity is a prominent phenomenon that translates into substantial differences in export participation and number of output-markets across firms (see Eaton et al. (2004, 2008); for a survey of this fast growing literature, see Bernard et al. (2007)). Furthermore, describing the current patterns of trade requires considering quality differentiation. International trade is decreasingly characterized by horizontal specialization across goods and increasingly characterized by quality specialization within goods (see Schott (2004); Hummels and Klenow (2005); Khandelwal (2007); and Fontagne et al. (2008) among others). In this context, Hummels and Skiba (2004) have documented {{a positive relationship between}} export quality and transportation costs to destination market, in line with the well-known Alchian–Allen effect. Baldwin and Harrigan (2007) and Johnson (2007) provide evidence in the same direction. 5 In particular, Baldwin and Harrigan (2007) find that unit prices of exports tend to increase with the remoteness of destination markets. They also show that previous standard firm-heterogeneous trade models without quality differentiation are inconsistent with this evidence. The reason is that more-efficient firms sell at lower (<b>fob)</b> <b>prices</b> in all markets; since only the more-efficient firms sell in the more-distant markets, more-distant markets should have lower average import (<b>fob)</b> <b>prices.</b> They argue that introducing quality differentiation seems to be the most plausible way to rebuild previous models in order to make them consistent with the new evidence. Specifically, the link between firm efficiency and output quality can explain the larger export prices to more-distant markets. This same firm-efficiency/output-quality link is the mechanism used in this paper’s model to explain the relationship between firm wages and human capital, on the one hand, and output-market remoteness on the other hand.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the pricing {{efficiency of the}} Quebec corn and soybean meal markets to answer a hypothesis {{on the part of}} the local livestock industry as to the existence of pricing inefficiency in the feed input industry. In evaluating the pricing efficiency of the markets, this research used two approaches: an analysis of market and an analysis using econometric models, focusing on price information structure accuracy and rapidity. The weekly data series of corn and soybean meal price are from selected cities in Canada and the US cover the crop years of 1990 [...] 1996. The accuracy is addressed by applying Faminow's model for testing the pricing systems and Houck's model for testing price transmission symmetry. The results showed that the Quebec corn market is accurate based on the evidence of (i) a relatively unconcentrated market structure; (ii) evidence of an <b>FOB</b> <b>pricing</b> system; and (iii) symmetric price adjustments. Even though the soybean meal market is also based on an <b>FOB</b> <b>pricing</b> system, it is not accurate because the price adjustments are asymmetric and its market structure is highly concentrated. The rapidity is addressed by applying Vector Error Correction (VEC) models in three ways: (i) by investigating the cointegration relationships, (ii) by assessing the strength of the relationships, and (iii) by measuring dynamic price response. The results showed that the strength of the relationships and the speed of Quebec corn price adjustment in response to external shocks are less than those found in Ontario and Southeastern US markets, while soybean meal is comparable to those markets. Thus, by means of an assessment of market structure, marketing margin, price information transmission accuracy and rapidity, this research concludes that the corn market in Quebec is relatively pricing efficient while the soybean meal market is not...|$|R
