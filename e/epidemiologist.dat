5|$|In 1717, {{the dark}} {{pigmentation}} of a postmortem spleen and brain {{was published by}} the <b>epidemiologist</b> Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. This {{was one of the}} earliest reports of the characteristic enlargement of the spleen and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas to the presence of flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease was}} named after the Brazilian {{physician}} and <b>epidemiologist</b> Carlos Chagas, who first described it in 1909. The disease was not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored). Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now Reduviidae: Triatominae) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the Trypanosoma genus, {{and was able to}} demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to marmoset monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed squirrel monkeys were also vulnerable to infection.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{named the}} {{pathogenic}} parasite as Trypanosoma cruzi and {{later that year}} as Schizotrypanum cruzi, both honoring Oswaldo Cruz, the noted Brazilian physician and <b>epidemiologist</b> who successfully fought epidemics of yellow fever, smallpox, and bubonic plague in Rio de Janeiro and other cities {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus Pneumocystis, later infamously linked to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS victims). Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus Schizotrypanum, but following the description of Pneumocystis by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name Trypanosoma cruzi.|$|E
40|$|In November 1989, {{representatives from}} 12 States {{attending}} the Annual Convocation of Southern State <b>Epidemiologists</b> completed a survey to enumerate <b>epidemiologists</b> working in central offices of State health departments. <b>Epidemiologists</b> were classified according {{to education and}} program area. A total of 117 <b>epidemiologists</b> were identified, yielding a range among the States of 0. 6 to 8. 3 (median 1. 9) <b>epidemiologists</b> per million population. The most common degree was a medical degree, followed by master's training in epidemiology or biostatistics; only 9 percent had doctoral training in epidemiology or biostatistics. More {{than one-third of the}} <b>epidemiologists</b> worked in infectious diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases, and about one-fifth worked in environmental epidemiology. The areas of injuries, cancer, chronic diseases, maternal and child health, and occupational health collectively accounted for about one-fifth of <b>epidemiologists.</b> The results of the survey suggest room for further epidemiologic training among health department <b>epidemiologists.</b> The results also identify areas where additional epidemiologic input would be beneficial...|$|R

5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with <b>epidemiologist</b> Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American <b>epidemiologist</b> Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On {{was used}} as the basis for a 1993 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO {{television}} film of the same name. It was produced by Aaron Spelling, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, and starred Matthew Modine as <b>epidemiologist</b> Don Francis and Richard Masur as William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control. Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for union-scale pay. The film was released the same year as Philadelphia and , which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it. Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS. However, And the Band Played On, along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.|$|E
5|$|The first hemisphere-wide {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} smallpox {{was made in}} 1950 by the Pan American Health Organization. The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all American countries except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. In 1958 Professor Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the World Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox. The proposal (Resolution WHA11.54) was accepted in 1959. At this point, 2 million people were dying from smallpox every year. Overall, however, the progress towards eradication was disappointing, especially in Africa and in the Indian subcontinent. In 1966 an international team, the Smallpox Eradication Unit, was formed {{under the leadership of}} an American, Donald Henderson. In 1967, the World Health Organization intensified the global smallpox eradication by contributing $2.4 million annually to the effort, and adopted the new disease surveillance method promoted by Czech <b>epidemiologist</b> Karel Raška.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Cancer {{screening}} procedures have brought great {{benefit to the}} public's health. However, the science of cancer screening and the evidence arising from {{research in this field}} as it is applied to policy is complex and has been difficult to communicate, especially on the national stage. We explore how <b>epidemiologists</b> have contributed to this evidence base and to its translation into policy. Methods: Our essay focuses on breast and lung cancer screening to identify commonalities of experience by <b>epidemiologists</b> across two different cancer sites and describe how <b>epidemiologists</b> interact with evolving scientific and policy environments. Results: We describe the roles and challenges that <b>epidemiologists</b> encounter according to the maturity of the data, stakeholders, and the related political context. We also explore the unique position of cancer screening as influenced by the legislative landscape where, due to recent healthcare reform, cancer screening research plays directly into national policy. Conclusions: In the complex landscape for cancer screening policy, <b>epidemiologists</b> can increase their impact by learning from past experiences, being well prepared and communicating effectively. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{introduction}} of genetic approaches in respiratory epidemiology is novel for most <b>epidemiologists,</b> and the post-genome phase poses new challenges. After describing specific questions {{pertinent to the}} field of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, two main methodological aspects regarding technological and scientific advances are presented in this review. The first one concerns biological aspects in the genome and post-genome phases, i. e. how to study the genome, the transcriptome and the proteome. The second area concerns genetic epidemiology, considering design (case control and family based) and statistical analytical issues. Key aspects are large sample size, good phenotyping and the consideration of environment-by-gene interaction according to windows of opportunity. Needs that have been identified include the following. 1) Networking for setting standards in the field and access to sufficiently large samples. 2) Multidisciplinarity; the collaboration of <b>epidemiologists,</b> clinicians, geneticists and specialists in bioinformatics, in addition to specialists in disciplines less familiar to <b>epidemiologists,</b> to be prepared for new phenotypic characterisations based on transcriptome and proteome. 3) Training in genetic analytical techniques for some respiratory <b>epidemiologists,</b> as well as in respiratory epidemiology for some genetic <b>epidemiologists.</b> Implications for research, considering ethical aspects, public health aspects and organisational aspects in the field of genetic and environmental respiratory epidemiology also need to be addressed...|$|R
