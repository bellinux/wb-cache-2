50|$|The {{township}} {{was originally}} settled as a port for the produce from the proposed market town of Noarlunga a few kilometres upstream. The Onkaparinga River mouth proved unsuitable to coastal ketches, so produce was barged down river to the sandhills and then taken by horse <b>drawn</b> <b>rail</b> trucks to the jetty. The current jetty {{was constructed in}} 1921 and is the second jetty to have been constructed at Port Noarlunga. The original jetty, 30 metres south of the current jetty, was constructed in 1855, but was destroyed in several severe storms in the early 1900s.|$|E
5000|$|Kane {{and others}} in Baltimore, knowing the fever pitch of the city, sought to learn about plans for other troops to pass through town, but their telegrams north asking for {{information}} were largely ignored, probably at least partly because of Kane's well-known Southern sympathies. So {{it was on the}} next day, April 19, that Baltimore authorities had no warning that troops were arriving from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The first of the troops had arrived at the President Street Station, {{on the east side of}} town, and had successfully traveled the one-mile distance along East Pratt Street via horse <b>drawn</b> <b>rail</b> cars, to the Camden Street Station (now near modern [...] "Camden Yards"/Oriole Park baseball stadium) the west side, to continue to Washington. There a disturbance ensued that soon brought the attention of Marshal Kane. His police, (according to Mayor Brown's later memoirs), prevented a large and angry crowd “from committing any serious breach of the peace.” [...] Upon hearing reports that the mobs would attempt to tear up the rails leading toward Washington, Kane dispatched some of his men to protect the tracks.|$|E

25|$|A third {{locomotive}} named Alice {{was obtained}} in 1880 from Grant, Ritchie & Co of Kilmarnock. It was an 0-4-0 saddle tank. This time the engine arrived by rail, at Crossgates, and was then drawn {{through the streets}} on temporary <b>rails,</b> <b>drawn</b> by horses.|$|R
50|$|From the 1820s to the 1880s urban transit in North America {{began when}} horse-drawn omnibus lines started to operate along city streets. Examples {{included}} Gilbert Vanderwerken's 1826 omnibus service in Newark, New Jersey. Before long Omnibus companies sought to boost profitability of their wagons by increasing ridership along their lines. Horsecar lines simply ran wagons along rails {{set in a}} city street {{instead of on the}} unpaved street surface as the omnibus lines used. When a wagon was <b>drawn</b> upon <b>rails</b> the rolling resistance of the vehicle was lowered and the average speed was increased.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} railway in Britain was a wagonway system, a horse <b>drawn</b> wooden <b>rail</b> system, used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, {{perhaps from}} the 1560s.. A wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly {{as early as}} 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus {{about half a mile}} away. On 26 July 1803, Jessop opened the Surrey Iron Railway, south of London erroneously considered first railway in Britain, also a horse-drawn one. It was not a railway in the modern sense of the word, as it functioned like a turnpike road. There were no official services, as anyone could bring a vehicle on the railway by paying a toll.|$|R

50|$|These early mine {{railways}} used wooden rails, {{which in}} the early industrial revolution about Coalbrookdale, were soon capped with iron strapping, those were replaced by wrought iron, then with the first steam traction engines, cast iron rails, and eventually steel rails as each was in succession found to last much longer than the previous cheaper rail type.

50|$|As {{the early}} coal seams of the Northumberland Coalfield near the River Tyne were exhausted, waggonways were laid to serve pits sunk further north.

The first traffic begin in 1755 {{on a line}} from Shiremoor to Hayhol staithes, and was soon followed by more lines. Wooden rails were eventually replaced by wrought iron. Rope haulage was introduced from 1821, with the museum site being {{at the top of}} Prospect Hill. By the 1820s coal was coming from pits further to the north in Seghill, Backworth and Cramlington, while a pit at Murton near Shiremoor had also been added. In 1826 it also became the preferred route for coal coming from Fawdon to the west, to make it unnecessary to use keel boats further upriver.|$|R

5|$|Trains {{passing through}} Baltimore {{at that time}} could not proceed {{directly}} through the city without stopping. Southbound trains were decoupled at President Street Station {{on the east side}} of the city. Cars were <b>drawn</b> individually along <b>rails</b> on Pratt Street by horsepower to Camden Station on the west side of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, where the trains were reassembled. The initial cars encountered little resistance but soon a growing crowd of Baltimore citizens became increasingly agitated by the passing transports filled with troops. The crowd attacked the car carrying Company K with stones and bricks and derailed it by placing obstructions on the tracks. Railroad company workers managed to put the car back on track and Company K was the seventh and last company to reach Camden Station by rail. The crowd barricaded the rails by dumping cartloads of sand and dragging anchors from the nearby docks across them thus preventing further cars from passing.|$|R

Rail trespass and risk-taking behaviours are particularly high among 16 – 25 year olds.

The study involves focus groups with 117 young people and 43 interviews with stakeholders <b>drawn</b> from the <b>rail</b> industry alongside professionals involved in working with young people. Participants in the focus groups are shown a set of four safety videos which describe the dangers of trespass. The findings demonstrate a number of misconceptions about the dangers and legality of trespass among young people (e. g. lack of awareness of electrocution dangers). Material which includes emotional, ‘real-life’ information in the form of safety narratives is judged to be the most effective in communicating trespass risks. The study also underlines the importance of combining and integrating technical, educational and community-based efforts to reduce trespass...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} capitalization effects of proximity to rail transit and {{bus rapid transit}} (BRT) in fast-growing Beijing. Few related {{studies have been conducted}} for Chinese cities because the real estate market has only recently been established. Data were collected on apartment homes sold in the Beijing metropolitan area during 2011, and hedonic price modeling was employed to gauge the price premiums or discounts associated with proximity to transit stations. Overall, the authors identified an average price premium of around 5 % for properties near rail transit stations, but no statistically significant effects were detected at BRT station areas. Moreover, the authors found that station proximity effects increased both in magnitude and spatial extent at stations Incited farther from the city center and those surrounded by low- and middle-income neighborhoods. For example, the price premium was as high as 10 % in some suburban and low-income areas. The conclusion <b>drawn</b> was that <b>rail</b> transit investment was an effective strategy for Beijing to reshape its urban spatial structure, and local governments in China might consider a rail and property development model as a financing solution for rail transit investment. This study contributes to the evidence of capitalization effects of public transit from a booming and transitional economy...|$|R
