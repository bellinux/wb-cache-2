5000|$|These murals, {{of groups}} {{of men in}} various postures of waiting, {{reference}} photographs from Alexia Webster’s photographic series, Waiting for Work. The works imply different kinds of waiting particular to a contemporary South African context. As Faith47 told Wooster Collective, “Miners <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for justice. Workers <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for a living wage. People <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for service delivery. Refugees <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for assistance. Men <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for jobs. We <b>are</b> all <b>waiting</b> for an honest politician. So many people <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for others to do things first. To take the blame. To do things for them. To take the fall. To build the country. To admit defeat. There has <b>been</b> so much <b>waiting</b> {{in this country that}} much time has been lost.” ...|$|R

5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
