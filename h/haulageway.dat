40|$|Faulty {{insulators}} on mine trolley/track haulageways {{may allow}} {{the flow of}} leakage currents into the mine roof and ultimately result in combustion of the local roof material. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL), has devised a passive means to detect overheating insulators on direct current systems. The detector consists of a spring-loaded cartridge that ejects a reflective streamer of white Teflon tape when subjected to elevated temperatures. The cartridge assembly can be easily installed over the outer metallic shell of an existing trolley line insulator. If an insulator overheats due to ground leakage currents, the visible streamer alerts mine personnel traveling on the <b>haulageway...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} WF radio communication in coal mines, with particular {{reference to the}} rate of loss of signal strength along a tunnel, and from one tunnel to another around a comer is the concern of this paper. Of prime interest are {{the nature of the}} propagation mechanism and the prediction of the radio frequency that propagates with the smallest loss. The theoretical results are compared with published measurements. This work was part of an investigation of new ways to reach and extend two-way communications to the key individuals who are highly mobile within the sections and <b>haulageways</b> of coal mines...|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} main mine fans in {{underground}} mines are to induce airflow and continuously re- move hazardous gases and dust. While most larger mines use multiple fans to accomplish these tasks, many smaller mines employ {{only a single}} fan. This paper concentrates on those mines having only one fan to provide ventilation needs. If this fan should cease to function, {{it is likely that}} methane concentrations will in- crease in some areas of the mine. As a safety precaution, Federal Regulations require that personnel must be- gin evacuating the mine within fifteen minutes after fan stoppage. Powered haulage can be used to transport workers to the mine portal as long as travel is through areas where hazardous levels of methane are not expected. To determine where methane will accumulate along <b>haulageways</b> during a fan stoppage, air samples must be taken at specific areas and analyzed for hazardous gases. During this study, procedures were developed for measuring methane levels along the haulegeways that are used to exit a mine following stoppage of the main mine fan. Methane levels were measured in four different mines at selected underground locations during four planned fan stoppages. In these mines the measurements taken only at the specified locations showed that, if workers had used electrically powered haulage to exit the mine following a fan stoppage, the methane accumulated along <b>haulageways</b> during fan stoppages would not have significantly increased the risk of an ignition...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{magnetic field}} measurements in the Helvetia Coal Co. Lucene # 8 Mine {{for purposes of}} deriving a mapping of the magnetic field strength covering the major <b>haulageways</b> which contain conductors. The measurements were performed by Terry S. Cory, P. E. under U. S. Bureau of Mines purchase order P 0372716. Assisting in performance of the measurements were personnel from the Bureau of Mines, PMSRC, and Helvetia Coal Co. Acknowledgement is given to Engineer Tom Strong of Helvetia Coal Co. who accompanied the measurement team and who lended support in performing the measurements and in supplying valuable engineering information for use in evaluation of the results. The results of the testing at medium frequency show that coverage of the entire mine area containing conductors can be achieved employing wireless radio techniques whereby radio signals are coupled into and are carried by these conductors. These results confirm earlier qualitative testing of the Collins Mine Wireless Radios in this mine. These results, performed over the frequency range 71 - 2890 KHz, illustrate the effect of frequency on the radio propagation with {{the conclusion that the}} best overall coverage is obtained at frequencies approximating 1000 KHz. This report presents all the raw data and the reduced data in the form of magnetic field strength contour maps. Sufficient information is provided to enable independent reduction of the data. A summary of observations which can be made directly from the contour maps is given...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} the use of lightweight concrete in the density range of 100 Ib/ft 3 for liners in underground mines. Three test sections were completed: a monolithic, portal-type structure with integral walls and arch constructed aboveground; an underground test section constructed in a mine drift using plywood forms; and a second section constructed in a drift using an air-supported formwork. The lightweight concrete in the two underground test sections was placed using piston pumps and a slickline. Fiber reinforcement was added to the concrete in the mine sections without any apparent problems with either pumping or placement of the concrete. In another experiment, the Bureau and Hecla Mining Co., Mullan, rD, used lightweight concrete in the density range of 25 Iblfe to replace timber blocking in a raise preparation structure. Other experiments are described in which low-density, lightweight concrete blocks were produced for mine ventilation doors, stoppings, and barricades. Other mine uses reviewed include pillars and collapsing beams. An advantage of low-density concrete is that it will display up to 50 % deformation at a constant yield stress. These hlllovative concepts in deformable concrete lining systems will aid mine operators by decreasing capital and maintenance costs, increasing the available space in underground <b>haulageways,</b> and providing productivity gains and improved resource recovery in the soft, caving, squeezing, or bursting grollnu conditions often found in deep mines...|$|R
5000|$|The basic geology of the Jeddo Tunnel's {{watershed}} {{was created}} 345 million years ago, during the Carboniferous Period. [...] The Jeddo Tunnel itself was {{established at the}} end of the 19th century. John Markle was one of the people involved in designing the tunnel; he spent three years and $1,000,000 on the construction of the tunnel. Two teams of workers used compressed air drills and explosives to build the tunnel from both ends. A total of 250 workers were involved in the construction of the tunnel. The construction finished on September 15, 1894. The construction of the Jeddo Tunnel used up 170 tons of forcite, a Belgian gel dynamite. The Jeddo Tunnel's original purpose was to remove the water from deep coal mines in the eastern middle anthracite field. However it also connects to mining operations near Hazleton. The construction of the tunnel involved the channeling of streams, as well as the construction of <b>haulageways.</b> When constructed, the tunnel was considered to be an engineering marvel; however, in modern times, Alan C. Gregory describes it as [...] "a dinosaur that survived extinction". The tunnel ceased to be used in 1955, when the deep-mining industry stopped, and the mines in the area were largely abandoned in 1961. However Pagnotti Enterprises still mines anthracite in the vicinity of the tunnel. The water quality of the Jeddo Tunnel has improved slightly since the deep-mining industry stopped.|$|R
40|$|Rock {{masses in}} deep level mines {{are subject to}} high stresses, which can result in {{unexpected}} failure of rock into mined-out openings. Historically, various independent methods {{have been used to}} discern the causes of rock bursts and to evaluate stress conditions in rock masses susceptible to violent failure. Personnel from two research centers of the former U. S. Bureau of Mines, Spokane and Twin Cities, investigated a rock burst that occurred in May of 1994 in a rock mass between the 4400 and the 4600 levels of the Sunshine Mine, Kellogg, ID. The team evaluated the current state of stress in the pillar and the most likely cause of the rock burst by studying the seismic history of the pillar, examining the geology, analyzing the available in situ stress data, calculating possible fault-plane solutions for the burst, and performing a seismic velocity tomographic survey. The results of the study showed that post-rock-burst seismicity was concentrated about 15 to 30 m west of and about 15 m above the rock-burst location. The pillar is composed of a very hard sericitic-to- vitreous quartzite of a type rarely found in the mine, but that is often found in other district mines having a history of seismic activity. In situ stress analysis of the pillar and the surrounding rock mass showed a probable stress rotation from northwest-southeast to east-west. Of four fault plane solutions, the most probable was either a left-lateral, strike-slip movement with a compressive principal stress oriented nearly north-south, or a right-lateral, strike-slip movement oriented east-west. Finally, tomographic images showed low-velocity areas (interpreted as areas of low stress) associated with the crosscuts and <b>haulageways,</b> and high-velocity areas (interpreted as areas of high stress) associated with the rock-burst location. High velocities were also found in a planar area oriented in an elongate northeast-southwest direction...|$|R
40|$|Three {{types of}} {{communication}} systems have become popular in solving communication requirements underground: Loud-speaking pager phones, carrier current phones, and magneto ringing phones. Basically, {{all three are}} simply single-channel party line systems. Although these systems are quite reliable, the single channel creates a variety of problems. For example- 1. Since no call is confidential, messages are sometimes purposely made vague, especially if accidents or safety topics are being discussed. 2. A potential user must literally "wait in line" until the channel becomes clear for his use; thus, when foremen {{have to wait to}} call in reports or supply requests, this single chan-nel creates a serious productivity bottleneck. 3. In many large mines, there are independent branch lines that must be tied together by a dispatcher, adding further delays to the system. To solve these problems, some mines have installed other phone systems-mostly commercial dial phones in industrial enclosures that offer extra channel capacity and private line features. Others have installed a system that combines both dial- and page-phone features in a single unit. Although these do represent improvements, they do not truly solve the overall problems that face modern mines. Besides extra channels, a communication system should have the following features to enhance productivity and safety: 1. A means of paging a roving miner to alert him that he is wanted on the phone. 2. Wireless-to-wired system interconnects by which a miner can talk on the wired phone system by using a remote portable radio. 3. Remote monitors that alert personnel when there is a toxic or explosive gas buildup. 4. Control interfaces that allow remote control of fans, pumps, or other devices. 5. Transmitters and receivers that can serve as emergency links. 6. Loopback that allows an alternate path of communications if the main path is cut. This chapter focuses on equipment and methods to meet the special communication needs of individuals in various places of the underground mine. The communication requirements can be broken down into four categories: 1. The mine entrance (shaft communication). 2. Permanent and semipermanent locations (shop areas, lunchroom, crusher stations, etc.). 3. Mining areas (the room-and-pillar sections, longwall faces, block caving areas, etc.). 4. <b>Haulageways</b> (tracked trolley haulage, diesel, belt haulage). Methods of implementing systems to meet the communication needs of these areas are described in sections 3. 2 through 3. 5. Section 3. 6 discusses methods of satisfying special communication requirements that exist. Major topics in this category include communications with roving personnel, the isolated miner, and motorman-to-snapper communications. Emergency communication systems are described in section 3. 7.
