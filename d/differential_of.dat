5|$|Bridenbaugh's first {{assistant}} {{coaching job}} {{was with the}} Oberlin Yeomen of Oberlin College under head coach T. Nelson Metcalf. He then spent two seasons at Kiski Preparatory School in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania and another two at Beaver Falls High School. In 1917 he became the ninth head coach of Geneva College's Golden Tornadoes in Beaver Falls. His record in this first season was 5–3–1, although the team allowed as many points as they scored (114). He went 4–2 in 1918, outscoring the opposition 67–36, and 4–2–2 in 1919, despite a negative point <b>differential</b> <b>of</b> 51–59 caused by a 2–33 loss to the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920 his record was 5–2–1, outscoring other institutions 125–61 despite a 0–47 loss to Pittsburgh. He was 5–3–1 in his final season, with a positive point <b>differential</b> <b>of</b> 106–49; half of their points scored during this year came in a 54–0 victory over Juniata College. Following his resignation, he was replaced by Robert Park, who {{was head of the}} history department, for the 1922 season, and then Tom Davies in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in a bell, to decompression from saturation, which generally occurs in a decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration <b>differential</b> <b>of</b> the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable <b>differential</b> <b>of</b> stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{second game}} of the Bears-Vikings rivalry took place in Minneapolis and was the third game at TCF Bank Stadium; the Bears won the first game in 2010 while the Vikings won in 2014. To succeed against the Vikings, Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears had to excel {{at the start of}} the game; offensively, the Bears had a first quarter scoring <b>differential</b> <b>of</b> -48, 31st in the league, while scoring only twice on game-opening possessions. In the third quarter, the Bears scored a league-worst 32 points; in comparison, the Vikings defense had allowed only one {{touchdown}} on opening drives and a league-low 37 points in the third quarter. The defense took on a Vikings offense spearheaded by Adrian Peterson, whose 1,251 yards led the league. On special teams, the Vikings led the league in post-kickoff starting position, while being ranked third in returns of at least 20 yards with 26 and first in returns of at least 40 yards with five. Additionally, kickoff returner Cordarrelle Patterson led the league in return average with 31.1 yards. Christian Jones, Cameron Meredith, Bryce Callahan, Nick Becton, Tayo Fabuluje, Jacoby Glenn and Antone Smith were inactive.|$|E
