60|$|Saint. I see you are ignorant; but verily, {{you are a}} new vessel, and I may season you. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not use the parish-church.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{believed}} to be an honourable profession, my good dame; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS KNOX. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> think {{yourself}} a heroine of romance.|$|R
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> {{tell your}} wife {{that you go}} {{elsewhere}} for advice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless me, Phoebe! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not meet}} any poor curate at that place of Honor Charlecote's. Your papa would never consent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{a little}} pause Lily {{said in a}} subdued voice, 'Claude, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe that I was {{thinking}} of what really happened when I said that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Stowel, your {{doctrine}} {{would make}} a quiet nation, {{as well as a}} quiet ship. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me the justice to think there is no co-equal in my commands!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to bear that name any longer. Pray call me by my assumed name still, and keep my secret. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe all the {{newspapers}} said?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not get a}} {{chill in}} the garden. The weather is a little wrong again, but I am thankful for last night's sunset.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he admitted, [...] "that it {{was rather}} a clumsy joke. I apologize, Mrs. Fitzgerald. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not really imagine {{that it had been}} stolen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Cissy, {{when they}} had passed, [...] "didn't I tell you? Did you ever see such conceit in your born days? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not look at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Lydia. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} I am a silly little fool. It is only that I {{have not been}} {{accustomed}} {{to that kind of}} treatment, and I will not have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your sentiments do you credit, Sanders," [...] {{said the}} minister; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not enter upon the blessed state of matrimony without full {{consideration}} of its responsibilities. It {{is a serious}} business, marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} your place," [...] Mr. Carmyle was saying, [...] "and the hall porter {{told me that}} you were here, so I ventured to follow you. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not mind? May I smoke?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had another}} letter from Mrs. Fenton, who says {{you were with}} her; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not go on purpose. I will answer her letter soon; it is about some money in Lady Giffard's hands.|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” {{said the}} girl quietly, {{though there was a}} faint gleam in her eyes. “That {{contract}} is too big for me. Still, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not lose many opportunities, Mr. Broughton, through taking care of me.” ...|$|R
60|$|Lord. Nay, {{my sweet}} mistress, be not so unjust to suspect any new attempt: I am too {{penitent}} for my last fault, so soon to sin again. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{tell it to}} your aunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Trouble, Miss Stanbury! How {{could it}} be trouble? The labour we delight in physics pain. But {{to go back to}} the subject-matter. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that my affection for you is true and honest, and genuine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind {{forgiving}} message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not retract what you then said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is none,' said Fowler, walking {{forward and}} sitting {{down upon the}} parapet in front of Karenin {{so that he could}} see his face. 'There is no {{absolute}} limit to either knowledge or power.... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not tire yourself talking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{understood}} {{that you thought}} you had not treated your aunts rightly by not consulting them about your intercourse with the Whites, and that you had very properly resolved to tell them all. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would it {{be generous}} and honourable {{to step into}} your place--if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so, for I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not--anticipating, or knowing beforehand, that I should come here, and {{designing}} to take me at this disadvantage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{forward the}} stones {{presented}} by the Consul.--Julia says to tell Mary that she got a very rich fur cloak in Paris and hopes she got one also. Is there anything we can <b>do</b> for <b>you</b> in Paris? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} won't be offended, Lord Wisbeach," [...] said Mrs. Pett {{from the group}} by the door. [...] "I engaged a detective to help you. I really thought you could not manage {{everything}} by yourself. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are lots}} of vulgar fellows getting into the law, Miles--men who have not half your claims to be {{considered}} gentlemen. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not think I wished you and Rupert to study law {{in order to make}} gentlemen of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why not me, Mr. Furnival? When all the {{profession}} is meeting together, why should not I {{be there as}} well as another? <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not deny me my right to feel {{an interest in the}} great subjects which are being discussed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] said Lady Lufton. [...] "I {{have not}} an idea. But I did not flatter myself {{that you would}} come so far on a morning call, merely to see us three ladies. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to see}} Ludovic, because he will not be back till to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At length Ganlesse paused, and {{declared}} the supper exquisite. [...] "But, my friend Smith," [...] he added, [...] "are your wines curious? When you brought all that trash of plates and trumpery into Derbyshire, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not leave {{us at the}} mercy of the strong ale of the shire, as thick and muddy as the squires who drink it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It rankled in {{your baby}} breast,' he said. 'It embittered {{the life of}} your poor mother. <b>You</b> are right. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> may <b>do</b> better, yet; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> may correct yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and that}} you {{afterwards}} gave him an income {{when he came up}} to live in London. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not think that I am ungrateful, George?" [...] and Sir Lionel used his softest and, at the same time, his most expressive tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> too, Will," [...] {{answered}} Joe, and his lip quivered as he spoke. Perhaps {{this would}} be the last time he would see his brother alive. Never before had the situation appeared so serious as now. Darry also received an affectionate farewell.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have more}} than an excuse--a reason, and I think we shall be fully agreed; but first you must let me have the {{pleasure}} of one look to recall old times. It is such a treat to see you so unchanged. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not still suffer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> {{your duty}} {{as well on}} a line-of-battle ship as <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when mate of the brig, for it is a duty that may be serious.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is your employer, the Sieur Philip Fletcher. I have {{warranted}} that {{he shall}} find you good and true men, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will <b>do</b> justice to my recommendation." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was quite}} {{sorry to hear}} you say you stayed in town on my account, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> {{sincerely}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not mean so superfluous a piece of politeness.|$|R
