5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, <b>double</b> <b>coat.</b> While {{grooming}} is not difficult, breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.|$|E
5|$|They have a white <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> which {{requires}} regular brushing {{with a wire}} comb {{in order to prevent}} matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming too soft.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{remains very}} popular in the UK, with {{multiple}} winner at Cruft's, {{and is in the}} top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scottish whisky Black & White. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. The breed can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents.|$|E
30|$|Bacterial counts {{decreased}} significantly {{during the}} study period (P <  0.001). In the case of L. rhamnosus the rate of this decline was significantly faster in free form in comparison with single (P =  0. 002) and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> (P <  0.001) form and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> bacteria were more resistant than single coated form (P =  0. 001). The differences between single and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> was not statistically significant in L. acidophilus (P =  0.127), but the rate of decline in bacterial count in free form was significantly higher than single coated (P =  0.002) and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> bacteria (P =  0.001). In conclusion, microencapsulation with alginate-chitosan-Eu S 100 nanoparticles is a novel and efficient method for better viability of L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus bacteria. Nevertheless, more studies are required to assess the viability of further probiotic strains as well as examine the guard effect of encapsulation and coating on the probiotic viability in animal and human models.|$|R

50|$|The mill was {{developed}} to produce off-machine coated grades of paper. Principle grades were label (one sided coated), gloss art (two sided, single and double coated)and matt art (two sided single and <b>double</b> <b>coated).</b>|$|R
25|$|The Working Kelpie {{comes in}} three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, {{and a few}} have white points. Kelpies {{sometimes}} have a <b>double</b> <b>coat,</b> which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a <b>double</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Newfoundland's {{extremely}} large bones give it mass, {{while its}} large musculature gives it the power {{it needs to}} take on rough ocean waves and powerful tides. These dogs have huge lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances, and a thick, oily, and waterproof <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> which protects them from the chill of icy waters. The <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> makes the dog hard to groom, and also causes a lot of shedding to occur. The droopy lips and jowls make the dog drool, especially in high heat.|$|E
25|$|A big, {{powerful}} hound {{in general}} appearance, with long legs, long drop ears, {{and a long}} tail. Their short, <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> is tricolour, black, white and tan. They stand 62–72cm (24.4-28 ins) at the withers.|$|E
5000|$|The coat may be [...] "smooth," [...] "broken," [...] or [...] "rough." [...] All types {{should have}} dense and coarse <b>double</b> <b>coats</b> that are harsh {{to the touch}} and weatherproof. [...] Smooth: Short, glossy hair. Undercoat still usually present.|$|R
50|$|The Labrador Husky is {{a fairly}} large dog that can weigh between 60 and 100 pounds and can grow to 20 - 28 inches. Thick, <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> fur protects these dogs from the bitterly cold {{temperatures}} that come with Labrador's long winters.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Multiple {{adhesive}} coating is a controversial topic, especially in primary dentition {{that should be}} clarified. We evaluated the effect of multiple consecutive adhesive resin coatings on the microshear bond strength (µSBS) of composite resin to primary tooth dentin utilizing a filled (Adper Single Bond Plus) and an unfilled (Adper Single Bond) adhesive resin. Materials and Methods: Thirty extracted primary canines were randomly allocated into two groups based on the adhesive used. Dentin occlusal surfaces were exposed and further polished on 400, 600 and 800 -grit silicon-carbide paper. The surfaces {{were divided into two}} halves in the labial-lingual orientation. After etching, the adhesives were used either in <b>double</b> <b>coats,</b> or four coats on the halves of the same tooth followed by air evaporation for each layer and finally light curing. Cylinders of composite were bonded to the dentin surfaces. After 24 h shear bond testing was evaluated by Bisco tensile tester. ANOVA, Student t test and paired t test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean (standard deviation) for <b>double</b> <b>coats</b> or four coats in single bond were 31. 99 (2. 94) and 30. 25 (2. 69), while they were 29. 18 (3. 35) and 31. 26 (2. 07) in single bond plus, respectively. No {{significant differences were found between}} the <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> specimens and those receiving four coatings with both adhesives (p> 0. 05). Micro SBS values of Single Bond <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> specimens were significantly higher than Single Bond Plus (p= 0. 02). In four-coated specimens, there were no significant differences between Single Bond and Single Bond Plus (p= 0. 26). Conclusion: Applying four coats of adhesive did not improve the µSBS to primary tooth dentin...|$|R
25|$|The Siberian Husky (Russian: Сибирский хаски) is {{a medium}} size working dog breed that {{originated}} in north-eastern Siberia, Russia. The breed {{belongs to the}} Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred <b>double</b> <b>coat,</b> erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.|$|E
25|$|When {{the birds}} are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, then rises, putting the birds to flight, {{allowing}} him a shot. The Toller then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving in cold water climates because of their water-repellent <b>double</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The beaver's fur {{consists}} of long, coarse outer hairs and short, fine inner hairs (see <b>Double</b> <b>coat).</b> The fur has {{a range of}} colors, but usually is dark brown. Scent glands near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as castoreum, which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{an attempt to}} obtain a more compact system for gas sensing, {{designed}} directly on a transducer, is presented. In the nature, a mucous layer covers the olfactory receptor cells of mammalians and selectively tunes the chemical interactions between odorous molecules and sensing systems. Such natural double layer design was reproduced in this study using a <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> comprised of a proper hydrophobic Teflon-like overlayer tuning the humidity interference between the odorous molecules and the sensitive matrix below consisting of a Zn-porphyrin film. This <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> was applied on both surfaces of the quartz crystal microbalance used for transducing into electrical signals the chemical signals deriving from the adsorption of volatile molecules.

50|$|The {{honeycomb}} {{is produced}} and conveyed into an air-conditioned area {{where it is}} cut into bars. Then it goes through chocolate coating machines. The bars are <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> to seal the honeycomb from the air. Cooling tunnels take the bars to the automatic wrapping machines. The metallised wrapper is moisture resistant.|$|R
25|$|Huskies are {{energetic}} and athletic. They {{usually have a}} thick <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> that can be gray, black, copper red, or white. Their eyes are typically pale blue, although {{they may also be}} brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.|$|E
25|$|Show Kelpies are {{restricted}} to solid colours (black, chocolate, red, smoky blue, fawn, black and tan, red and tan) in a short <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> with pricked ears. It was during the early 20th century that Kelpies were first exhibited, at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Different kennel clubs' breed standards have preferences for certain colours. Show Kelpies are generally heavier and shorter than working Kelpies.|$|E
25|$|The Toller was bred to {{retrieve}} from icy waters {{and must have}} a water-repellent <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> of medium length and softness, and a soft dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back, but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length, the tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving.. The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of various application methods of one-step self-etch adhesives to microtensile resin-dentin bond strength. Materials and Methods Thirty-six extracted human molars were used. The teeth were assigned randomly to twelve groups (n = 15), according to the three different adhesive systems (Clearfil Tri-S Bond, Adper Prompt L-Pop, G-Bond) and application methods. The adhesive systems were applied on the dentin as follows: 1) The single <b>coating,</b> 2) The <b>double</b> <b>coating,</b> 3) Manual agitation, 4) Ultrasonic agitation. Following the adhesive application, light-cure composite resin was constructed. The restored teeth were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours, and prepared 15 specimens per groups. Then microtensile bond strength was measured and the failure mode was examined. Results Manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than single <b>coating</b> and <b>double</b> <b>coating</b> did. <b>Double</b> <b>coating</b> of adhesive significantly increased the microtensile bond strength than single coating did and there was no significant difference between the manual agitation and ultrasonic agitation group. There was significant difference in microtensile bonding strength among all adhesives and Clearfil Tri-S Bond showed the highest bond strength. Conclusions In one-step self-etching adhesives, there was significant difference according to application methods and type of adhesives. No matter of the material, the manual or ultrasonic agitation of the adhesive showed significantly higher microtensile bond strength...|$|R

50|$|Romanov wool is {{very strong}} and resourceful. The wool is <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> with mean {{diameter}} of wool fibers of 20.9 micrometres and 71.9 micrometres of outer-coat hair (lamb wool). Mean greasy fleece weight is around 4.5 kilograms. The wool, which {{is a mixture of}} gray wool and black guard hair, is usually used for rugs, mats, and wall hangings.|$|R
25|$|The outer {{part of the}} <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> {{should be}} {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|The first clear {{evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164M {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. As both extant mammals, Megaconus and Castorocauda have a <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> of hair, with both guard hairs and an undercoat, it may be assumed that their last common ancestor did as well. This animal must have been Triassic as it was an ancestor of the Triassic Tikitherium. More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites pushes back the origin of mammalian hair much further back in the synapsid line to Paleozoic therapsids.|$|E
25|$|In general, Border Collies are {{medium-sized}} {{dogs with}} a moderate amount of coat, {{which is most}} often thick and sheds often. They have a <b>double</b> <b>coat</b> that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. Whilst black and white is most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) have also been seen regularly, with other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.|$|E
50|$|The Skye is <b>double</b> <b>coated,</b> with a short, soft {{undercoat}} and a hard, straight topcoat. The shorter hair of {{the head}} veils the forehead and eyes, forming a moderate beard. The ears are generally well feathered and, in prick-eared examples, the hair normally falls like a fringe, accenting the form, and blending with the side locks.|$|R
30|$|Calcium {{alginate}} is anionic (i.e., negatively charged) and {{can attract}} positive charged chitosan. So the first coating layer of beads will be established by ionic bonds. In {{the next stage}} negative charged Eu S 100 nanoparticles will attach the chitosan with the same mechanism (ionic bonds) and finally <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> beads are created (Badhana et al. 2013; Boeris et al. 2009; Kouchak et al. 2015). It should be also noted that beads made of calcium alginate (by extrusion method) are porous and the <b>double</b> layer <b>coating</b> with chitosan and Eu S 100 nanoparticles can cover the porous beads and increase protection for the probiotic bacteria.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{an inverse}} method {{to obtain the}} elastic {{properties}} of material. The sum of the squared differences between the experimental resonance frequencies and calculated resonance frequencies from the finite element method is chosen as the objective function. The proposed method presents an optimization method, Hybrid Genetic /Simulated Annealing algorithm, to determine the elastic properties. When the objective function reaches its minimum value, its corresponding design variables are the elastic constants of the material. The inverse method is applied to determine the elastic constants of aluminum plate, Glass/PP laminate, and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> steel plate. The results indicate that for few elastic constants as an aluminum plate, Hybrid Genetic /Simulated Annealing algorithm has no apparent improvement, but more calculation time in comparison method. While simulated annealing while for Glass/PP laminate and <b>double</b> <b>coated</b> steel plate with more elastic constants, Hybrid Genetic /Simulated Annealing algorithm is superior to the traditional simulated annealing method...|$|R
