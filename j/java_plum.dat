40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes {{are common}} {{foodborne}} pathogens in the United States. With {{the advent of}} more consumers seeking chemical-free treatments to control pathogenic organisms in food, {{there has been an}} increasing interest in antimicrobials from natural sources. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of lime juice and <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice on aforementioned foodborne pathogenic bacteria in microbiological media and food models. First, agar well diffusion assay was conducted to test if the juices were effective against the four bacteria. After confirming its effectiveness, the antimicrobial activity of diluted lime juice was further confirmed in water and nutrient broth inoculated with the pathogenic bacteria. The survival of the bacteria in water and nutrient broth was determined on plate count agar (PCA). S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes in water supplemented with 50 % lime juice were inactivated at room temperature within 3, 8, and 48 h, respectively. Inactivation of the pathogens was faster in nutrient broth incubated at 35 °C than in water. Nutrient broth supplemented with 50 % <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice inactivated S. Typhimurium and S. aureus in 12 h, and E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. monocytogenes in 24 h. The juices were then tested on food models such as shrimp and cut cantaloupe. The pathogenic bacteria on the foods were enumerated on selective agars, with xylose lysine decarboxylase (XLD) agar for S. Typhimurium and modified Oxford (MOX) agar for L. monocytogenes. The overlay agar method was also employed to recover the injured cells on PCA before enumerating on the selective agars. S. Typhimurium was used as a representative pathogen to test its susceptibility to lime juice on shrimp. S. Typhimurium-inoculated shrimps were marinated in diluted lime juice at 7 °C for 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. By 24 h, a significant difference (P< 0. 05) between the 25 % treatment and control started to show. Comparing to the control, the 50 % treatment reduced the count of S. Typhimurium on shrimp by 2. 07, and 3. 34 logs at 24 h, and 48 h, respectively. S. Typhimurium and L. monocytogenes, the two pathogens that have caused several multistate foodborne illness outbreaks with cantaloupe, were tested for their susceptibility to <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice treatments on the fruit. After dipping the inoculated cantaloupe cubes in diluted <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice for an hour, the fruit was stored at 7 °C for 8 days. Under refrigeration, both L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium were able to grow on cut cantaloupe. When the fruit was treated with 50 % <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice, the growth of L. monocytogenes was restrained. Comparing to the control, the 50 % treatment significantly reduced the count of S. Typhimurium by 0. 67, 2. 86, and 3. 41 logs on day 0, day 4 and day 8, respectively. The results from the selective agar and overlay agar were significantly different for S. Typhimurium counts in both solid food models although counts for L. monocytogenes showed {{no significant difference between the}} two agars. This indicates that the use of overlay method is crucial for the enumeration of S. Typhimurium when the cells are injured due to exposure to lime juice and <b>java</b> <b>plum</b> juice...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. This {{study was}} focused on {{understanding}} the response of different hydrologic processes to changes in land use/land cover and climate in Mākaha watershed. Rainfall, throughfall, and stemflow were measured between 2006 and 2010 to determine the canopy interception of three non-native tree species (Strawberry guava, Christmas berry, and Coffee). The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was evaluated in simulating the hydrologic processes and {{to assess the impact}} of additional groundwater development on the Mākaha streamflow. A trend analysis was performed using the longterm air temperature data across the island of O'ahu. To assess the sensitivity of streamflow and evapotranspiration to climate warming, a sensitivity analysis using DHSVM was also conducted. Mean throughfall was the lowest (48. 1 %) under Strawberry guava and the highest (61. 2 %) under a mixture of Christmas berry, Strawberry guava, and <b>Java</b> <b>plum.</b> However, stemflow was the highest for Strawberry guava (34. 8 %) and the lowest under the mixture of Christmas berry, Strawberry guava, and <b>Java</b> <b>plum</b> (4. 65 %). The canopy interception losses were between 18 and 38 % of the gross rainfall. The estimated annual groundwater recharge was 31 % of the gross rainfall. Results of this study indicate that 11 % of streamflow decline over the period 1991 - 2009 may be attributed to groundwater pumping. Decreasing trend in rainfall and increasing trend in the fraction of the gross rainfall converted into evapotranspiration could have been the other causes behind the streamflow decline. Analysis of air temperature (1949 - 2007) shows an increasing trend. Changes in island-wide maximum and minimum temperatures occurred in the year 1961 and 1977, respectively. Increases in minimum (0. 43 oC/decade) and maximum temperatures (0. 29 oC/decade) are higher than those at the global level (0. 18 oC/decade, since 1979). The climate change sensitivity analysis indicates that the changes in precipitation had significant impact on streamflow and evapotranspiration compared to temperature. However, temperature increase coupled with decrease in precipitation, showed significant effect on all hydrological components of the watershed. Additionally, changes in leaf conductance and leaf area index with increasing CO 2 concentration significantly affect evapotranspiration and subsequently on streamflow. Further study is needed to quantify the changes in vegetation characteristics under elevated CO 2 concentrations...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} on <b>Java</b> <b>plum</b> (Syzygium cumini) fruit as source of natural antioxidant {{has been done}} with special emphasis {{on the role of}} anthocyanins. The aims of this research were : to determine the extraction condition which include types of solvents, length of time, and temperature of extractions. The solvents combination consisted of : methanol-HC 1 1 %; acetone; acetone-water (7 : 3); and water, which were applied for 4, 8, 12 hours extractions at room (27 - 29 Â°C) and cool room (4 Â°C) temperatures. The results showed that methanol-HCI I% gave highest extract of anthocyanins and polyphenols and antioxidant activity as compared to acetone, acetone-water (7 : 3), and water. Higher antioxidant activity and anthocyanin content were resulted from extraction in 4 Â°C compared to room temperature; whereas higher polyphenol content were obtained from extraction at room temperature compared to cool room temperature. The length of extraction time. did not give significant differences in antioxidant activity, anthocyanin and polyphenol content.

40|$|Local {{stakeholders}} at {{the important}} but vulnerable Centre Hills on Montserrat {{consider that the}} continued presence of feral livestock (particularly goats and pigs) may lead to widespread replacement of the reserve’s native vegetation by invasive alien trees (<b>Java</b> <b>plum</b> and guava), and consequent negative impacts on native animal species. Since 2009, a hunting programme to control the feral livestock has been in operation. However long-term funding is not assured. Here, we estimate the effect of feral livestock control on ecosystem services provided by the forest to evaluate whether the biodiversity conservation rationale for continuation of the control programme is supported by an economic case. A new practical tool (Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment) was employed to measure and compare ecosystem service provision between two states of the reserve (i. e. presence and absence of feral livestock control) to estimate the net consequences of the hunting programme on ecosystem services provided by the forest. Based on this we estimate that cessation of feral livestock management would substantially reduce the net benefits provided by the site, including a 46 % reduction in nature-based tourism (from $ 419, 000 to $ 228, 000) and 36 % reduction in harvested wild meat (from $ 205, 000 to $ 132, 000).

The fruit pulp was separated from the seed, frozen dried, and kept in freezer. The freezer dried fruit was extracted (macerated) with methanol-HCl 1 % for overnight at 4 ºC, and filtered with Whatman no 1 to obtain fruit extract. Anthocyanin-betacyanin testing was used to indicate that the fruit contain anthocyanin. Antioxidant activity test was conducted with ferri-thiocyanate method in linoleic acid emulsion system. Anthocyanin contents was determined with pH differential method, while its polyphenol with spectrophotometric method with Folin-CIocalteu reagent. The result showed that the fruit contained anthocyanin, ranging from 1, 68 mg/g at young stage (green) to 29, 39 mg/g at overripe stage (black), and showed that antioxidant activity was influenced by fruit maturity. With regard to fruit maturoty, the antioxidant activity of purple, red, adn green fruit were 64, 75 %, 62, 42 %, and 29, 86 % respectively; whereas that of BHT was 79, 45 %. It was noted that there were significant correlation between the level of anthocyanins, poluphenols, and the degrees of maturity. As the fruit maturity increased, the anthocyanin increased, but the polyphenol decreased. The fruit contained considerable amount of anthocyanins and had antioxidant activity that was influenced by stages of maturity.

40|$|Since the myrtle rust {{pathogen}} (Austropuccinia psidii) {{was first}} reported (as Puccinia psidii) in Brazil on guava (Psidium guajava) in 1884, {{it has been}} found infecting diverse myrtaceous species. Because A. psidii has recently spread rapidly worldwide with an extensive host range, genetic and genotypic diversities were evaluated within and among A. psidii populations in its putative native range and other areas of myrtle rust emergence in the Americas and Hawaii. Microsatellite markers revealed several unique multilocus genotypes (MLGs), which grouped isolates into nine distinct genetic clusters [C 1 -C 9 comprising C 1 : from diverse hosts from Costa Rica, Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and USA-Hawaii, and USA-California; C 2 : from eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) in Brazil/Uruguay and rose apple (Syzygium jambos) in Brazil; C 3 : from eucalypts in Brazil; C 4 : from diverse hosts in USA-Florida; C 5 : from <b>Java</b> <b>plum</b> (Syzygium cumini) in Brazil; C 6 : from guava and Brazilian guava (Psidium guineense) in Brazil; C 7 : from pitanga (Eugenia uniflora) in Brazil; C 8 : from allspice (Pimenta dioica) in Jamaica and sweet flower (Myrrhinium atropurpureum) in Uruguay; C 9 : from jabuticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) in Brazil]. The C 1 cluster, which included a single MLG infecting diverse host in many geographic regions, and the closely related C 4 cluster are considered as a "Pandemic biotype," associated with myrtle rust emergence in Central America, the Caribbean, USA-Florida, USA-Hawaii, Australia, China-Hainan, New Caledonia, Indonesia and Colombia. Based on 19 bioclimatic variables and documented occurrences of A. psidii contrasted with reduced sets of specific genetic clusters (subnetworks, considered as biotypes), maximum entropy bioclimatic modelling was used to predict geographic locations with suitable climate for A. psidii which are at risk from invasion.

40|$|ABSTRACT Syzygium cumini (Family Myrtaceae) is {{also known}} as Syzygium jambolanum and Eugenia cumini. Other com-mon names are Jambul, Black Plum, <b>Java</b> <b>Plum,</b> Indian Blackberry, Jamblang, Jamun etc. Today these trees are found growing {{throughout}} the Asian subcontinent, East-ern Africa, South America, Madagascar and have also naturalized to Florida and Hawaii in the United States of America [1]. The tree fruits once in a year and the berries are sweetish sour to taste. The ripe fruits are used for health drinks, making preserves, squashes, jellies and wine [1]. In association to itsdietary use, all parts of the tree and, importantly the seeds are used to treat a range of ailments, the most important being diabetes mellitus [2]. Different parts of the jambolan were also reported for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuropsycho-phar- macological, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-HIV, an-tileishmanial and antifugal, nitric oxide scavenging, free radical scavenging, anti-diarrheal, antifertility, anorex-igenic, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic and redio-protective activities [2]. The {{purpose of this study was}} investigating experimentally the possible anti asthma activity of macerated and soxhlet extracts of fruits of this plant on tracheal chains of guinea pigs were evaluated. The relaxant effects of 4 cumulative concentrations of macerated and soxhlet extracts (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 25 W/V) in comparison with saline as negative control and 4 cumulative concentrations of theophylline (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 and 1. 25 mM) as positive control were examined on precontracted tracheal chains of two groups of 6 guinea pig by 60 mM KCl (group 1, N= 6) and 10 µM methacholine the non-incubated tissues (group 2, N = 6) and tissues incubated with 1 µM propranolol (group 3, N = 4) [18]. Decrease in contractile tone of tracheal chains was considered as relaxant effect. The isolated guinea-pig trachea pre-contracted with KCl, methacholine and tissues incubated with propranolol were used to study the relaxation of macerated and soxhlet extracts of fruits Syzygium cumini. In group 1 experiments only the last two higher concentrations of theophylline and soxhlet extract showed significant relaxant effect compared to that of saline (p< 0. 001 for both concentrations), which were significantly greater than those of macerated extracts (p< 0. 001 for all cases). In group 2 experiments only the last two higher concentrations of theophylline and soxhlet extract showed significant relaxant effect compared to that of saline. The effects of one higher concentrations of theophylline in this group were significantly greater than those of macerated and soxhlet extracts (P < 0. 01). And in group 2 and 3 experiments both macerated and soxhlet extracts showed concentration-dependent relaxant effects compared to that of saline (p< 0. 05 to p< 0. 001 for both extracts). The relaxant effects of macerated and soxhlet extracts in group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3. In group 3 experiment potent relaxant effect was observed.
