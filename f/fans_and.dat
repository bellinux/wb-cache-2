40|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>and</b> Yao (1998) {{proposed}} an efficient method {{to estimate the}} conditional variance of heteroskedastic regression models. Chen, Cheng, and Peng (2009) applied variance reduction techniques to the estimator of <b>Fan</b> <b>and</b> Yao (1998) and proposed a new estimator for conditional variance {{to account for the}} skewness of financial data. In this paper, we apply empirical likelihood methods to construct confidence intervals for the conditional variance based on the estimator of <b>Fan</b> <b>and</b> Yao (1998) and the reduced variance modification of Chen et al. (2009). Simulation studies and data analysis demonstrate the advantage of the empirical likelihood method over the normal approximation method. ...|$|R
