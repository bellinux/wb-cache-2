5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{focus on}} formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus {{suggested}} a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's {{concept of the}} <b>efficient</b> <b>cause.</b> Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, “causality” is {{a notion}} {{implying}} the most general idea of “actual scientific knowledge” which guides and stimulates each investigation. In this sense, Kepler already embarked in his MC on a causal investigation by {{asking for the}} cause of the number, the sizes and the “motions” (= the speeds) of the heavenly spheres. On the other hand, “causality” implies in Kepler, according to the Aristotelian conception of physical science, the concrete “physical cause”, the <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> which produces a motion or is responsible for keeping the body in motion. Original to Kepler, however, and typical of his approach is the resoluteness with which he was convinced that the problem of equipollence of the astronomical hypotheses can be resolved and the consequent introduction of the concept of causality into astronomy – traditionally a mathematical science. This approach is already present in his MC, where he, for instance, relates {{for the first time the}} distances of the planets to a power which emerges from the Sun and decreases in proportion to the distance of each planet, up to the sphere of the fixed stars (see Stephenson 1987, pp.9–10).|$|E

60|$|As I have {{so often}} observed, the general {{question}} {{of the existence of}} <b>Efficient</b> <b>Causes</b> does not fall within the limits of our subject; but a theory which represents them as capable of being subjects of human knowledge, and which passes off as <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> what are only physical or phenomenal causes, belongs as much to Logic as to metaphysics, and is a fit subject for discussion here.|$|R

Ernst Mayr criticised Pittendrigh's confusion of Aristotle's four causes, arguing that evolution only involved {{the material and}} formal but not the <b>efficient</b> <b>cause.</b> Mayr proposed {{to use the term}} only for [...] "systems operating {{on the basis of a}} program of coded information." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1884, the Swiss {{botanist}} Carl Nägeli (1817–1891) {{proposed a}} version of orthogenesis involving an [...] "inner perfecting principle". Gregor Mendel died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an [...] "idioplasm" [...] transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics. According to Nägeli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed. [...] Charles Darwin saw this as a serious challenge, replying that [...] "There must be some <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> for each slight individual difference", {{but was unable to}} provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics. Further, Darwin was himself somewhat progressionist, believing for example that [...] "Man" [...] was [...] "higher" [...] than the barnacles he studied.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E
40|$|Libet???s {{attempt to}} explain {{positive}} free acts (which he denies) in terms of physiological brain <b>causes</b> fails: <b>Efficient</b> causality has an inherent relation to persons; personal wills are primary/superior forms of <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> and the only <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> properly speaking instead of mere transmitters of causality; personal causation stands {{at the beginning of}} non-personal efficient causes; it is conscious; immediately experienced, known with evidence. Libet???s recognition of free veto power logically entails recognition of positive free will; Libet overlooks the natural connection between efficient and final causality and personal <b>causes</b> irreducible to <b>efficient</b> and final <b>causes.</b> Supposing his theory: the causes of knowledge would degenerate into irrational contents of consciousness <b>caused</b> by <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> in the brain deprived of rational justification; free actions intentionally directed at, and motivated by, the importance of states of affairs to be realized would be impossible. Libet???s test results and interpretations in no way prove the truth of the conclusion of his attempted ???disproof of positive free will??? but, when freed from his inadequate philosophy of persons and other equivocations and mistakes {{in the design of the}} tests confirm it.

5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> is [...] "the primary source", or {{that from}} which the change under {{consideration}} proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of [...] "cause" [...] as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the archeus, van Helmont believed in other governing agencies resembling the archeus which were not always clearly distinguished from it. From these he invented the term blas (motion), defined as the [...] "vis motus tam alterivi quam localis" [...] ("twofold motion, to wit, locall, and alterative"), that is, natural motion and motion that can be altered or voluntary. Of blas there were several kinds, e.g. blas humanum (blas of humans), blas of stars and blas meteoron (blas of meteors); of meteors he said [...] "constare gas materiâ et blas efficiente" [...] ("Meteors do consist of their matter Gas, and their <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> Blas, as well the Motive, as the altering").|$|E
2500|$|In facing choices, {{he argued}} that humans are governed by intellect, will, and passions. The will is [...] "the primary mover of all {{the powers of the}} soul ... and it is also the <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> of motion in the body." [...] Choice falls into five stages: (i) {{intellectual}} consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution. Free will enters as follows: Free will is an [...] "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term [...] "appetite" [...] from Aquinas's definition [...] "includes all forms of internal inclination"). He states that judgment [...] "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [...]" ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{question}} is still used {{in discussions of}} the labour theory of value and related issues.

Hume's argument that there were no <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> hidden in nature was supported and developed by Thomas Brown (1778-1820), who was Dugald Stewart's (1753-1828) successor at Edinburgh and who would be a major influence on later philosophers including John Stuart Mill.|$|R
2500|$|Psychology {{had been}} a central {{interest}} of Leibniz. He {{appears to be an}} [...] "underappreciated pioneer of psychology" [...] He wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology: attention and consciousness, memory, learning (association), motivation (the act of [...] "striving"), emergent individuality, the general dynamics of development (evolution). His discussions in the New Essays and Monadology often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed petite perceptions to the distinct, self-aware apperception, and psychophysical parallelism {{from the point of view}} of causality and of purpose: [...] “Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of <b>efficient</b> <b>causes,</b> i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.” [...] This idea refers to the mind-body problem, stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony. Leibniz, however, did not use the term psychologia.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts {{as both a}} final and <b>efficient</b> <b>cause.</b> Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed {{as a result of}} God's existence [...] "overflowing", which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him. The key idea here is that God [...] "acts" [...] through created intermediaries, which in turn [...] "act" [...] on one another – through a chain of cause and effect – to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not [...] "act" [...] at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action. This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy, as it portrayed the [...] "first cause" [...] and [...] "unmoved mover" [...] of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{document}} some modern day scholars note that “chain of being {{described by the}} Ikhwan possess a temporal aspect which has led certain scholars to view that {{the authors of the}} Rasai’l believed in the modern theory of evolution”. [...] According to the Rasa’il “But individuals are in perpetual flow; they are neither definite nor preserved. [...] The reason for the conservation of forms, genus and species in matter is fixity of their celestial cause because their <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> is the Universal Soul of the spheres instead of the change and continuous flux of individuals which is due to the variability of their cause”. [...] This statement is supporting the concept that species and individuals are not static, and that when they change it is due to a new purpose given. [...] In the Ikhwan doctrine there are similarities between that and the theory of evolution. [...] Both believe that “the time of existence of terrestrial plants precedes that of animals, minerals precede plants, and organism adapt to their environment”, but asserts that everything exists for a purpose.|$|E
2500|$|The Vedanta {{tradition}} of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the <b>efficient</b> <b>cause</b> of all existence while Prakriti is its material cause. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman {{is both the}} efficient and the material cause, [...] "that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed." [...] What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always. This Brahman it postulates is sat-cit-ananda (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for: first, how did sat Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did cit Brahman create material [...] world? third, if ananda Brahman is pure bliss, why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.|$|E
50|$|The {{facts of}} existence, however, are not {{adequately}} {{explained by the}} mechanical categories. The ultimate interpretation of the universe can only {{be found in the}} higher category of End or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line, between philosophical systems. On the one side stand those that acknowledge none but <b>efficient</b> <b>causes,</b> which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were, a tergo ("from the back"). This may be called, typically, Democritism. On the other side stands the organic or teleological view of the world, which interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the <b>efficient</b> <b>causes</b> only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense Platonism. Systems like Spinozism, which seem to form a third class, neither sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the realization of ends.|$|R
50|$|However, Edward Feser argues, in {{line with}} the Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition, that {{finality}} has been greatly misunderstood. Indeed, without finality, efficient causality becomes inexplicable. Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end towards which a thing is ordered. When a match is rubbed against the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire. The effect is not arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire which is realized through <b>efficient</b> <b>causes.</b>|$|R
