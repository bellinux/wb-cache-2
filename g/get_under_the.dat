Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled <b>Get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> desk, in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, the Rangers decided not to {{transfer}} Redden to the AHL roster, thereby not having to pay his salary during the labour dispute. When the lockout was settled, however, the newly ratified NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) directly affected Redden in two ways —1) It forced teams to count any AHL player's salary above $900,000 against its NHL cap; and 2) It allowed for up to two contracts per team to be bought out for up to two-thirds of the remaining salary, without the buyout counting against the cap in the 2013 and/or 2014 off-seasons, so as to help teams <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> reduced cap, also known as a compliance buyout. However, the buyouts cannot be used on injured players, so, to avoid any risk of a hockey-related injury, the Rangers originally instructed Redden to simply not report to camp.|$|E
25|$|British {{engineers}} quickly began {{digging in}} batteries on the hornwork hill, the first battery was finished on 22 September but {{hoping to get}} lucky again, Wellington ordered {{an attack on the}} night of 22/23 September before his guns had fired a shot. Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 foot wall, they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> fort's west wall. When this was detonated {{in the early hours of}} the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the city, Batman {{encounters}} enemy watchtowers, guard posts, aerial drones, and explosive mines {{embedded in}} the city streets. Some drones can be hacked and turned against their allies by using the Remote Hacking Device. Arkham Knight introduces the [...] "Fear Takedown", where Batman can subdue up to five enemies simultaneously {{as long as he}} remains undetected; time is slowed after each takedown, allowing the player to target the next enemy. Hazardous items such as power generators can be used in combat for environmental attacks. Combat is rewarded with experience points, which are used to unlock gadget abilities, combat moves, and health upgrades. Batman can now access grates from afar, allowing him to roll forward and immediately <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> grate if in range instead of having to be right on top of them, while also initiating multiple takedowns from within them. Some enemies carry devices capable of blocking Batman's Detective Vision.|$|E

500|$|Realizing {{that the}} ABC-UPT deal put DuMont near extinction, network {{officials}} were receptive to a merger offer from ABC. Goldenson quickly brokered {{a deal with}} Ted Bergmann, DuMont's managing director, under which the merged network would have been called [...] "ABC-DuMont" [...] until at least 1958 and would have honored all of DuMont's network commitments. In return, DuMont would get $5 million in cash, guaranteed advertising time for DuMont sets and a secure future for its staff. A merged ABC-DuMont {{would have been a}} colossus rivaling CBS and NBC, as it would have owned stations in five of the six largest U.S. television markets (excluding only Philadelphia) as well as ABC's radio network. It also would have inherited DuMont's de facto monopoly in Pittsburgh, and would have been one of two networks to have full ownership of a station in the nation's capital (the other being NBC). However, it would have had to sell a New York station – either DuMont's WABD or ABC flagship WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV), probably the former. It also would have had to sell two other stations – most likely ABC's two smallest O, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and KGO-TV in San Francisco (both broadcasting on channel 7) – to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> FCC's limit of five stations per owner.|$|E

Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{said that}} the in-game voice acting (provided by such stars as Debi Derryberry and Billy West) was [...] "clear and entertaining". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox {{also noted that the}} character voices were [...] "done well" [...] and that the music [...] "isn't annoying". However, Michael Lafferty of GameZone stated that the music can become [...] "a little tiring" [...] and [...] "annoying" [...] after a while. Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that the sound was [...] "respectable", but added that the [...] "attitude" [...] of the character sounds bites seemed [...] "forced". Ed Lewis of IGN {{said that the}} [...] "saving grace" [...] of the [...] "Looney Tunes-style repartee and sound effects" [...] is that [...] "it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly if you listen to it, it doesn't grate and <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> skin as other games can." [...] He added that the music was [...] "bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony". Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report described the music and sound effects as [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "plain" [...] respectively, and noted that {{the best part of the}} game's audio was [...] "that sexy talking mask that gives you advice between races, but even he gets rather annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} {{stalemate}} followed, {{during which time}} the regiment, {{along with the rest}} of the brigade, rotated between the forward position at Fara and other positions in support and reserve at Kukhari and Marakeb as preparations were made for a future offensive. The regiment's next major action came in October 1917. Conceived as part of an attack towards the Jerusalem to Jaffa line, the regiment took part in the Battle of Beersheba. During this battle, along with the 4th Light Horse Regiment, the 12th Light Horse carried out a successful mounted charge, advancing over open ground late in the afternoon to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman guns and capture the town and its vital water supplies. Late in the afternoon, the 12th Light Horse Regiment advanced, according to historian Henry Gullett, on a [...] "squadron frontage in three lines" [...] apart, with the 4th Light Horse Regiment to launch a [...] "pure cavalry" [...] charge, the troopers advancing with bayonets in their hands. Advancing over , the light horsemen were subjected to rifle and machine-gun fire and artillery bombardment from the flanks and trenches to their front. Supporting artillery helped suppress the machine-gun fire from the flanks, and the speed of the charge made it difficult for the Ottoman gunners to adjust their range. The Ottoman trenches were not protected with wire and after jumping over the trenches, the light horsemen dismounted and hand-to-hand fighting followed. While most of the 4th Light Horse and some of the 12th Light Horse dismounted, the remainder stayed mounted, continuing their charge into the town. The British official historian claims [...] "more than half the dismounted troops in the town were captured or killed," [...] while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured by the Desert Mounted Corps and XX Corps. Over 700 Ottoman soldiers were captured and, more significantly for the Australians, over 400,000 litres of water secured. In achieving this, the 12th lost 24 men killed and 15 wounded; 44 horses were also killed, while another 60 were wounded or became sick.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-August, Nashville was in third-place behind Evansville and the Atlanta Crackers. The {{race for}} the Southern League championship, {{determined}} by winning percentage, heated up following a disputed call during an August 10 contest at Athletic Park versus Atlanta. Nashville was trailing 10–8 in their last at bat in the ninth inning. They scored a run and still had men on first and second base with their catcher, Daniel Sweeney, at the plate. He hit a high foul fly ball back toward the grandstand. As Atlanta's catcher, Tug Wilson, attempted to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> ball, his foot slipped causing him to miss it. While reaching for the ball, a boy in the stands threw a baseball glove or cap past his head. The umpire, Clark, ruled this as interference and called Sweeney out, resulting in a 10–9 Seraphs loss.
