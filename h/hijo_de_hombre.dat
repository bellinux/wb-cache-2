5|$|In 1953 the {{collection}} of 17 short stories El trueno entre las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, {{but it was not}} until the 1960 publication of the novel <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{after the}} war {{he worked as a}} bank clerk and later as a journalist. During this time he began writing plays and poetry. In 1941 Roa Bastos won the Ateneo Paraguayo prize for Fulgencia Miranda, {{although}} the book was never published. In the early 1940s he spent significant time on the yerba mate plantations in northern Paraguay, an experience he would later draw upon in his first published novel, <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (1960; Son of Man). In 1942 he was appointed editorial secretary for the Asunción daily El País.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre.</b> Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E

Originally Los Piratos worked more with El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000, Jr., but <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Cien Caras was killed in November 2010 and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. began working more in AAA, which meant <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata began working more and more against <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 and Cien Caras, Jr. On December 19, 2010, Máscara Año 2000, Jr. won the IWRG Texas Heavyweight Championship from <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata. Over {{the next year or}} so the storyline was phased in and out as both {{competitors}} also pursued other championships and storilines. On September 16, 2012 the feud was reignited as <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata defeated <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 to win the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship in a match where <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata's IWRG Rey del Ring Championship was also on the line. Later on both of them were involved in a multi-man Steel Cage Match where the last man in the ring would lose either their championship or their mask. Both <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata and Hijode Máscara Año 2000 escaped the cage, which ended with El Ángel winning the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Oficial AK-47.

5|$|Roa Bastos' {{life and}} writing {{were marked by}} {{experience}} with dictatorial military regimes. In 1947 he was forced into exile in Argentina, and in 1976 he fled Buenos Aires for France in similar political circumstances. Most of Roa Bastos' work was written in exile, but this did not deter him from fiercely tackling Paraguayan social and historical issues in his work. Writing in a Spanish that was at times heavily augmented by Guaraní words (the major Paraguayan indigenous language), Roa Bastos incorporated Paraguayan myths and symbols into a Baroque style known as magical realism. He is considered a late-comer to the Latin American Boom literary movement. Roa Bastos' canon includes the novels <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (1960; Son of Man) and El fiscal (1993; The Prosecutor), as well as numerous other novels, short stories, poems, and screenplays.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Roa Bastos {{received}} a diversity of honors and distinctions. In 1941 he won the Ateneo Paraguayo Prize for his (unpublished) novel Fulgencio Miranda. This first award was followed by a British Council fellowship for journalism that enabled him to travel to Europe during World War II. In 1959 Roa Bastos won the Losada prize for his first published novel <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre.</b> The adaptation of this novel, for which he wrote the screenplay, won best film in the Spanish language and first prize of the Argentine Instituto de Cinematografia the following year. His most prestigious awards were a 1971 John Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship for creative writers, and in 1989, the Cervantes Prize, an award given by the Spanish government for lifetime achievement, and Spanish language literature's most prestigious prize. Roa Bastos donated most of his prize money to provide easier access to books in Paraguay.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (1960; Son of Man), Roa Bastos' first {{published}} and award-winning novel, represents his definitive break with poetry. It {{is seen as}} a refined [...] "outgrowth" [...] of his earlier works of short fiction such as El trueno entre las hojas (1953), which also dealt with themes of political oppression and social struggle in Paraguay. This novel portrays the conflict between the governing élite and the oppressed masses in Paraguay from 1912 until just {{after the end of the}} Chaco War with Bolivia in 1936. Like his later Yo, el Supremo, <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> draws upon a series of Paraguayan legends and stories dating back to start of Dr. Francia's dictatorship in 1814.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his main}} event victory <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 laid out another {{challenge}} to <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras {{to put the}} IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship on the line against him, a challenge <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras {{did not respond to}} at the time. The two rivals faced off in the 2015 Guerra de Familias tournament on July 5, 2015 where the team of <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras and Super Nova defeated <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000 Jr.|$|R

The storyline had really escalated in mid-2015 after <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras defeated <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 in a one-on-one match. A few weeks later <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 successfully defended the IWRG Rey del Ring ("King of the Ring") Championship against <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras, once again by resorting to underhanded means. On July 20, 2014 <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras won the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. In subsequent months <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 successfully defended the Rey del Ring championship once more where Cien Caras Jr. showed up to help his cousin out. The two rivals also competed in a MXN 50,000 Ladder match on IWRGs La Isla ("The Island") show alongside Demon Clown, Oficial AK-47, Dr. Wagner Jr., L.A. Park, Trauma I and Veneno, neither man won the match and were more focused on inflicting punishment on each other. The storyline between the two led to them both putting their championship {{on the line in}} a match, with <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras winning and thus walking away as both the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and the Rey del Ring Champion. <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras would remain a double champion for 98 days, until Máscara Año 2000 regained the championship on January 11, 2015 in a match where only the Rey del Ring Championship was on the line. At the 2015 Rebelión <b>de</b> los Juniors <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras outlasted a field of seven other wrestlers including <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000 to become the number one contender for the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship.

500|$|Even before Yo, el Supremo, Roa Bastos was {{considered}} part of [...] "the pantheon of great writers" [...] by some critics, due to <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre.</b> However, it was the former work that cemented his place as a significant literary figure. According to Juan Manuel Marcos, Yo, el Supremo [...] "anticipates many of the post-boom writing techniques" [...] such as [...] "the carnivalization of historical discourse, transtextualization, and parody". Mexican literary great, Carlos Fuentes has called Yo, el Supremo one of the milestones in Latin American literature. While his reputation rests on his novels, Roa Bastos' achievements in film, creative writing, and journalism add further substance to his legacy.|$|E
500|$|His writing deploys {{symbols and}} {{multiple}} narratives that {{build on the}} collective memory of the Paraguayan people. <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre,</b> for example, constructs an [...] "alternative history of popular movements" [...] out of the people's recollections and symbols. The intertextual novel Yo, el Supremo is particularly representative of this technique, both in its construction and narrative. In El Fiscal (1993), a third novel about the abuses of political power—this time focusing on Stroessner's régime—Roa Bastos again offers {{an alternative to the}} accepted versions of events in Paraguay and challenges [...] "the intelligibility of history". To this end he weaves elements of fantasy and metafiction into his narratives.|$|E
500|$|While most critics {{agree that}} the Boom started {{some time in the}} 1960s, there is some {{disagreement}} as to which work should be considered the first Boom novel. [...] Some (such as Alfred McAdam) would start with Julio Cortázar's Hopscotch (Rayuela in Spanish) from 1963 while others prefer Vargas Llosa's The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros in Spanish) which won the Biblioteca Breve Award in 1962. [...] Fernando Alegria considers Augusto Roa Bastos' <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> the inaugural work of the Boom even though, as Shaw notes, [...] "it was published in 1959." [...] One could, however, even go as far back as Miguel Ángel Asturias's 1949 novel Men of Maize.|$|E

During the match, Demon Clown attacked <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras with the ladder on several occasions until Demon Clown was able to climb the ladder and grab the bag of money. Following the ladder match, <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dos Caras successfully defended the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship against Demon Clown only a week after La Isla.|$|R
500|$|<b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> builds upon {{a system}} of Christian metaphors {{as part of the}} Neobaroque concept of Magic Realism, in order to examine the pain of being Paraguayan. This novel {{contrasts}} two figures: Miguel Vera and Cristóbal Jara. Vera narrates the odd chapters, although he might also be the narrator of all nine chapters (this is unclear). He is a well-to-do and educated romantic supporter of revolution, who is unable to take real action to support his ideals and in the end betrays them (not unlike [...] Judas). [...] Jara, on the other hand, is an uneducated [...] "son of man" [...] who becomes a Christ-like leader for Paraguayan people through action and strength of character. Although it was a massive critical success, Roa Bastos remained dissatisfied with the work for a number reasons. It was fourteen years before he published another novel.|$|E
500|$|Ruy Díaz de Guzmán's Anales del descubrimiento, población y conquista del Río de la Plata, is {{considered}} one of the most important antecedents to Roa Bastos' writings. Guzmán, a Paraguayan explorer of Guaraní and Spanish heritage, wrote extensively about the geography of Paraguay using mythical descriptions of the landscape and the Guaraní language. The most important precursor to Roa Bastos, however, is Rafael Barrett (1876–1910), whose writings incorporated many of the important themes and writings styles that Roa Bastos would later master including: Spanish-Guaraní bilingualism, magic realism, the revision of Paraguayan history, social literature, exploration of collective memory and the universe of poetic symbols. Barrett's essay [...] "Lo que son los yerbales" [...] is a severe critique of the exploitation of workers on yerba mate tea plantations. Roa Bastos spent part of the early 1940s documenting this same issue and there is much speculation about the role of [...] "Lo que son los yerbales" [...] in the creation of his first major novel <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre.</b> The Uruguayan writer Horacio Quiroga is another important predecessor.|$|E
500|$|Several {{other writers}} have been {{associated}} with the Boom. [...] Juan Rulfo, the author of two books, only one of them a novel, was the acknowledged master incorporated a posteriori; a writer who balances social concern, verbal experimentation and unique style. [...] Augusto Roa Bastos of Paraguay wrote <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre,</b> considered by some to be the first novel of the Boom. [...] His highly experimental I, the Supreme has been compared to Joyce's Ulysses and is [...] "one of the most highly regarded works of fictional history to ever come out of South America." [...] Manuel Puig, an Argentine, is a central figure, along with Vargas Llosa, of the Seix-Barral publishing world. The Cuban novelist José Lezama Lima, though not widely known in the English-language publishing world, can also be regarded as a major figure {{on the basis of his}} major novel, Paradiso (1966). José Donoso is a Chilean writer of both the Boom and the post-Boom. In his book, Historia Personal del [...] "Boom", [...] Donoso also mentions other writers associated with the movement. Examples are Jorge Amado (although he began writing novels back in the 1930s) of Brazil, Salvador Garmendia and Adriano González León of Venezuela, Gastón Suárez and Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz of Bolivia and David Viñas of Argentina, among many others.|$|E

El Hijo del Pirata Morgan and Trauma I won the match and thus were allowed to skip the first two rounds. In first round matches El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Mascara Ano 2000 defeated Bobby Lee Jr., Ultraman Jr. defeated El Hijo del Canek, Bestia 666 defeated Kung Fu Jr. and El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> LA Park defeats Carta Brava Jr. {{to qualify for the}} quarter-finals of the tournament. In the quarter-finals, <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Mascara Ano 2000 and El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> L.A. Park won their matches and moved on in the tournament. After sitting out for two rounds El Hijo del Pirata Morgan defeated Trauma I to qualify for the finals while El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> L.A. Park won his match as well.

5000|$|Thirst (Spanish: La sed) aka <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>Hombre,</b> aka Choferes del Chaco is a 1960 Argentine-Spanish war film {{directed}} by Lucas Demare. It is set during the Chaco War (1932-35) between Bolivia and Paraguay, sometimes {{known as the}} [...] "War of the Thirst". The script {{is based on a}} chapter of Augusto Roa Bastos novel <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>Hombre.</b> It was made as a co-production between Argentina Sono Film and the Spanish company Suevia Films.|$|E
50|$|In 1953 the {{collection}} of 17 short stories El trueno entre las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, {{but it was not}} until the 1960 publication of the novel <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on the oppressive history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> (1960; Son of Man), Roa Bastos' first {{published}} and award-winning novel, represents his definitive break with poetry. It {{is seen as}} a refined [...] "outgrowth" [...] of his earlier works of short fiction such as El trueno entre las hojas (1953), which also dealt with themes of political oppression and social struggle in Paraguay. This novel portrays the conflict between the governing élite and the oppressed masses in Paraguay from 1912 until just {{after the end of the}} Chaco War with Bolivia in 1936. Like his later Yo, el Supremo, <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> <b>hombre</b> draws upon a series of Paraguayan legends and stories dating back to start of Dr. Francia's dictatorship in 1814.|$|E
50|$|IWRG held a one night, ten man tournament on February 6, 2011 to {{determine}} the first ever IWRG Junior de Junior Champion. The tournament started with a Battle royal where the last two in the ring would advance straight to the semi finals. <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata Mogan and Trauma I advanced to the semi final match and <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata Morgan defeated <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> L.A. Park in the final.|$|R
25|$|The storyline between <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata and Factor did {{not really}} start until the fall of 2012, when Factor lost the Rey del Ring {{championship}} to <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata. He later regained the Rey del Ring title as well as won the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship from <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata. The two also had several heated exchanges in the 2012 El Castillo del Terror Steel cage match, but neither gained a definitive advantage over the other in that match. The three storylines were tied together through a match in mid-November where Factor successfully defended the Rey del Ring title against <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara Año 2000. Factor was forced by the wrestling commission to have Oficial 911 in his corner while <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Máscara had Cien Caras, Jr. in his corner. Following the title match all the involved participants as well as <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Pirata fought, leading to the various participants challenging the others to put their mask {{on the line in}} a Luchas de Apuestas or bet match.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{match of}} the show was {{scheduled}} to feature three wrestlers who had never worked for CMLL, but were not considered part of Los Invasores. The team consisted of second, or third generation wrestlers all sons of famous Luchadors as El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> L.A. Park (Son of L.A. Park), El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dr. Wagner Jr. (The son of Dr. Wagner Jr.) and El <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Solitario (the son of El Solitario) would team up and face the CMLL trio of La Máscara, Máscara Dorada and Valiente. The booking of <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> L.A. Park and <b>Hijo</b> <b>de</b> Dr. Wagner Jr. {{was a bit of}} a surprise as both their fathers work for CMLL's biggest competitor in Mexico AAA. This was the first time either of these young wrestlers had worked for CMLL and it was the biggest show for either up until this point.|$|R
