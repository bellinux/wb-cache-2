While reviewing the video, Vanity Fair magazine said in 1986 that Jackson [...] "might be Michael's androgynous twin in the sweep of her arm, the accusatory glare in her eyes, the collapsing diagonals of her dancing".|$|E

Maybe I’d cut his ear off, through a mistake or something. He’d laugh at me. So I’d throw it away, got to start all over again. He’d say, ‘Now you think you can’t put on, but you can take off. If you take off, you can’t put it back on.’Then, when I got older and went to work at the {{chemical}} plant, they all knowed what I was doing. I was doing that ‘cuz I never would go to sleep. I’d be carving to keep me awake or something like that. Well, that’s when I really went back to carving. I always did have something I like to put on wood. I actually saw a piece of wood that kinda reminded me of something, and so I started carving. I used to make pieces and set them in the window. You’d go to lunch, you’d come back and it’d be gone. And so I fixed them. I made a coffin with a dead man and stuck it in the window. He stayed there for about 2 months and nobody bothered it. We {{had a lot of fun}} with that thing. Nobody bothered. It’d sit there in the window and look at them, and nobody looked at it. Nobody steal nothing. If it was anything else, they’d get it. So maybe they thought it was like a booby trap.So when I retired from Allied Chemical, they bought me a pocket knife. They bought me some sandpaper and some wood like I usually bought then. They bought me that stuff and it had lines on each one of them. It said, ‘Now you do your carving on your own time, not the company’s time.’Now some people don’t know what to make of my carving. I got a couple of friends that come to the house, they don’t go to the cellar ‘cuz I usually have coffins sitting around there. You know the fellow I rent from, he don’t go down there. He says if anything would break, you fix it because I ain’t going down there. Then if he does come, he says if you gonna make things then cover them up so I can’t see ‘em, put a sheet or something on ‘em. One night he come to the door and I was trying to put a wig on those dead people in the coffin. He told me I was an idiot for doing stuff like that.I was down there one night.

Sometimes I get up, something I making and I can’t figure it out. And that bothers me. That’s where I go out. My mind’s stuck on it. Like somebody’s arm or nose don’t come out so well. I’m gonna think about it and finish this. I’ll do it, too. Any time I get something I can’t handle, it bothers me. I’ll leave and go get me a sandwich and coffee, and around a little bit I’ll get that off my mind, and I think about it and come back and do it.
