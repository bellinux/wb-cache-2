And in June, he traveled to Beijing to file the complaint and meet with foreign reporters to publicize the case. Although there had been prior instances of Chinese citizens filing complaints about abuses under the one-child policy, Chen’s initiative was the first class-action lawsuit to challenge <b>its</b> <b>implementation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation Tannenbaum, a {{military}} offensive intended to occupy all of Switzerland, most likely in co-operation with Italy (which itself desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland), {{was in the}} planning stages during 1940-1941. <b>Its</b> <b>implementation</b> was seriously considered by the German military after the armistice with France, but it was definitively shelved after the start of Operation Barbarossa had directed the attention of the Wehrmacht elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in <b>its</b> <b>implementation,</b> into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

An enhanced remake of the game, included in , was released in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cauldron, Palace {{employee}} Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect <b>its</b> <b>implementation.</b> Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} major general, Godley, {{together with}} fourteen British Army officers seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces, was tasked with reorganising and instilling professionalism {{in the military}} establishment of the country.

5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to <b>its</b> <b>implementation</b> in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that key members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.|$|E
5|$|Between 1984–1985, {{the city}} of Roanoke {{developed}} an Airport Master Plan calling for $43.8 million to be spent {{in the development of}} a new terminal building, in addition to other improvements throughout the site. With $15.4 million secured in state and local funding for <b>its</b> <b>implementation,</b> the remainder of the costs were covered by local authorities. From this need for funding, the idea for the creation of a Regional Airport Commission to oversee airport operations was proposed. Approved by the Virginia General Assembly on February 18, 1986, and initiated on July 1, 1987, the Roanoke Regional Airport Commission consisted of five members, with three appointed from Roanoke City and two appointed from Roanoke County. The creation of the commission ended {{the city of}} Roanoke's role as the sole operator of the airport, which had stretched from 1934 through 1987.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since <b>its</b> <b>implementation,</b> TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|In {{the urban}} {{expansion}} of Gateshead, Deckham was enveloped {{so that its}} exact boundaries are difficult to define. The estate had boundaries at Split Crow Road, Old Durham Road, Hendon Road and Carr Hill Road but documents indicate that Deckham stretches to Durham Road {{in the west and}} the streets adjoining Hendon Road as far north as the Bankies open space at Mount Pleasant. In1974 Deckham was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972. Until <b>its</b> <b>implementation,</b> Deckham was part of County Durham. It is now bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough. These are Sheriff Hill to the south, Low Fell and Shipcote to the west, Gateshead to the north and Felling and Carr Hill to the east.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for <b>its</b> <b>implementation,</b> arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} judge is {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying <b>its</b> <b>implementation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave <b>its</b> <b>implementation</b> to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the odds for the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{consulted}} with his frontline commanders and senior {{officers of the}} General Staff from 12 to 15 April 1943. In the end he and the Stavka agreed that the Germans would probably target Kursk. Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative, but Zhukov countered that the Germans would be drawn into a trap where their armoured power would be destroyed, thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet counteroffensive. They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings before launching their own offensive. Preparation of defences and fortifications began {{by the end of}} April, and continued until the German attack in early July. The two-month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and <b>its</b> <b>implementation</b> allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare.|$|E
