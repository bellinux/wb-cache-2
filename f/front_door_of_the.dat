5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house is open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a {{room filled with}} dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with {{a blow to the}} head.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{house that}} appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house {{in order to get to}} Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it through the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E
50|$|A red banner (红彩帘) will be hung across <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two {{household}} {{to announce}} the joyous event.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 <b>the</b> suburb <b>of</b> North Pine {{was renamed}} Petrie. At about this time, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church were {{replaced}} with doors from Tom Petrie's home. During the Second World War {{the ceiling was}} inserted.|$|R
25|$|Also on 26 November, the Civil Court {{issued an}} {{injunction}} ordering the PAD {{to leave the}} Suvarnabhumi International Airport immediately. Notices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injunction were placed on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13 PAD leaders. The PAD did not comply with the injunction.|$|R
5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} {{glass window}} on the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor prepares {{some food}} and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E
5|$|Somehow King {{walked in}} the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jail {{and a few minutes}} later out the back. King had {{arranged}} with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the Nugget) to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.|$|E
50|$|Attached to {{the school}} is the {{historic}} Meetinghouse and The Fifteenth Street Monthly Meeting <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Religious Society <b>of</b> Friends. <b>The</b> Meetinghouse plays an integral part in student life at Friends Seminary. Outside <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meetinghouse is the courtyard used for recess and other activities.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> {{withdrawal}} <b>of</b> a bid by Penske Automotive {{to acquire}} Saturn, the Motors Liquidation Company of General Motors announced in September 2009 {{that it would}} phase out the Saturn brand by October 31, 2010, when it ceased operations. The GM logos were applied on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outlook; the GM logo had stopped being applied on the Outlook in 2010, but the GM logo was applied on the early 2010 Outlook models.|$|R
25|$|On 14 October 2011, Johnson {{was arrested}} {{after he and}} two others chained {{themselves}} to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Department <b>of</b> Corrections and Rehabilitation in Sacramento, California. The three were protesting {{in support of a}} hunger strike being conducted by Pelican Bay State Prison inmates.|$|R
5|$|The Everett Station complex also {{includes}} a bus station with 26 bus bays that serve as a major transfer station for routes from Snohomish County. Everett Transit operates {{the majority of its}} bus routes out of their 12 bus bays on Smith Avenue. Community Transit has six routes at the station, serving as the terminus for local service from Smokey Point, Marysville, Snohomish, Lake Stevens, and Monroe; CT also debuted their Swift bus rapid transit service in 2009, with Everett Station as the northern terminus of the route along the Highway 99 corridor to Shoreline. Sound Transit runs three of its ST Express bus routes out of Everett Station, with peak-only, limited-stop service to Seattle and Bellevue, as well as all-day service to Seattle via Lynnwood Transit Center, along Interstate 5 and Interstate 405. Skagit Transit runs a weekday inter-county express route (Route 90X) from the station to the Skagit Transportation Center in Mount Vernon and Chuckanut Park & Ride in Burlington; Island Transit also runs a peak-only weekday express route (Route 412C) from Everett Station to Stanwood and Camano Island. Paratransit to the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station building is provided by Community Transit and Everett Station through the Dial a Ride program.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by {{one of the men who}} pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

2500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new {{features}} was the Latin inscription Terribilis est locus iste above the <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> taken from <b>the</b> Common Dedication <b>of</b> a Church, which translates as: [...] "This {{is a place}} <b>of</b> awe"; <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dedication reads [...] "this is God's house, <b>the</b> gate <b>of</b> heaven, and it shall be called <b>the</b> royal court <b>of</b> God." [...] <b>The</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dedication is above the front doors—the rest inscribed on the arches over <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church.|$|R
25|$|He {{died after}} {{suffering}} a heart attack while taking a bath on 26 June 1947 at Mickleham. He was exactly one week shy of his 77th birthday. He is buried there in St. Michael's Churchyard, Mickleham. The tomb, and Government of Canada marker outside, are steps from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. He is the only deceased former Canadian Prime Minister not buried in Canada. Unmarried, Bennett was survived by nephews William Herridge, Jr., and Robert Coats, and by brother Ronald V. Bennett. The viscountcy became extinct on his death.|$|R
2500|$|ABS-CBN held auditions {{stretching}} from May to June 2006 in various {{cities in the}} Philippines, as well as overseas auditions in Sydney, Milan, Tokyo, Dubai, and San Francisco, for the show's second season, which began on February 25, 2007 (it was originally scheduled for March), and ended on June 30 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same year. These same auditions were also held for another reality show, Pinoy Dream Academy, another Endemol franchise. This season of Pinoy Big Brother promised a bigger house, more housemates (fourteen to be exact), and a stricter Big Brother. The [...] "bigger house" [...] concept {{stems from the fact}} that the house area was expanded and used in Pinoy Dream Academy. The house had been expanded with larger living and dining areas, larger bedrooms, separate restrooms, and others. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> cameras had been increased from 27 to 42 and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house were now at the garden, leading to the eviction hall built next door which was the auditorium previously used in <b>the</b> first season <b>of</b> Pinoy Dream Academy. Previously <b>the</b> original <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house area lead to <b>the</b> facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Pinoy Ako had also been rehashed, this time sung by the band CeBaLo (Yvan Lambatan, Panky Trinidad, Eman Abatayo, and Davey Langit of Pinoy Dream Academy).|$|R
25|$|In many traditions, the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{house is}} opened at this point. Psalms 79:6-7 is recited in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi traditions, plus Lamentations 3:66 among Ashkenazim.|$|E
25|$|The Duke {{is today}} commemorated by an equestrian statue {{standing}} on Whitehall in central London; it is, somewhat ironically, positioned outside the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War Office that he so strongly resisted.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, hate {{messages}} were {{written on the}} <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synagogue, immediately prior to the arrival there of the Premier of Alberta and Mayor of Edmonton to celebrate the congregation's 100th anniversary. Membership was 250 families in 2008.|$|E
50|$|Both the state, as {{purchaser}} <b>of</b> services, and <b>the</b> {{operating company}} {{were surprised by}} <b>the</b> high numbers <b>of</b> passengers. <b>The</b> trains are often crowded at peak times. As a first step, a parallel bus service was introduced because the platforms at some stations are too short for operating double sets. However, a double set has been used since 12 December 2011 in the morning from Neumünster at 6:37 and from Oldesloe at 7:42, and in the afternoon from Neumünster at 16:37 and from Oldesloe at 17:42. Only <b>the</b> three <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains can be used at the short platforms.|$|R
2500|$|The {{north tower}} stands 130 {{feet tall and}} the south tower stands 123 feet tall.

[...] The sweeping stairwell leading to <b>the</b> attic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building found at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top floor is original to the structure. [...] <b>The</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rooms in the central [...] "shotgun" [...] hallway are structural and largely conform to <b>the</b> plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original building. [...] <b>The</b> cast-iron sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seats in the Giffels auditorium are supposedly cast from original molds.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> front facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{residence}} consists <b>of</b> eye-catching {{peach and}} white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned {{by a female}} face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house are wooden louvered characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. <b>The</b> interior consists <b>of</b> nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|R
25|$|Becker {{was born}} in 1928 in Madison, Illinois, to George and Frances Becker. He was raised in Granite City, Illinois, where the Becker family lived within 100 feet of {{the gates of the}} Granite City Steel Works mill. The heat from the mill could be felt through the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family home.|$|E
25|$|Lafontaine, exercising {{his role}} as Attorney General, advised Ermatinger to release the prisoners. On Saturday April 28, they were {{released}} on bail. A procession of omnibuses and cabs transported them in triumph from the prison to the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bank of Montreal, on Place d'Armes, where they addressed their partisans and thanked them for their support.|$|E
25|$|Welsh {{craftsman}} {{and artist}} John Petts {{was inspired to}} construct and deliver the iconic stained-glass Welsh Window to the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1965. The Welsh Window is a large stained-glass edifice depicting a black Jesus, with arms outstretched, reminiscent of the Crucifixion of Jesus. Erected at the church in 1965, the Welsh Window stands over the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary.|$|E
2500|$|The blocks {{along the}} street are {{elongated}} {{but only a few}} meters in width; those on the eastern side oriented lengthwise, and those on the western crosswise. [...] Only four blocks thus forms <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street while some 20 are lined-up along the western side. [...] Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings are located either on the quiet Prästgatan, the parallel street passing along the eastern side, or in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerous alleys on the street's western side. [...] <b>The</b> intact façades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northernmost blocks are hiding <b>the</b> semi-detached offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riksdag. [...] To <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> those are <b>the</b> remaining numerous and very narrow blocks and alleys which before <b>the</b> great fire <b>of</b> 1625 occupied <b>the</b> entire western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> Benavides {{was taken}} to Puebla and {{displayed}} in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> La Compañía church. The {{reason for this is}} not known.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{interior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{machine was}} very complicated {{and designed to}} mislead those who observed it. When opened on <b>the</b> left, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if <b>the</b> back <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. <b>The</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line <b>of</b> vision through <b>the</b> machine. Underneath <b>the</b> robes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed <b>the</b> presenter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|R
25|$|A 31-year-old man {{was arrested}} for battery on a police officer for {{allegedly}} punching a police officer and hitting another officer with a picket sign during a protest at the Santa Rosa City Hall on December 10, 2013. Charges were dropped against him in May 2014. A second person {{was arrested for}} obstructing a police officer and violating probation. Multiple protesters vandalized the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sonoma County Jail, breaking its glass.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, two stone lions {{were placed}} at the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Avenue Building, as symbols of {{guardianship}} of the people’s money. The stately lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by Max Kohler, each from a single block of quarry-bedded brownstone. A project to restore the lions began in September 2009 and was completed in June 2013. The two new exact replica lions were created by Master Carver Nicolas Fairplay. The original lions sit inside the Fourth Avenue building.|$|E
25|$|The Museum at Casa Armstrong Poventud {{presents}} the latest architectural and artistic taste in vogue {{at the end}} of the 19th century in Europe. For example, heavy use of glass on doors and windows. The glass decor used in the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residence, for instance, is almost identical to those used in the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in England years earlier. The floral and natural motifs in the residence, are also characteristic of those comprising the new artistic expression of the Victorian Era evident in Europe and the United States in the first decades of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{conservation}} works {{have taken place}} since the Gayndah Shire Council purchased the Brick Cottage in 1969. In 1988 the original shingled roof was removed and replaced with a corrugated iron hip roof. At this time, work was also carried out on the ceiling, which needed to be repaired again in 1994, as {{it was beginning to}} sag due to incorrect installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof timbers. The dirt floor in the main room was laid with concrete to match the exposed floor in <b>the</b> bedrooms, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cottage were replaced and the interior walls replastered. The mantels over the central fireplace were also replaced, on one side with what is believed to be a replica <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original and the other with the mantel from the fireplace at Ban Ban homestead.|$|R
50|$|Constable Ainsworth and Teddy Moore {{arrived at}} the Wilson Ranch house on <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> April 7, 1899, {{sometime}} after dawn, but before noon. The two lawmen were side-by-side and approximately forty feet from <b>the</b> front porch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house when Ainsworth read the arrest warrant aloud and demanded that the Halderman brothers come out peaceably. When {{it seemed as though}} the two young men were going to surrender without resisting, Ainsworth suggested that they eat breakfast before leaving and pack some of their belongings for staying a few days in Pearce. However, while inside the house, the Haldermans decided that Moore intended to do them harm, rather than take them to jail, so they armed themselves and reappeared at <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, which were located at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the wars}} the school's {{sporting}} prowess continued, and in 1929 a thatched pavilion {{was built on}} the playing fields, paid for out <b>of</b> tuckshop profits. <b>The</b> pavilion has <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former home <b>of</b> W.G.
