It is concluded that <b>homogeneous</b> ice <b>nucleation</b> {{is responsible for}} the ice production in these clouds at temperatures below about - 33 C. The lack of ice nucleation observed above - 33 C indicates a dearth of ice-forming nuclei, and hence heterogeneous ice nucleation, in these clouds. Aircraft measurements in the temperature range - 31 to - 41 C show the following complement of simultaneous and abrupt changes in cloud properties that indicate a transition from the liquid phase to ice: disappearance of liquid water; decrease in relative humidity from near water saturation to ice saturation; increase in mean particle size; change in particle concentration; and change in temperature due to the release of latent heat. A numerical model of cloud particle growth and <b>homogeneous</b> ice <b>nucleation</b> is used to aid in interpretation of our in situ measurements. The abrupt changes in observed cloud properties compare favorably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with results from the <b>homogeneous</b> ice <b>nucleation</b> model.

2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (<b>homogeneous</b> <b>nucleation),</b> and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|E

Our results suggest that water diffusion in SOA particles is faster than often assumed and imposes no significant kinetic limitation on water uptake and release at temperatures above 220 K. The fast diffusion of water suggests that heterogeneous ice nucleation on a glassy core is very unlikely in these systems. At temperatures below 220 K, model simulations of SOA particles suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleation may occur in the immersion mode on glassy cores which remain embedded in a liquid shell when experiencing fast updraft velocities.

30|$|Among various polymers, PANI as a {{versatile}} conducting polymer is usually selected to compound with noble metals or inorganic particles owing to its easy preparation, anticorrosion, {{and the low}} cost of raw material. Recently, Kamchi et al. [3] have elaborated serials of camphor-doped PANI/FeNi nanoparticle-based EMI shielding composites. The maximum conductivity value of 104  S m- 1 and the shielding effectiveness (SE) of 90  dB of the prepared multilayer composites have been detected over the frequency band of 8 to 18  GHz. Leyva et al. [15] have successfully synthesized kinds of hybrid organic/inorganic PANI-Ag powders via in situ chemical oxidation of PANI-emeraldine base by the capped Ag+ on the PANI-emeraldine base surface. The electrical direct current conductivity of the resulting PANI-Ag reaches 3.5 [*]×[*] 103  S m- 1 at room temperature, showing a good conductivity. Moreover, Shukla et al. [16] have also prepared homogeneous PANI-Ag core-shell nanorods synthesized via a mild photolysis-initiated ultraviolet radiation. The core-shell nanorods display a strong blueshift in the UV-visible (UV–vis) absorption spectrum and have instant application as a highly sensitive hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide sensor. However, the EMI shielding properties have not been studied. In addition, relevant PANI-based nanowires, nanorods, and core-shell nanoparticle EMI composites have been successfully prepared elsewhere [17 – 20]. Actually, many researches have been done to improve both the EMI SE and the cost performance by enhancing the conductivity and lowering the magnetic loss. Unfortunately, most of the developed hybrid EMI shielding materials are binary composites comprised of polymer/metal, polymer/inorganic, or metal/inorganic. These materials still suffer disadvantages of low EMI SE, limited shielding frequency range, high density, and high cost. Furthermore, from {{the angle of the}} crystal growth dynamics, most of the developed binary composites are simple blends or epitaxial blends. In the in situ preparation process of the second layer of the binary hybrid nanoparticles or nanocomposites, an obvious contradiction between the formation of more <b>homogeneous</b> <b>nucleations</b> and the heterogeneous nucleation and epitaxial growth of the second layer should be firstly solved.
