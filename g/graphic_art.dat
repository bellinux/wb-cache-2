A PPML producer that generates a PPML dataset that conforms to the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conformance level (PPML/GA) can then be printed using any <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conforming consumer.

5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E

25|$|The Leningrad-based {{newspaper}} Moscow {{offices were}} intended to be first and foremost an advertising magnet, rather than actual offices. The client secured a strategic but very small (6×6 meters) parcel of land on Strastnaya Square in Moscow. The Vesnins responded with a lean, six-storey tower housing two-storey public area (newsstand and reading room) and four-storey editorial office. It embraced various engineering and avant-garde novelties, including Alexander's own stage sets and the design cues of Nikolai Ladovsky's rationalist school. However, the building was completely devoid of <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> or sculpture of any kind. Alexander Vesnin rejected the concept of synthesis of the arts: for them, architectural form itself synthesized past experience in <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> and spatial installations, and need no embellishments besides the inevitable advertising.|$|E

25|$|Collaborative works {{illustrate}} {{the way in}} which manga and its European and American counterparts are seen by Algerian graphic artists: not as mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary media that can bring together diverse readerships. The foreign analogues to the different strains of Algerian <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> – , comics and manga – are often defined by their differences with each other; collectively produced manga such as /, instead, bring diverse sources together with new modes of affiliation based on non-hierarchical relations. In such works, artists draw their stylistic choices from an array of ideas which are neither localized nor confined, creating a composite structure which forces readers to move consciously in a world marked by a transnational fluidity of images and references.|$|E
25|$|Anime is {{a diverse}} art form with {{distinctive}} production methods and techniques {{that have been}} adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. It consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining <b>graphic</b> <b>art,</b> characterization, cinematography, {{and other forms of}} imaginative and individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> of {{all kinds}} often {{depicted}} Black characters in a stylized fashion, emphasizing certain physical features to form a recognizable racial caricature of Black faces. These features often included long unkempt hair, broad noses, enormous red-tinted lips, dark skin and ragged clothing reminiscent of those worn by Black slaves. These characters were also depicted as speaking accented English. In the early 20th century United States, these kinds of representations were seen frequently in newspaper comic strips and political cartoons, {{as well as in}} later comic magazines, and were also present in early cartoons by Disney and Looney Tunes. In comics, nameless Black bystanders (see right) and even some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including Ebony White, sidekick of The Spirit (see below) and Steamboat, valet of Billy Batson.|$|E
