This {{acceptance of the}} probabilistic approach, following Boltzmann, for Planck was a radical change from his former position, which till then had deliberately opposed such thinking proposed by Boltzmann. Heuristically, Boltzmann had distributed the energy in arbitrary merely mathematical quanta [...] , which he had proceeded to make tend to zero in magnitude, because the finite magnitude [...] had served only to allow definite counting {{for the sake of}} mathematical calculation of probabilities, and had no physical significance. Referring to a new universal constant of nature, , Planck supposed that, in the several oscillators of each of the finitely many characteristic frequencies, the total energy was distributed to each in an integer multiple of a definite physical unit of energy, , not arbitrary as in Boltzmann's method, but now for Planck, in a new departure, characteristic of the respective characteristic frequency. His new universal constant of nature, , is now known as Planck's constant.|$|E

Yet, in teaching {{students how to}} design, <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> are typically only granted a secondary role. So, how do designers and students develop a mindset for using <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods?</b> In this paper, we study how prior knowledge (about <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> and their usage) and preference (for using <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods)</b> relate to the reported use of <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> when designing. Drawing on a survey among 304 students enrolled in a master-level course on design theory and methodology, we investigated method usage for five activities in the basic design cycle: (1) analysis, (2) synthesis, (3) simulation, (4) evaluation and (5) decision-making. The {{results of the study}} showed that knowledge and preference both influence method usage. Additionally, the results showed that for all activities except evaluation, knowledge indirectly influenced method usage through a ‘complementary’ mediation of method preference.

6000|$|In {{addition}} to moral discussions, {{that at the}} best are very second-rate eloquence, and at the worst are respect destroying, mind destroying gabble, there are various forms of [...] "ethical" [...] teaching, advocated and practised in America and in the elementary schools of this country. For example, a story of an edifying sort is told to the children, and comments are elicited upon the behaviour of the characters. [...] "Would you have done that?" [...] "Oh, no, teacher!" [...] "Why not?" [...] "Because it would be mean." [...] The teacher goes into particulars, whittling away at the verdict, and at last the fine point of the lesson stands out. Now it may be indisputable that such lessons can be conducted effectively and successfully by exceptionally brilliant teachers, that children may be given an excellent code of good intentions, and a wonderful skill in the research for good or bad motives for any given course of action {{they may or may}} not want to take, but that they can be systematically trained by the average teacher at our disposal in this desirable [...] "subject" [...] is quite another question. It is one of the things that the educational reformer must guard against most earnestly, the persuasion that what an exceptional man can do ever and again for display purposes can be done successfully day by day in schools. This applies to many other things besides the teaching of ethics. Professor Armstrong can give delightfully instructive lessons in chemistry according to the <b>heuristic</b> <b>method,</b> but in the hands of the average teacher by whom teaching must be done for the next few years the heuristic system will result in nothing but a pointless fumble. Mr. Mackinder teaches geography--inimitably--just to show how to do it.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we study the {{reported}} use of systematic and <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> for 304 {{students enrolled in}} a master-level course on design theory and methodology. What to teach design and engineering students about methods is an important topic for discussion. One {{reason for this is}} that the experiences of design educators when using methods in their teaching do not always sit well with how methods are portrayed in the literature. Based on self-reports of the students, we study the use of systematic and <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> for the five activities in the basic design cycle: (1) analysis, (2) synthesis, (3) simulation, (4) evaluation, and (5) decision-making. The results of our study suggest that systematic and <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> fulfil different roles for the students when designing. The students reported to use <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> significantly more for synthesis, while they reported to use systematic methods significantly more for evaluation and decision making. In understanding the potential origin of these use practices, we call for more in-depth studies on method usage in design, for instance related to the role of preference and knowledge on systematic and <b>heuristic</b> <b>methods</b> usage.
