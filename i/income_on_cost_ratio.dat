On average households in Europe spend between 10 % to 20 % of their net <b>income</b> <b>on</b> transport [33]. However, the figures differ substantially between income groups. While the lowest <b>income</b> groups spend, <b>on</b> average, less on transport than higher income groups due to low levels of car ownership, the situation is fundamentally different if only households with car-related transport costs are taken into account.

40|$|In the {{research}} and policy community there is ongoing debate about the measurement of housing affordability. This debate is important because what we measure affects the perceived prevalence of housing affordability problems, who should be targeted for intervention, and ultimately it reflects how well government agencies have addressed the affordability problem. This paper examines individual self-assessments of housing affordability stress, and evaluates {{the degree to which}} the two most commonly applied ratio measures of housing stress actually reflect that experience. The two ratio measures examined are the 30 %Rule (defined as households spending 30 % or more of <b>income</b> <b>on</b> housing <b>costs),</b> and the 30 / 40 Rule (households in the lowest 40 per cent of the income distribution who spending 30 % or more of <b>income</b> <b>on</b> housing <b>costs).</b> We note in this paper that in addition to defining and calculating housing stress, an additional and under-acknowledged means to identify those in housing stress is to ask them: to borrow from Allport (1941), if you want to know if people are in housing stress ask them. We use survey data from low income individuals and ask if housing costs meant they could not pay for bills, meals or utilities. We classify this as self-identified housing stress. In this paper we compare the characteristics of populations who are classified by each housing stress approach (self-assessed, the 30 %Rule and the 30 / 40 Rule). We then undertake Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the degree to which a ratio measure predicts self-identified housing stress and find that these ratio rules are not particularly accurate.

The optimal waiting time is higher for treatments with demands more elastic to waiting time, higher costs, lower charges, smaller marginal welfare loss from waiting by treated patients, and smaller marginal welfare losses from under-consumption of care. The results hold for a wide range of welfarist and non-welfarist objective functions and for systems in which there is also a private health care sector.
