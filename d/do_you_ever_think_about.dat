5000|$|IBS News is an American {{news channel}} {{that appears to}} be a parody of FOX News. The station's newsreaders, Anthony Markowitz and Julia Regan (Claudia Christian), give long pieces of opinion after every topic, often using the phrases 'I'm no expert' or 'I don't pretend to know much about this, but...'. Anthony tends to give colloquial, ill-informed opinion ("When you flush the toilet on an aeroplane, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> where it goes? I sure don't!"), while Julia gives {{incredibly}} political commentary on the outcome ("Imagine the effect this will have on the already strict aviation guidelines in force"). They then inevitably link the story, however tenuously, to the weather report ("No more frozen urine falling from the sky, but expect rain over North Carolina"). It also covers the [...] "Vincenti Trial", a parody of the Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson trials, where the main defendant is accused of murdering his wife who was having affairs with three different women in three hotels in three states simultaneously while technically dead ("Of course {{whether or not this is}} even possible has to be considered a legal nicety").|$|E

Ok, so it’s almost Father’s Day and we’re {{talking about}} maintenance. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how generally, we dads {{are in charge}} of {{maintaining}} everything greasy, dirty or grimy that’s outside, under or in the bowels of our house, while moms {{are in charge of}} maintaining everything else inside the house? Maintenance is something we should do for everything we own, and the older I get the more I think about maintenance BEFORE I purchase a product. The more expensive the car, for example, the more likely we’re going to want the best oil to maintain it. We all know what happens when we fail to keep fresh, or enough oil in an engine. Chiropractic physicians have long held that regular monthly follow up treatments even after you have reached maximum improvement are just as helpful for the spine, as are those regular oil changes you provide to your car.

5000|$|Dawes only {{competed in}} the team {{competition}} in 1992, not breaking through as an all-around gymnast until 1993. She is probably {{best known for her}} performances at the 1993 and 1994 World Championships. In 1993, Dawes led the competition after three events, even beating her more famous teammate Shannon Miller. However, she decided to try her harder vault (1½ twisting layout Yurchenko) worth a 10.00 instead of simply a full-twisting layout Yurchenko, which had been devalued to a 9.8. She made the first vault, but slipped and fell on the second, immediately bursting into tears. With the new rule that both vaults were averaged in all-around competition, her fall dropped her to 4th overall while Miller won the title. Famously, after the vault fall Dawes's coach Kelli Hill exhorted her to be proud of her performance anyway, stating: [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave". Dawes did so and earned a standing ovation from the crowd.
