40|$|The {{complete}} physiopathology {{is still}} unclear. Two separate processes have been described: a progressive calcification of medium and small vessels of the subcutaneous and fat tissues {{related to an}} abnormal phosphate/calcium ratio occurring {{in the presence of}} predisposing factors (chronic vasculopathy, diabetes mellitus, obesity, renal insufficiency, etc.) and an acute phase caused by a decreased blood flow (hypotension, hemostatis perturbations and coagulopathy, infection, injury, etc.) causing the infarction of the tissues. The main risk factor for calciphylaxis is the chronic renal insufficiency with or without a hyperparathyroidy.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this article is to report our {{experience}} concerning the indications and results for combined liver-kidney transplantation in our centre. MATERIAL AND METHOD: From July 1991 to October 2006, 26 patients underwent combined liver-kidney transplantation in our establishment. This group comprised 16 men and 10 women with a mean age of 50. 1 years (range: 19 to 68 years). The main indications were as follows: hepatorenal polycystic disease, type I hyperoxaluria, cirrhosis associated with end-stage renal failure. RESULT: The median follow-up was 62. 73 (+/- 50. 9) months. Only two patients of this series died, one at 70 months from gastric cancer, and the other at 89 months from cerebral metastases. Nine patients developed surgical complications (29 %). Liver function was normal in the 24 surviving patients. Only one case of loss of renal graft was observed at 12 years and this patient is currently on dialysis. The mean creatinine level in these patients (apart from the <b>dialysed</b> <b>patient)</b> at the last follow-up visit was 120. 3 (+/- 30. 43) mumol/l. CONCLUSION: Combined liver-kidney transplantation can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality and excellent long-term results...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{was to examine}} the {{lifestyle}} and life quality of chronically <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients.</b> I described this wide topic {{from the point of view}} of patients, with whom I conducted interviews according to prepared questions, i. e. qualitative research. For healthcare staff providing immediate professional care in dialysis centres I used quantitative research by means of questionnaires. I processed 71 questionnaires and spoke to 12 patients in total. I found the sources in seven healthcare facilities in South and central Bohemian regions. The aim of the thesis was met. The decisive and related aspects linked to the lifestyle and life quality of chronically <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> were described. During preparation of the thesis I met new aspects like the extraordinary demandingness of the work of the healthcare staff, the important influence of science on medical procedures and psychical demandingness and patience of treated patients. The research questions were answered and in the instance of ambiguousness they were deduced and statistically substantiated. Two hypotheses, namely H 1 : Nurses in dialysis centres educate <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> about the limitations linked to lifestyle quality and H 2 : Nurses in dialysis centres adhere to the principles of specific (structured) communication have been confirmed. My work involved a proposal of an informative brochure for chronically <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients,</b> which sets the goal to inform <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> optimistically, with certain hyperbole, however realistically on the endless possibilities how to use free time in the form of topics, on self-confidence strengthening and effective communication with healthcare staff...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to describe the complications that the patients undertaking the chronic dialysis programme face. The purpose {{of the work is}} to identify the most frequent complications such patients have, the possible causes of these complications and the ways that help the patients overcome their problems. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and an empirical part. At the beginning of the theoretical part I am discussing the concept of the complications from various angles and points of view. In the second chapter I am concentrating on the description of general problems of the chronically ill patients and in the third and fourth chapter I am investigating the common problems of hem dialysed and peritoneal <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients.</b> The theoretical part serves {{as the basis for the}} following empirical part. Using a questionnaire I have addressed 100 <b>patients</b> (50 hem <b>dialysed</b> and 50 peritoneal <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients)</b> with the aim to find out the most burdening problems the patients have to deal with. The questions in the questionnaire concerned the physical, psychical and social side of their problems.

40|$|Human peritoneal macrophages {{isolated}} from uremic patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis bind type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coil {{in the absence}} of opsonins. The number of bacteria bound per macrophage was 6. 9, as determined by microscopic examination. Methyl a-mannoside (0. 1 mM) and p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside (0. 01 mM) inhibited this binding by about 66 %. The ability of peritoneal macrophages to bind E. coil in a mannose-specific manner was confirmed in further experiments using an enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) with an antibacterial antibody, radiolabelled E. coil, and counts of colony-forming units (CFU). The number of bacteria bound per macrophage was 7 to 12 in the ELISA and 5. 5 - 8. 5 in the CFU assay. Methyl a-mannoside caused 70 % inhibition of binding in the ELISA and 84 % in the CFU assay, whereas p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside showed inhibition of 79 % and 90 %, respectively. Most bound bacteria (76 - 8 O%) were subsequently killed. Nonfimbriated E. coil 827 bound poorly to the macrophages (- 22 %) as compared to that of the fimbriated bacteria. Although this binding was not inhibited by methyl a-D-mannoside or p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside, the percentage of bacteria killed was {{similar to that of the}} fimbriated phenotype. The peritoneal macrophage is thus able to phagocytose E. coil {{in the absence of}} opsonins.

40|$|Nursing care in {{nephrology}} brings certain specifics {{both for}} the patient and for the nursing staff concerned. For each member of a nephrology multidisciplinary team that participates in identification and meeting bio-psycho-social and spiritual needs of dialysed patients, the quality nursing care provision and the patientsÂ´ safety assuring should be the rule. To assure quality care provision in a health care facility, {{it is necessary to}} define the professional level of quality, i. e. to introduce processual nursing standards at the national level for all dialysis centers. The objective of this thesis was to make a survey of historical milestones in the development of nephrology nursing in the Czech Republic (in the former Czechoslovakia), from its beginning to present days. In individual parts of the theoretical section various contexts of nursing issues (historical, legal, social, relational, educational) and their interaction are described. The thesis also is focused on detection the importance of aspects influencing the quality of provided nursing care in nephrology and realization of analysis the use and compliance with the existing local nursing standards in individual dialysis centers in the Czech Republic. Another objectives of this thesis were detection of satisfaction rate with existing national standards for nephrology nursing care and to make up a proposal of a national processual standard of nursing care provided to adult dialysed patients. To obtain data the mixed methods research was used. The practical part offers, through conclusions of the quantitative research, explanations of many facts by confirmation or refutation of hypotheses arisen from the qualitative research. The nursing research was conducted through a questionnaire survey in dialysis centers in the Czech Republic. The respondents were head nurses - nursing care managers working in these units. Interviews with representatives of the biggest professional organization of nurses { [...] } the Czech Nurses Association were also carried out as another research procedure. The survey outcomes have clearly demonstrated the need to introduce national processual standards of nursing care in nephrology practice. Description of the present state is the first step for its improvement. The way out from the current situation is the development of general national processual standards for individual areas of care for nephrology patients and subsequent introduction of them into clinical practice in all dialysis centers in the Czech Republic. One of the components of the thesis is a proposal of the national processual standard of nursing care for a <b>dialysed</b> <b>patient</b> with acute or permanent central venous catheter (CVC).

Methodology - Method of research-anonymous, questionnairing inquest. After explaining the purpose of research, relevance, substantiality, questionnaires were distributed. Investigatives â KMUC Nephrological clinics, the department of dialysis, where the pacients having chronic insufficiency of kidney function are treated by dialysis were chosen for research. Two questionnaires were intended: Â·	one is assigned for <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> trying to compare psychological problems, communication problems {{of those who were}} haemodialysed long ago and not long ago. 76 patients participated. Â·	other for general practices nurses, trying to ascertain personnel opinion about <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients,</b> their communication and psychological problems. 14 nurses participated in the research. Results Life of <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> and their families changes very much. Very often dialysed person canât work, possibilities of social activity declines. Most of the patients very often are unstable, they are afraid of the treatment and of the future. Those who are dialysed for a longer period feel concern more often than those who are dialysed till three years. Psychological problems that appear are mostly solved by immediate family.

We compared T cell functions in ESRD patients undergoing haemodialysis (n = 20), or were not dialysed and received conventional medical treatment (n = 20). Healthy volunteers (n = 15) served as controls. The T cell phenotype was examined by immunofluorescence using fluorochrome-labelled monoclonal antibodies and FACS analysis. The concentration of soluble CD 95 /Fas and of tumour necrosis factor-Î± receptor type 1 (sTNFR 1) in the sera was quantified by ELISA. Activation-induced programmed T cell death was triggered by anti-CD 3 /CD 28 antibodies and measured by 7 -AAD staining. All immunological tests were performed at least 1 month after dialysis initiation. T cell proliferation in response to phytohaemagglutinin or anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies was moderately diminished in non-dialysed patients and markedly reduced in haemodialysis patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0 Â· 01 and P < 0 Â· 001, respectively). In a mixed lymphocyte culture the proliferative response of T cells from <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> was significantly diminished (P < 0 Â· 001).

40|$|Through the {{treatment}} of anaemia in dialysis patients part of the iron ions remain free in the serum {{which is at the}} bacterias disposal for growth and the strengthening of their virulence. The linear relation of the increased serum iron level and tissue iron stores in the body and the infection incidence in <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> has become more emphasised. The need of a clearly defined upper threshold of the serum iron concentration limit has been mentioned in scientific journals intensely, and consequently the demand for more precise professional instructions for anaemia treatment. For the purpose of participating in these professional and scientific discussions, we have observed the relation between the iron overload of the organism and complication incidence in 120 of our haemodialysis uremic patients, with special emphasis on infections. It has been established that the sepses incidence is much higher in patients with a serum ferritin concentration above 500 mg/L, than in those patients with a ferritin level lower than the mentioned value (c 2 = 7. 857, p= 0. 005). The incidence of vascular access infection is significantly higher in those patients with a serum ferritin level above 500 mg/L than in those patients with a ferritin level lower than the mentioned value (c 2 = 23. 186, p= 0. 001). Furthermore, it has been determined that the incidence of total infection in patients is 3. 8 episodes per 100 patients months, which is in accordance to the referral values of other authors.

BEN group differentiates from control group: BAI-total (R= 1. 110, OR= 0. 578 (95 %), CI= 0. 770 â 0. 890, P= 0. 001), HDRS-total (R= 0. 995, OR= 1. 290 (95 %), CI= 1. 180 â 1. 920 P = 0. 001. BEN group have lower scores than the control group in MMSE-total: (R= 0. 430, OR= 0. 023 (95 %), CI= 0. 034 â 2. 850, P = 0. 001) which represents the organic part of anxiety. Thanatophobia is present in both groups, but it is more frequent in the BEN (11. 70 %) than in control group (7. 50 %). We found that thanatophobia occurs before dialysis, and that it is structured as a pervasive fear of death and is associated with endemia, years spent on dialysis, and avoidance of dialysis...|$|R

40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of group I and II pepsinogens (PG I and PG II) were determined in 15 {{patients with chronic}} renal failure. Gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and acid secretion tests were also performed. Five patients had histologically confirmed severe Brunner's gland hyperplasia manifesting as multiple polyps in the duodenal bulb. Five patients had a mild form of Brunner's gland hyperplasia which was evident only by histological analysis. Five had no signs of such alterations. The three groups of patients were comparable in age, sex, mean level of serum creatinine, mean duration of dialysis treatment, distribution of non-dialysed and <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients,</b> and gastric histology.

40|$|Investigations {{concerning}} {{the influence of}} pharmacologic agents on transperitoneal water movement are predominantly undertaken {{in the hope that}} their results can help in a restoration of net ultrafiltration (UF) volume toward normal in cases with declining UF during long-term dialysis treatment. Net UF volume represents the difference between net transcapillary UF and lymphatic absorption. The choice of a pharmacological agent for enhancing UF depends on the mechanisms responsible for net UF loss, which include: (a) early dissipation of the transperitoneal osmotic gradient; (b) decrease in the peritoneal surface area; (c) Iymphomonokine overproduction; (d) enhanced lymphatic absorption; (e) high residual volumes left in the peritoneal cavity; or (f) a combination of these factors. Leakage of dialysate to the abdominal wall sometimes occurring in peritoneally <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> (1), according to a definition of net UF volume, cannot be regarded as a true UF loss.

40|$|Nosocomial {{transmission}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) to haemodialysed patients, strongly suspected in epidemiological studies, {{has recently been}} unequivocally demonstrated by molecular virology reports. Potential transmission mechanisms include staff hands, dialysis monitors, and equipment items shared between patients. The respective involvement {{of each of these}} vectors in HCV transmission has not been determined. Then is no conclusive data on the reality of HCV transmission by dialyser re-use. Prevention of HCV transmission relies on the use of erythropoietin, blood donor screening for anti-HCV antibodies and the application of 'Universal Precautions' (Atlanta CDC). in contrast, isolation of anti-HCV-positive <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> {{does not appear to be}} warranted by prospective studies. as it might increase the risk of co-infection by different HCV strains, would entail additional costs and be at best partially effective.

40|$|Nutritional {{status is}} an {{important}} predictor of clinical outcome in <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients.</b> Beside decreased serum protein/albumin,lower BMI with decreased muscle mass {{is the most significant}} predictor of morbidity and mortality. Keto amino acids (KA) represent an additional source for protein anabolism influencing indirectly also carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,Ca-P and acid base balance. Additionaly,by concominant metabolic and hemodynamic effect on residual nefrons, KA can help to slow progression of residual renal function (RRF) mainly in peritoneal dialysis patients. We conducted a long-term prospective randomized placebo controlled trial to test whether a modified low-protein diet (LPD) with or without keto acids (KA) would be safe,well tolerated and associated with an increase of metabolic status and preservation of RRF in peritoneal dialysis (PD). We evaluated a total of 62 PD patients (32 M/ 30 F) aged 26 - 72 yrs with creatinine clearance (Ccr) 7. 9 - 5. 7 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 for a period of 12 months. All patients were on modified LPD containing 0. 8 protein/kg/IBW/day and 135 /kJ/kg/IBW/day. LPD was randomly supplemented with KA at dosage of 100 mg/kg/IBW/day (30 patients, Group I) while 30 patients (Group II) received placebo. We analysed also muscle and fat metabolism by MR spectroscopy (MRS, m. tibialis anterior)) and imagining (MRI,visceral fat). Patients from Group I were before enrolment on conservative management using LPD + KA (0. 6 g P + 0. 1 g KA/kg/IBW/day) for longer time (18 - 48 months, median 28) with good compliance (SGA). Patients from group II were never treated with LPD and KA. All patients were monitored at the beginning of PD and at every 3 months for 12 months.;A neutral or positive long- term nitrogen balance (nPCR in g/kg IBW/day) was achieved in Group I (p< 0. 05). RRF measured as Ccr remained stable in Group I (6. 5 Â± 2. 18 to 5. 9 Â± 2. 54 ml/min, p=NS),while it decreased in Group II (6. 7 Â± 2. 22 to 3. 2 Â± 1. 44 ml/min, p< 0. 02). There were no differences in Dialysate clearance (DCcr(L/week/ 1. 73 m 2). At the end of the study,there were significant differences in Total clearance per week expressed as Dialysate clearance + Residual creatinine clearance (TCcr=DCcr + RCcr), P< 0. 01 and Total Kt/Vurea/week,P< 0. 01. Serum albumin increased significantly (from 29. 5 Â± 2, 5 to 35. 4 Â± 3. 4 g/L, P< 0. 01) in Group I comparing to Group II (30. 4 Â± 3. 4 to 31. 8 Â± 3. 5 g/L, P =ÅS). Also urine output was sigificantly higher in Group I (1226 Â± 449 mL/day) than in Group II (678 Â± 327 mL/day, P< 0. 01), respectively). Fat in muscle measured by MR spectroscopy (MRS, m. tibialis anterior) significantly decreased in Group I and was linked to reduced volume of visceral fat measured by MRI (p< 0. 02). In conclusion, comparing to control Group II, long-term administration of modified LPD+KA was associated in Group I with better metabolic status and residual renal function.

40|$|Abstract. Serum immune complexes, plasma dextran {{antibodies}} {{and percentage}} conversion of complement have been measured in 20 <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients</b> {{before and after}} an intravenous infusion of iron dextran providing 600 mg elemental iron. Complement conversion was unmeasurable {{and there were no}} changes in circulating immune complexes. The presence of dextran antibodies in nine patients before the infusion was not related to prior exposure to iron dextran. They became undetec-table in these patients within hours after the infusion, reappearing 1 month later in three. Two of three patients reporting mild aches and shivers on the day following the infusion had no detectable dextran anti-bodies. An adverse reaction involving inflamed joints occurred 1 - 2 days after a second infusion given to one of the patients studied above. The parameters under study were again measured and did not appear to relate to the reaction. The presence of dextran antibodies does not preclude the giving of iron dextran to patients on dialysis, and the immune complex and complement systems remain undisturbed by iron dextran infusions...|$|R

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of ornidazole (Tiberal) was studied after {{intravenous administration}} {{of a single}} 500 mg dose in eight patients with advanced chronic renal failure (ACRF) (creatinine clearance 2 - 16 ml/min), in seven patients treated by haemodialysis (residual renal creatinine clearance 0 - 5 ml/min) and in five patients treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (residual renal creatinine clearance 0 - 6 ml/min). In ACRF patients, the half-life of ornidazole was 10. 8 +/- 1. 4 h, the total plasma clearance 46. 3 +/- 2. 3 ml/min and the volume of distribution 0. 73 +/- 0. 06 l/kg. During haemodialysis, ornidazole was partly removed: the dialyser extraction ratio was 42 +/- 5 % and the dialysis clearance 64 +/- 7 ml/min. During CAPD, peritoneal excretion was low: the dialysis clearance was 3. 0 +/- 0. 4 ml/min and in 48 h 6. 0 +/- 1. 1 % of the administered dose {{was found in the}} peritoneal fluids. In these patients, the half-life of ornidazole was 11. 8 +/- 0. 8 h and total plasma clearance was 48. 3 +/- 5. 5 ml/min, values which were close to those determined in non <b>dialysed</b> <b>patients.</b> In patients with end-stage renal disease, the half-life of ornidazole is comparable to that of subjects with normal renal function. This is due to the predominantly extra-renal elimination of the drug. Therefore, {{there is no need to}} modify the usual dosage of ornidazole for these patients. Because of the large elimination of the drug during haemodialysis it is necessary to administer the drug after the dialysis session...|$|R
