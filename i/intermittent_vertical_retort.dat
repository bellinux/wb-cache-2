5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from calamine in a <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> style smelter.

50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste heat boiler on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal Retort House.|$|R
50|$|This {{process was}} {{licensed}} to the Imperial Smelting Corporation (ISC), based in Avonmouth, England, {{which had a}} large <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> (VR) plant in production for many years. It was used until the mid-1970s when it was superseded by the company's Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) plant. The VR plant was demolished in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Arthur Duckham {{became a}} trainee gas engineer, while also taking evening classes at King's College, London, and was {{appointed}} assistant superintendent of a London gasworks. Along with Harold Woodall he formed a company Woodall-Duckham which developed the continuous <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> for manufacturing gas from coal. He married Maud Peppercorn, daughter of Arthur Douglas Peppercorn {{and they had}} three children.|$|R
50|$|Moore's {{successor}} as Engineer and Manager, WH Shedden, {{designed the}} next revamp, brought on stream in June 1930. (Shedden was still {{employed by the}} Company in the 1950s). Work included a new Glover-West <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> house, the contractor being West's Gas Improvement Co. Ltd. of George Street, Sydney. There was again an improvement in efficiency, of about 13%.|$|R
50|$|Later retort systems (many {{types of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>retorts,</b> {{especially}} ones in continuous operation) which had other anti-oxygen safeguards, such as check valves, etc., {{as well as}} larger retorts, often omitted the hydraulic main entirely and {{went straight to the}} condensers - as other apparatus and buildings could be used for tar extraction, the main was unnecessary for these systems.|$|R
50|$|He married Anne Whiteman in 1865. They {{had five}} daughters and five sons. Four {{of his sons}} also worked in the gas industry: Henry joined the gas {{engineering}} consultancy practice and was also {{a director of the}} Gas Light and Coke Company; Harold worked with Arthur Duckham to develop continuous <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> for manufacturing gas from coal, and they founded Woodall-Duckham.|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were (a) to assess the ability of the rating of {{perceived}} exertion (RPE) to predict performance (i. e. number of vertical jumps performed to a fixed jump height) of an <b>intermittent</b> <b>vertical</b> jump exercise, and (b) to determine the ability of RPE to describe the physiological demand of such exercise. Eight healthy men performed <b>intermittent</b> <b>vertical</b> jumps with rest periods of 4, 5, and 6 s until fatigue. Heart rate and RPE were recorded every five jumps throughout the sessions. The number of vertical jumps performed was also recorded. Random coefficient growth curve analysis identified relationships between the number of vertical jumps and both RPE and heart rate for which there were similar slopes. In addition, there were no differences between individual slopes and the mean slope for either RPE or heart rate. Moreover, RPE and number of jumps were highly correlated throughout all sessions (r= 0. 97 - 0. 99; P 0. 001), as were RPE and heart rate (r= 0. 93 - 0. 97; P 0. 001). The findings suggest that RPE can both predict the performance of <b>intermittent</b> <b>vertical</b> jump exercise and describe the physiological demands of such exercise...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{concentration}} of 3 : 4 -benzpyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {{have been made in}} gas works retort houses of several types. The tarry fumes which escaped from retorts contained extremely high concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons, but in general men were only exposed to these very briefly. The mean concentration of 3 : 4 -benzpyrene determined from long-period samples at sites representative of normal working conditions in three works was 3 μg. /m. 3, over 100 times the normal level in the City of London. Above the retorts in an old horizontal retort house {{the concentration}} was over 200 μg. /m. 3, about 10, 000 times that in the City, and the `top-man' working there could be exposed to this in the normal course of his duty. We found no working areas in the <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> houses where men could be exposed to such massive concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons. Apart from defining these special conditions above horizontal retorts our results did not reveal any gross differences in pollution of the general air in horizontal and continuous <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> houses...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> {{was built}} in the 1930s, the Horizontal Retorts were removed along with chimney and {{replaced}} with a boiler and a large tar plant in the mid portion of the building with associated 3 oil tanks outside on the southern face. The brick and masonry portion of the eastern wing was re-fitted with 3 exhausters and the steel and galvanized iron portion upgraded to contain 4 more purifiers adding to a total of 8.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{combustion}} retort {{process is}} classified as an internal combustion technology. For the oil shale pyrolysis it uses a <b>vertical</b> vessel <b>retort.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today the {{building}} is falling into disrepair despite minor restoration work being carried out {{a few years earlier}} and most of the sandstone is heavily eroded. The north face of {{the building}} is only partially original. The last restoration attempts from the 1980s saw the purifiers removed and converted to conference rooms; closing the originally open air structure with galvanized iron and plate glass bearing the new Gasworks emblem, based on the ventilation hole patterns in the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort's</b> walls.|$|R
50|$|Since it was {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} LPG in 1977, the <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> was left to fall into ruin with large piles of droppings cover the floor and machinery due to the pigeons that used the building as a roost because of the many openings in its brickwork. In late July 2012, most of the building underwent cleaning to remove the accumulated waste from the interior before scrapping and internal demolition stripped the building of its heritage value {{to make way for}} a building proposal.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the coal}} was {{transported to the}} top level where it was {{deposited}} in a long hopper at the top level of the building (which also contains the conveyor drive and water tank). From the hopper, the coal was fed via a single chute into the <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> block which was then divided into 8 separate retorts, where it was heated by furnaces (and later an additional steel furnace in the back room) located {{on the first floor}} (ground level). The extracted gas was collected in two parallel [...] "Collector Mains" [...] running {{along the top of the}} retort block. Accumulated tar and liquor was drained from the collector mains into a small liquor separating tank on the 3rd floor on the western side of the building. The collected gas was forced through the retort governor (recently removed for scrap) and into the foul main that runs down the back of the retort house where it was purified elsewhere on the site. Like the Horizontal <b>Retorts,</b> the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> was run on Newcastle Coal imported from New South Wales. In the 1950s, modifications were made to the gasworks to allow the site to use Fingal Coal from the Fingal Valley in north east Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{engineer}} {{of the site}} {{used to live in}} an ornate cottage on the NE corner of the site. The first engineer was William Falconer from Scotland and many more followed. An unusual feature associated with the cottage was the {{chief engineer}}'s private, heated swimming pool. It is said to still be there, buried under the courtyard between the cottage and the gas laboratories. The pool was heated by the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> Building's boilers and was strictly out of bounds to all workers unless they were needed to fix it. The cottage is now restoredand serves as a private residence.|$|R
50|$|Located {{between the}} Chief Engineers Cottage and the <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort,</b> the Laboratory was an {{essential}} part of the site. Every day, samples of gas were tested in this building for quality. The laboratory was no safe place, before switching to Butane for town gas in 1978, the coal gas process produced many hazardous by-product gasses such as Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide which were always a potential hazard.This building was also fitted with a drafting table where the Lab Assistant drew up site plans when they were needed. All the distribution maps for Launceston's gas mains were produced here.|$|R
50|$|The 29m high (not {{including}} stack height) <b>Vertical</b> <b>Retort</b> Building {{was built}} in 1932 as the primary gas production facility for the Launceston Gasworks site. The building was officially opened on 19 March 1932 and was described by the company director as a masterpiece of modern chemistry and engineering. During the opening ceremony, the buildings moving components were switched on and visitors {{were taken to the}} top of the retorts to view what was the most advanced gasworks of its time. During later operation, the building was described as a harsh place to work in due to blazing heat, noise and gas fumes.|$|R
50|$|The new Glover-West <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> {{carbonising}} plant, with {{a capacity}} of 4,000,000 cu. ft. per day, was eventually opened in 1954. In view of delays in supply of specialised plant from post-war England, a Humphreys-Glasgow carburetted water-gas plant was installed as an emergency measure by MR Hornibrook Pty Ltd, prior to the winter of 1953. While less efficient than the carbonisation process, this process, one of several known as gasification, used coke as its feedstock and was more easily automated. It is probable that the Bryan-Donkin diaphragm-operated governors, housed immediately {{to the north of}} and in series with the original governor, were installed as part of the 1954 revamp.|$|R
40|$|Wind data {{collected}} at four levels on a 90 -m tower in a prospective wind farm area {{are used to}} evaluate how well the 10 -m wind speed data with and without <b>intermittent</b> <b>vertical</b> profile measurements compare with the 90 -m tower data. If a standard, or even predictable, wind speed profile existed, {{there would be no}} need for a large, expensive tower. This cost differential becomes even more significant if several towers are needed to study a prospective wind farm...|$|R
50|$|The Union {{process was}} an above ground shale oil {{extraction}} technology for production of shale oil, {{a type of}} synthetic crude oil. The process used a <b>vertical</b> <b>retort</b> where heating causes decomposition of oil shale into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue. The particularity {{of this process is}} that oil shale in the retort moves from the bottom upward to the top, countercurrent to the descending hot gases, by a mechanism known as a rock pump. The process technology was invented by the American oil company Unocal Corporation in late 1940s and was developed through several decades. The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort.|$|R
50|$|Initially, retort benches were of many {{different}} configurations {{due to the lack}} of long use and scientific and practical understanding of the carbonization of coal. Some early retorts were little more than iron vessels filled with coal and thrust upon a coal fire with pipes attached to their top ends. Though practical for the earliest gas works, this quickly changed once the early gas-works served more than a few customers. As the size of such vessels grew - the need became apparent for efficiency in refilling retorts - and it was apparent that filling one-ended <b>vertical</b> <b>retorts</b> was easy; removing the coke and residues from them after the carbonization of coal was far more difficult. Hence, gas <b>retorts</b> transitioned from <b>vertical</b> vessels to horizontal tubular vessels.|$|R
