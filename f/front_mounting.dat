25|$|The Brusilov {{offensive}} {{began on}} June 4, 1916, {{it was the}} greatest Russian feat of arms during World War I, and among the most lethal battles in world history. It was a major offensive against the armies of the Central Powers on the Eastern <b>Front.</b> <b>Mounting</b> pressure from the western Allies caused the Russians to hurry their preparations. Brusilov amassed four armies totalling 40 infantry divisions and 15 cavalry divisions. He faced 39 Austrian infantry divisions and 10 cavalry divisions formed in a row of three defensive lines, although later German reinforcements were brought up.|$|E

The vehicle has mounting points for three 7.62 mm machine guns (either the PKT, the SGMB or the PKB tank/medium/general-purpose machine guns), {{one on the}} front and one on each side between the two small doors; however, only one mount is fitted, and that is usually on the <b>front</b> <b>mounting</b> point. The vehicle carries 2,000 machine gun rounds. It was also known under the designation GAZ-49.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Figure  8 and Table  7 that the front part of the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> frame has a maximum deformation of 0.82  mm, mainly {{because there are no}} rubber blocks. The stress in the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> is mainly distributed in the six bolt holes and two sides of the vertical part of the metal frame, and the bolt hole of the horizontal part has a maximum stress of 82.017  MPa. Compared with the left and right <b>mounts,</b> the <b>front</b> <b>mount</b> has larger deformation and stress, and is more easily damaged during use, and hence, it is necessary to improve the reliability of the <b>front</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R

50|$|Late in {{that month}} it {{moved to the}} Moscow Military District and was {{assigned}} to the 2nd Reserve Army in the STAVKA reserves. By July the division was in 3rd Reserve Army when it was re-designated the 60th Army for front-line service. On July 19 that Army went into Voronezh Front, and on that same date, Col. K.S. Fedorovsky was promoted from chief of staff to divisional command. Later promoted to major general, he remained in command until Dec. 21, 1944, when he was mortally wounded in Hungary; he died a week later. The 303rd spent the remainder of 1942 in that Army in that <b>Front,</b> <b>mounting</b> an aggressive defense against what the STAVKA anticipated to be a German drive to the northeast towards Moscow. In early 1943 it was moved to 40th Army, and then for a month in Voronezh Front reserves for rebuilding.|$|E
5000|$|As late as 30 July 1914 the Erfurt Social Democrats were calling, at {{a meeting}} with banners, for [...] "War against the war". [...] Two days later, as the Imperial Russian Army mobilised in support of Serbia, on 1 August 1914 the German empire {{declared}} war in the Russian empire. On 4 August 1914 a meeting tool place in Berlin of the (since 1912) 110 SPD Reichstag members {{to decide on the}} parliamentary party's position over the war. Paul Reißhaus {{was one of those who}} believed that, war having been declared, the party should support parliamentary votes to provide [...] "war credits" [...] to finance the fighting. [...] Slightly more than three months later, on 12 November 1914, a meeting of party members in Erfurt, acting under the influence of Reißhaus, backed the party's so-called [...] "Burgfriedenspolitik", which amounted to a comprehensive parliamentary truce for the duration of the war. [...] The decision was resisted by left-wing party members from the outset and would lead, in 1917, to a split of the SPD itself. Despite his initial public support for the leadership line, Reißhaus, like many on the political left, continued to be badly conflicted over political support for the war. On 21 December 1915, with slaughter on the frontline and acute deprivation on the home <b>front</b> <b>mounting,</b> he signed a declaration opposing the fifth vote for war credits and absented himself from the chamber before the actual vote was held.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Figure  11 that the root-mean-square values of the vibration acceleration {{before and after the}} optimization are 4.84 g and 0.82 g, respectively, indicating a reduction of 83 % and hence, the vibration is evidently attenuated. This is because we optimize both the rubber and metal frame of the <b>front</b> <b>mount,</b> which changes the ratio of stiffness of the metal frame to that of the rubber. The figure of frequency domain also shows that the vibration optimal decoupling and topology optimization can evidently attenuate the vibration of the <b>front</b> <b>mount,</b> especially in the frequency band of 1250  Hz.|$|R
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>mounted</b> {{longitudinal}} engines with {{rear-wheel drive}} (FR) {{is a common}} layout of luxury cars. European marques like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Jaguar have almost never adopted <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> engines with front-wheel drive (FF) and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars. Japanese brands such as Lexus and Infiniti also have predominantly FR lineups. The FR layout, while {{more expensive than the}} FF, has been retained by these luxury manufacturers as it allows for higher performance engines (particularly the straight-6, V8, and other engine configurations with more cylinders), better handling, and a smoother ride.|$|R

40|$|Pigeon pea or tur (Cajanus cajan L. Mills.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} pulse crops of India and ranks second to chickpea in area and production. Traditionally the harvesting of pigeon pea is done manually by sickle, which demands considerable amount of labour, drudgery, time and cost to harvest, which reflects on total production cost of the crop. In view of this a tractor operated <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> pigeon pea stem cutter was developed and being <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> implement it facilitated better visibility and control to operator. The power was transmitted from pto to gear box. Arrangement of hydraulic cylinder and hydraulic motor was provided on the equipment to facilitate the height of cut and to rotate the conveyer belt. During comparative performance evaluation of developed equipment, the average cutting efficiency and field capacity was found 96. 30 % and 0. 176 ha/hr respectively. There was increase in fuel consumption and plant damage with increase in speed of operation. The average operation cost of newly developed tractor operated <b>front</b> <b>mounted</b> pigeon pea stem cutter was 64. 71 % less as compared with manual harvesting of pigeon pea crop. The time saved was almost 1 / 3 rd to that of manual harvesting...|$|R
