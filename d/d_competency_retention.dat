In light of a low participation rate in the Canadian AET system by undereducated adults, the rationale was to examine whether or not AET programmes are meeting the needs of undereducated adults beyond a narrow focus on an instrumental approach associated with human capital development. This study was located in a theoretical framework consisting of (a) learning theory, (b) motivations for participation, (c) general barriers to participation, (d) structural barriers to participation, and (e) transformative learning. The purposive sample consisted of 11 participants between the ages of 18 - 58 who were drawn from service providers in 4 geographic regions of Ontario.

30|$|Table  2 {{demonstrates}} that SCS retention over 8  months was variable for different <b>competencies.</b> This <b>retention</b> of confidence {{is likely to}} be related to the trainees’ actual surgical experiences over the 8 -month interim. For example, trainees were almost as confident at the start of day 2 as the end of day 1 for procedures that were simple and likely to be a common part of supervised clinical training, such as sterilisation and opening and closing the abdomen. The greatest reduction in SCS between the two training days was for hysterectomy. This {{is likely to be}} because hysterectomy is more complex to undertake and trainees have less opportunities for supervised clinical training. Table  3 shows that despite some loss of confidence for some of the surgical competencies, trainees were universally more confident at the start of day 2 than day 1. This would suggest that the intervention of cadaveric simulation combined with supervised clinical training is an effective approach to teaching surgical procedures. Simulation training is an important adjunct rather than an alternative to clinical experience [24] but is likely to be of greatest value when simulation is timed to clinical exposure.|$|R

40|$|Conference Theme: Challenging BoundariesReading {{and writing}} are both related to text as reading {{is the process}} of {{deconstructing}} text and writing {{is the process of}} constructing text, therefore genre pedagogy can work as a bridge to connect the teaching of reading and writing. Considerable works have been done to study genre theory and prove its effects especially in the field of teaching in English (Christie et al. 1990 a；Christie et al. 1990 b; Christie et al. 1992; Christie and Martin 1997; Feez and Joyce 1998; Martin and Rothery 1981; Martin and Rothery 1982). Some researchers (Hyland 2007 : 153, Hyon 1996, Johns 2002) pointed out that Reading to Learn methodology has been {{recognized as one of the}} most effective and well‐designed genre study from theoretical and pedagogical aspects. It’s developed based on the theories of SFL (Halliday 1994), pedagogical discourse (Bernstein 1996, 2000), and scaffolding (Vygotsky 1962). The Reading to Learn methodology has been proved that it can improve English learners’ reading and writ <b>ing</b> <b>competency</b> at an average double to four times standard growth rates (Culican 2006, McCrae et al 2000, Rose, Farrington & Page 2008), and also to reduce the learning gap between high achievers and low achievers (Rose, D. & Martin, Jim R. 2012). But relevant research in teaching of Chinese was less common until Shum (2010) applied the concept of genre pedagogy in Chinese language education. For further development of SFL‐based genre pedagogy in different language, there’s a strong need to investigate the effect and feasibility of applying Reading to Learn in teaching languages other than English. Other than that, past research about Reading to Learn mainly focused on students’ writing outcome. As reading not only works as the model text of writing, but also serves the purpose to create meaning and deliver different information, the reading comprehension performance of students should also be concerned. Therefore this paper aims to study the effect of Reading to Learn methodology in CSL (Chinese as second language) education, while reading and writing assessment will both be conducted in pre‐test and post‐test to observe whether Reading of Learn can improve CSL learners’ reading and writing performance of Chinese practical essay. The research methodology of case study will be applied on a group of non‐Chinese speaking students (immigrants from foreign countries and studying in Hong Kong currently) attending Chinese class in Hong Kong, to answer the research question of this study: What are the effects of Reading to Learn pedagogy towards non‐Chinese speaking students’ reading and writing performance of Chinese practical texts? 20 non‐Chinese speaking students in secondary school grade 1 will be observed within the duration of 3 months. The triangulation of data will combine quantitative data (results of pre‐test and post‐test) and qualitative data (interview, text analysis of students’ reading and writing output) to prove the validity and reliability of data collected. The potential outcome is Reading to Learn pedagogy will be effective in improving CSL learners’ literacy performance, similar to previous studies in English language education. But it requires further research to examine its potential development and modified needed to be adopted in Chinese language education. The research outcome will be discussed in-depth after completion of data collection and analysis in May 2015...|$|R

From a large multiethnic sample (n = 784) of children below the median on literacy at school entrance, 124 retained children were matched with 251 promoted children {{on the basis of}} propensity scores (probability of being retained in first grade estimated from 72 baseline variables). Relative to promoted children, retained children were found to benefit from retention in both the short and longer terms with respect to decreased teacher-rated hyperactivity, decreased peer-rated sadness and withdrawal, and increased teacher-rated behavioral engagement. Retained children had a short-term increase in mean peer-rated liking and school belongingness relative to promoted children, but this advantage showed a substantial decrease in the longer term. Retention had a positive short-term effect on children’s perceived school belonging and a positive longer term effect on perceived academic self-efficacy. Retention may bestow advantages in the short-term, but longer term detrimental effects on social acceptance may lead to the documented longer term negative effects of retention.

During the transition, new graduate nurses compare {{the way they}} have conceptualized nursing to what they actually experience in practice. If the observed reality is not congruent with their ideal perception, role conflict and a compromised socialization may occur. Residency programs have been instituted at some healthcare facilities to promote a positive organizational socialization process. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the differences in role conception of new graduates. The relationship of role conception and various anticipatory socialization variables such as age, gender, type of education and previous healthcare experience are examined. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of an existing national database of new graduate nurses who completed a residency program during the years 2011 - 2013.

These two theorists, among others, addressed child development and concepts of learning, imagination and creativity. In this context we designed an action research type study which consisted in the application of a program entitled “Whilst playing with light I created a story” during six workshops. This program was applied to heterogeneous groups of children and youth in formal learning environments (one group from a private school) and in non-formal learning environments (three groups from a social solidarity institution), making up a total of 53 participants. Generally speaking the methodologies sought to deconstruct the use of materials and conventional art techniques as well as to promote a creative and investigative approach in the construction of visual products based on light projections. The program revealed diverse benefits which we choose to highlight as follows: a) the creation of visual products which the participants identified as artistic; b) the creation of building strategies on an individual and collective level; c) the development of capacity for dialog and sharing; <b>d)</b> increased <b>competency</b> in reading and image interpretation; e) the development of aesthetic and artistic expressive qualities, and f) increased capacity to resolve problems creatively. This same method also proved to be adequately versatile and adaptable since it was possible to apply it successfully to heterogeneous groups in both formal and informal contexts.

40|$|The <b>competency</b> <b>retention</b> rate of Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) among nurses was poor. The {{knowledge}} {{retention rate}} {{among those who}} have completed an ACLS course rapidly declined to 37 % at three months, and 14 % at one year. Extending the course duration did not show any improvement in the retention rate. Structured debriefing may be a possible solution, but its efficacy on knowledge retention among nurses has not been examined. The aims of this thesis are to perform linguistic and psychometric evaluation of a Chinese version of Student Satisfaction and Self-confidence (SSSC), and to assess the effects in knowledge retention of nurses in a simulation-based resuscitation training, using the Gather-Analysis- Summary (GAS) model of structured debriefing. In this thesis, the reliability and scale structure of the Chinese SSSC were assessed in 161 nurses when they attended an ACLS course. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that a two-factor structure had satisfactory with χ^ 2 = 92. 12 (df = 54), RMSEA =. 07 (90 % CI =. 04 to. 09), CFI =. 98 and NNFI = 0. 96. The two factors are the satisfaction and self-confidence which had high internal reliability with Cronbach's alpha as. 95 and. 97, respectively. The Chinese SSSC is a reliable and valid tool to assess student satisfaction and self-confidence in simulation training. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to assess the efficacy of the GAS model. The primary outcome in this study was knowledge competency. It was assessed by the written test of the American Heart Association ACLS provider course. The secondary outcomes in this study were perceived skills, and self-efficacy. They were assessed using our validated Chinese SSSC and the General Self-Efficacy scale. In the intervention arm, the instructor conducted 18 scenarios and structured debriefing using the GAS model. Each GAS model of debriefing session consisted of three phases, namely: "Gather", "Analysis", and "Summary". The debriefing session was conducted to help participants to self-reflect on the learning objectives. Each debriefing session lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. In the control arm, participants had 36 scenario as usual teaching plan instead of debriefing {{at the end of each}} scenario. A follow-up assessment were conducted at Day Two and Week 24. A total of 161 nurses were recruited in this study. They were divided into 32 groups and randomized by groups to either the intervention arm (n= 85, 15 groups) or the control arm (n= 76, 17 groups). The effects of the GAS model were examined using a linear mixed effects model to take account of the extra-covariance among participants in the same group. The test showed that the GAS model debriefing improved knowledge retention after Day Two follow-up. However, it was marginally significant (estimated coefficient= 2. 56, 95 % CI=. 17 to 4. 95, d=. 22, p=. 036). Perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 01, 95 % CI= -. 24 to. 27, d=. 15, p=. 918), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 01 95 % CI= - 1. 27 to 1. 24, d=. 06, p=. 984) were also not significant. After adjusting the baseline by adding three significant different baseline factor, namely: education level, rank, and prior ACLS certification, the knowledge (estimated coefficient= 1. 54, 95 % CI=- 1. 06 to 4. 16, d=. 22, p=. 242). Perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 01, 95 % CI= -. 26 to. 28, d=. 15, p=. 967), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 31, 95 % CI=- 1. 64 to 1. 02, d=. 06, p=. 648) were insignificant. There were 73 nurses (45. 3 %) dropped out before 24 weeks. Overall, only 22 out of the remaining 88 (25 %) nurses passed the follow-up written test. Although debriefing based on the GAS model showed a sizable effect on knowledge retention at Week 24. the improvement was not significant (estimated coefficient= 5. 01, 95 % CI= - 1. 02 to 11. 04, d=. 17, p=. 101). The effects of debriefing on perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 09, 95 % CI= -. 89 to 2. 7, d=. 22, p=. 317), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient=. 51, 95 % CI= - 2. 19 to 3. 2, d=. 12, p=. 707) were also not significant. After the baseline adjustment, the debriefing effects on knowledge (estimated coefficient= 2. 15, 95 % CI= - 4. 26 to 8. 56, d=. 17, p=. 503), perceived skills (estimated coefficient=. 92, 95 % CI= -. 98 to 2. 82, d=. 22, p=. 336), and self-efficacy (estimated coefficient= -. 11, 95 % CI= - 3. 02 to 2. 79, d=. 12, p=. 938) remained insignificant. This is the first RCT to assess the effect of structured debriefing in ACLS simulation.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the extent of specialized training and competence in family-based death and grief-related counseling among family counselors, and identify variables that predict counselor competence. A comprehensive measure of specialized competence was created. Variables measured and investigated in relation to competence included demographic information, personal death and grief-related experience, professional death and grief-related training and experience. and personal death competency. All survey items and instruments were implemented into an on-line survey. A sample of 147 family counselors participated in this study. Descriptive results indicated that the majority of participants reported moderate to high levels of perceived family death and grief-related counseling competence and personal death competency. However, the majority of participants rated their specialized death and grief-related training within their counselor preparation program as less than adequate. Factor analysis revealed four factors of family-death and grief-related counseling knowledge and skills-based competence: (1) advanced family grief counseling skills, (2) basic grief counseling skills, (3) developmental aspects of grief counseling, and (4) the ability to utilize resources in grief counseling. Additionally, factor analysis supported the previously hypothesized two subscales of Bugen's (1980 - 1981) Coping with Death Scale. which measured personal death competency, with some modifications. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated the following significant results consistent with hypotheses: (a) personal death and grief-related loss positively impacted family death and grief-related counseling personal competencies. (b) professional death and grief-related training and experience positively impacted family death and grief related counseling knowledge and skills-based competencies, (c) perceived adequacy of death and grief-related training positively impacted personal death <b>competency,</b> (<b>d)</b> family death and grief-related personal competencies positively impacted personal death competency, and (e) personal death competency positively impacted family death and grief-related counseling knowledge and skills. Study results suggest that family counselors who have participated in adequate specialized death and grief-related training experiences are more likely to cope well with personal issues related to death and dying, and have stronger knowledge and skills in counseling grieving families. Implications for further counseling research, training, and practice to continually improve counseling services offered to grieving clients are provided...|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} aimed {{to gain a}} {{holistic}} understanding of career guidance as implemented in a university in Guangdong province. The purpose of the research was to investigate (a) the identifiable content and approaches used in career guidance, (b) contextual factors {{inside and outside the}} university that influence career guidance, (c) how the people involved perceive the effect of career guidance on enhancing students' career <b>competencies,</b> (<b>d)</b> problems in delivering and receiving career guidance, and (e) how career guidance can be strengthened and improved. Qualitative data were collected between 2010 and 2012, using multiple methods including individual interviews, focus groups, observations, and documentary study. A total of 13 individual interviews and 5 focus group sessions were completed. The researcher collected information related to perceptions of university students, graduates, administrators, career practitioners, student tutors and teachers involved in the career guidance service. Evidence was also obtained from curriculum designs, reports, surveys, web pages, and documents produced by the school, faculties and student association. The researcher also conducted 17 participant and non-participant observations during relevant career activities. The data analysis involved coding, categorization, concept mapping, and theme generation. The themes that emerged were triangulated using data from the various sources. The findings reveal that a system has been built to provide career guidance through three separate channels. The Career Center is formally in charge of all career affairs; but currently ‘employment management’ is its main duty. Various career activities (conducted by students) are provided by the Students' Career Development Association (SCDA), which is supported by the Career Center. Also, in each faculty, career guidance related to specific majors is implemented. Contextual factors that influence career guidance can be summarized under four aspects: national policies and university support; management systems; political tradition of a centralization system; and various resources. The findings suggest that career guidance does enhance students’ career competencies, particularly in areas of self-understanding, career-related knowledge and skills, and in career-relevant networking. A variety of problems have existed in the university in relation to career guidance, including the lack of a comprehensive service, insufficient resources, a lack of credibility, uneven quality of career guidance, and a lack of professional training for the personnel involved. Many suggestions have been put forward by students and teachers for strategies to improve career guidance. In particular, it is believed that the Career Center, the faculties, and SCDA have to increase their coordination and cooperation at all levels, by a better integration of resources. The data analyzed in this study provide a unique picture of the implementation and content of career guidance with Chinese characteristics. In addition, factors influencing career guidance and its service delivery are identified and discussed within a Chinese context, taking socio-political factors into account. While the results provide evidence for an operational model of career guidance in a university, they also expand current theories of career guidance in China as a whole. Implications for practical solution of problems and for improvement of existing services are discussed in detail. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Competent {{people are}} the key to future success and offer organisations their only {{sustainable}} competitive advantage. Therefore, to obtain and develop an effective and competent workforce for superior performance has become a basic necessity for organisations worldwide in order to sustain and retain an edge in the competitive milieu. In recent years executives have become more concerned about personal effectiveness, since career progress is rightfully tied to ability. How well managers are able to accomplish the objectives, for which they are accountable, {{the degree to which they}} do so in a cost-effective manner, how their practices affect the willingness and ability of those they manage are related to their effectiveness. It is the responsibility of the lower and middle level executives to identify the core competencies of the enterprise and to ensure that the competencies required by the workforce are adequate and appropriate. There has been insufficient research reported in the literature on competency mapping requirements of lower and middle level executives. Therefore, this study explores the competencies critical to the success of these executives. The core focus of this study was to carry out an empirical investigation on competency-based executive performance assessment processes in manufacturing units and the relationship between identified competencies towards organisational effectiveness. The basic objectives for conducting this research was; a) to identify competency levels of executives required for threshold and superior performance in an organisational setup, b) to recognise competencies and capabilities of the executives through competency modelling so as to help identifying and placing the right person in the right job, c) to conduct a competency based executive performance survey through questionnaire/ structured schedule using coded <b>competencies,</b> <b>d)</b> to collect empirical data from the industries to illustrate the impact of competency-based executive performance assessment model on organisational performance standard, and e) to find out the impact of developmental inventions as a moderator on the relationship between executive competencies and individual performance. For the purpose of this research, three manufacturing units were chosen, i. e., Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP), National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO) and Tata Steel Ferro Alloys Limited (TS Alloys Ltd.) to draw a clear picture of the impact of competency-based performance management system on the performance of individual executives and the organisation as a whole. A self-designed, pre-tested questionnaire was used for the purpose of the study. A hundred and twenty four items were included in the questionnaire, in view to the extensive combing of existing literature on executive competencies. A total of five hundred and sixteen useful responses was utilised for the study after examining the validity and reliability of the scales to make it statistically adequate. The responses obtained were subjected to analysis using the SPSS 22 and AMOS 22. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted, utilising a principal axis factoring extraction method with a varimax rotated solution, to ensure that the identified variables are suitable for testing the hypothesised model of this study adequately. The identified factor was further used for structural equation modelling; to get an overall fit for the model and to valid the hypotheses formulated. The findings of the study indicate that most of the executive competencies have significant influence on performance. The developmental intervention as a moderator was found to enhance the positive relationship between executive competencies and executive performance. Finally, at the conclusion of this study, practical implications and suggestions were provided for the executives of the manufacturing sector for the improvement of their performance within an organisational set up...|$|R

The office of education program, {{one of the first}} fields included in the process, is at its initial stage of development in Vietnam. A reference guide for a realistic teaching technique is needed to help develop a different approach for the program. Statement of the Problem: The problem studied was to prepare a set of guidelines for using office simulation to teach office practice in the Vietnamese comprehensive high schools. Purposes of the Study: The main purposes of this study were to: (1) introduce a different and realistic approach in the teaching and learning situation for the office practice course in Vietnam; and (2) Provide a general reference guide for an office simulation approach in teaching office practice in Vietnamese public high schools. Methods and Procedures: Research studies and reports, as well as professional writings pertaining to simulation approach in office education and other fields, were reviewed, analyzed and synthesized. The period covered was from 1962 to 1971. The preliminary review revealed the six major areas that were necessary in building guidelines for the Vietnamese business educators and School administrators who have not used the simulation technique. The later selection of data was made based on these six identified areas: The objectives of the office practice course. The simulation technique and its contribution to the office practice course. The criteria for designing an educational simulation model. The organization of the simulated environment. The operation of office simulation. The teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role in the simulation program. Telephone interviews were made with the former business education advisor in Thu Due Demonstration High School to acquire a general outlook into the present status of the office practice course in Vietnam. Findings: The findings of this study were presented as a set of general guidelines. These guide lines were based on the theoretical and practical principles and opinions on instructional simulation, in office education and other fields, as experimented researched and expressed in the United States. They were organized into four areas: Design guidelines included the following steps: a. Establishment of objectives b. System analysis c. Data collection d. Establishment of model framework e.
