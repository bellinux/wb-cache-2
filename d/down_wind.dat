5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off <b>down</b> <b>wind</b> and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E

25|$|Low level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an {{atmospheric}} pollutant. It is not emitted {{directly by}} car engines or by industrial operations, but {{formed by the}} reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at {{the source of the}} pollution or many kilometers <b>down</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} monsoon, wind {{patterns}} undergo large scale changes. In May {{there is very}} little large scale wind current through the mountains, most circulates around the mountains, although onshore flow is present. As the high pressure moves north, air is pulled off the Gulf of Mexico, bringing easterly winds aloft to the mountains. On the east slope of the mountain daytime upslope winds flow to the crest, where the flow joins westerly winds. The mountains cause convection during the following monsoon season, during which nocturnal winds at low levels in the atmosphere move moisture overnight. After the high pressure breaks <b>down,</b> <b>wind</b> patterns return to those prior to the monsoon season.|$|E
25|$|Outhauls, which {{control the}} foot tension of a boom-footed sail. This {{is one of}} the main {{controls}} for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for <b>down</b> <b>wind</b> sailing, so the main sail becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.|$|E

2500|$|Before 1673, {{the most}} common vessel on the lakes was the canoe. While smaller canoes were used on rivers and streams, lake canoes were more {{commonly}} larger vessels measuring up to about [...] long. While some of these were made from a single carved log ("dug out" [...] or [...] "pirogue"), most were bark canoes. Bateaux were also common. They were open vessels (no deck) made of wood measuring up to about [...] long and capable of carrying three or four tons of cargo. While they were at times fitted with mast and sails, their primary propulsion was either oars or poles. The sails were merely supplemental for traveling <b>down</b> <b>wind.</b> Their inefficiency at beating to windward made them impractical as sailing vessels, {{and they were not}} very safe in open water.|$|E

2500|$|Brigs {{were used}} as small {{warships}} carrying about 10 to 18 guns. Due to their speed and maneuverability they were popular among pirates (though they were rare among American and Caribbean pirates). While their use stretches back before the 17th century, {{one of the most}} famous periods for the brig was during the 19th century when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the Battle of Lake Erie. In the early 19th century the brig was a standard cargo ship. It was seen as [...] "fast and well sailing", but required a large crew to handle its rigging. While brigs could not sail into the wind as easily as fore-and-aft–rigged vessels such as schooners, a trait that is common to all square-rigged ships, a skilled brig captain could [...] "manoeuvre it with ease and elegance; a brig could for instance turn around almost on the spot". A brig's square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling offshore, in the trade winds, where vessels sailed <b>down</b> <b>wind</b> for extended distances and where [...] "the danger of a sudden jibe was the large schooner-captain's nightmare". This trait later led to the evolution of the barquentine. The need for large crews in relation to their relatively small size led to the decline of the production of brigs. They were replaced in commercial traffic by gaffsail schooners (which needed fewer personnel) and steam boats (which did not have the windward performance problems of square rigged ships).|$|E
