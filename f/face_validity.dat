25|$|There is {{flexibility}} of the focus group research in {{being used as a}} qualitative method or a combination of the former with quantitative techniques (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).The moderator is permitted to inquire into and examine unforeseen issues due to this kind of format. Has high <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> and naturalistic- as it includes storytelling, joking, disagreements, boasting and more (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library & Morgan). It is relatively inexpensive/relatively low cost (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). Provides relatively fast results (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library).Consumes lesser time unlike structured interviews in order to increase sample sizes and resource investment (n.d., HCC Education Digital Library). It is helpful and important for needs assessment and project evaluation projects (Savithiri, 2009).Regarding the facts and numbers in research, meaning behind these facts can also be found and confirmed through surveys as it is qualitative in nature(Savithiri, 2009). It is relatively simple to carry out (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It consumes less time as large sample size can be studied (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement).Information is gained from group interaction due to group dynamics (n.d., National Center for Postsecondary Improvement). It helps in obtaining and gathering contracted and incisive data of specific topic (Morgan).Many new perspectives and opinions are obtained which results in insights (Morgan). Sensitive topics can be discussed leading to personal disclosures (Silverman, 2004).Often these interactions result in creating ‘synergistic effects’ (Silverman, 2004).Vocabulary and language used can be observed (Silverman, 2004). It is much more efficient when the data being gathered is very much related to the researcher’s interests(Morgan).The moderator keeps the discussion in sync with the topic and makes sure one individual does not dominate the other; hence follows an ‘egalitarian’ method(Silverman, 2004 & n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). Non-verbal behavior as well plays a role in the moderator’s decision making and research results (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages). High possibilities in resulting in rich and in-depth information or data (n.d., Focus Groups: Issues Regarding Advantages and Disadvantages & Deem, 1997). It is useful for exploratory research (Deem, 1997). Group interaction can be observed in a controlled setting(Deem, 1997). The reactions of participants towards each other can be analyzed (n.d., Southalabama Education: Strengths and Weaknesses of Focus Groups). Previously neglected or unnoticed phenomena can be drawn towards the researcher’s attention(Silverman, 2004).Helps to inform the development of survey instruments(Silverman, 2004).Opportunistic use of focus groups results in improvised research design and impoverished data(Silverman, 2004).|$|E

40|$|The current exigencies and {{fluidity}} of {{the business}} environment engendered largely by demographic changes, technological advances and globalisation have made it imperative for organisations to posses the brightest talents {{as a source of}} competitive advantage, if they hope to survive. The continuing ‘talent war’ and fierce competition in the global market place; and issues concerning employee branding and candidate attraction, means that organisations and their managers have to carefully review their recruitment and selection processes, ensuring that employee selection methods not only contributes towards enhancing organisational image, but also predicts future job performance to a reasonable extent. There is therefore, the need for chosen methods to be high in both Predictive and <b>Face</b> <b>validities.</b> This article critically examines the importance of the concepts of Predictive and <b>Face</b> <b>validities</b> to employee selection in a wider context as an HR strategy and {{as an integral part of}} organisations’ general strategy, suggesting ways of improving both concepts. The central argument of this article, is that for selection methods to be effective, reliable, valid and minimise costs associated with loosing top talents, poor employee performance and turnover, it must possess high predictive and face value. The article assesses three major selection methods (interviews, work sampling and assessment centres) with a view of maximising their predictive and <b>face</b> <b>validities,</b> arguing that the design, contents and the manner of administrating these methods are major issues. The paper concludes that there is no one best way of selecting new employees, but a combination of carefully chosen methods and well-trained HR professionals will undoubtedly improve <b>face</b> and predictive <b>validities</b> and by extension, the selection method. </p...|$|R

The questionnaires used a 5 -point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]extremely unconfident, 3 [*]=[*]neutral, 5 [*]=[*]extremely confident). Questionnaires regarding the simulators' <b>face</b> and content <b>validity</b> were collected from participants following testing. <b>Face</b> and content <b>validity</b> questionnaires used questions similar to those described by Weidenbach et al.

50|$|<b>Face</b> <b>validity</b> is an {{estimate}} of whether a test appears to measure a certain criterion; it does not guarantee that the test actually measures phenomena in that domain. Measures may have high validity, but when the test {{does not appear to}} be measuring what it is, it has low <b>face</b> <b>validity.</b> Indeed, when a test is subject to faking (malingering), low <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> might make the test more valid. Considering one may get more honest answers with lower <b>face</b> <b>validity,</b> it is sometimes important to make it appear as though there is low <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> whilst administering the measures.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{people use}} the term <b>face</b> <b>{{validity}}</b> to refer only to the validity of a test to observers who are not expert in testing methodologies. For instance, if a test is designed to measure whether children are good spellers, and parents are asked whether the test is a good test, this measures the <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> of the test. If an expert is asked instead, some people would argue that this does not measure <b>face</b> <b>validity.</b> This distinction seems too careful for most applications. Generally, <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> means that the test [...] "looks like" [...] it will work, as opposed to [...] "has been shown to work".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Face</b> <b>validity</b> is {{the extent}} to which a test is subjectively viewed as {{covering}} the concept it purports to measure. It refers to the transparency or relevance of a test as it appears to test participants. In other words, a test can be said to have <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> if it [...] "looks like" [...] it is going to measure what it is supposed to measure. For instance, if a test is prepared to measure whether students can perform multiplication, and the people to whom it is shown all agree that it looks like a good test of multiplication ability, this demonstrates <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> of the test. <b>Face</b> <b>validity</b> is often contrasted with content validity and construct validity.|$|E

The developmental process was robust in that it was based on three types of information: assessment approaches being used in other locations; expert judgement by Departmental officers; and statistical analyses of data obtained using an initial form of the instrument. Statistical analysis was based on a final form of the instrument consisting of 11 focus areas structured into three domains - physical needs, learning needs, and social needs of students.

5000|$|Content {{validity}} {{is different}} from <b>face</b> <b>validity,</b> which refers not to what the test actually measures, but to what it superficially appears to measure. <b>Face</b> <b>validity</b> assesses whether the test [...] "looks valid" [...] to the examinees who take it, the administrative personnel who decide on its use, and other technically untrained observers. Content validity {{requires the use of}} recognized subject matter experts to evaluate whether test items assess defined content and more rigorous statistical tests than does the assessment of <b>face</b> <b>validity.</b> Content validity is most often addressed in academic and vocational testing, where test items need to reflect the knowledge actually required for a given topic area (e.g., history) or job skill (e.g., accounting).

Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is developed in response to the need for a standard and reliable tool for assessment of psychiatric disorders in preschool age. The aim {{of this study was to}} translate this tool to Farsi and evaluate the <b>face</b> and content <b>validity</b> of this precious and comprehensive tool. Methods: The process was forward translation to Farsi, evaluation for <b>face</b> and content <b>validity,</b> finalization of items within expert panel, backward translation to English, matching the original PAPA with randomly selected items from the backward translation version and revision as needed and finally evaluation for validity of the changes for localization and cultural considerations. Results: The research team translated original PAPA to Farsi. In the next step, evaluation for <b>face</b> and content <b>validity</b> was performed by expert panel, a mean of 30 - 35 items from 100 pages were revised and 7 items which were not compatible with social and cultural conditions in our country got localized. Two percent of pages from this forward translation (14 pages) were randomly selected as a sample from the whole questionnaire in order to be back translated to Farsi and expert panel were asked to evaluate.

50|$|A {{model that}} has <b>face</b> <b>validity</b> {{appears to be}} a {{reasonable}} imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system. <b>Face</b> <b>validity</b> is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies. An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases. Sensitivity to model inputs {{can also be used to}} judge <b>face</b> <b>validity.</b> For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.|$|E

Methods A 37 -item assessment tool was formed by combining 1) the enhanced Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ), 2) a checklist created by Sacks, and 3) three additional items recently judged to be of methodological importance. This tool was applied to 99 paper-based and 52 electronic systematic reviews. Exploratory factor {{analysis was used to}} identify underlying components. The results were considered by methodological experts using a nominal group technique aimed at item reduction and design of an assessment tool with <b>face</b> and content <b>validity.</b> Results The factor analysis identified 11 components. From each component, one item was selected by the nominal group. The resulting instrument was judged to have <b>face</b> and content <b>validity.</b> Conclusion A measurement tool for the 'assessment of multiple systematic reviews' (AMSTAR) was developed. The tool consists of 11 items and has good <b>face</b> and content <b>validity</b> for measuring the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Additional studies are needed with a focus on the reproducibility and construct validity of AMSTAR, before strong recommendations can be made on its use. </p...|$|R
