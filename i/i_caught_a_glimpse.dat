500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting on the step of the Vic, waiting for me mother. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of her through the door. Sitting {{on top of the}} piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E

60|$|Madame Blumenthal seemed, for the time, to have abjured the Kursaal, and <b>I</b> never <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of her. Her young friend, apparently, was an {{interesting}} study, and the studious mind prefers seclusion.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Mrs. Doncastle's new maid--if {{that was}} she <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of the other}} day--is ever so much older than you--a dozen years.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed to}} an oaken cupboard, {{and as he}} threw it open <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of glistening rows of {{parallel}} barrels, like the pipes of an organ.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{could see}} nothing, but {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of {{a bit of}} smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple and yellow of the vegetation.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Ogden as Mr Abney {{showed him}} into his study. He seemed a self-possessed boy, very like but, if anything, uglier than the {{portrait}} of him which I had seen at the Hotel Guelph.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I shall {{probably}} never see that child again, yet what a pleasant picture she leaves in my memory!" [...] I thought to myself, as <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse</b> {{of the brown}} hat going round the corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I almost require {{introducing}} to you, for <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> but <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of you as}} {{we crossed}} the river, and you look so different {{now that you have}} got rid of that hideous attire that I don't think that I should have known you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found nothing}} worth {{notice in the}} church, {{and was about to}} leave it again, when <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of a pretty view through a side door, and stopped to admire it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can I, now," [...] Ralph said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse,</b> just now, and I {{will almost}} swear to its being the sea--though {{how we could}} get there, I don't know." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the door}} closed <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of our poor companion's face. He seemed frozen with terror. His eyes stared with a horrible anguish as if dazed, and no sound came from his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is an advantage," [...] Captain Nelson laughed. [...] "When I {{think that}} you have raised your hand against that venerable but {{somewhat}} truculent prelate, I shudder at your boldness. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of him as he passed, but I could see that he looks rather scared." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{man with}} the shade became aware of my {{presence}} for the first time, and threw his head {{back for a moment}} and sideways, to see me. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> momentary <b>glimpse</b> of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he began to cough and splutter again.|$|R
60|$|That evening, at {{the crowded}} corner by the Cafe de la Paix, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{fleeting}} <b>glimpse</b> of Laploshka. He smiled, slightly raised his hat, and vanished. I {{never saw him}} again. After all, the money {{had been given to}} the deserving rich, and the soul of Laploshka was at peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were you not at {{the opera}} on Tuesday?" [...] began he, {{assuming}} at once the airs of a man of fashion. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of you in the}} Duchess of Diddlebury's box." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not mistaken? Surely Mr. Denham? <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of {{your coat}} through the window, and I felt sure that I knew your coat. Have you seen Katharine or William? I'm {{wandering}} about Lincoln {{looking for the}} ruins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good God! Captain Poke," [...] I exclaimed, {{the instant}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the {{formidable}} danger that menaced us, [...] "you surely {{do not mean}} to continue madly on, with such a warning of the consequences in plain view?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> have <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of {{the faces}} of several Moorish women (for they are only human, and will expose their faces for the admiration of a Christian dog when no male Moor is by), and I am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness.|$|R
60|$|Amid {{the stream}} of Corinthians and fighting-men who were thronging into the room <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of the sturdy figure and broad, good-humoured face of Champion Harrison. The sight of him was like a whiff of South Down air coming into that low-roofed, oil-smelling room, and I ran forward to shake him by the hand.|$|R
60|$|In {{the rapid}} {{fighting}} that followed I had little chance to note aught else than {{the movements of}} my immediate adversaries, but now and again <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> of <b>a</b> purring sword and a lightly springing figure of sinewy steel that filled my heart with a strange yearning and a mighty but unaccountable pride.|$|R
60|$|It was a clang of the bell, {{followed}} instantly {{by heavy}} steps upon the stair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade {{appeared in the}} doorway. Over his shoulder <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> {{of one or two}} uniformed policemen outside.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of his face, {{flushed and}} forced against the bookcase, {{from between the}} swaying limbs of my captors and his. To my astonishment his eyes were really {{brilliant}} with pleasure, {{like those of a}} child heated by a favourite game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Word of honor, Paul!" [...] he declared; [...] "I {{never saw}} the old rat take a thing! I simply landed him with the brooch. It was not until he was going out that <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of those other things in his pocket." ...|$|E
60|$|As he let us {{into the}} hall of his West Side apartment, <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>glimpse</b> of <b>a</b> young woman seated in the living room, busily sewing. She rose calmly, though a little surprised at our invasion, and with her rising, spools of thread and bits of cloth fell away from her with comic effect, although her expression remained loftily serene.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then I {{will come}} round to your place. I really am {{curious to see}} the girl. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> passing <b>glimpse</b> {{of her in the}} park that day." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was no need}} of commiseration, however; {{now that}} the dog {{was out of the}} way they could take care of {{themselves}} very well. I found them resting only a short distance ahead; but when I attempted to stalk them from leeward the noise of my approach on the crust sent them off with <b>a</b> rush before <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> even <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of them in their thicket.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed. The {{carriage}} drew to {{the side}} of the road. We rushed by, and <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of three faces. My spirits rose. There was only the Baron to deal with. Madame Richard and Isobel were the other occupants of the carriage.|$|E
60|$|The brushes parted. <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of a {{long brown}} body and a hairy head. Then the {{creature}} reared up, breasting itself against a log, full in front of me. Great heavens! It was not a bear at all. It was a man.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of Issus leaning far forward {{upon her}} throne, her hideous countenance {{distorted}} in a horrid grimace of hate and rage, in which I thought I could distinguish {{an expression of}} fear. It was that face that inspired me to the thing that followed.|$|E
60|$|I {{stepped into}} the 'bus and we drove off. As we turned {{out of the station}} <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> last <b>glimpse</b> of our shadower. He was {{standing}} close to the main exit with his hands behind him, looking up to the sky as though anxious to discover whether it were still raining. He looked into our 'bus as it clattered by, and my companion, who caught sight of him, leaned back in her seat.|$|R
6000|$|Again Lillian {{detected}} the secret disquiet which possessed him, and her curiosity was roused. It piqued {{her that this}} Helen felt no desire to meet her and chose to seclude herself, as if regardless of the interest and admiration she excited. [...] "I will see her {{in spite of her}} refusal, for <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> in the Park. Something is wrong, and I'll discover it, for it evidently worries Paul, and perhaps I can help him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Away they went, and I {{was just}} {{wondering}} whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were {{sticking out of the}} buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. <b>I</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.|$|R
