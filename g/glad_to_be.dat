5|$|The 2nd Virginia Cavalry was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back at winter {{quarters}} in Camp Piatt, Virginia, and {{believed they had}} completed their work for the year. On November 22, Colonel Paxton received a surprising order from the new division commander, recently promoted Brigadier General George Crook.|$|E
5|$|He {{was asked}} to leave the college in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, his insistence that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. <b>Glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E

On the TGS set, a huge {{poster of}} Jenna is hung with her real {{birthday}} and death date. When Jenna sees that her real birth date is displayed, she comes out of hiding and appears on stage to cover the poster. After witnessing this, Liz confronts Jenna and Tracy for their behavior, but is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back at work.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights {{made a decision to}} begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{rid of the}} former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of}} the equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Birmingham, Doyle soon linked up with Championship club Nottingham Forest on a short-term loan deal in December 2004. The loan was then extended {{to keep him}} at the City Ground {{for the rest of}} the season. Doyle made his first-team debut for Forest in a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur on 20 February 2005. As the match approached half-time, Doyle gifted Tottenham the lead as a Jermain Defoe free kick bounced out of his hands and into the net, but Forest were able to equalise in the second half to take the tie to a replay. Even though Doyle only played in a further three league matches for Forest, he said he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to play regular reserve-team football and the loan spell had exceeded his expectations. He was rumoured to be {{returning to}} Forest on loan for the following season, a move which did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Keith Wilson (Don Marshall), {{his wife}} Dorothy (Janee Michelle), their {{daughter}} Lisa (Venetta Rogers), and Keith's boss, Larry Tate (David White), visit {{the home of}} the Stephens family, with whom Lisa is to spend a few days while Keith is away on a business trip for Larry. The Wilsons are African-American {{and all of the other}} characters are white, including the Stephens family: Darrin (Dick Sargent), his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), their daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and their son Adam (David Lawrence). Tabitha is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying he has seen enough.|$|E

25|$|Ewbank {{moved back}} to Oxford in {{retirement}} and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He {{was inducted into the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, Jason Giambi signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back as {{he put on his}} old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E

25|$|A {{new wave}} of discontent spread amongst the {{different}} Xhosa tribes on the colonial frontier, {{and there was another}} uprising in Basutoland under Moirosi after the Gaika-Galeka War. The Xhosa under Moirosi were put down with severe fighting by a colonial force, but their defeat notwithstanding, the Basutos remained restless and aggressive for several years. In 1880, the British colonial authorities attempted to extend the Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, attempting a general disarmament of the Basutos. Further fighting followed the proclamation, which did not have a conclusive end, although peace was declared in December 1882. The imperial government took over Basutoland as a crown colony, on the understanding that Cape Colony should contribute £18,000 annually for administrative purposes. The authorities of the Colony were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relieved in 1884 of the administration of the Transkei, whose administration had already cost them more than £3,000,000.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked about his role in the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either admit that he sees value in the present world, or that he simply wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proven wrong again.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, but Tom (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E
