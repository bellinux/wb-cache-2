5|$|The list of benzodiazepines {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of insomnia is fairly similar among most countries, but which benzodiazepines are officially designated as first-line <b>hypnotics</b> prescribed {{for the treatment of}} insomnia varies between countries. Longer-acting benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam and diazepam have residual effects that may persist into the next day and are, in general, not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other <b>hypnotics,</b> and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of <b>hypnotics,</b> including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of <b>hypnotics</b> was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of nonbenzodiazepines in 1992 in {{response}} to safety concerns, individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines (2.3% in 1993 to 13.7% of Americans in 2010), less often prescribed benzodiazepines (23.5% in 1993 to 10.8% in 2010). It is not clear {{as to whether the}} new nonbenzodiazepine <b>hypnotics</b> (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines. Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line long-term treatment of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.|$|E

40|$|A <b>hypnotic</b> {{induction}} produces {{different patterns}} of spontaneous experiences across individuals. The magnitude {{and characteristics of}} these responses covary moderately with <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility, but also differ within levels of <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility. This study sought to identify discrete phenomenological profiles {{in response to a}} <b>hypnotic</b> induction and assess whether experiential variability among highly suggestible individuals matches the phenomenological profiles predicted by dissociative typological models of high <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility. Phenomenological state scores indexed in reference to a resting epoch during hypnosis were submitted to a latent profile analysis. The profiles in the derived four-class solution differed in multiple experiential dimensions and <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility. Highly suggestible individuals were distributed across two classes that exhibited response patterns suggesting an inward attention subtype and a dissociative subtype. These results provide support for dissociative typological models of high <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility and indicate that highly suggestible individuals do not display a uniform response to a <b>hypnotic</b> induction...|$|R

5000|$|Hypnosis {{typically}} {{involves an}} introduction to the procedure during which the subject is told that suggestions for imaginative experiences will be presented. The <b>hypnotic</b> induction is an extended initial suggestion for using one's imagination, and may contain further elaborations of the introduction. A <b>hypnotic</b> procedure is used to encourage and evaluate responses to suggestions. When using hypnosis, one person (the subject) is guided by another (the hypnotist) to respond to suggestions for changes in subjective experience, alterations in perception, sensation, emotion, thought or behavior. Persons can also learn self-hypnosis, which is the act of administering <b>hypnotic</b> procedures on one's own. If the subject responds to <b>hypnotic</b> suggestions, it is generally inferred that hypnosis has been induced.

25|$|The most {{commonly}} used class of <b>hypnotics</b> for insomnia are the benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are not significantly better for insomnia than antidepressants. Chronic users of hypnotic medications for insomnia do not have better sleep than chronic insomniacs not taking medications. In fact, chronic users of hypnotic medications have more regular nighttime awakenings than insomniacs not taking hypnotic medications. Many have concluded that these drugs cause an unjustifiable risk to the individual and to public health and lack evidence of long-term effectiveness. It is preferred that <b>hypnotics</b> be prescribed {{for only a few}} days at the lowest effective dose and avoided altogether wherever possible, especially in the elderly. Between 1993 and 2010, the prescribing of benzodiazepines to individuals with sleep disorders has decreased from 24% to 11% in the US, coinciding with the first release of nonbenzodiazepines.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, hypnotizability {{has always}} been defined as the {{increase}} in suggestibility produced by hypnosis. In practice, hypnotizability is measured as suggestibility following a <b>hypnotic</b> induction. The data indicate that these are different constructs. Although the induction of hypnosis inmases suggestibility to a substantial degree, the correlation between <b>hypnotic</b> and non <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility approximates the reliability coefficients of so-called hypnotizability scales. This indicates that <b>hypnotic</b> susceptibility scales are better measures of waking suggestibility than they are of hypnotizability.|$|R
40|$|In two papers, Pekala et al. (2010 a, 2010 b) {{reviewed}} and empirically assessed {{the relationships among}} response expectancies, <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility, spontaneous alterations in consciousness following a <b>hypnotic</b> induction, and <b>hypnotic</b> depth. We appreciate their attempt to integrate diverse facets of <b>hypnotic</b> responding and reconcile seemingly competing accounts of hypnosis. In addition, we applaud their complementary use of phenomenological and <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility measures. However, {{in their attempt to}} develop a clinically-viable measure of <b>hypnotic</b> responsiveness, we believe that they have sacrificed too much, resulting in a measure with a number of important shortcomings whose empirical utility is questionable. Furthermore, their review and study gloss over a number of important distinctions. Finally, we believe that they over-interpret the relationships between their selected measures and ones previously used in the extant literature. A closer examination of variability among highly suggestible individuals, from the purview of the approach that Pekala et al. have adopted, but with a greater diversity of methods, is likely to yield a number of insights into the characteristics and determinants of <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility and self-perceived <b>hypnotic</b> depth.

40|$|The primary phenomenological {{feature of}} a {{response}} to <b>hypnotic</b> suggestion is the perception {{that a person is}} not the author of their actions and experiences. This distortion in volition during <b>hypnotic</b> responding, known as the classic suggestion effect, has the potential to illuminate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying hypnosis and inform broader models of agency. Here, we sought to clarify interindividual differences in the patterns of agency that participants experience during hypnosis. We applied latent profile analysis, a finite mixture modeling method for partitioning participants into homogeneous classes, to participants’ responses to a standardized behavioral measure of <b>hypnotic</b> suggestibility and an experiential measure of sense of agency during <b>hypnotic</b> responding. The best fitting model suggested that there were 4 discrete response patterns: a low suggestible class, 2 medium suggestible classes, and 1 highly suggestible class. The 2 medium suggestible classes displayed nearly equivalent patterns of behavioral <b>hypnotic</b> responding but diverged in their experience of agency during <b>hypnotic</b> responding: 1 class experienced greater involuntariness during responding, whereas the other experienced greater effortlessness during responding. These results reinforce previous research highlighting differential patterns of <b>hypnotic</b> responding and complement work suggesting that there may be 2 or more phenomenologically distinct modes of <b>hypnotic</b> responding. They also have a number of implications for the measurement of <b>hypnotic</b> responding and for the use of low and medium suggestible individuals in experimental hypnosis research designs...|$|R
