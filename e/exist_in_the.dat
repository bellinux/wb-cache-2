50|$|Unger {{explains}} that much criticism of liberalism {{is directed at}} liberal doctrine only as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of ideas, a level of discourse in which one can fruitfully apply the methods and procedures of formal logic. However, a full review of liberalism requires that it be examined not only as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of ideas, {{but also as a}} form of social life, one that <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of consciousness. Studying liberalism as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of consciousness is not an inquiry susceptible of formal logical analysis; rather, a different method must be employed, one suited to symbolic analysis. Unger describes the method needed as a method of appositeness or symbolic interpretation.|$|R
