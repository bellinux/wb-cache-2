He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to Nawaz, there is absence of <b>democratic</b> <b>choice</b> in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties often find themselves competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.|$|E

Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates’ deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties – regardless of political differences – on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to <b>democratic</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

He drafted a resolution based on the one passed by the 1858 Illinois Republican convention that had endorsed Abraham Lincoln for Senate in his unsuccessful race against Stephen Douglas.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} results of a study of voters’ online {{behaviour}} conducted during the 2011 Scottish Parliamentary election campaign. Here, 64 citizens of Aberdeen, North-east Scotland, were observed and questioned while they searched for, browsed and used information on the websites of political parties and candidates standing for election to the Scottish Parliament. While online campaign sites were generally regarded as serving a useful purpose, as being easy to use and understand, relatively interesting and likely to be visited again, there was very little evidence in this study to indicate that they had any significant impact on voting behaviour during the 2011 Scottish campaign. Rather, the participants’ comments suggest that more traditional information sources, particularly print and broadcast media, coupled with long-established campaign techniques, such as leaflet deliveries and door knocking, continue to be more influential in determining voters’ <b>democratic</b> <b>choices...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{suggests}} that EU governance in Southeastern Europe reproduces a discourse {{in which the}} failures and problems which have emerged, especially {{in relation to the}} pace of integration and the sustainability of peace in candidate member states such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, have merely reinforced the EU's external governance agenda. On the one hand, the limitations of reform have reinforced the EU's projection of its power as a civilising mission into what is perceived to be a dangerous vacuum in the region. On the other hand, through the discourse of post-liberal governance, the EU seeks to avoid the direct political responsibilities associated with this power. Rather than legitimise policy making on the basis of representative legitimacy, post-liberal frameworks of governance problematise autonomy and self-government, inverting the liberal paradigm through establishing administrative and regulatory frameworks as prior to <b>democratic</b> <b>choices.</b> This process tends to distance policy making from representative accountability, weakening the legitimacy of governing institutions in Southeastern European states which have international legal sovereignty but lack genuine mechanisms for politically integrating society...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the {{technological}} attacks on intellectual property are a movement against democratically chosen intellectual property rules. They form a basic challenge {{to the rule of}} law and to the control of the rules wired into the network. In making this argument, the Article first maintains that intellectual property rights have an important public function in democracy in that they mark political, economic, and social boundaries. Next, the Article shows that the public law, as enacted by governments, has reallocated intellectual property rights to adapt to the information economy. While many aspects of this new allocation of rights have been controversial, these decisions nevertheless emanate from public authorities. The Article then analyzes the rejection of those rules by technologists and their fight to take control of rulemaking. In essence, the technical community seeks to replace the state 2 ̆ 7 s decision on public intellectual property law with the community 2 ̆ 7 s own private preferences in subversion of <b>democratic</b> <b>choices.</b> The Article concludes with several predictions and prescriptions...|$|R

40|$|Social animals {{routinely}} {{are challenged}} to make consensus decisions about movement directions and routes. However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} facilitating such decision-making processes are still poorly known. A prominent question is how group members participate in group decisions. We addressed this question by examining how flocks of homing pigeons (Columba livia) decide their homing direction. We released newly formed flocks varying in size and determined the time taken to choose a homing direction (decision-making period) and the accuracy of that choice. We found that the decision-making period increases exponentially with flock size, {{which is consistent with}} a participatory decision-making process. We additionally found that there is no effect of flock size on the accuracy of the decisions made, which does not match with current theory for <b>democratic</b> <b>choices</b> of flight directions. Our combined results are better explained by a participatory choice of leaders that subsequently undertake the flock directional decisions. However, this decision-making model would only entirely fit with our results if leaders were chosen based on traits other than their navigational experience.

40|$|This study {{challenges}} the perceived wisdom that economic globalisation has rendered social democracy a historically exhausted project. Utilising data gathered from election manifestos, the paper presents {{evidence to show}} that social democratic parties have continued to fashion a multitude of responses to globalisation and have not revised their ideological stances in ways that are consistent with the globalisation orthodoxy. In seeking to explain continued social democratic party diversity, the study draws on the fundamental insights of new-institutionalist theory. This approach examines the linkages between party positions and political institutions and shows how institutional configurations refract the pressures of globalisation and elicit a multitude of social democratic policy stances. The analysis focuses on the manifesto positions of social democratic parties on welfare policy from the 1970 s to the late 1990 s. Data on social democratic parties in more than 20 OECD democracies are obtained from a dataset produced by the Comparative Manifestos Project and examined longitudinally. The data are measures of the priority social democratic parties attach to welfare state expansion, welfare state limitation and social justice. The results show that party positions oscillated substantially between the 1970 s and 1990 s. There are no clearly visible patterns in the data and, importantly, no directional trends. In seeking to explain why social democratic parties continue to pursue a multitude of different policy paths, the paper draw on the insights of new-institutionalist theory. The approach is defined broadly, with the study utilising four strands of new-institutionalism. The bulk of the paper was given over to empirical institutionalism, the primary analytical tool deployed to uncover the influence of institutional variables on social <b>democratic</b> <b>choices.</b> The theoretical arguments of empirical institutionalist theory are operationalised into quantitative measures and a range of statistical methods are used to demonstrate the influence of institutional variables on party welfare-ideological profiles during the three-decade period. The explanatory power of new-institutionalism is further explored in a case study of the German Social Democratic Party and Agenda 2010, a radical package of welfare reforms the party launched in 2003. Three alternative new-institutionalist approaches are employed to illustrate how the role of institutions in influencing social <b>democratic</b> <b>choices</b> can be understood and explained in different ways.
