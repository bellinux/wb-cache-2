After the war, its contents were read to Polish listeners by Radio Free Europe. His diary, which was kept until very last moment before the execution, is {{regarded as one of}} the most accurate, as he <b>described</b> <b>every</b> day <b>events</b> at camps.

He maintained a blog that <b>described</b> <b>every</b> <b>event</b> attended by Thompson and his interaction with voters. [...] Wise also witnessed a spat between Thompson and fellow presidential candidate Tom Tancredo. [...] Thompson criticized Tancredo for negative campaigning after discovering that he had sent out a mailer that referred to Thompson as a [...] "moderate governor" [...] that supported amnesty for illegal immigrants. He labelled the mailer a [...] "hate piece" [...] put out by [...] "somebody who's way behind and is trying to attack me".

40|$|According {{to modern}} physics, all {{physical}} processes are described by quantum theory. In particular, due to quantum fluctuations, {{even in the}} empty space, the causal relation is, in general, slightly different from the usual Minkowski one. Since quantum effects are probabilistic, to properly represent the corresponding stochastic causality, we need to <b>describe,</b> for <b>every</b> two <b>events</b> e and e 2 ̆ 7, the probability p(e,e 2 ̆ 7) that e can causally influence e 2 ̆ 7. Surprisingly, {{it turns out that}} such a probability functions cannot be Lorentz-invariant. In other words, once we take into account quantum effects in causality, Lorentz-invariance is violated [...] similarly {{to the fact that it}} is violated if we take into account the presence of matter and start considering cosmological solutions...|$|R
