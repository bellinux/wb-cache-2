40|$|Thermal plasma {{measurements}} on the SCATHA and GEOS satellites show {{the existence of}} the plasmasphere out to beyond geosynchronous orbit in the dusk bulge region. On at least one occasion, this plasma population persisted until local midnight, as observed by both satellites. These observations establish the context for the 'hidden ion' population reported by Olsen [1982] as the outer plasmasphere. The GEOS <b>electrostatic</b> <b>analyzers,</b> which were on biased booms, were able to measure the cold plasma with a- 8 V bias. The SCATHA <b>electrostatic</b> <b>analyzers</b> were unable to measure this plasma in sunlight, but could in eclipse. The floating potential of the GEOS satellite in sunlight in this 50 cm- 3 plasma was about + 3 V, and it is apparent that SCATHA was at a similar potential. This potential was sufficient to prevent the measurement of the 0. 6 - 0. 7 eV temperature plasma. 1...|$|R

30|$|Despite their {{scientific}} importance, medium-energy electrons {{occur in}} an energy range gap between low-energy plasma sensors and high-energy particle detectors.

40|$|Data {{obtained}} from the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>analyzers</b> aboard the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft and from the Faraday cup aboard Voyager 2 were used to study spatial gradients in the distant solar wind. Prior to mid- 1985, both spacecraft observed nearly identical solar wind structures. After day 150 of 1985, the velocity structure at Voyager 2 became flatter, and the Voyager 2 velocities were smaller than those observed by Pioneer 11.

40|$|There are {{divergent}} {{results in}} the literature on the (in) dependence of the ion velocity distribution functions on the ion charge states. Apparently, most time-of-flight methods of measurements indicate independence whereas most measurements with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>analyzers</b> state the opposite. It is shown here that this grouping is coincidental with investigations of pulsed and continuous arcs. All results can be consolidated by taking ion-neutral interaction into account, especially charge exchange collisions with the metal neutrals produced by the arc itself. The velocity distribution functions are independent of charge state when produced at cathode spots but become charge-state dependent when the plasma interacts with neutrals...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after launch, {{scientists}} {{found that the}} Scanning <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Analyzer</b> had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open.

50|$|An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>analyzer</b> or ESA is an {{instrument}} used in ion optics that employs an electric field {{to allow the}} passage of only those ions or electrons that have a given specific energy. It usually also focuses these particles (concentrates them) into a smaller area. ESA’s are typically used as components of space instrumentation, to limit the scanning (sensing) energy range and, thereby also, the range of particles targeted for detection and scientific measurement. The closest analogue in photon optics is a filter.|$|E
