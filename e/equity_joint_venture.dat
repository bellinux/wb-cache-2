40|$|Abstract. This paper {{extends the}} {{internalization}} {{approach to the}} theory of the multinational enterprise (MNE) to include an expanded role for <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures.</b> Using the transaction cost paradigm of Williamson, this paper explains why <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> may sometimes be preferred over wholly owned subsidiaries. Also presented is empirical work on joint-venture performance in developing countries which demonstrates that under certain conditions <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> can be the optimal mode of foreign direct investment. <b>Joint</b> <b>ventures</b> are the dominant form of business organization for multinational enterprises in the developing countries (Vaupel and Curhan 1973), and are frequently being used by Fortune 500 companies in the developed countries (Janger 1980; Harrigan 1985). In fact, for U. S. -based companies, all cooperative arrangements (involving such things as licences or local shareholders) outnumber wholly owned subsidiaries by a ratio of 4 to 1 (Contractor and Lorange 1987). MNEs often prefer <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> over wholly owned subsidiaries {{regardless of whether or not}} they are required by a host country as a condition of entry (Beamish 1984). Nevertheless, fairly limited consideration has been given to the rationale for <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> in the theory of the multinational enterprise. While recent theoretical contributions utilizing the internalization approach have significantly advanced our understanding of MNEs (Buckley and Casson 1976...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{joint ventures}} offer a {{potentially}} attractive form of corporate and industrial organisation, they also experience {{high rate of}} break-up within ten years from their initial formation. In this paper, we model this process not as an uncertain random event, but rather as the predictable outcome of underlying economic variables, with break-up within a finite time resulting even under conditions of complete certainty. Given the prevalence of joint venture break-ups, {{it is in the}} interests of both partners in an <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> to be fully aware of their own optimal durations of the joint venture in their initial negotiations for the formation of the <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture.</b> Where the underlying economic parameters imply differences in their individual optimal durations of the joint venture, there is therefore scope for mutually beneficial agreements on a binding date for the break-up of the joint venture, and for side payments to enable this binding agreement to be reached, either as cash payments or in terms of their relative shareholdings in the jointly-owned separate company that will manage the <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture.</b> In addition, there is scope for a differential corporate tax rate on the joint venture, compared to that on the go-it-alone businesses of the two partners, in order bring the two partners’ privately optimal durations into line with the socially optimal duration of the joint venture.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how firms choose organizational form for their R&D alliances. Encouraging cooperation in these alliances is often challenging, given {{the difficulties in}} knowledge sharing between partners and protecting the property rights over partner knowledge. Interestingly, knowledge based and transaction cost perspectives generate different hypotheses on alliance organization choice in this setting. When partner knowledge bases are very different, the risk of unintended transfer or leakage is reduced, yet the need for enhanced communication and knowledge sharing mechanisms remains undiminished. With a sample of 232 R&D alliances, I find more thorough support for the transaction cost hypothesis. Firms more likely select an <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> as partner knowledge bases diverge and knowledge transfer becomes more difficult. When such knowledge bases are very different, however, firms {{are less likely to}} choose an <b>equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> over more contractual forms of alliance organization. Thus, these results provide empirical evidence on alliance organization choice and also have important implications for the fundamental question of why firms exist...|$|E
