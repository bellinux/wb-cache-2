We start by constructing simulated samples of both optically thick and optically thin galaxies and {{show that they are}} in excellent correspondence with the observational data used by Burstein et al. The Burstein et al. method does appear to have overcome many of the selection effects inherent in other surface brightness <b>inclination</b> <b>tests.</b> The problem is that they now appear to have introduced yet another selection effect by requiring that all of the galaxies in their sample need a distance estimate.

40|$|Properties of {{magnetic}} {{field in the}} internetwork regions are still fairly unknown due to rather weak spectropolarimetric signals. We address the matter by using the 2 D inversion code that is able to retrieve the information on smallest spatial scales, up to the diffraction limit, while being less susceptible to noise {{than most of the}} previous methods used. Performance of the code and the impact of the various effects on the retrieved field distribution is tested first on the realistic MHD simulations. The best inversion scenario is then applied to the real Hinode/SP data. Tests on simulations show: (1) the best choice of node position ensures a decent retrieval of all parameters, (2) code performs well for different configurations {{of magnetic}} field, (3) slightly different noise level or slightly different defocus included in the spatial PSF produces no significant effect on the results and (4) temporal integration shifts the field distribution to the stronger, more horizontally inclined field. Although the contribution of the weak field is slightly overestimated due to noise, the 2 D inversions are able to recover well the overall distribution of the magnetic field strength. Application of the 2 D inversion code on the Hinode/SP internetwork observations reveals a monotonic field strength distribution. The mean field strength at optical depth unity is ∼ 130 G. At the higher layers, field strength drops as the field becomes more horizontal. Regarding the distribution of the field <b>inclination,</b> <b>tests</b> show that we cannot directly retrieve it with the observations/tools at hand, however the obtained distributions are consistent with those expected from simulations with a quasi-isotropic field inclination after accounting for observational effects.

40|$|The {{study of}} the opacities of spiral galaxies is focused here on the optical depth in the blue band in the regions of the discs between the {{effective}} radius and the 26 mag arcsec^- 2 ^ blue isophote. A sample of galaxies drawn from the ESO-LV catalogue is explored using completeness tests which employ the V/V_max_ technique. The results allow a comparison between results from various <b>inclination</b> <b>tests</b> that use different photometric parameters and sample selection criteria. For Sb-Sc galaxies, isophotal diameters do not increase with inclination in complete samples, but do so in incomplete samples. This result explains part {{of the diversity of}} the literature. An additional analysis, incorporating the effect of interlopers in a diameter-selected sample, employs log N-log diameter distributions and provides new results on the transparency in the outer regions for several central surface brightness `families' of Sb, Sc and Sd galaxies. These results and earlier findings match well, and suggest an average overall picture of the optical depth at various locations in the discs of these galaxies. Sb galaxies and high surface brightness galaxies of later type (Sc, Sd) are found to have low C values (optically thick, high internal extinctions) over the whole of their discs, while the fainter surface brightness Sc and Sd galaxies are best modelled with C= 0. 5 - 0. 6 at the effective radius (semi-transparent) and C = 0. 7 - 0. 9 at the 26 mag arcsec^- 2 ^ isophote (nearly transparent). A relatively large optical depth and a corresponding low overall disc C value at the outer radii are best understood in terms of an obscuring component with a scaleheight of the same order as that of the stars and a scalelength larger than that of the stars.

Physiological tests of the project were aimed to study hu-man subjects at thermal comfort or being slightly warm in cold: 0, - 10, - 25 and wind-chill temperature – 50 ºC. Wind-chill temperature – 50 was achieved by combination of 2 tempera-tures and wind velocities: - 40 ºC and 3 m/s, and - 23 ºC and 10 m/s. Moderate activity to keep subjects at thermal comfort without sweating was chosen according to IREQ-neutral (ISO/CD 11079, 2001).

The integrations incorporate the gravitational effects of Sun and the eight planets (Pluto is neglected). Mercury is the least likely planet, as it is unable to retain tadpole orbits over 100 million year timescales. Both Venus and the Earth are much more promising, as they possess rich families of stable tadpole and horseshoe orbits. Our survey of Trojans in the orbital plane of Venus is undertaken for 25 million years. Some 40 % of the survivors are on tadpole orbits.

Both Venus and the Earth also have regions in which inclined test particles can endure near the Lagrange points. For Venus, only test particles close to the orbital plane are stable. For the Earth, there are two bands of stability, one at low inclinations (i < 16 degrees) and one at moderate inclinations (between 24 degrees and 34 degrees).

40|$|The {{advancement}} {{of research and}} development for Electric Vehicle (EV) has pushed a similar advancement in the EV performance test and measurement. Traditionally, chassis dynamometer is used to measuring power delivered from Vehicle Under Test (VUT) typically by Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle which access power by unidirectional. This one-way power delivery becomes a limitation for advanced EV with the regenerative braking feature, which the kinetic power of the vehicles is converted into electrical power. To test and measure this capability, a new chassis dynamometer is needed where the power delivery must be bidirectional. With that intention, this study proposes the usage of half-bridge bidirectional DC–DC converter (HBDC) as the Power Absorption and Delivery Unit (PADU) for a DC machine based dynamometer. PADU is controlled by modified Hysteresis Current Controller (HCC) and PID controller. The modified HCC and PID control power flow direction; back and forth during testing. The testing includes normal condition and regenerative braking condition. In normal condition, power is delivered by the DC machine whereas in regenerative braking condition, power is absorbed by the DC machine. Several test cases are considered; <b>inclination</b> <b>test,</b> declination test, normal drive condition, brake condition and stop condition. It is found that the HBDC successfully control the power flow in both normal condition and regenerative braking condition. As compared to conventional HBDC, modified HBDC reduces conduction loss with up to 28. 21 % reduction and switching loss with up to 7. 69 % reduction. To evaluate the power flow control, several power measurement points are taken in the simulation and comprehensive results are presented.

First published July 1, 2010; doi: 10. 1152 /japplphysiol. 00281. 2010. -The cellular mechanisms of positive effects associated with aerobic exercise training on overall intrinsic skeletal muscle changes in heart failure (HF) remain unclear. We investigated potential Ca(2 +) abnormalities in skeletal muscles comprising different fiber compositions and investigated whether aerobic exercise training would improve muscle {{function in a}} genetic model of sympathetic hyperactivity-induced HF. A cohort of male 5 -mo-old wild-type (WT) and congenic alpha(2 A) /alpha(2 C) adrenoceptor knockout (ARKO) mice in a C 57 BL/ 6 J genetic background were randomly assigned into untrained and trained groups. Exercise training consisted of a 8 -wk running session of 60 min, 5 days/wk (from 5 to 7 mo of age). After completion of the exercise training protocol, exercise tolerance was determined by graded treadmill exercise test, muscle function test by Rotarod, ambulation and resistance to <b>inclination</b> <b>tests,</b> cardiac function by echocardiography, and Ca(2 +) handling-related protein expression by Western blot. alpha(2 A) /alpha(2 C) ARKO mice displayed decreased ventricular function, exercise intolerance, and muscle weakness paralleled by decreased expression of sarcoplasmic Ca(2 +) release-related proteins [alpha(1) -, alpha(2) -, and beta(1) -subunits of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) ] and Ca(2 +) reuptake-related proteins [sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) -ATPase (SERCA) 1 / 2 and Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX) ] in soleus and plantaris. Aerobic exercise training significantly improved exercise tolerance and muscle function and reestablished the expression of proteins involved in sarcoplasmic Ca(2 +) handling toward WT levels. We provide evidence that Ca(2 +) handling-related protein expression is decreased in this HF model and that exercise training improves skeletal muscle function associated with changes in the net balance of skeletal muscle Ca(2 +) handling proteins.

40|$|Mechanical {{testing was}} {{performed}} on {{a new class of}} nanostructures—amorphous Si slanted nanorods of rectangular cross section, fixed at one end to the substrate. These nanorods were grown spatially well separated on nano-pillars under the oblique angle physical vapor deposi-tion technique. Various samples with different dimensions and <b>inclination</b> angles were <b>tested</b> in bending using an atomic force microscope. The material response was elastic up to large stresses/deflections. The Young’s modulus was calculated from the slope of the experimentally observed stiffness versus the geometrical factor common to all the samples and was found to be (9414 ± 1021) GPa. No size effect of this parameter was observed within the accuracy of the present measurement...|$|R
40|$|Observers viewed large dichoptic {{patterns}} undergoing smooth temporal modulations or {{step changes}} in simulated slant or inclination {{under various conditions}} of disparity [...] perspective cue conflict and concordance. After presentation of each test surface, subjects adjusted a comparison surface to match the perceived slant or <b>inclination</b> of the <b>test</b> surface. Addition of conflicting perspective to disparity affected slant and inclination perception more for brief than for long presentations. Perspective had more influence for smooth temporal changes than for step changes in slant or inclination and for surfaces presented in isolation rather than with a zero disparity frame. These results indicate that conflicting perspective information plays a dominant {{role in determining the}} temporal properties of perceived slant and inclination...|$|R
40|$|Abstract There are few informations {{about the}} {{influence}} of cusp inclination on the fracture strength of implant-supported crowns. The study aimed to evaluate the influence of cusp inclination and retention type on fracture load in implant-supported metal-ceramic single crowns. Sixty crowns were made, classified as cemented and screw-retained with screw access hole (SAH) sealed or not. Standard (33 °) and reduced (20 °) cusp <b>inclinations</b> were <b>tested</b> for each group (n= 10). To support crowns of a mandibular second molar, analogs of external hexagon implants 5. 0 were used. The fracture load was measured in a universal testing machine EMIC DL 2000 (10 kN load cell; 0. 5 mm/min). Two-way ANOVA (retention and cusp inclination) followed by post hoc Tukey&# 8217;s honest significant difference test was used for the statistical analyses (a= 0. 05). Crowns with reduced cusp inclination exhibited significantly higher fracture load (p 0. 05) for the fracture load. The sealing of SAH did not influence the fracture load of screw-retained crowns (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, fracture load of implant-supported metal-ceramic crowns was influenced by retention and cusp inclination, and there was no influence of the sealing of SAH...|$|R
