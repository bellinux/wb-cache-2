40|$|Making a distal {{extension}} removable partial denture {{is difficult}} because of tissue ward movement of the partial denture. Two structures that support distal extension removable partial denture (teeth and mucosa) differ markedly in their viscoelastic response to loading. Some factors that can give support for distal extension removable partial denture are extension of the base, the type of impression, and tightness of contact between the base and mucosa. All of these factors {{can be achieved by}} using altered cast impression. The procedures of altered cast impressions are physiologic adjustment of the metal framework, making self-cured acrylic resin <b>individual</b> <b>tray</b> on the metal framework, border molding the <b>individual</b> <b>tray</b> and finally making final impression.

Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the transfer impressions of implants performed with individual acrylic resin trays and conventional trays using polyvinyl siloxane. Material and methods: To carry out the transfer impressions, a master cast with four external hexagon implants parallel to each other was used. Five impressions were made with individual acrylic resin trays and five other impressions with modified conventional trays, opened in the region of the implants. The linear measurements between the implants were made with a digital caliper with an accuracy of 0. 01 mm and the results were statistically evaluated (alpha = 5 %). Results: For the points AB and BC, the measurements obtained with the <b>individual</b> <b>trays</b> were statistically similar to the master cast.

40|$|University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Engineering Department {{distillation}} column {{is used as}} a teaching tool, but is currently without a feedback control system. An eventual goal of developing such a control system requires that the behavior of the column be understood. It is necessary to identify which of the column parameters can change, either ones that change to cause a disturbance, or ones that the controller can change in response to a disturbance. There are four of these parameters in the UTC column: feed flow rate, feed composition, reboiler heat and reflux percent. Experiments were performed on the column to identify the response when each of the four parameters was changed in isolation. A chart showing the concentrations on each of the trays {{both before and after the}} change was used to visualize how the change affected the <b>individual</b> <b>trays.</b> The operating lines from the McCabe-Thiele method were used to analyze the overall effect on the column.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the stress distribution at the bone–implant contact in the pick-up implant impression technique. The mechanical properties and the curing dynamics of Pattern Resin LS were previously investigated. Materials and methods Measurements of the elastic modules of Pattern Resin LS were carried out after complete curing by standard stress–strain tests and a three-point bending technique. A specific laboratory set-up was implemented to monitor the curing dynamics and the linear contraction by using optical imaging methods. A finite element model (FEM) was created and a complete assembly was made with 33 solid bodies representing the main components of the system including the external portion of cortical bone, the internal portion of trabecular bone, six implants, six copings, one bridging structure (modular <b>individual</b> <b>tray),</b> six modules, and six pattern resin layers to fill up the interstitial spaces. Isotropic characteristics for cortical and trabecular bone were incorporated. The stress distribution was measured at the total body of the bone–implant interface, at the external cortical bone surface, at the coping–implant connection area, and at the tray–coping junction. Parametric analysis was also done to study the behavior of two types of internal connection in the impression phase: type A consisting of a 0. 4 mm tube-in-tube connection with a triangular head by three cams (Cam-Log Biotechnologies, Germany); type B consisting of a 0. 5 -mm internal hexagonal connection (Biomet 3 i, USA). Results The measured values of Young’s modulus and the flexural modulus of the resin were 1. 58 ± 0. 12 GPa and 2. 07 ± 0. 24 GPa, respectively. The final volume contraction was found to be strongly dependent on the powder/ liquid ratio; specifically, the tests suggested that the highest value of the powder/liquid ratio (2 : 1) was the most favorable one. In all cases, however, the Pattern Resin behavior was within the linear elastic range, without any permanent deformation or detachment. At individual tray–Pattern Resin interfaces, a stress of about 20. 0 MPa was produced for each component; FEM analysis showed that the stress level at the implant–transfer copings connection was higher than that at the bone–implant interface. The trabecular and cortical bone showed the lowest level of stress concentration. B-type transfer showed a higher stress at the transfer coping–implant connection; A-type transfer coping allowed for a higher deformation area, increasing the risk of detachment. Conclusions The mechanical properties of Pattern Resin LS seem to be appropriate for use in the pick-up impression technique thanks to the low-volume contraction, the capabilities to dampen misfits, and permanent deformation effects. The shape of the copings affects the values of the stress both in the transfer coping–implant connection zones and at resin–transfer coping interfaces. A thicker clearance of the module–tray connection helps in reducing the mechanical stress. The FEM analysis showed that the removal procedure of the pick-up implant impression tray does not produce any irreversible damage on the cortical and trabecular bone structure. Since the yield threshold was high, the stress dis-tribution at the bone–implant–coping configurations was largely within the safety range for the multiple internalconnection implants, in combination with a modular <b>individual</b> impression <b>tray...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a rapid growth of {{terrestrial}} and satellite communications {{in the last few}} decades of the 20 th century. This has resulted in a heavy congestion of low microwave bands and {{has been a}} major driving force for exploring the upper microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. One of the main requirements for a successful shift to the new frequency spectrum is the availability of high power solid-state transmitters. Solid-state devices such as diodes or transistors have been able to meet such demands when their output signals are combined using space-level power combining methods that avoid conduction losses, which become pronounced at millimeter wave frequencies. In this thesis, theoretical and experimental investigations are carried out into the spatial power combiners (SPCs) which employ active planar arrays formed by transistor amplifiers whose input and output ports are equipped with planar radiating elements. The SPC structures include the reflection-type combiner using the tile configuration of planar array and the transmission-type combiner using tile or tray configurations of planar arrays. The frequency bands chosen for the designing and testing of prototypes are X- and Ku-band. The first stage of the investigation concerns the 10 GHz reflection-type power combiner structure formed by a phased planar microstrip reflectarray (MRA) of 37 -element dual-feed aperture coupled microstrip patch antennas equipped with open-circuit stubs as phasing components. The experimental tests reveal poor radiation performance and hence poor power combining efficiency of this structure. These results indicated the need for theoretical investigations into the operation of this type of SPC. The study of the unit cell of this power combiner reveals that the phase of an open-circuit stub does not increase linearly {{as a function of the}} stub length and its range is limited to less than (about is required for proper functioning). This finding, forms the basis for extending the investigations into alternative phasing mechanisms of a MRA which would offer a phasing range exceeding. A phasing mechanism exploiting variable size stacked patches is chosen. In order to accurately determine the phasing of the reflected wave, a theory based on an equivalent unit cell waveguide approach (WGA) is proposed and developed. The proposed theory is computationally efficient and is proven to be accurate compared with benchmark results published by other researchers. Following the verification, an offset feed 161 -element two-layer printed MRA prototype with patches of variable size is designed and developed for operation in Ku-band. The test results aim at verifying the validity of applying a unit cell WGA to designing passive and active MRAs. The next investigations, which are presented in the thesis concern increasing operational bandwidth of the transmission-type SPC in tile configuration. The designs presented so far in the open literatures were based on edge-feed microstrip patch antennas as radiating elements of individual active stages and featured a narrow-band performance. In order to overcome this shortcoming, stacked patch (SP) microstrip antennas as receiving and transmitting elements in an active transmitarray (TXA) are proposed. For the aim of testing the proposed concept, a 16 -element SP TXA is designed for operation in X-band. Two identical hard horn antennas with an approximately uniform field across the aperture for signal launching and collecting complete the design and development of this space-level power combiner. The performance of the developed device is assessed experimentally and an increased operational bandwidth is demonstrated. The final structure being investigated in the thesis project is the transmission-type SPC in tray configuration. This power combining structure employs a travelling wave antenna of uniplanar quasi-Yagi type as a radiating element to achieve broad-band operation. The investigated SPC is formed by seven trays of uniplanar quasi-Yagi antenna. In order to achieve uniform and in-phase excitation of <b>individual</b> <b>trays,</b> which is required to obtain high power combining efficiency, hard horn antennas and Schiffman phase shifters are employed in the design of this space-level combiner.

40|$|Durante um longo perÃodo de tempo, plantas tÃm sido avaliadas como fonte de produtos naturais para prevenÃÃo de doenÃas orais, especialmente cÃrie e doenÃa periodontal. A atividade antimicrobiana dessas plantas tem sido estudada para combater os microorganismos patogÃnicos da boca, dentre elas a Lippia sidoides Cham. Tendo em vista a cÃrie ser a {{principal}} doenÃa bucal que afeta crianÃas na idade escolar, deve-se encontrar uma forma segura e eficaz de prevenÃÃo desta doenÃa. O presente trabalho objetivou realizar um ensaio clÃnico randomizado, a partir de um estudo piloto, para avaliar a eficÃcia de trÃs diferentes formas farmacÃuticas, bochecho, gel e dentifrÃcio, do Ãleo essencial de Lippia sidoides Cham, frente a uma das principais bactÃrias relacionadas Ã doenÃa cÃrie: os Streptococcus mutans. A pesquisa foi realizada em trÃs fases: a primeira consistiu em um estudo piloto no qual 20 pacientes foram randomicamente distribuÃdos em quatro diferentes grupos, com 5 pacientes em cada grupo. O grupo I recebeu tratamento tÃpico com Lippia sidoides bochecho a 0, 6 %, o grupo II Lippia sidoides bochecho a 0, 8 %, o grupo III a 1 % e o grupo IV usou bochecho a concentraÃÃo de 1, 2 %. A partir da melhor concentraÃÃo encontrada (0, 8 %) procedeu-se da mesma maneira com o gel de Lippia sidoides, tambÃm para se verificar a melhor concentraÃÃo (1, 4 %). A segunda fase do estudo consistiu de 100 crianÃas que foram divididas em cinco diferentes grupos, de forma randomizada. O grupo I recebeu tratamento tÃpico com Lippia sidoides bochecho, o grupo II Lippia sidoides gel, o grupo III clorexidina bochecho, o grupo IV recebeu clorexidina gel e o grupo V recebeu dentifrÃcio de Lippia sidoides. Tratando-se das formulaÃÃes bochecho e gel, a identificaÃÃo de cada substÃncia foi feita com letras de modo a nÃo saber qual antimicrobiano estava sendo aplicado. O paciente tambÃm desconhecia qual substÃncia estava sendo aplicada a ele, garantindo o estudo duplo-cego. Em cada um dos tratamentos com bochecho foram utilizados 5 ml, durante 1 minuto, 1 vez ao dia, durante 5 dias consecutivos. Em cada tratamento com gel, foram utilizados 5 ml, aplicados em moldeiras individuais por 4 minutos, 1 vez ao dia, durante 5 dias consecutivos. No tratamento com dentifrÃcio foi utilizada uma quantidade correspondente a um caroÃo de ervilha, durante 1 minuto, 1 vez ao dia, durante 5 dias consecutivos. A saliva de cada paciente foi coletada antes de se iniciar o tratamento (D 1), no Ãltimo dia do tratamento (D 5), 30 dias apÃs o dia 1 (D 30), 60 dias apÃs o dia 1 (D 60), 6 meses apÃs o inÃcio do tratamento (D 180) e 1 ano apÃs o inÃcio do tratamento (D 360), para se verificar a eficÃcia das formas farmacÃuticas de Lippia sidoides na reduÃÃo dos Streptococcus mutans. Antes do inÃcio do tratamento foi feito um exame por apenas um examinador atravÃs do mÃtodo visual/tÃtico para se calcular o nÃmero de superfÃcies cariadas, perdidas e obturadas (CPOS) para avaliar o aparecimento de novas lesÃes de cÃrie no decorrer de um ano apÃs o tratamento. A melhor formulaÃÃo encontrada foi o dentifrÃcio, embora quando todas as formulaÃÃes foram comparadas Ã clorexidina, esta demonstrou possuir maior eficÃcia na reduÃÃo de Streptococcus mutans. Isso nos levou a concluir que o problema poderia estar relacionado ao nÃmero de aplicaÃÃes insuficientes (apenas 1 vez ao dia). Logo, deu-se inÃcio Ã terceira fase do estudo, que consistiu nos mesmos princÃpios descritos anteriormente, porÃm foram selecionadas apenas 20 crianÃas com cÃrie, que foram submetidas Ã aplicaÃÃo de dentifrÃcio de Lippia sidoides durante 1 mÃs, com escovaÃÃo 3 vezes ao dia. Outras 20 crianÃas, tambÃm com cÃrie, foram selecionadas para fazerem escovaÃÃo com pasta fluoretada comum, pelo mesmo perÃodo, com o mesmo nÃmero de escovaÃÃes diÃrias. Todas as crianÃas receberam instruÃÃo de higiene de forma padronizada, para que as escovaÃÃes feitas no domicÃlio se aproximassem ao mÃximo da maneira a qual foi estabelecida. A melhor eficÃcia na reduÃÃo dos Ãndices de Streptococcus mutans foi observada no grupo do dentifrÃcio de Lippia sidoides em relaÃÃo ao grupo que utilizou a pasta comum. NÃo foram relatados efeitos colaterais, pelo contrÃrio, alguns responsÃveis relataram melhora no hÃlito das crianÃas que utilizaram o dentifrÃcio de alecrim. Esses dados indicam que a planta estudada pode servir como uma alternativa de baixo custo e culturalmente aceitÃvel para a prevenÃÃo da cÃrie em crianÃas de 6 a 12 anos quando utilizada 3 vezes ao dia na forma de dentifrÃcio. During {{a long period}} of time, plants have been evaluated as a source of natural products for prevention of oral diseases, especially caries and periodontal disease. The antimicrobial activity of these plants has been studied to combat pathogenic microorganisms of the mouth, among them the Lippia sidoides Cham. Considering that caries are the main oral disease affecting children at school age, it is necessary to find a safe and effective prevention of this disease. This study aimed to conduct a randomized clinical trial, from a pilot study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three different dosage forms, rinses, gels and toothpaste, essential oil of Lippia sidoides Cham, facing one of the major bacteria-related disease caries: Streptococcus mutans. The survey was conducted in three phases: the first consisted of a pilot study in which 20 patients were randomly assigned to four different groups, with 5 patients in each group. Group I was treated with topical Lippia sidoides mouthrinse with 0. 6 %, group II Lippia sidoides mouthrinse to 0. 8 %, group III at 1 % and group IV used mouthwash concentration of 1. 2 %. From the best dosage (0. 8 %) proceeded in the same way with the gel Lippia sidoides, also to study the best concentration (1. 4 %), this concentration was also used for toothpaste. The second phase of the study consisted of 100 children who were divided into five different groups at random. Group I was treated with topical Lippia sidoides mouthrinse, group II Lippia sidoides gel, chlorhexidine mouthwash group III, group IV received chlorhexidine gel and group V received toothpaste Lippia sidoides. In the case of mouthwash and gel formulations, the identification of each substance was made with letters so as not to know which antimicrobials were being applied. The patient was also unaware of which substance was being applied to it, ensuring the double-blind study. In each of the treatments were used with mouthwash 5 ml, 1 minute, 1 time a day for 5 consecutive days. In each treatment gel, were used 5 ml, applied in <b>individual</b> <b>trays</b> for 4 minutes, 1 time a day for 5 consecutive days. In the treatment with toothpaste was used an amount corresponding to a lump of sweet, 1 minute, 1 time a day for 5 consecutive days. The saliva of each patient was collected before starting treatment (D 1), the last day of treatment (D 5), 30 days after day 1 (D 30), 60 days after day 1 (D 60), 6 months after initiation of treatment (D 180) and 1 year after initiation of treatment (D 360), to verify the effectiveness of dosage forms of Lippia sidoides in the reduction of Streptococcus mutans. Before the start of treatment was a survey done by a single examiner using the visual method / tactic to calculate the number of surfaces decayed, missing and filled (DMF) to assess the emergence of new carious lesions during the course of one year after treatment. The best formulation was found the toothpaste, although when all the formulations were compared to chlorhexidine, it has shown greater efficacy in the reduction of Streptococcus mutans. This led us to conclude that the problem could be related to insufficient number of applications (only 1 time a day). So has begun the third phase of the study, which consisted of the same principles described above, but were selected only 20 children with caries, which were sprayed with Lippia sidoides dentifrice for 1 month, brushing 3 times a day. Another 20 children, also with caries, were selected to make brushing with fluoridated common folder for the same period, with the same number of daily brushings. All children received hygiene instruction in a standardized manner, so that the brushing done at home to approach the maximum of the way it has been established. The best efficacy in reducing the levels of Streptococcus mutans was observed in the dentifrice of Lippia sidoides in the group that used the common folder. There were no reported side effects; however, it was reported some improvement in the breath of children who used toothpaste rosemary. These data indicate that the plant studied can serve as an low cost alternative and culturally acceptable to the prevention of dental caries in children aged 6 to 12 years if used 3 times a day as toothpaste...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of an impression valve system (IVS) on the bonding force between an impression tray and an edentulous maxillary jaw. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, a polyether-coated maxillary jaw simulator (PM) was used to model an edentulous maxillary jaw. The IVS was placed into <b>individual</b> impression <b>trays.</b> An irreversible hydrocolloid impression was taken of the PM when the IVS was open and closed. The impression tray bonding force was measured using a digital dynamometer. Student’s t-test was used to determine the significance of the difference between these two groups. Results: The impression tray was more easily separated from the PM when the IVS was open (108 ± 3. 9 N). The separation was more difficult when the IVS was closed (153. 7 ± 14. 2 N). The difference between these two findings (P = 0. 000) was significant. Conclusion: The use of an IVS facilitates the removal of the impression tray from the mouth when taking impressions from an edentulous maxillary jaw...|$|R
40|$|Innovations in {{mosquito}} mass-rearing {{techniques are}} essential {{in the quest}} to develop SIT (sterile insect technique) methods to fight mosquito vectors of disease. This study reports modifications to the Food and Agriculture Organisation/International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) mass-rearing cage (MRC) for mosquitoes to support the behaviour of adult Anopheles arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) and to maximize egg production. The effects of an improved sugar-feeding device, {{and the addition of}} resting sites and a black cloth shroud to create an artificial horizon (visual contrast of light vs. dark at the edge) were assessed for their effect on adult longevity and egg production. Egg production of adults resulting from larvae reared in <b>individual</b> free-standing <b>trays</b> vs. those reared in the same trays in the FAO/IAEA larval rearing rack was also compared. Finally, the effect of blood feeding and frequency of egg collection from the MRC on average egg production per batch was investigated. Overall, the modifications to the MRC enhanced adult longevity, and the improved cage prototype allowed the collection of more eggs overall from a cohort of adults than was possible using the original and previous cage prototypes. These stepwise improvements are important for the development of economical and logistically efficient mass-rearing systems for the malaria vector An. arabiensis...|$|R
40|$|Full denture acrylic protheses can {{substitute}} all maxillary or mandibulary teeth naturally. The objective of fabricating full denture protheses is to substitute the tissue lost that {{was occupied by}} teeth or connective tissue before ward. This {{is a case of}} a 43 year old female with lost of all her upper and lower teeth. At the maxilla there is a palatine torus spreading along the midline with 25 mm length, 10 mm width and 6 mm height. She has never worn prothese before. The process of full denture protheses fabrication were carried out in several steps, starting from making anatomical impression  to get study model, making of <b>individual</b> stock <b>tray,</b> making functional impression to get working model, choosing the design, making of midline, making of bite rim, inserting the model on articulator, preparing artificial teeth arrangement, fitting the wax, countoring wax, flasking, boiling out, packing, curing, deflasking, finishing, polishing and inserting the protheses. The process of this full denture protheses fabrication used tin foil as reducer to prevent overpressure of the tissue around the thin torus area so the prothesis will be more comfortable for the patient. The result was the protheses can be used by the patient, nicely and comfortably...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{printing}} is an {{additive manufacturing}} method {{in which a}} 3 D item is formed by laying down successive layers of material. 3 D printers are machines that produce representations of objects either planned with a CAD program or scanned with a 3 D scanner. Printing is a method for replicating text and pictures, typically with ink on paper. We can print different dental pieces using different methods such as selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, and laminated object manufacturing. The materials are certified for printing <b>individual</b> impression <b>trays,</b> orthodontic models, gingiva mask, and different prosthetic objects. The material can reach a flexural strength of more than 80 MPa. 3 D printing takes the effectiveness of digital projects to the production phase. Dental laboratories are able to produce crowns, bridges, stone models, and various orthodontic appliances by methods that combine oral scanning, 3 D printing, and CAD/CAM design. Modern 3 D printing {{has been used for}} the development of prototypes for several years, and it has begun to find its use in the world of manufacturing. Digital technology and 3 D printing have significantly elevated the rate of success in dental implantology using custom surgical guides and improving the quality and accuracy of dental work...|$|R
