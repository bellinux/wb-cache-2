5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, {{and it was not}} uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, slaves were treated harshly and oppressively during the Roman republican period. Under Republican law, a slave was not {{considered}} a person, but property. Owners could abuse, injure or even kill their own slaves without legal consequence. While there were many grades and types of slaves, the lowest—and most numerous—grades who worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> mines were subject {{to a life of}} hard physical labor.|$|E
5|$|The Covent Garden {{estate was}} {{originally}} {{under the control}} of Westminster Abbey and lay in the parish of St Margaret. During a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to St Martin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fields,</b> <b>and</b> then in 1645 a new parish was created, splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of St Paul Covent Garden and St Martin, both still within the Liberty of Westminster. St Paul Covent Garden was completely surrounded by the parish of St Martin in the Fields. It was grouped into the Strand District in 1855 when it came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works.|$|E

5|$|The west {{part of the}} Strand was in {{the parish}} of St Martin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fields</b> <b>and</b> in the east it {{extended}} into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Strand. Most of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. The Strand was the northern boundary of the precinct of the Savoy, which was approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now. All of these parishes and places {{became part of the}} Strand District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately. The Strand District Board of Works was based at No. 22, Tavistock Street. Strand District was abolished in October 1900 and became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{inductance}} L is a symmetric matrix. The diagonal coefficients Lm,m {{are called}} coefficients of self-inductance, the off-diagonal elements are called coefficients of mutual inductance. The coefficients of inductance are constant, {{as long as}} no magnetizable material with nonlinear characteristics is involved. This is {{a direct consequence of}} the linearity of Maxwell's equations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> the current density. The coefficients of inductance become functions of the currents in the nonlinear case.|$|E

For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> family run businesses because they are motivated to contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community {{in order to help}} their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.|$|E
25|$|Researchers today doubt Las Casas' {{figures for}} the pre-contact levels of the Taíno population, {{considering}} them an exaggeration. For example, Anderson Córdova estimates a maximum of 500,000 people inhabiting the island. The Taíno population estimates vary a great deal, from {{a few hundred thousand}} up to 8,000,000. They had no resistance to Old World diseases, notably smallpox. The encomienda system brought many Taíno to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> mines in exchange for Spanish protection, education, and a seasonal salary. Under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials, many Spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the anaborios and Spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their land and wealth. It would take some time before the Taíno revolted against their oppressors — both Indian and Spanish alike — and many military campaigns before Emperor Charles V eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery.|$|E
25|$|The {{units of}} the 1st Arkansas were to proceed to Ft. Roots outside of Little Rock for {{mobilization}} when the companies had reached the minimum company strength of sixty-five men. The minimum strength was difficult to achieve because of new orders from the War Department mustering out guardsmen with families and those with previous orders. This released all men employed in government work. To counteract the men mustered out, companies were held at their home stations {{as long as possible}} to stimulate recruiting. It was known by guard officers that when a company leaves its home station the boys of the community lose interest in joining the guard the fear {{that they will not be}} assigned to their local company. Recruiting for the guard was greatly aided when Armour, one of the largest companies in Little Rock, gave the difference between salaries to its regular employees who had enlisted in the Arkansas National Guard before March 31, 1917, and were called into active service. Individuals also were exemplifying patriotism; one man upon learning the need of men for the guards left his work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> walked thirty miles to enlist.|$|E

500|$|The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailović at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. [...] "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," [...] he recounted, [...] "because the women were out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields,</b> <b>and</b> every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails.

500|$|At Brook Farm, {{women had}} the {{opportunity}} to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued. They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>and</b> men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time.

Women also {{played an important role in}} providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, [...] "elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.," [...] for sale at shops in Boston.
