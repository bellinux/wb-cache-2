50|$|While it {{is quite}} well known on campus, the Iron Ring Clock is not always {{recognized}} as a clock. The most common criticism of the clock {{is that it is}} counterintuitive to read. (It must be read straight on, with the number on the top ring denoting the hour and the number on the bottom ring denoting the minute. If there is no number directly under the <b>hour</b> <b>indicator,</b> the minute must be inferred from the nearest two numbers.) As the rings move slowly, the clock has been mistaken for a static display. It has shown the wrong time in the past, due to events such as power outages or breakdowns; in 2006/2007, the clock stopped for three months due to motor bearing failure. In 2007, an uninterruptible power supply was installed to eliminate the problem with power outages. However, in the absence of such events the motor and mechanism have shown themselves to be quite accurate.|$|E

Some centers reside in natural environments and uses the outdoors actively as a pedagogical approach, {{but there is a}} need for research that examine whether outdoors daycare is associated with children’s socio-emotional development. Objectives: The first aim was to examine whether the number of daily outdoor hours in Norwegian daycare centers are associated with exposure to natural contexts. The second aim was to investigate whether there was a dose-response relationship between daily outdoor hours and inattention/hyperactivity symptoms. The third aim was to look for long-term effects by investigating whether the number of outdoor hours was associated with 1) inattention/hyperactivity symptoms and 2) internalizing symptoms, after children have commenced elementary school. Method: A longitudinal design was employed, following 543 preschoolers in 28 representative daycare centers. Data was collected annually for four years. Each year, parents and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and provided information about family and daycare center characteristics. Results and conclusion: Correlation analyses showed moderate to high correlations between the number of outdoor <b>hours</b> and <b>indicators</b> of exposure to natural contexts. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that the number of outdoor hours was associated with low levels of inattention/hyperactivity in preschoolers. Difficult temperament and high levels of initial inattention/hyperactivity symptoms moderated a long-term association between high numbers of outdoor hours and low levels of internalizing symptoms. It was concluded that outdoor daycare might have noteworthy effects on children’s socio-emotional development...|$|R

Specifically, we use meta-analysis {{to examine the}} relationships between <b>hours</b> worked and <b>indicators</b> of organizational identity (e. g., organizational support and tenure), occupational identity (e. g., human capital investments and work centrality), and family identity (e. g., family responsibilities and family satisfaction). The meta-analysis also allowed us to explore other important correlates of hours worked (e. g., situational demands, job performance, mental health, and physical health), moderating variables (e. g., age, gender, and job complexity), and curvilinear relationships of work hours to social identity indicators. Overall, we found that occupational factors and situational demands had the strongest relationships with hours worked, hours worked were negatively associated with measures of employee well-being, gender had several significant moderating effects, and there were curvilinear relationships between hours worked and well-being and work-family conflict variables.

This suggests that future research should look at how success is affected when both student and instructor characteristics are considered simultaneously and the mediating effects therein.|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean storms usually show high {{intensity}} and irregularity of rainfall. A single torrential event can double, even triplicate, {{the average annual}} rainfall. These features, in turn, determine rainfall-runoff conversion and other hydrological processes. As a consequence flash-floods and hydrological behaviour of ephemeral streams are dominated by these extreme events. However the internal structure of storms varies according to the time scale at which data are collected. As the observation interval is reduced, intensity becomes more significant and emphasizes the concentrated character of the precipitation. Moreover, an equivalent amount of rainfall, registered at different time scales, can result in different rainfall spatial patterns, and it can help to indentify which factors are important at each time measurement scale. This paper analyzes the temporal and spatial variations of rainfall pattern, associated with different time scales in data collection. The study area involves the whole territory of the River Júcar Water Authority.

Rainfall data are collected, every five minutes, by the Automatic Hydrological Information System (SAIH), from 147 rain gauges, covering a 13 years continuous period (1994 - 2007). Precipitation data have been rescaling {{in order to obtain}} rainfall parameters every five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 <b>hours.</b> <b>Indicators</b> of cumulative rainfall, maximum intensity, irregularity, probability of rain and persistence of rain have been estimated for every time scale. From a time scale perspective, results show that there are two variables, “cumulative rainfall” and “probability of rain”, that follow a positive logarithmic trend, time-dependent. “Cumulative rainfall” shows a change of trend at 6 hours time scale, while the variable “probability of rain” changes its trend after 1 hour. Variables of "maximum intensity", "irregularity" and "persistence of rain" show negative trends, fitting power curves functions time-dependent. All of these variables show a change of trend after 1 hour. Regarding the spatial pattern of these variables qualitative analysis have been made. Result show changes in the factors influencing this pattern, depending on the length of the measurement time interval. Thus, for the variables of "cumulative rainfall" and "maximum intensity", increasing time interval implies a reduction of the area affected by the maximum values. Moreover, in the interval of 5 minutes the factor altitude is determinant, while for longer time intervals, factors as distance to the sea and the orographic structures exposure to wet dominant winds gain importance. The “irregularity” shows, for 5 minutes, the highest values in the plains near the sea, (exposed to wind of component E) and in the first line of relief or valleys opened to the sea (which acts as a trigger of instability). As the time interval increases, other factors, as distance to the sea, the effect of a second inland alignment of relieves, and the exposure to wet wind of component NE, become important. Concerning the "probability of rain" the interval of five minutes, shows the importance of exposure to wet winds of component NE plus the effect of the relief as a trigger. As the time interval increases, the presence of mountainous area in combination with wind of component W acquires prominence. The “persistence of rain” is related to the distance to the sea from the first mountainous alignments and to the exposure to winds of components NE and SE. As the time interval increases the persistence of higher values are reduced to the area exposed to winds of component NE in combination with the effect of the relief as a trigger.

Speed is the level of traffic movement or a particular vehicle is often expressed in kilometres/hour. There are two categories of average velocity. The first is the speed of the average time that is the average of the number of speed at certain locations. The second is the speed or the average speed of travel which includes travel and time constraints.

In this experiment, we evaluated the effect of silicon carbide whiskers (SiC) on alveolar macrophages mainly by unique magnetometry and also by established methods such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, apoptosis measurement and morphological observations. Alveolar macrophages obtained from Syrian golden hamsters by bronchoalveolar lavages were exposed in vitro to Fe 3 O 4 for 18 <b>hours</b> as an <b>indicator</b> for magnetometry and SiC for experiments. A rapid decrease of the remanent magnetic field, so called “relaxation”, was observed after cessation of an external magnetic field in macrophages phagocytizing Fe 3 O 4 alone, while relaxation was delayed in those concurrently exposed to SiC. Release of LDH from SiC-exposed macrophages into the medium was not significantly higher than the controls, but it increased dose-dependently. Apoptosis was recognized in macrophages exposed to 60 µg/ml of SiC by the DNA ladder detection method and morphological observations. Electron microscopic examination revealed irregular forms of nuclei and organellas in macrophages exposed to SiC.

40|$|Fossil {{resources}} will likely face future resource problems, {{and the use}} of such resources {{is one of the main}} drivers for global warming. Biological feedstock has been suggested as a potential alternative to fossil resources. Such feedstock can be used in biorefineries to produce fuels and materials. A desire to make biorefineries more flexible by making them mobile has been expressed by the European Union’s Commission of Research, which has initiated a research project called Mobile FLIP to develop mobile biorefinery concepts. A socio-economic assessment of implementing these mobile biorefineries is to be carried out within this project, and that is where this study aims at contributing. To identify socio-economic factors related to implementing mobile biorefineries, the method of content analysis was applied by analysing 25 reports and articles from both journals and newspapers. The texts were culled for arguments that associate or dissociate socio-economic factors to mobile biorefineries. A total of 104 arguments where identified and categorised into four primary arguments: (1) cost, (2) feedstock availability, (3) rural development and (4) forest fire. The identified arguments were both compared to two established frameworks for social assessment of products, and analysed by reviewing the existing literature and performing some screening calculations. Most of the identified factors could not be identified in the established frameworks for social assessment of products. This is likely due to in the context in which these were developed. Current product social assessment frameworks were developed in a developing country context, while mobile biorefineries are mainly discussed in a developed country context. All socio-economic factors identified in this study should be evaluated further to confirm their importance and impact. Some specific suggestions of relevant methods for further analysis are suggested. Life cycle costing (LCC) could be used for assessing the primary argument cost. A risk assessment should be performed to assess the potential risk of forest fires.

The secondary aim studied the relationship between controlling feeding practices and two proxy indicators of diet quality. Participants were 203 Australian-Indian mothers with children aged 1 – 5 years. Controlling feeding practices (pressure to eat, restriction, monitoring) and children 2 ̆ 7 s appetite traits (food approach traits: food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, desire to drink, emotional overeating; food avoidance traits: satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, fussiness and emotional undereating) were measured using self-reported, previously validated scales/questionnaires. Children 2 ̆ 7 s daily frequency of consumption of core and non-core foods was estimated using a 49 -item list of foods eaten (yes/no) in the previous 24 <b>hours</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of diet quality. Higher pressure to eat was associated with higher scores for satiety responsiveness, slowness in eating, fussiness and lower score for enjoyment of food. Higher restriction was related to higher scores for food responsiveness and emotional overeating. Higher monitoring was inversely associated with fussiness, slowness in eating, food responsiveness and emotional overeating and positively associated with enjoyment of food. Pressure to eat and monitoring were related to lower number of core and non-core foods consumed in the previous 24 hours, respectively. All associations remained significant after adjusting for maternal and child covariates (n[*]=[*] 152 due to missing data). In conclusion, pressure to eat was associated with higher food avoidance traits and lower consumption of core foods. Restrictive feeding practices were associated with higher food approach traits.

40|$|The main {{hypothesis}} of the dissertation is that "e-grocery with home delivery {{can be more}} efficient than supermarket retailing handling a similar volume of sales". The e-grocery business {{should be seen as}} an assembly industry producing shopping baskets. Only in this way can the new electronic channel work efficiently. The e-grocery business is usually seen as a supermarket copied into an electronic form; it is seen only as an opportunity to buy products. Instead, the starting point of operational design should be the real needs of a household and take into account the possibility of adding new services for the customers. One of the conclusions of this research is that the operational costs of a distribution centre can be lower than those of a supermarket. Store-based order picking is less expensive than using a specialised distribution centre when turnover is less than one million euros. A turnover of more than 3 million euros means that a dedicated distribution centre appears to be more efficient than store-based picking. However, the distribution centre has to be purpose-built for shopping basket assembly with a reasonably stable workload. A combination of store-based picking and a specialised distribution centre has been introduced as an opportunity to create gradual low-risk growth in the e-grocery business. It seems that efficient home delivery can be achieved even with a moderate market share. Unattended reception is very important for the overall cost structure of the supply chain and enable service models that give flexibility in route planning and optimisation. However, the investments that unattended reception requires should also be taken into account. The cost efficiency of a home delivery service model can be described by the average mileage driven per order, which directly correlates with the number of stops per <b>hour.</b> New efficiency <b>indicators</b> are needed to measure the efficiency of the e-grocery business.
