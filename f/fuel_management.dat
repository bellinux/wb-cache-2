5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent <b>fuel</b> <b>management,</b> and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|A coupe version {{based on}} the Holden Monaro was also sold in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. In Arabia, the Lumina was offered in four {{different}} trims: LS (Omega), LTZ (Berlina), S (SV6) and SS (SS). The LTZ and S comes standard with a 3.6L Alloytec V6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission for the S and 4-speed for the LTZ, while the SS comes standard with 6.0L Alloytec V8 with the option of Active <b>Fuel</b> <b>management.</b> A 6-speed manual is standard with the option of a 6-speed Automatic on SS. The LTZ was the luxury model, while the S and SS models focused on sportiness. Exports to the Middle East ceased in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The full Holden VE {{range was}} {{exported}} {{and sold to}} New Zealand, whereas in the Middle East and South Africa it was re-branded as the Chevrolet Lumina. Sales of the Berlina began in 2007 for Brazilian market as the Chevrolet Omega. Pontiac in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8. The G8's cessation was a consequence of GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy resulting in {{the demise of the}} Pontiac brand. Unlike the Chevrolet Lumina and Omega, the Pontiac received several unique features including a revised L76 engine with Active <b>Fuel</b> <b>Management</b> as opposed to the Commodore's L98, and appearance changes.|$|E
30|$|<b>Fuels</b> <b>management</b> {{objectives}} often prioritize {{fire hazard}} reduction, and our {{data do not}} address achievement of this goal. Our results do suggest, however, that fuels treatments, as currently implemented in southwest Oregon interior valley chaparral, are unlikely to accomplish restoration goals. Because high fuels and fire severity appear to have been, and continue to be, typical of chaparral, <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> objectives to mitigate fire hazard and restore characteristic structures and processes may be incompatible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the effect wildfire mitigation has on broad-scale wildfire behavior. Each year, hundreds of million {{of dollars are}} spent on fire suppression and <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> applications, yet little is known, quantitatively, of the returns to these programs {{in terms of their}} impact on wildfire extent and intensity. This is especially true when considering that wildfire management influences and reacts to several, often times confounding factors, including socioeconomic characteristics, values at risk, heterogeneous landscapes, and climate. Due to the endogenous nature of suppression effort and <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> intensity and placement with wildfire behavior, traditional regression models may prove inadequate. Instead, I examine the applicability of propensity score matching (PSM) techniques in modeling wildfire. This research makes several significant contributions including: (1) applying techniques developed in labor economics and in epidemiology to evaluate the effects of natural resource policies on landscapes, rather than on individuals; (2) providing {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between wildfire mitigation strategies and their influence on broad-scale wildfire patterns; (3) quantifying the returns to suppression and <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> on wildfire behavior...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Despite {{the belief}} that <b>fuels</b> <b>management,</b> a form of {{prescribed}} fire that reduces accumulated fuels in commercially thinned forests, is necessary to restore forest 'health' in the Pacific Northwest, its effects on wildlife has received little attention in the scientific literature. Because <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> is supported, funded, and implemented nationwide under the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy, {{it is imperative to}} understand how these management activities affect wildlife. In this field experiment, I used mark-recapture methods to examine community, population, and individual responses of small mammals one year following three fuels-management treatments (lop and scatter, pile, and pile/bum) in three commercially thinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest stands within the Applegate Adaptive Management Area of southwest Oregon. Fifteen species were captured during two years of study, and I found that fuels treatments did not appear to affect species richness or evenness, nor did they affect population densities and survival of the two most abundant species, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and western red-backed vole (Clethrionomys californicus). In study plots where fuels provided variable distributions and amounts of cover, only deer mice used piled fuels significantly more than available while randomly using fuels that were lopped and scattered. Deer mouse numbers decreased and their home ranges increased with increasing distance from piled fuels. Thus, it appears that although these three fuels treatments do not affect the population density of deer mice in my study area, piled fuels do affect the distribution and home range size of individuals within these populations, leading to a shift in their local distribution. I hypothesize that environmental conditions created by the open canopy following thinning in this study may have led to poor-quality forest-floor habitat for small mammals, which could have dampened small mammal community- and population-level responses one year following fuels treatments. I recommend that future studies of wildlife responses to <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> in the Pacific Northwest consider interactions between commercial thinning, <b>fuels</b> <b>management,</b> and regional climate conditions...|$|R
50|$|The 2009 QFR also {{outlines}} {{an integrated}} <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> {{plan that would}} help ensure that fuels treatment investments are tied more closely to land stewardship objectives. It also suggests that small-scale fuels treatments (prescribed burning, mechanical removal of brush, thinning, chemical treatments, and so forth) are not as effective as larger, landscape-scale treatments in terms of ecosystem health.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil tanks through overflow vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with <b>fuel</b> <b>management</b> practices onboard Aiviq.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the four}} EPRs under {{construction}} (in Finland and France) are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost. Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent <b>fuel</b> <b>management</b> and elevated design basis threats. While first of their kind designs, such as the EPRs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget, of the seven South Korean APR-1400s presently under construction worldwide, two are in S.Korea at the Hanul Nuclear Power Plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project {{in the world as}} of 2016, in the United Arab Emirates at the planned Barakah nuclear power plant.

25|$|The record-breaking XB-42 {{prototype}} {{had been}} destroyed in a crash at Bolling Field. The second of two prototypes of the Douglas XB-42, 43-50225, on a routine flight out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., suffered in short order, a landing gear extension problem, failure of the port engine, and as coolant temperatures rose, failure of the starboard engine. Maj. Hayduck bailed out at 1,200 feet, Lt. Col. Haney at 800 feet, and pilot Lt. Col. (later Major General) Fred J. Ascani, after crawling aft to jettison the pusher propellers, at 400 feet – all three survived. The aircraft crashed at Oxen Hill, Maryland. Classified jettisonable propeller technology caused a problem for authorities in explaining what witnesses on the ground thought was the aircraft exploding. Possible <b>fuel</b> <b>management</b> problems were speculated, but this hypothesis was never proven by subsequent investigation. The remaining prototype was used in flight test programs, including fulfilling a December 1943 proposal by Douglas to fit uprated engines and underwing Westinghouse 19XB-2A axial-flow turbojets of 1,600lbf (7.1kN) thrust each, making it the XB-42A.|$|E

In this study, we examine the relationship between place meanings and views on fire and <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> through in-depth interviews and computer-based mapping with forest landowners. While landowners readily described and mapped special places, these places did not influence views on fire and <b>fuels</b> <b>management,</b> views that were situated almost entirely at larger scales and explained by broader worldviews and political ideologies.

The main hypothesis is that simulated wildfire effects during a severe fire season may be mitigated by scheduling activities in a pattern across the landscape. Results suggest: (1) operational management prescriptions, designed to promote the development of forest structure within a desired range of stand density, were not appropriate for mitigating wildfire effects, and (2) increased harvest levels obscure spatial patterns of activity, making patterns less clear as harvests increase.

25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{relevant}} aspect of energy modeling, i. e. fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>management.</b> The issue is faced by using purely operational research techniques, which are suitable in this context. In particular, a dynamic stochastic optimization model is developed to optimally determine use and stock of resources to be employed in consumption and investments, in a wide economic sense: human and physical capital, R&D, etc. It is assumed that a sustainability criterion drives the optimality rules, i. e. decisions are also grounded on the well-being of future generations.

500|$|Holden, {{concerned}} {{about the risks of}} introducing a new platform and drivetrain at the same time, introduced the Australian-built Alloytec V6 engine in the proven VZ model. This allowed time to address any issues or faults before fitting it to the VE. The original base V6 benefited from power increases over the VZ, with engine noise reduced by using new timing chains among other modifications. An updated version of the long-serving four-speed GM 4L60-E automatic transmission remained for this engine. Manual transmission options are the Aisin AY6 and Tremec T-56 six-speeders. Two automatics featuring Active Select; the five-speed GM 5L40-E and six-speed GM 6L80-E were also offered. The latter was reserved exclusively for a modified L76 V8 engine, giving an extra [...] of power compared to the VZ. This new engine designated L98 does not readily support fuel-saving Active <b>Fuel</b> <b>Management</b> technology, unlike the L76.|$|E
500|$|The {{final chapter}} of the third {{generation}} series was the VZ Commodore. Debuting in 2004 with {{a new series of}} V6 engines known as the Alloytec V6, both [...] and [...] versions of the 3.6-litre engine were offered. These were later upgraded to 180 and 195kilowatts (241 and 261hp) respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous Ecotec engines, the Alloytec benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed 5L40E automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed Aisin AY6 manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement. A new 6.0-litre Generation 4 V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards. Compared to the American version, both Active <b>Fuel</b> <b>Management</b> and variable valve timing were removed. The Alloytec V6 was also affected by the new standards, which saw the peak output reduced to 172kilowatts (231hp).|$|E

40|$|AbstractLittle {{research}} has focused on the economic impact associated with climate-change induced wildland fire on natural ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. We examine changes in wildland fire patterns based on the U. S.

We construct a habitat equivalency model under which <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> activities, actions commonly undertaken to reduce the frequency and/or severity of wildland fire, are used to compensate for climate change-induced losses in ecosystem services on conservation lands in the contiguous U. S. resulting from wildland fire. The benefit of the greenhouse gas mitigation policy is equal to the difference in <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> costs between the reference and policy scenarios. Results suggest present value ecosystem service benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation on the average of $ 3. 5 billion (2005 dollars, assuming a three percent discount rate).

30|$|A {{century of}} fire {{suppression}} has altered {{the role of}} fire in maintaining historic structure, composition, and ecological processes in many semi-arid ecosystems (e.g., western dry coniferous forests; Agee 1991, Taylor and Skinner 1998). Fire suppression may also contribute to fuels buildup and uncharacteristically intense wildfires that damage property and natural resources (Hessburg et al. 2005). Mitigating fire hazard to property and restoring ecosystems degraded by lack of fire have become central objectives of national fire policy in the US (Healthy Forest Restoration Act 2003). <b>Fuels</b> <b>management</b> can achieve both objectives in some ecosystem and fire regime types, but goals to reduce fire hazard are not compatible with restoration in many ecosystems. Where historic structures and fire regimes of ecosystems targeted for <b>fuels</b> <b>management</b> are poorly understood, the need for and design of fuels treatment are often extrapolated from better studied ecosystems (Keeley and Fotheringham 2001). Misguided application of ecologically incompatible treatments, however, can contribute to ecosystem degradation and failure to achieve management objectives (Hosten et al. 2006, Keeley 2007).|$|R
