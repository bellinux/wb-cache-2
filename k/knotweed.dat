5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese <b>knotweed</b> has {{preserved}} heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInvasive {{species are}} often managed with the {{objective}} of population control or eradication. Here we tested whether clipping techniques influenced the aboveground and belowground structures of 2 closely related invasive taxa: Fallopia japonica and Fallopia x bohemica. We compared the aboveground response (plant height, number of stems, and number of leaves) of rhizome fragments to clipping of both taxa. The second experiment was aimed at comparing the belowground response of both taxa to the same clipping disturbance. Rhizome fragments were planted in rhizoboxes and subjected to a clipping disturbance after 4 weeks of growth. Regrowth, belowground biomass, specific root length, total root length, and distribution of roots in 3 soil layers were measured. Aboveground plant traits of both taxa were unaffected by clipping. On the other hand, clipping induced a reduction in belowground dry mass and an increased proportion of roots in the upper layer of soil in F. japonica. Both taxa of Asian <b>knotweeds</b> are highly tolerant to clipping because they are able to cope with aerial biomass loss. Nevertheless, this tolerance seems to be lower in F. japonica. The potential implications for the impact of these invasive species are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Japanese <b>knotweeds</b> {{are among}} the most {{invasive}} organisms in the world. Their recent expansion into salt marsh habitat provides a unique opportunity to investigate how invasives establish in new environments. We used morphology, cytology, and AFLP genotyping to identify taxa and clonal diversity in roadside and salt marsh populations. We conducted a greenhouse study to determine the ability to tolerate salt and whether salt marsh populations are more salt tolerant than roadside populations as measured by the efficiency of PSII, leaf area, succulence, height, root-to-shoot ratio, and total biomass. Clonal diversity was extremely low with one F. japonica clone and five F. ×bohemica genotypes. The two taxa were significantly different in several traits, but did not vary in biomass or plasticity of any trait. All traits were highly plastic in response to salinity, but differed significantly among genets. Despite this variation, plants from the salt marsh habitats did not perform better in the salt treatment, suggesting that they are not better adapted to tolerate salt. Instead, our data support the hypothesis that plasticity in salt tolerance traits may allow these taxa to live in saline habitats without specific adaptation to tolerate salt. Read More: [URL]...|$|R
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including tulip poplar trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese <b>knotweed,</b> Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells are {{a species}} of {{deciduous}} woodland over much of their range, flowering and leafing early before the canopy closes in late spring. They may also be found growing under bracken or Japanese <b>knotweed,</b> perennial plants which also form stands with a dense summer canopy. They are most successful on slightly acid soils; the same niche in alkaline conditions may be occupied by other species such as Mercurialis perennis. As a species adapted to woodlands, the young shoots are able to penetrate through {{a thick layer of}} leaf litter, and bluebells are often used as an indicator species to identify ancient woodland. Bluebells are also frequently found in hedgerows, and in the west of their range they can be found growing in open habitats, including coastal meadows. Bluebell flowers are rich in pollen and nectar, and are chiefly pollinated by bumblebees, although they are also visited by various other insects. They are a host species for the parasitic fungus Uromyces muscari, which causes bluebell rust. The ability of H.non-scripta to take up phosphorus from the soil is greatly enhanced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in its roots.|$|E
25|$|Identification of Japanese <b>knotweed</b> is {{not always}} easy. Many other plants are {{suspected}} of being <b>knotweed,</b> due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems.

40|$|International audienceBig Asian <b>knotweeds</b> (Fallopia spp.) {{are among}} the most {{invasive}} plant species in north-western Europe. We suggest that their success is partially explained by biological and chemical niche construction. In this paper, we explored the microbial mechanisms by which the plant modifies the nitrogen cycle. We found that Fallopia spp. decreased potential denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) by reducing soil moisture and reducing denitrifying bacteria density in the soil. The plant also reduced potential ammonia and nitrite oxydizing bacteria enzyme activities (respectively, AOEA and NOEA) in sites with high AOEA and NOEA in uninvaded situation. Modification of AOEA and NOEA were not correlated to modifications of the density of implicated bacteria. AOB and Nitrobacter-like NOB community genetic structures were significantly different in respectively two and three of the four tested sites while the genetic structure of denitrifying bacteria was not affected by invasion in none of the tested sites. Modification of nitrification and denitrification functioning in invaded soils could lead to reduced nitrogen loss from the ecosystem through nitrate leaching or volatilization of nitrous oxides and dinitrogen and could be considered as a niche construction mechanism of Fallopia...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} alien <b>knotweeds,</b> Fallopia spp. (Polygonaceae), {{are some}} of the most troublesome invasive species in Europe and North America. Invasive success in Fallopia may be enhanced by multiple hybridization events. We examined the pattern of hybridization and its evolutionary consequences in Belgium with a concerted analysis of ploidy levels (chromosome counts and flow cytometry), morphological variation, and genetic variation (RAPDs). At least four taxa with different ploidy levels were part of the pattern of invasion in Belgium. Hybrid F. 3 bohemica with various chromosome numbers restored the genotypic diversity that was lacking in the parental species. Hybrid genotypes were mainly assigned to a specific genetic pool and not to a mixture between the genetic pools of the putative parental species as would be expected for hybrids. Parental species and hexaploid hybrids differed significantly for a set of well-defined morphological characters, enabling future researchers to distinguish these taxa. On the basis of our results, the importance of hybridization has probably been underestimated in large parts of the adventive range of alien Fallopia species, pointing to the need for concerted molecular and morphological analyses in the study of the evolutionary consequences of hybridization.

40|$|Studies {{of plant}} invasions rarely address impacts on molluscs. By {{comparing}} pairs of invaded and corresponding uninvaded plots in 96 sites in floodplain forests, we examined effects of four invasive alien plants (Impatiens glandulifera, Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis, and F. × bohemica) in the Czech Republic on communities of land snails. The richness and abundance of living land snail species were recorded separately for all species, rare species {{listed on the}} national Red List, and small species with shell size below 5 mm. The significant impacts ranged from 16 - 48 % reduction in snail species numbers, and 29 - 90 % reduction in abundance. Small species were especially prone to reduction in species richness by all four invasive plant taxa. Rare snails were also negatively impacted by all plant invaders, {{both in terms of}} species richness or abundance. Overall, the impacts on snails were invader-specific, differing among plant taxa. The strong effect of I. glandulifera could be related to the post-invasion decrease in abundance of tall nitrophilous native plant species that are a nutrient-rich food source for snails in riparian habitats. Fallopia sachalinensis had the strongest negative impact of the three <b>knotweeds,</b> which reflects differences in their canopy structure, microhabitat humidity and litter decomposition. The ranking of Fallopia taxa according to the strength of impacts on snail communities differs from ranking by their invasiveness, known from previous studies. This indicates that invasiveness does not simply translate to impacts of invasion and needs to be borne in mind by conservation and management authorities...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the extent of metal accumulation in some aquatic macrophytes from contaminated urban streams in southeast Queensland, plants were sampled from six sites, along with contiguous sediments. In all, 15 different species were collected, the most common genera being Typha (Cattails or Bulrushes) and Persicaria (<b>Knotweeds).</b> Before heavy metal analysis, plants were further separated into various morphological tissues, and five selected samples were separated into various physiological tissues. The cadmium, copper, lead and zinc content of the plants were analysed using flames AAS. In general, plant roots exhibited higher metal concentrations than the contiguous sediments. Of the metals of interest, only for zinc was there a relatively clear pattern of increasing accumulation in aquatic macrophytes with increasing sediment metal concentrations. Comparison between morphological tissues of the sampled plants found that roots consistently presented higher metal concentrations than either the stems or leaves, however unlike previous studies, this investigation revealed no consistent trend of stems accumulating more metals than the leaves. For Typha spp., metal concentrations followed the order of roots > rhizomes > leaves, while for Persicaria spp. the order was roots > leaves > stems. The submerged species Myriophyllum aquaticum accumulated the highest levels of metals overall (e. g. Zn 4300 姠g- 1 dry weight and Cd 6. 5 姠g- 1), and the emergent macrophytes also exhibited relatively high metal contents in their roots. The leaves of the submerged and floating-leafed species collected contained relatively high quantities of the four metals of interest, compared with the leaves of emergent aquatic macrophytes. In the Typha rhizome and Persicaria stem samples analysed for internal variation in metal content, there was a pattern of increasing metal concentrations towards the external sections of the stem, both for subterranean stems (rhizomes) and above-substrate stems. For Persicaria stems, no clear pattern was observed for cadmium and lead, the two metals investigated that are not required by plants for survival. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} {{invasive}} plants makes their management increasingly difficult. Remote sensing offers {{a means of}} fast and efficient monitoring, but still the optimal methodologies remain to be defined. The seasonal dynamics and spectral characteristics of the target invasive species are important factors, since, at certain time of the vegetation season (e. g., at flowering or senescing), plants are often more distinct (or more visible beneath the canopy). Our aim was to establish fast, repeatable and a cost-efficient, computer-assisted method applicable over larger areas, to reduce the costs of extensive field campaigns. To achieve this goal, we examined how the timing of monitoring affects the detection of noxious plant invaders in Central Europe, using two model herbaceous species with markedly different phenological, structural, and spectral characteristics. They are giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), a species with very distinct flowering phase, and the less distinct <b>knotweeds</b> (Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis, and their hybrid F. × bohemica). The variety of data generated, such as imagery from purposely-designed, unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV), and VHR satellite, and aerial color orthophotos enabled us to assess the effects of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution (i. e., the target species' phenological state) for successful recognition. The demands for both spatial and spectral resolution depended largely on the target plant species. In the case that a species was sampled at the most distinct phenological phase, high accuracy was achieved even with lower spectral resolution of our low-cost UAV. This demonstrates that proper timing can to some extent compensate for the lower spectral resolution. The results of our study {{could serve as a}} basis for identifying priorities for management, targeted at localities with the greatest risk of invasive species' spread and, once eradicated, to monitor over time any return. The best mapping strategy should reflect morphological and structural features of the target plant and choose appropriate spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The UAV enables flexible data acquisition for required time periods at low cost and is, therefore, well-suited for targeted monitoring; while satellite imagery provides the best solution for larger areas. Nonetheless, users must be aware of their limits. Článek shrnuje přístupy pro klasifikaci rostlinných invazí na základě dat vzdáleného průzkumu Země.
