5000|$|In {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing, <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> {{frames are}} typically 3D. <b>Datum</b> <b>reference</b> frames {{are used as}} part of the feature control frame to show where the measurement is taken from. A typical <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> frame is made up of three planes. For example, the three planes could be one [...] "face side" [...] and two [...] "datum edges". These three planes are marked A, B and C, where A is the face side, B is the first datum edge, and C is the second datum edge. In this case, the <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> frame is A/B/C. A/B/C is shown at the end of feature control frame to show from where the measurement is taken. (See the ASME standard Y14.5M-2009 for more examples and material modifiers.) ...|$|E

5000|$|In carpentry, an alternative, {{more common}} name is [...] "face side" [...] and [...] "face edge". The artisan nominates two {{straight}} edges on a workpiece as the [...] "datum edges", {{and they are}} marked accordingly. One convention is to mark the first datum edge with a single slanted line (/) and the second with double lines (//). For most work, the <b>datum</b> <b>references</b> of the workpiece need to be square. If necessary they may be cut, planed or filed to make them so. In subsequent marking out, all measurements are then taken from {{either of the two}} <b>datum</b> <b>references.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Reference</b> Datum:The <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is a <b>reference</b> {{plane that}} allows accurate, and uniform, {{measurements}} to any {{point on the}} aircraft. The location of the <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual. The horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, {{and it may be}} located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the horizontal <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> 100 inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is usually located {{at the center of the}} helicopter.|$|R
50|$|A <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> is a {{known and}} {{constant}} surface {{which is used}} to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since <b>reference</b> <b>datums</b> can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed <b>reference</b> <b>datums</b> around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local <b>reference</b> point. Contemporary <b>datums,</b> based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common <b>reference</b> <b>Datums</b> in use in North America are NAD27, NAD83, and WGS 84.|$|R

The <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust that are established based on three different principles are analyzed and compared, viz. taking SLR vertical velocity fields as <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust; taking vertical velocity predicted by postglacial rebound ICE- 4 G geophysical model as reference datum; taking the vertical velocity constrained as zero which located nearby the low latitude belts of equator (− 10 °∼ 10 °) as <b>reference</b> <b>datum.</b> The result shows that there is a better consistency of those three methods in whole, and the <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> of vertical motion of the crust based on SLR vertical velocity has advantages like clear geophysical sense, easy implementation and application...|$|R

5000|$|In firearms, {{headspace}} is {{the distance}} measured from {{the part of}} the chamber that stops forward motion of the cartridge (the <b>datum</b> <b>reference)</b> to the face of the bolt. Used as a verb, headspace refers to the interference created between this part of the chamber and the feature of the cartridge that achieves the correct positioning. Different cartridges have their datum lines in different positions in relation to the cartridge. [...] For example, 5.56 NATO ammunition headspaces off the shoulder of the cartridge, whereas [...]303 British headspaces off the forward rim of the cartridge.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, an {{aircraft}} {{is designed to}} operate within a specified range of weight and (chiefly longitudinal) balance; an airman is responsible for determining these factors for each flight under his or her command.

5000|$|According to the ASME Y14.5-2009 [...] standard, {{the purpose}} of {{geometric}} dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) is to describe the engineering intent of parts and assemblies. The <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> frame can describe how the part fits or functions. GD&T can more accurately define the dimensional requirements for a part, allowing over 50% more tolerance zone than coordinate (or linear) dimensioning in some cases. Proper application of GD&T will ensure that the part defined on the drawing has the desired form, fit (within limits) and function with the largest possible tolerances. GD&T can add quality and reduce cost {{at the same time}} through producibility.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, without {{destructive}} testing, full metrology {{has only}} been performed on the exterior dimensions of components. If a highly detailed component requires inspection, the conventional method of inspection would be to fixture the part to create specified <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> plane and go through a timely CMM touch-probe inspection process or use a vision system to map exterior surfaces. Past internal inspection methods would require using a 2D X-ray of the component {{or the use of}} destructive testing. Industrial CT scanning allows for full metrology of the CT datasets allowing for an analysis of GD&T points to meet the PPAP requirement.|$|E

A precondition for such a comparison is that the shoulder angles are identical, since otherwise shifts will occur, which are not recognizable at first glance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{electronic}} or pneumatic multi-section and multi-probe gauges {{are widely}} used for diameter and coaxiality measurements due to their high measurement efficiency in workshops. However, their measurement accuracy is determined mainly by the manufacturing errors of the assembly coaxiality master, therefore, how to establish coaxiality measurement <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> is the key technology. The physical coaxiality masters {{are expected to be}} the impossible "zero error datum reference". The higher manufacturing accuracy of the masters, the more expensive for their manufacturing costs. A novel mathematical method on the basis of error separation principle was proposed in order to separate the manufacturing errors of the master. The basic principle is that the eccentric error of the coaxiality master can be expressed as the first harmonic function and the ideal zero-error <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> could be established by the mathematical method of two sampling operations in phase difference of 180 ° in coaxiality master for gauge initialization. This method can be called as "mathematical <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> " for coaxiality measurement. Experimental results indicate that the coaxiality measurement results of the multi-section and multi-probe gauge by the novel mathematical method coincide with those of the three-coordinate measuring machine and the maximum difference of both is about 0. 0014 mm. The new coaxiality measurement principle can separate the datum error of the coaxiality master theoretically and can improve the coaxiality measurement accuracy greatly with the common accuracy coaxiality master...|$|E

The <b>reference</b> <b>datum</b> also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} cost optimum conversion of functional tolerances into machining tolerances transferred {{to one or more}} <b>datum</b> <b>reference</b> frames. A new concept - that of the Tolerance Element - is introduced as a machining process-related geometric entity with attributes associated with the accuracy cost. The accuracy-getting capabilities and cost per Tolerance Element are recorded for a particular machine shop through an appropriately designed database feedback form. The Tolerance Elements methodology, once adapted for this machine shop through processing information of the database feedback form, automatically creates application-focused cost-tolerance functions. The latter, in conjunction with the tolerance transfer principle and the machining axes accuracies, are used for the formulation of the problem objective function for cost optimum tolerancing. The system database needs expert updating only when changes occur in the machine shop facilities and/or expertise. The proposed method is demonstrated and discussed by means of an application example...|$|E
