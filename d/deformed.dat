40|$|Background: Buccal <b>deforming</b> {{habits are}} caused by many factors, which make more {{important}} the implementation of strategies aimed at reducing their incidence. Objective: To prove the effectiveness of an intervention strategy in children with <b>deforming</b> buccal habits. Methods: An interventional, after-and-before, cuasi-experimental study was developed including 133 children between 5 and 11 years from Abreus municipality. The research was developed in three different periods: diagnosis, interventions and evaluation. The analyzed variables were: <b>deforming</b> buccal habits knowledge including its consequences, age, sex, kind of <b>deforming</b> habit and dental maxillofacial defect. Results: Knowledge about <b>deforming</b> habits increased in children, parents and teachers and 66, 5 % of the <b>deforming</b> habits were eradicated, reducing dental maxillofacial defects. Conclusions: The intervention was effective since we could elevate knowledge level on <b>deforming</b> habits and their impact and we could reduce them in a significant percent...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Although <b>deforming</b> arthropathy in {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) is characterised {{by a number of}} manifestations, definitive criteria for the different forms have not yet been established. To define <b>deforming</b> arthropathy and its different types a study was undertaken of 176  SLE patients.  METHODS—Using as criterion any deviation from any of the metacarpus finger axes 17  patients (16  women, one man) were identified with clinical <b>deforming</b> arthropathy. These patients were evaluated according to a standardised protocol that covered all known characteristics of <b>deforming</b> arthropathy. By means of "Jaccoud's arthropathy index" three different forms were identified.  RESULTS—Three patients had an erosive form of <b>deforming</b> arthropathy (or rhupus hand) such as those seen in frank rheumatoid arthritis (RA), eight patients were identified as having Jaccoud's arthropathy (or lupus hand), and the remaining six patients had mild <b>deforming</b> arthropathy. Jaccoud's arthropathy is characterised by severe deformation of the hands (ulnar deviation, swan neck deformities, and Z deformity of the thumb) and feet with multiple non-erosive subluxations, mild aching and little or no evidence of synovitis. All patients, but one, fulfilled just four criteria of the ACR classification and joint symptoms were always found to precede the diagnosis of SLE. Furthermore a remarkable association of Jaccoud's arthropathy with fetal loss, thrombosis—both venous and arterial—and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies was found.  CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest that Jaccoud's arthropathy represents a subset of SLE. Subdivision of <b>deforming</b> arthropathy into several clinical forms can facilitate the clinical management of this disorder.    Keywords: <b>deforming</b> arthropathy; lupus hand; rhupus hand; antiphospholipid syndrom...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes a {{fresh look}} at the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) from the per-spective of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element methods for solving 3 -D {{incompressible}} viscous flows problems on <b>deforming</b> domain. GCL compliance is tradition-ally interpreted as a consistency criterion for applying an unsteady flow solution algorithm to simulate exactly a uniform flow on a <b>deforming</b> domain. We introduce an additional requirement: the time integrator must maintain its fixed mesh accuracy when applied to <b>deforming</b> meshes. We show how a fixed mesh unsteady FEM using high order time inte-grator (up to fifth order in time) can be transposed to solve problems on <b>deforming</b> meshes and preserve its fixed mesh high order temporal accuracy. An appropriate construction of the divergence of the mesh velocity guarantees GCL compliance while a separate con-struction of the mesh velocity itself allows the time-integrator to deliver its fixed mesh high order temporal accuracy on <b>deforming</b> domains. Analytical error analysis of problems with closed form solutions provides insight on the behavior of the time integrators. We present thorough time-step and grid refinement studies for simple problems with closed form solu-tions and for a manufactured solution with a non-trivial flow on a <b>deforming</b> mesh. In all cases studied, the proposed reconstructions of the mesh velocity and its divergence lead to optimal time accuracy on <b>deforming</b> grids. I...|$|R
