25|$|The {{silver and}} gold {{manufactured}} in the city during the 19th century and early 20th century was of exceptionally high quality, with its own hallmark. These products are now considered collectibles. In the 19th century, other products such as chains were manufactured. Some chains were produced to be purely ornamental and to be attached to watches. However, some larger chains were manufactured for industrial uses. These chains sometimes contained silver, and rarely gold. Gold chains would sell, on average, for £250,000. The first silver <b>guard</b> <b>chain</b> made in Birmingham was made in 1806. At around the mid-19th century, between 1,500 and 1,600 people were manufactured in the chain-making industry, 500 of which were women.|$|E

Sometimes the badge is partnered with a <b>guard</b> <b>chain</b> {{accompanied}} by the chapter's lettering (for example, the Kappa Omicron chapter of Phi Mu would have a ΚΟ assisting).|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the SRF-39, the SRF-39FP, has a {{transparent}} case, designed to thwart contraband concealment. The radio often appears on the commissary lists of U.S. federal prisons, hence the [...] "FP" [...] suffix. Both are popular in the DXing community partly for their generous recessed area for the tuning thumbwheel, 0-10 log strip, and <b>guard</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Theta Tau Outstanding Student Member Program {{was inaugurated}} {{to provide the}} {{mechanism}} by which each chapter could designate its outstanding student member for recognition by the national fraternity. The criterion for selection is service to the fraternity (at any level) during the previous calendar year. The national fraternity provides an engrossed certificate and an award dangle which the recipient displays on his badge's <b>guard</b> <b>chain.</b> One of these each year is selected as the fraternity's Outstanding Student Member with the announcement made at the national meeting. The national honoree is presented with a special certificate and with a jeweled dangle. The award was first presented in 1991 for service to the fraternity during the calendar year 1990.|$|E
50|$|Each {{branch of}} the {{military}} of the United States maintains its own police force. The U.S. Coast Guard, which in itself is a law enforcement agency, uses a mixture of enlisted rates and ranks qualified as law enforcement officers to patrol, investigate crimes, and enforce laws and regulations on large bases and training centers through the Coast Guard Police Department. The Coast Guard also uses the Coast Guard Investigative Service, a mixture of civilian, enlisted, reservists, and officers who are qualified and duly sworn federal law enforcement officers separate from the normal Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>chain</b> of command. CGIS primarily investigates and charges those in its own population with serious crimes, such as rape, assault or forgery, that fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} Virginian {{actually}} served {{in both the}} Confederate and Union armies. At {{the beginning of the}} war, a Confederate soldier from Fairfax County approached the Union soldiers <b>guarding</b> <b>Chain</b> Bridge in his Confederate uniform. Asked what he was doing trying to cross the bridge, he responded that he was travelling to Washington, D.C. to see his uncle. The perplexed Union soldiers asked who his uncle was and the soldier replied his name is Uncle Sam. He was quickly enlisted as a Union scout due to his knowledge of the local terrain.|$|R
25|$|Some chainrings can be {{outfitted}} with a <b>chain</b> <b>guard</b> — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the chainring. Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. <b>Chain</b> <b>guard</b> is usually mounted on the outboard side of the chainring or, in case of multi-sprocket chainring, on the outboard side of the largest chainring. Single-sprocket chainrings may have <b>chain</b> <b>guards</b> on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on multi-speed juvenile bicycles.|$|R

2500|$|In 1950 the Miltonberger Board, {{which was}} formed to review the National Guard Bureau’s {{structure}} and policies, largely validated Cramer’s view by recommending that the National Guard Bureau remain in the Air National <b>Guard’s</b> <b>chain</b> of authority, with the NGB Chief exercising responsibility for both the Army and Air National Guards. [...] The board also recommended {{the creation of a}} Deputy Chief of the National Guard Bureau position, to be filled by a Major General of the opposite service from the Chief, who could provide advice and subject matter expertise to the Chief.

50|$|Russian forces {{first had}} to take a pair of watchtowers <b>guarding</b> heavy <b>chains</b> restricting Russian {{movements}} on the water, during which a successful sortie was launched by the Turks that captured many of the Russian siege engines. The Russians accepted the losses and laid down a steady bombardment onto the fort. However, the fort was constantly receiving supplies by water, and the attrition was hurting Peter's forces more than the Turks. After three months, Peter was forced to withdraw.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new models}} were the XL-350, XL-500 and TT-500. All of these newer models {{featured}} {{front and rear}} disc brakes, headlight/taillights, chrome <b>chain</b> <b>guards</b> and automatic clutches with jackshafts. [...] Also new to these bikes were external spring shocks, front and rear, and noncontinuous forks and handlebars. The TT-500 was {{the top of the}} line newer model and featured a different <b>chain</b> <b>guard</b> as well as a two speed jackshaft. The XL-350 and XL-500 were identical, both featuring a single speed jackshaft, {{with the exception of the}} engine size—3 1/2 and 5 HP, respectively. Rupp also offered accessories for the bikes at an extra charge, including a front bicycle basket, windshield and crash bar.|$|R
25|$|Although Military Road did not close, Congress passed {{legislation}} allowing {{traffic on the}} highway to be stopped. On January 31, 1936, Representative John D. Dingell, Sr. warned Washington-Hoover Airport that Military Road posed a serious flying hazard. On February 14, airport officials (faced with legal action from Arlington County for obstructing traffic), stopped attempting to close the road using traffic <b>guards,</b> <b>chains,</b> or lights, leading the Department of Commerce to announce it would close the airport if traffic were not stopped. Two days later, the United States Post Office Department declared it would suspend airmail operations at Washington-Hoover unless the road were closed, leading both houses of Congress to introduce legislation demanding closure and realignment of the road. A fight {{broke out in the}} United States Senate over payment for the road: Some Senators wanted Washington-Hoover's owners to pay $50,000 in exchange for a quitclaim deed from the War Department. The airport refused, calling this blackmail. Eventually, after several failed compromises, Congress passed and Roosevelt signed federal legislation permitting traffic to be temporarily stopped whenever planes took off or landed, and paying for guards to do the traffic stops.|$|R

25|$|Bicycles {{that are}} going to be used in abusive applications, such as freeride and BMX, will often {{incorporate}} a very heavy-duty <b>chain</b> <b>guard</b> that is designed to protect the chainrings from physical damage caused by impact with fixed objects; also called 'bashguards', these commonly replace a third (large) chainring.|$|R
