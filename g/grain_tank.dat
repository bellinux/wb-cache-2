40|$|Metal <b>grain</b> <b>tanks,</b> as {{constructed}} in Swaziland, were demonstrated {{to be extremely}} effective structures for fumigation on a small scale; phosphine gas concentrations were maintained well above the recommended minimum concentration of 150 p. p. m. throughout the minimum seven days exposure period. Current methods of sealing the tanks were shown to be inadequate but were improved by sealing the tank inlet and outlet using plastic sheeting and adhesive tape. Application rates of 3 · 33 g of phosphine per tonne of grain (as currently recommended in Swaziland) were more than adequate, provided the tanks were well sealed. "Tiny Bags" (produced by Degesch GmbH) were slightly slower in releasing phosphine when compared to conventional tablet formulations. However, the pattern of gas release and subsequent decay in concentrations were similar for "Tiny Bags" and tablets.

Knowledge of where grain resides in a combine, cleaning labor requirements, and resulting purity levels would assist producers. Measurements {{were made of}} grain and other material residing in different areas of rotary- and cylinder-type combines in replicated clean-outs during corn and soybean harvest and also in preliminary clean-outs during oat harvest. Concentration of the prior (i. e. commingled) grain was measured in the first grain harvested of the subsequent crop. Total material remaining in the combine ranged from 84 to 186 lb, 61 % of which was whole grain. The greatest amounts of corn and soybean material (17 to 74 lb) {{were found in the}} <b>grain</b> <b>tank</b> and rock trap.

Cleaning the head, <b>grain</b> <b>tank,</b> threshing rotor/cylinder, and cleaning shoe required more time than other areas. Immediately after cleaning, small amounts of prior (commingled) grain and foreign material, 0. 2 to 2. 5 lb, were found in the first bushel of subsequent grain harvested.

40|$|Iowa's county {{road system}} {{includes}} several {{thousands of miles}} of paved roads which consist of Portland cement concrete (PCC) surfaces, asphalt cement concrete (ACC) surfaces, and combinations of thin surface treatments such as seal coats and slurries. These pavements are relatively thin pavements when compared to the state road system and therefore are more susceptible to damage from heavy loads for which they were not designed. As the size of the average farm in Iowa has increased, so have the size and weights of implements of husbandry. These implements typically have fewer axles than a truck hauling the same weight would be required to have; in other words, some farm implements have significantly higher axle weights than would be legal for semi-trailers. Since stresses induced in pavements are related to a vehicle's axle weight, concerns have been raised among county and state engineers regarding the possible damage to roadway surfaces that could result from some of these large implements of husbandry. Implements of husbandry on Iowa's highway system have traditionally not been required to comply with posted weight embargo on bridges or with regulations regarding axle-weight limitations on roadways. In 1999, with House File 651, the Iowa General Assembly initiated a phased program of weight restrictions for implements of husbandry.
