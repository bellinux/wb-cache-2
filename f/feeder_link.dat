50|$|Early Ekran {{satellites}} used orbital {{positions in}} the range from 48 degrees E to 95 degrees E, but recent Ekrans, including the current Ekran 20, have been stationed at 99 degrees E. These 3-axis stabilized satellites carry a single 24 MHz, 200 W transponder, feeding a 28 dB gain antenna transmitting on right-hand circular polarization to produce equivalent isotropically radiated powers in Siberia in the range 50 to 55 dBW at 714 MHz. The corresponding <b>feeder</b> <b>link</b> uses left-hand circular polarization at 6200 MHz. Therefore, almost every householder could receive the TV signal at home from Ekran's transponder using a simple Yagi-Uda antenna. There were also various kinds of collective or individual satellite receivers, such as Ekran KR-10, Ekran-KR-01 and Ekran. Latest version of receiver represents a simple individual TV set-top box itself. A modified version of Ekran was called Ekran-M. Ekran satellites have been replaced by improved geostationary craft for DBS, such as Gorizont, Gals, and Express.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Herein, {{we study}} the {{spectral}} coexistence of Geo-stationary (GEO) Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) downlink and Broadcasting Satellite Services (BSS) <b>feeder</b> <b>links</b> in the Ka-band (17. 3 − 18. 1 GHz) which is primarily allocated for BSS <b>feeder</b> <b>links.</b> Firstly, a novel cognitive spectrum exploitation framework is proposed {{in order to}} utilize the available band efficiently. Subsequently, based on the interference analysis carried out between these systems, two cognitive approaches, namely Carrier Allocation (CA) and Beamforming (BF), are investigated under the considered framework assuming the availability of an accu-rate Radio Environment Map (REM). The employed techniques allow the flexibility of using additional shared carriers for the FSS downlink system along with the already available exclusive carriers (19. 7 − 20. 2 GHz), thus increasing the overall system throughput. It is shown that a significant improvement in the per beam throughput {{as well as in}} the beam availability can be achieved by applying CA and BF approaches in the considered scenario...|$|R
30|$|Among {{related works}} in scheduling-based relaying, the {{literary}} works[12, 13] propose fairness approaches to OFDMA relaying assuming multiple parallely activated relays {{in a time}} slot. A similar architectural assumption is used in this article, thereby enabling spatial frequency reuse among many relays within a macro-cell. For relaying without spatial reuse, we refer to works such as[14], which performs optimization by enforcing that only one relay link is active on a subcarrier in the entire macro-cell. The authors of[12] propose resource partitioning of <b>feeder</b> <b>links</b> based on time slots by considering that the relays transmit concurrently in one time slot. They further optimize the time slot splits between relay <b>feeder</b> <b>links</b> to improve relaying efficiency, without dealing with user scheduling issues at relay access links. The study in[13] proposes a relay scheduler called multiple relay parallel activation, in a framework similar to[12] but wherein they make use of user-subcarrier scheduling at each relay. The scheduler however does not optimize relaying time durations. More importantly, their scheduler tries to minimize the outage of all the active users and thus also does not exploit admission control procedures.|$|R
