25|$|The {{culture of}} Romania {{is a unique}} culture, which {{is the product of}} its {{geography}} and its distinct <b>historical</b> <b>evolution.</b> It is theorized and speculated that Romanians, (Proto-Romanians, including Aromanians, Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians) are the combination of descendants of Roman colonists and people indigenous to the region who were Romanized. The Dacian people, one of the major indigenous peoples of Central and Southeast Europe are one of the predecessors of the Proto-Romanians. It is believed that a mixture of Romans, Dacians, Slavs and Illyrians are the predecessors of the Romanians, Aromanians (Vlachs), Megleno-Romanians, and Istro-Romanians. Romanian culture shares some similarities as well with other ancient cultures even outside of the Balkans, such as that of the Armenians.|$|E

Up-todateness is particularly relevant to Web documents because they usually contain content origining from different sources and being refreshed at different dates. Whether a Web document is relevant for a reader depends on the history of its contents and so-called external factors, i. e., the up-todateness of semantically related documents. In this paper, we approach automatic management of up-to-dateness of Web documents that are managed by an XML-centric Web content management system. First, the freshness for a single document is computed, taking into account its change history. A document metric estimates the distance between different versions of a document.

40|$|AbstractThe present article aims at evincing the {{positive}} valences of the holism-individualism dispute in the epistemology of social sciences. Like other dichotomous pairs, holism and individualism {{have become the}} predominant spaces of academic analysis in social sciences, being vested with a great power of theoretical discrimination. Instead of treating methodological individualism and holism as complete, a-temporal, antagonistic paradigms, it is our presumption that they are but <b>historical</b> <b>evolutions</b> in social thinking, which are under no circumstances definitive, but improvable and possibly complementary. In this context, the present study claims that there is less and less justification for a dispute between a “holist” Durkheim and an “individualism”-championing Weber, {{all the more so}} as {{in the past few decades}} consensus and synthesis have been sought by the very proponents of these doctrinary oppositions...|$|R

Considering land administration institutional setup of Ethiopia, we showed that the <b>historical</b> <b>evolutions</b> of the institutions are informed by the absolute political and economical interest of the ruling class that results in extractive institutions which cast high risk of expropriation. Using Ethiopian rural panel household survey data, we showed that perceived risks have adverse impact on households’ investment on land though the results vary with the investment indicators and the region under consideration. Our results underscore the importance of considering the institutional setup and the resultant risk environment in looking into the impact of property rights on land investment...|$|R
