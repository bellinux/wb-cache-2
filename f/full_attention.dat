5|$|Between 1926 and 1927, Cooper {{discussed}} {{the plans for}} Pan American Airways with John Hambleton, which was formed during 1927. Cooper {{was a member of}} the board of directors of Pan American Airways. During his tenure at Pan Am, the company established the first regularly scheduled transatlantic service. While he was on the board, Cooper did not devote his <b>full</b> <b>attention</b> to the organization; he took time in 1929 and 1930 to work on the script for King Kong. By 1931, he was back in Hollywood. He resigned from the board of directors in 1935, following health complications.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his <b>full</b> <b>attention</b> to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, the bailliage (bailiwick) of Metz elected Custine to the Estates-General; {{upon his}} election, he {{resigned}} his military commission, judging that his responsibilities {{in the national}} assembly required his <b>full</b> <b>attention.</b> In July 1789, as the French Revolution gained momentum, he remained in the National Constituent Assembly. There, he supported {{the creation of a}} constitution espousing the principles of representative government and often voted with such liberal (constitutional) nobility as the Marquis de Lafayette. Although he supported the abolition of some seigniorial rights, he strongly defended royal prerogative and the rights of the nobility who fled during the Great Fear, especially their rights of property. He offered limited support of the nineteen decrees that abolished game-laws, seigniorial courts, the purchase and sale of posts in the magistracy, pecuniary immunities, favoritism in taxation, surplice money, first-fruits, pluralities, and unmerited pensions.|$|E
40|$|Seldom {{treated by}} modern {{students}} of the Radical Reformation, Adam Reissner, humanist, historian, biblical commentator, amanuensis to Schwenckfeld and municipal clerk at Mindelheim deserves <b>fuller</b> <b>attention</b> for his commentary on Matthew and his other theological works. An initial review of his Matthew commentary, for example, indicates {{the possibility of a}} greater influence by Reissner on Schwenkfeld than previously thought...|$|R

Baryshnikov's {{decision}} to devote his <b>full</b> <b>attentions</b> to the New York company stunned the dance world. Balanchine never created a new work for Baryshnikov, though he did coach the young dancer in his distinctive style, and Baryshnikov triumphed in such signature roles as Apollo, The Prodigal Son, and Rubies.|$|R
5|$|In September 867, the Byzantine emperor Michael III {{was killed}} and succeeded by Basil I the Macedonian. The new emperor was more {{energetic}} than his predecessor, and the relative peace on his eastern frontier allowed him to soon turn his <b>full</b> <b>attention</b> to the west: in 868–869 admiral Niketas Ooryphas was sent to relieve an Arab siege of Ragusa and re-establish imperial authority in Dalmatia, after which he sailed to Italy in an abortive attempt to conclude a alliance through marriage and co-ordinate a joint siege of Bari with the western emperor, Louis II. Another fleet was dispatched to Sicily in spring 868, but the Byzantines were heavily defeated by Khafaja in battle, after which the Muslims freely raided the environs of Syracuse. After Khafaga's return to Palermo, his son Muhammad launched a raid against mainland Italy, possibly besieging Gaeta.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{destroys the}} machine {{powering}} it and prepares {{to destroy the}} Collector base. However, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and gives the order to sterilize the base instead with a timed radiation pulse {{so that it can}} be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the Normandy, Shepard speaks with the Illusive Man, who is either pleased or furious with Shepard's decision. As Shepard meets in the Normandys cargo bay with the survivors, Joker gives the Commander schematics of a Reaper. Humanity now has the <b>full</b> <b>attention</b> of the Reapers, who awaken in dark space and descend upon the galaxy.|$|E

Makoto claims that he is Miharu's fiancé, however his {{appearance}} was actually due to a mix-up between Miharu's parents and his own. However he was still determined to court Miharu and take over her father's restaurant - Ogawa-ya - one day, even transferring schools to get closer to Miharu (to her dismay). However, after meeting Miharu on the roof after school one day to apologize for his actions during the summer, he tells her that he will start giving 'Miss Karen' his <b>fullest</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{engages with}} Hanson Thiem's (2009) {{critique}} of geographies of education. Accepting {{the premise that}} education warrants <b>fuller</b> <b>attention</b> by geographers, the paper nonetheless argues that engaging with research on children, youth and families reshapes understanding of what has been, and might be, achieved. Foregrounding young people as the subjects rather than objects of education demands that attention be paid to their current and future life-worlds, in both inward and outward looking geographies of education. It also requires a broadening of our spatial lens, {{in terms of what}} 'count' as educational spaces, and the places where we study these...|$|R
5000|$|Orgasmic meditation, is a {{mindfulness}} practice {{where the}} object of meditation is conscious finger to genital contact. [...] "OMing" [...] is practiced in pairs, with one partner, gently holding the genitals with both hands, and that partner's index finger gently, precisely, slowly stroking the female’s clitoris specifically and with both parties placing their complete awareness mindfully on that localized point of contact between them. Both practitioners focus their <b>fullest</b> <b>attention</b> on their sensitive nerve endings and on their finest muscle control in stroking movement to develop connective (limbic) resonance between practitioners. The outcome, is not simply orgasm but interpersonal connection.|$|R

25|$|According to this theory, {{prospective}} memory {{should be}} enhanced when complete attention {{is given to}} the desired task than when attention is divided among multiple tasks. Research conducted by McDaniel et al. (1998) attempted to prove that prospective memory performance is better on focused tasks as opposed to those where attention is split. Subjects completed a prospective memory task in either a condition where <b>full</b> <b>attention</b> was given or a condition where attention was divided on other tasks. The results were consistent with the PAM theory, showing that participants' prospective memory performance was better with <b>full</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E

Later in 1974, he became Canadian Coordinator of the International Magnetospheric Study, and gave it his <b>fullest</b> <b>attention</b> until its completion {{at the end of}} 1979. During this period, he also pursued an earlier research interest in the possible influence of solar activity on prairie weather and rainfall.|$|R
40|$|Careful {{examination}} of the facts of record shows that the JRE has been as successful as its competitors in expanding the cultural range and scope of inquiry in religious ethics. Yet {{it should be noted}} that the debate between cultural particularists and philosophical ethicists, a debate that has shaped the actual practices of the field of comparative religious studies, has not been vigorously pursued in these pages. Likewise, the JRE has not yet realized its potential to foster collaborative work among scholars working in different religious traditions, to encourage attention to neglected topics, or to enlarge, through <b>fuller</b> <b>attention</b> to diverse religious traditions, the range of ethical and metaethical interests that dominate inquiry in religious ethics...|$|R
