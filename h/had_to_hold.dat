5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1925 season, Stanford lost {{just one}} PCC game (to Washington); California was finally defeated, 27–7. It {{was the first}} year of a new rivalry, with coach Howard Jones and the University of Southern California (USC) team. In their first game, at the Los Angeles Memorial Colosseum, Stanford scored twice in the first half but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off the {{charging}} Trojans in a 13–9 win. Because of the loss to Washington, Warner's team was not invited to the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, {{and the top of}} an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's hallway and the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica came out from under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5|$|Thirty CH-21 Shawnee {{helicopters}} {{were needed}} to airlift the entire 1st Battalion, ARVN 11th Infantry Regiment, but only ten were available. As a result, Dam could only send one company at a time onto the battlefield. At around 07:00, {{the first wave of}} CH-21 helicopters offloaded the first group of South Vietnamese soldiers. These troops <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their positions until the rest of the battalions had arrived. Because of the delay in the arrival of the regular South Vietnamese army units, two Civil Guard battalions of Task Forces A and B—under the command of Dinh Tuong provincial chief Major Lam Quang Tho—were left to march against enemy positions by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs returned with the next wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{ended the}} regular season at home against the Lions; in Chicago, the Bears led the series 50–26–3. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears offense <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off the blitz; in 2015, the Lions had 38 sacks, {{including}} 13.5 by defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, and ranked fourth in sack percentage, while recording the second-most negative plays in the NFL. In comparison, the Bears had the fewest negative plays in the league. Despite the frequency to blitz, the Lions only had eight sacks when doing so. Through the air, the Lions pass defense struggled, allowing a 30th-ranked passer rating of 101.7 and 30 touchdown passes while recording only interceptions. To excel, the Bears had to maintain the ball, as they were ranked sixth in the NFL in time of possession. On defense, the Bears took on a Lions offense that had improved under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter after Joe Lombardi's firing, going from 18.6 points per game to 26.4 under Cooter. With Matthew Stafford, the Lions were one of eleven teams with over 4,000 yards, while also being {{ranked in the top}} ten with 30 touchdown passes. However, Stafford was sacked 40 times, while the rushing attack averaged only 84.5 yards per game and 3.8 yards per carry. Eddie Royal, Zach Miller, Hroniss Grasu, Jarvis Jenkins, Jacoby Glenn, Tayo Fabuluje and Terry Williams were inactive.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs bounce off the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself decided {{there was no other}} recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly and communicate with one another, to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly and knocking out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} storm struck, CARE {{operated}} airlifts of food to flooded areas. The World Food Programme approved $2 million to help airlifting 53,000 metric tons of food. A fleet of 29 helicopters had rescued 14,204 people by March 7 as well as operating airlifting missions. This included 12 planes and helicopters from South Africa, six helicopters with crews along with 100 motorboats from the United Kingdom, ten helicopters from Germany, and two from Malawi. Many residents in flooded areas initially <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> onto trees and roofs {{due to lack of}} helicopters, with 100,000 people needing rescue as of March 1. After the floodwaters receded, the need for rescue diminished, allowing families to return home, although helicopters were still required to airlift relief goods. Emergency road repairs allowed supplies to be delivered by road in some areas by March 5. The United States sent a crew of 700 soldiers in what became Task Force Atlas Response, a $37 million operation to coordinate disaster relief, rebuild roads, deliver crop seed, and drop off aid. This was ordered by U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 2 after criticism that the international assistance was insufficient. The Save the Children organization helped reunited separated children from their families, while World Relief flew seeds and tools to help 26,260 farmers regrow their damaged crops. The United Kingdom assisted by canceling the country's $150 million debt earlier than scheduled, and urged other nations to follow suit; Italy canceled its $500 million debt in March. On February 24, the World Bank provided $2.5 million to rebuild roads, and later provided an additional $15 million. The same agency delayed debt payments for one year. Portugal and Spain canceled $150 million and $20 million worth of debt, respectively. Through the Jubilee 2000, most wealthy nations postponed debt payments for one year on March 16.|$|E

25|$|Hood's attack {{initially}} enveloped the 3,000 {{men in the}} two brigades under Lane and Conrad, which {{attempted to}} stand their ground behind inadequate fieldworks and without anchored flanks, but quickly collapsed under the pressure. Many of the veteran soldiers of the two brigades stampeded back on the Columbia Pike to the main breastworks, while some untried replacements were reluctant to move under fire and were captured. The fleeing troops were closely pursued by the Confederates and the two sides became so intermingled that defenders in the breastworks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their fire to avoid hitting their comrades.|$|E
25|$|Several {{experiments}} varied {{the immediacy}} of the teacher and learner. Generally, when the victim's physical immediacy was increased, the participant's compliance decreased. The participant's compliance also decreased when the authority's physical immediacy decreased (Experiments 1–4). For example, in Experiment 2, where participants received telephonic instructions from the experimenter, compliance decreased to 21 percent. Interestingly, some participants deceived the experimenter by pretending to continue the experiment. In the variation where the learner's physical immediacy was closest, where participants <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the learner's arm physically onto a shock plate, compliance decreased. Under that condition, 30 percent of participants completed the experiment.|$|E
