500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if you like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what happened to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later {{went on to say that}} she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where he is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do not want to know who took him.

2500|$|Filming {{the scene}} in which DS Miller confronts her murderous husband {{required}} some special care. The scene had been suggested by Olivia Colman. During her first meeting with Chibnall and Featherstone to discuss her character, she asked, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> do we get him [...] and do I get to kick him in the balls?" [...] Although no such scene had been written, they assured her it would be included (assuming Ellie Miller was not the murderer). Actors Olivia Colman and Matthew Gravelle were kept apart before the scene was filmed {{as a means of}} heightening the tension between the two during their meeting. The scene called for Colman to attack Gravelle, who would fall to the ground and allow Colman to kick him in the back. Gravelle's back was fitted with safety padding, but Colman's performance was so intense that she kicked him too hard and Gravelle was bruised for three weeks.|$|E

But what I {{want to say to}} you, if you will give me the opportunity, is this: The first few evenings after your arrival here were very pleasant ones indeed--for me. You talked to me, and I found more pleasure in our conversation than I have ever done in anything else in my life. There, that is being frank, is it not? I hoped that we might be friends; indeed, {{it seemed to me that}} we were certainly going to be so. I do not wish to offend you by any apparent exaggeration, but I must say that it made a considerable difference to my interest in life. That is putting it mildly. Where you have found the time to read and think so much, of course, I cannot tell. It is not my business. Only, I know that it makes your companionship very pleasant for me. You see I am trying to be as matter-of-fact as possible--do please give me credit for that.
