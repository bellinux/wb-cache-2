5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} were lengthened at 75th Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard to 660 feet {{to allow}} E and F trains to run eleven car trains. The E and F began running eleven car trains during rush hours on September 8, 1953. The <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers. The lengthening project cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The Pendolino has {{received}} bad publicity {{since the first}} units were taken in service for its serious reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems with the tilting system and the couplers. The coupling problems grew particularly important with {{the expansion of the}} Pendolino network in 2006, requiring rapid on-the-fly coupling of two trains at intersection stations. Because the units often could not be coupled the train units had to be run as two separate trains running one after another. This consumed one <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> slot on the heavily used rail sections causing cascading timetable delays. Sometimes two trains would not separate after coupling them, caused by moisture in the couplers. Due to the problems VR ended the practice of coupling Pendolino trains on-the-fly at the two intersection stations; in Tampere in late 2007 and in Kouvola during autumn 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Manawatu Railway Company railway {{when first}} {{constructed}} {{was a single}} track railway with crossing loops at principal stations to allow opposing trains to pass. In the 1920s the need for <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> services on the line was recognised, both to increase the tonnage of goods trains and to allow more frequent suburban passenger services. To {{increase the number of}} trains that the line could carry, duplication and electrification of the line along with other improvements, such as curve easements, was planned and progressed in stages.|$|E

25|$|Budgetary {{disagreements}} {{between local}} politicians in Oslo, Bærum and Akershus {{led to the}} closure of the Bekkestua to Kolsås leg on 1 July 2003. This allowed Oslo Sporveier {{to reduce the number of}} trains to eight, using three-car trains during rush-hour and twin units in off-peak hours. The move was little popular with the patrons and followed by protests. A political agreement was thereby struck, allowing services to Kolsås to resume from 20 November 2004. However, the line was in such poor shape that the speed was reduced several places. Only one <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> was added to the line, giving poorer regularity.|$|E
25|$|East Midlands Trains runs Regional Services {{across the}} East Midlands. The Norwich to Liverpool trains are painted white like Mainline services, {{rather than in}} the blue scheme used for other {{regional}} and local services. The Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Central, Manchester Oxford Road and Piccadilly, Sheffield, Nottingham, Peterborough and Ely to Norwich service was historically provided by Central Trains. Nottinghamshire County Council has consistently campaigned for better services between the four core cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. Network Rail's plans for the Manchester Hub would deliver <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> paths along the Hope Valley Line, enabling more trains to run from the North West to the East Midlands. In December 2012, double unit trains were provided for services between Manchester and Nottingham to ease overcrowding.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Normal" [...] game mode, each station can {{accommodate}} a limited capacity of waiting passengers; if the stations become too congested and the threshold is reached, the level ends. Upon failing, players {{can continue to}} build their network in the [...] "Endless" [...] game mode where stations {{do not have a}} limited capacity. To alleviate the network's growth, players earn upgrades each week of in-game time. At each upgrade, the player receives a new train car and a choice among two other random options such as an extra rail line, an <b>extra</b> <b>train</b> carriage, extra tunnels, or an interchange (which increases a station's capacity). In addition, the transit simulation can be paused at any point to allow for reconstruction and adjustments to train routes. In [...] "Extreme" [...] mode lines between stations cannot be adjusted once their position is set.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extension}} of the Fulton Street Line, the completion {{of which had been}} delayed due to war priorities, was finished by funds obtained by Mayor William O'Dwyer and was placed in operation on November 28, 1948, running along Pennsylvania Avenue and Pitkin Avenue to Euclid Avenue near the Queens border. Forty additional R10 cars were placed into service for the extension. The cost of the extension was about $46,500,000. It included the construction of the new Pitkin Avenue Storage Yard, which could accommodate 585 subway cars on 40 storage tracks. Because these stations were completed later {{than the rest of the}} line, they received different design features than other IND stations, including different wall tiles and fluorescent lighting. In 1953, the platforms were lengthened at Ralph Avenue and Broadway–East New York to 660 feet to allow E trains to run eleven car trains.
