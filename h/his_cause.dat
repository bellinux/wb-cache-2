5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were willing to support <b>his</b> <b>cause</b> after he ran away to Dalmatia. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until being murdered in 480, as the last lawful Western Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a {{merchant}} family. He later {{got involved in}} both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in horticulture and education led him to co-found the Michigan State Agricultural Society, a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes spent {{the next six years}} drafting legislation and gaining support for <b>his</b> <b>cause,</b> and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the murder}} of Archbishop Thomas Becket at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury {{became one of the}} most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine. This pilgrimage {{provided}} the framework for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th-century collection of stories, The Canterbury Tales. Canterbury Castle was captured by the French Prince Louis during his 1215 invasion of England, before the death of John caused his English supporters to desert <b>his</b> <b>cause</b> and support the young Henry III.|$|E

5|$|Ahmose I's {{campaigns in}} Nubia are better documented. Soon {{after the first}} Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian {{gathered}} many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at Buhen. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported <b>his</b> <b>cause</b> {{and that of his}} dynastic predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{suffered}} from major depression, {{and this was}} often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's Pink Moon, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, {{at the age of}} 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. <b>His</b> <b>cause</b> of death was determined to be suicide.|$|E

Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|In {{that year}} he rebelled against Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518), whose fiscal {{stringency}} {{and promotion of}} Miaphysitism were widely unpopular, and allowed Vitalian to quickly win over {{large parts of the}} army and the people of Thrace to <b>his</b> <b>cause.</b> After scoring a series of victories over loyalist armies, Vitalian came to threaten Constantinople itself, and forced Anastasius to officially recant his adoption of Miaphysitism in summer 515. Soon after, however, as Anastasius failed to honour some of the terms of the agreement, Vitalian marched on Constantinople, only to be decisively defeated by Anastasius' admiral, Marinus.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{came down}} firmly {{in favour of}} Henry, but the French {{arbitration}} failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons {{refused to accept the}} verdict. England slipped back into the Second Barons' War, which was won by Henry's son, Prince Edward. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing <b>his</b> <b>cause,</b> arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta. In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.|$|E

5|$|Meiklejohn {{resolved}} {{to open a}} new, experimental liberal arts college in late 1924, but struggled to find funding. Seeking $3 million for the venture, he was rejected by Bernard Baruch and Abraham Flexner but through support from The New Republic Herbert Croly was offered planning funds from the magazine's main benefactor. The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, New School professor Alvin Johnson, and The Century Magazine editor-in-chief Glenn Frank. Frank had previously published Meiklejohn's work and was sympathetic to <b>his</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E

The Mohave grieved deeply; Irataba's cremation and the rituals of mourning were reported in newspapers {{as far away as}} Omaha, Nebraska.

5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial an absurd one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to <b>his</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the Elector Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help <b>his</b> <b>cause.</b> Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the Elector Palatine, had expressed his support, and made a great show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E
5|$|Although William's {{supporters}} {{dominated the}} government, there remained a significant following for James, {{particularly in the}} Highlands. <b>His</b> <b>cause,</b> which became known as Jacobitism, from the Latin (Jacobus) for James, led {{to a series of}} risings. An initial Jacobite military attempt was led by John Graham, now Viscount Dundee. His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated William's forces at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld. The complete defeat of James in Ireland by William at the Battle of Aughrim (1691), ended {{the first phase of the}} Jacobite military effort. In the aftermath of the Jacobite defeat on 13 February 1692 in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on the grounds that they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Decisive for {{the verdict}} about the {{legality}} of both pontificates were not the legal arguments, but {{the attitude of the}} Catholic world, which had almost universally recognized Innocent II. His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned <b>his</b> <b>cause</b> as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain the control of the city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E
