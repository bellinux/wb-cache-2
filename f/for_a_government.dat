5|$|Once Egypt {{became a}} Roman province, Roman {{officials}} sought to limit temples' power and independence.

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{met with}} senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, {{until the}} Heian period, the {{language}} of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees, codes, commands, communications and certificates. Consequently, Chinese books were essential {{for the education of}} the (male) aristocracy, and beginning readers studied books such as the Mencius or the Thousand Character Classic. Towards the end of the 7th century, to prepare selected sons of the nobility <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> career, Emperor Tenji established the Daigaku-ryō ("Academy"). At first the curriculum consisted mainly of Confucian Classics and Chinese history. Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century, and the Academy's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan, Records of the Grand Historian and the Books of Han and Later Han. Unlike in China at the time, Classical Confucian studies, especially the historical and political side of Confucianism, were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty. In fact, one of the Japanese emperor's prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics, histories, and poetic anthologies.|$|E
5|$|In March, Congressman Darrell Issa, {{the ranking}} Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, {{sent a letter}} to White House Counsel Robert Bauer stating if Sestak's claim was true, the Obama {{administration}} may have violated a federal statue that makes it illegal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> employee to use his authority to interfere with a Senate election. Interest in the alleged job offer reignited after Sestak defeated Specter in the primary on May 18. Seven Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a review of the legal implications of the offer. Around this time, Sestak continued to maintain that a job offer was made, but he downplayed the importance of the incident and defended Obama's integrity. On May 28, the White House formally responded to the allegations and acknowledged White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel enlisted former President Bill Clinton to offer Sestak a seat on a presidential advisory board or another executive board if Sestak dropped his candidacy. If Sestak accepted, he would have been allowed to remain in the House while serving in the unpaid position.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union in September. They were looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations with the Soviet Union and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who {{had just}} {{returned}} from a trip to Sorrento, called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E

5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>government</b> unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E
