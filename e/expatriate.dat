The Western <b>expatriates</b> were mainly from the USA, France and Germany while the overseas Chinese <b>expatriates</b> were mostly from Hong Kong. It was found that overseas Chinese <b>expatriates</b> less often than the Western <b>expatriates</b> used problem-focused coping strategies, such as showing tolerance and patience and using responsible problem solving, but more often applied symptom-focused strategies, such as resorting to parent-country escapism. Especially Hong Kong <b>expatriates</b> were found to use fewer problem-focused coping strategies than their US and French counterparts {{while at the same}} time applying more symptom-focused coping strategies than the US and German <b>expatriates.</b> Obviously, that may limit the managerial effectiveness of overseas Chinese <b>expatriates</b> on the Chinese mainland in general, and in particular that of Hong Kong <b>expatriates...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} {{that the concept of}} ethnic {{identity}} confirmation (EIC), the level of agreement between how <b>expatriates</b> view the importance of their own ethnic identity and how local employees view the importance of expatriates' ethnic identity, can explain why <b>expatriates</b> who are ethnically similar to host-country employees are sometimes less effective than expected when working overseas. Multinationals often choose ethnically similar <b>expatriates</b> for international assignments, assuming these <b>expatriates</b> can more effectively acquire knowledge from local employees. Thus, understanding the specific challenges that endanger the realization of this potential is crucial. Our survey, administered to a sample of 128 expatriate–local employee dyads working in China, reveals that both ethnically similar and ethnically different <b>expatriates</b> acquire more local knowledge when EIC is high. However, the association between ethnic (dis) similarity and knowledge acquisition is direct for ethnically different <b>expatriates,</b> whereas for ethnically similar <b>expatriates</b> it is indirect via their perception of local employees' trustworthiness. We discuss this study's important implications and provide recommendations for multinationals on how to provide tailored support to <b>expatriates</b> who face different identity challenges...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{adaptation}} of organizational and voluntary expatriates: {{similarities and differences}} in the Brazilian contextThough expatriation has become common in today’s corporate world {{and the majority of}} <b>expatriates</b> are self-initiated rather than assigned by business organizations to work abroad, many authors have treated these two groups of <b>expatriates</b> (self-initiated and organizational) as homogeneous. The objective {{of this study was to}} differentiate, conceptually and empirically, self-initiated and organizational <b>expatriates,</b> by examining differences in the {{adaptation of}} individuals from both groups in Brazil. The study was qualitative, conducted through semi-structured interviews with 21 organizational and 24 self-initiated <b>expatriates</b> living in Brazil, using content analysis. The theoretical perspective adopted in this study was the model of transcultural adaptation of <b>expatriates</b> of Black, Mendenhall and Oddou (1991). The results emphasize the importance of a conceptual and empirical separation of the two types of <b>expatriates,</b> as they showed different characteristics in the three dimensions of transcultural adaptation used in this study. For Human Resources professionals that work with expatriation processes, the authors suggest that self-initiated <b>expatriates</b> are an advantageous option for the creation of a global workforce, since they tend to adapt better than the organizational ones.
