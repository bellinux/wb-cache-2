500|$|The album's next {{track is}} {{a version of}} the Chris Montez song [...] "Let's Dance". The song {{features}} Leon playing Radio City's large Wurlitzer pipe organ. The 13th track on the record, [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Around with You", consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. It is one of the group's earliest compositions. [...] It is the first song on their first demo tape, written at the beginning of 1974. [...] "I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You" [...] fades into the album's final track, [...] "Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World", a song that refers to a Hitler Youth member. Seymour Stein complained about the song's original lyrics—"I'm a Nazi, baby, I'm a Nazi, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> for the Fatherland"—insisting that the track was offensive. When Stein threatened to completely remove the track from the album the band put together alternate lyrics: [...] "I'm a shock trooper in a stupor, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> for the Fatherland." [...] Stein accepted the revision and it was published in the album.|$|E

500|$|Fiasco {{has since}} {{released}} Food & Liquor 2, {{as well as}} put work into a [...] joint album with fellow Child Rebel Soldier & All City Chess Club member Pharrell. Prior to the album's release, he revealed {{that there would be}} no more mixtapes after [...] "Friend Of The People: <b>I</b> <b>Fight</b> Evil" [...] prior to Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, which was planned to be a double-disc with Part I set to release in fall 2012. Its lead single, the Simonsayz and B-Side produced track Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free), was released on May 21, which stirred controversy from an infuriated Pete Rock for using a sample from They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.). Rock said that he felt [...] "so violated" [...] by the use of the sample, although the original track itself used samples from Tom Scott and James Brown.|$|E
500|$|Jolie's {{reputation}} {{began to}} change positively after she, at age 26, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, later commenting, [...] "In my early 20s I was fighting with myself. Now I take that punk in me to Washington, and <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> for something important." [...] Owing to her extensive activism, her Q Score—the industry's measure of celebrities' likability—nearly doubled to 25 between 2000 and 2006. Her recognizability grew accordingly; by 2006, she was familiar to 81% of Americans, compared to 31% in 2000. She became noted for her ability to positively influence her public image through the media, without employing a publicist or an agent. Her Q Score remained above average even when, in 2005, she was accused of ending Brad Pitt's marriage to Jennifer Aniston, at which point her public persona became an unlikely combination of alleged homewrecker, mother, sex symbol, and humanitarian. A decade later, Jolie {{was found to be}} the most admired woman in the world in global surveys conducted by YouGov in 2015 and 2016.|$|E
500|$|Rowland stated to Rap Up TV that [...] "the {{concept of}} the video is very futuristic and great. The red line in {{the story is that}} I am above all the lead but in the club {{atmosphere}} with cool people. <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> against myself with my haircut, makeup, and dance moves." [...] According to Love, in the clip Rowland is transformed into a fashionista, [...] "Kelly's look in this video is just utterly sexy. It's like a jungle feel. I feel like we're in Avatar somewhere, running through the woods, minus the blue paint." [...] Later one of her outfits was described as an [...] "Avatar-esque bodysuit". Rowland said [...] "I had to pull out my dancing shoes for this video!" [...] The video features [...] "Kelly Rowland facing off against herself. The two Kellys start {{what appears to be a}} voguing competition on the dancefloor, then are flanked by respective dance teams." [...] Guetta makes an appearance at the end of the clip he [...] "undergoes a 'Transformers'-like metamorphosis, turning into a mixer." [...] Paper magazine described Rowland's look in the video as [...] "superhero-esque". Joanna Goh from MSN China said that in the clip [...] " [...] sports a new femme fatale image a la the bodysuits and masculine imaging".|$|E

2500|$|The {{conference was}} {{somewhat}} successful in {{its attempt to}} form a more unified command. The basic goal was to appoint a ‘commander-in-chief’ with enough authority to manage all Allied operations. The members attending the conference believed that General Ferdinand Foch had shown the best leadership and perseverance and therefore put him in charge of all the Allied armies on the Western Front. One of Foch's more inspiring statements at the conference, clearly showing his perseverance, was [...] "You aren't fighting? <b>I</b> would <b>fight</b> without a break. <b>I</b> would <b>fight</b> in front of Amiens. <b>I</b> would <b>fight</b> in Amiens. <b>I</b> would <b>fight</b> behind Amiens. <b>I</b> would <b>fight</b> all the time.

500|$|More {{than two}} and a half years after the album's completion, Lasers was {{released}} on March 8, 2011. The first single from the record was [...] "The Show Goes On", which samples [...] "Float On" [...] by Modest Mouse. [...] "The Show Goes On" [...] debuted at number 57 on the Billboard Hot 100.

[...] Despite the album's commercial success, Lasers received mixed reviews from most music critics. [...] Writing for AllMusic, editor Andy Kellman gave the record three out of five stars and criticized its [...] "lumbering, overwrought choruses", writing that [...] "If there is one MC whose rhymes should not be dulled for the sake of chasing pop trends, it's Lupe Fiasco". Lasers, however, was nominated Best Rap Album, with [...] "The Show Goes On" [...] nominated for Best Rap Performance, and Best Rap Song at the 2012 Grammy Awards. Lupe Fiasco later involved himself at the Occupy Wall Street movement where he donated tents and released a poem in support of the protesters.

2500|$|Both McCain and Romney {{addressed}} the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, DC on February 7, while Mike Huckabee spoke on February 9. Romney used {{his speech to}} announce {{the end of his}} campaign, saying, [...] "Now if <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> on in my campaign, {{all the way to the}} convention -- (cheers, applause). I want you to know I've given this a lot of thought. I'd forestall the launch of a national campaign and, frankly, I'd be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win. Frankly, in this time of war, I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror." [...] McCain spoke about an hour later, again appealing to right-wing uncertainty about his ideology.|$|E

[...] Green stated that [...] "it will be most probably the last time <b>I</b> <b>fight</b> in Western Australia", and said of his opponent [...] "Nothing soft comes out of the Bronx, and he's a very tough guy."

Green remained [...] "tight-lipped on his boxing future" [...] and replied [...] "I'm just going to relax and enjoy it" [...] when asked about his plans.|$|E
