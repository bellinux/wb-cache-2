5|$|Some {{patients}} – {{particularly those}} who are terminally ill – may {{not wish to be}} <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> pain management decisions, and may delegate such choices to their treatment providers. The patient's participation in his or her treatment is a right, not an obligation, and although reduced involvement may result in less-than-optimal pain management, such choices should be respected.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human being is not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{paper mill}} {{is divided into}} several sections, roughly {{corresponding}} to the processes <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> handmade paper. Pulp is refined and mixed in water with other additives to make a pulp slurry. The head-box of the paper machine (Fourdrinier machine) distributes the slurry onto a moving continuous screen, water drains from the slurry (by gravity or under vacuum), the wet paper sheet goes through presses and dries, and finally rolls into large rolls. The outcome often weighs several tons.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, the Viking army did {{withdraw}} from Reading {{in the autumn}} of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser, or by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend, and Waterloo Bridge. These finds hint at the cost <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.|$|E
25|$|There {{are nine}} main {{categories}} of muscular dystrophy that contain {{more than thirty}} specific types. The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. Other types include Becker muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy. They are due to mutations in genes that are <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> muscle proteins. This can occur due to either inheriting the defect from one's parents or the mutation occurring during early development. Disorders may be X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant. Diagnosis often involves blood tests and genetic testing.|$|E

Even today those who make paper by hand use tools and technologies quite similar to those existing hundreds of years ago, as originally developed in China and Asia, or those further modified in Europe. Handmade paper is still appreciated for its distinctive uniqueness and the skilled craft <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> each sheet, {{in contrast with the}} higher degree of uniformity and perfection at lower prices achieved among industrial products.|$|E
25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
25|$|Most {{types of}} {{porphyria}} are inherited from a person's parents and {{are due to}} a mutation {{in one of the}} genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to increased iron in the liver, hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or the bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if there is a difference in the way male and female authors of contemporary realistic fiction for young adults portray decision making by their male or female protagonists. Questions asked in the study were: (1) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for male protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making?</b> (2) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for female protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making?</b> (3) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for male protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making?</b> and (4) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an ethic of justice or an ethic of care for female protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making?</b> Content analysis was used as the method of collecting data. The sample consisted of 194 novels written from 1989 to 1998, 53 of which contained a moral dilemma. A discussion of the novels included examples of moral dilemmas, alternative solutions, dilemma resolutions, and resolutions based upon care or justice. Analysis of the data revealed: (1) Female writers employ an ethic of care and an ethic of justice for male protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making.</b> (2) Female writers prefer an ethic of care for female protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making.</b> (3) Male writers prefer an ethic of justice for male protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making.</b> (4) Male writers prefer an ethic of justice for female protagonists <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> moral decision <b>making...</b>|$|R
