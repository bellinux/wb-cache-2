40|$|General {{circulation}} models (GCMs) {{have been}} criticized for their failure to represent the observed scales of precipitation, particularly in the tropics where simulated daily rainfall is too light, too frequent and too persistent. Previous assessments have focused on temporally or spatially averaged precipitation, such as daily means or regional averages. These evaluations offer little actionable information for model developers, because the interactions between the resolved dynamics and parameterized physics that produce precipitation occur at the native <b>gridscale</b> and time step. We introduce a set of diagnostics (Analyzing Scales of Precipitation, version 1. 0 – ASoP 1) to compare the spatial and temporal scales of precipitation across GCMs and observations, which can be applied to data ranging from the <b>gridscale</b> and time step to regional and sub-monthly averages. ASoP 1 measures the spectrum of precipitation intensity, temporal variability as a function of intensity and spatial and temporal coherence. When applied to time step, <b>gridscale</b> tropical precipitation from 10 GCMs, the diagnostics reveal that, far from the dreary persistent light rainfall implied by daily mean data, most models produce a broad range of time step intensities that span 1 – 100  mm day − 1. Models show widely varying spatial and temporal scales of time step precipitation. Several GCMs show concerning quasi-random behavior that may influence and/or alter the spectrum of atmospheric waves. Averaging precipitation to a common spatial ([*]≈[*]  600  km) or temporal (3  h) resolution substantially reduces variability among models, demonstrating that averaging hides a wealth of information about intrinsic model behavior. When compared against satellite-derived analyses at these scales, all models produce features that are too large and too persistent...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} influence of convective latent heat release/diabatic heating on the production of kinetic energy during AVE/SESAME I. The primary focus has been on the relative importance of thermally forced modification of the wind field through thickness and height gradient changes versus inertial-advective effects via the diabatic component of vertical motion. Preliminary results have shown that because of the strong vertical shear over the convective region, ageostrophic response is primarily caused by the latter process. The diagnostic parameterization of convective heating has been extended for use in conjunction with satellite precipitation estimates in data-poor oceanic regions. An initial application was made to a mesoscale convective system embedded in the South Pacific convergence zone. Comparison to the heating field diagnosed as a residual in the thermodynamic equation using the ECMWF III-b analyses showed that the methodology will be useful in explaining the observed heating fields and determining the relative contribution of moist processes to the total diabatic heating. Research activities are now concentrated in the following areas: (1) Determining the sensitivity of vertical heating profiles to partitioning of <b>gridscale</b> versus convective precipitation; (2) assessing the possible effects of incorrect analyzed <b>gridscale</b> vertical motions on residuals in the heat budgets computed with the ECMWF III-b data sets...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} "multipatch" {{infrastructure}} for numerical simulation of fluid problems in which sub-regions require different <b>gridscales,</b> different grid geometries, different physical equations, or different reference frames. Its key element is a sophisticated client-router-server framework for efficiently linking processors supporting different regions ("patches") that must exchange boundary data. This infrastructure {{may be used}} {{with a wide variety}} of fluid dynamics codes; the only requirement is that their primary dependent variables be the same in all patches, e. g., fluid mass density, internal energy density, and velocity. Its structure can accommodate either Newtonian or relativistic dynamics. The overhead imposed by this system is both problem- and computer cluster architecture-dependent. Compared to a conventional simulation using the same number of cells and processors, the increase in runtime can be anywhere from negligible to a factor of a few; however, one of the infrastructure's advantages is that it can lead to a very large reduction in the total number of zone-updates.

40|$|We {{describe}} a compatible finite element discretisation for {{the shallow water}} equations on the rotating sphere, concentrating on integrating consistent upwind stabilisation into the framework. Although the prognostic variables are velocity and layer depth, the discretisation has a diagnostic potential vorticity that satisfies a stable upwinded advection equation through a Taylor-Galerkin scheme; this provides a mechanism for dissipating enstrophy at the <b>gridscale</b> whilst retaining optimal order consistency. We also use upwind discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the transport of layer depth. These transport schemes are incorporated into a semi-implicit formulation that is facilitated by a hybridisation method for solving the resulting mixed Helmholtz equation. We illustrate our discretisation with some standard rotating sphere test problems...|$|E
40|$|Inverse {{modeling}} {{methods are}} now commonly used for estimating surface fluxes of carbon dioxide, using atmospheric mass fraction measurements {{combined with a}} numerical atmospheric transport model. The geostatistical approach to flux estimation {{takes advantage of the}} spatial and/or temporal correlation in fluxes and does not require prior flux estimates. In this work, a geostatistical implementation of a fixed-lag Kalman smoother is developed to improve the computational efficiency of the inverse problem. This method makes it feasible to perform multi-year inversions, at fine resolutions, and with large amounts of data. The new method is applied to the recovery of global <b>gridscale</b> carbon dioxide fluxes for 1997 to 2001 using pseudodata representative of a subset of the NOAA-ESRL Cooperative Air Sampling Network...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{models of}} the ocean {{typically}} employ gridpoint techniques in which the dynamical variables defining {{the state of the}} ocean are held on a staggered grid. One common arrangement of the variables, known as the Arakawa C-grid, is particularly prone to <b>gridscale</b> noise that is due to spatial averaging of Coriolis terms and that is manifest when the grid resolution is coarse with respect to the deformation radius. Here, the authors analyze the problem in the context of linear inertia–gravity waves and discuss the reason for the prevalence of noise. They suggest {{a solution to the problem}} in which the C-grid model variables are augmented with D-grid velocity variables. An analysis of the resulting C–D grid indicates favorable behavior and numerical results are presented to demonstrate this. Finally, they discuss the similarity in nature between the C–D grid and the Z-grid, to explain why the C–D grid works well at both high and low resolution. 1...|$|E
40|$|Finite-difference {{simulations}} of fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics generally require an explicit diffusion operator, either to maintain stability by attenuating <b>gridscale</b> structure, or to implement physical diffusivities such as viscosity or resistivity. If {{the goal is}} stability only, the diffusion must act at the grid scale, but should affect structure at larger scales as little as possible. For physical diffusivities the diffusion scale depends on the problem, and diffusion may act at larger scales as well. Diffusivity undesirably limits the computational timestep in both cases. We construct tuned finitedifference diffusion operators that minimally limit the timestep while acting as desired near the diffusion scale. Such operators reach peak values at the diffusion scale {{rather than at the}} grid scale, but behave as standard operators at larger scales. We focus on the specific applications of hyperdiffusivity for numerical stabilization, and high Schmidt and high Prandtl number simulations where the diffusion scale greatly exceeds the grid scale. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{database}} {{has been}} developed containing downscaled socio-economic scenarios of future population and GDP at country level and on a geo-referenced <b>gridscale.</b> It builds on the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), but has been created independently of that report. The SRES scenarios are derived from projected data on economic, demographic, technological and land-use changes for the 21 st century in a highly aggregated form consisting of four world regions. Since analysts often need socio-economic data at higher spatial resolutions {{that are consistent with}} GCM climate scenarios, we undertook linear downscaling to 2100 of population and GDP to the country-level of the aggregated SRES socio-economic data for four scenario families: A 1, A 2, B 1, B 2. Using these countrylevel data, we also generated geo-spatial grids at 1 / 4 o resolution (~ 30 kilometers at the equator) for population “density ” (people/unit land area) and for GDP “density” (GDP/unit land area) for two time slices, 1990 and 2025.

40|$|The sub-grid-scale {{parameterization}} {{of clouds}} {{is one of}} the weakest aspects of weather and climate modeling today, and the explicit simulation of clouds {{will be one of the}} next major achievements in numerical weather prediction. Research cloud models have been in development over the last 45 years and they continue to be an important tool for in-vestigating clouds, cloud-systems, and other small-scale atmospheric dynamics. The lat-est generation are now being used for weather prediction. The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model, representative of this generation and of a class of models using explicit time-splitting integration techniques to efficiently integrate the Euler equations, is de-scribed in this paper. It is the first fully compressible conservative-form nonhydrostatic atmospheric model suitable for both research and weather prediction applications. Re-sults are presented demonstrating its ability to resolve strongly-nonlinear small-scale phenomena, clouds, and cloud systems. Kinetic energy spectra and other statistics show that the model is simulating small scales in numerical weather prediction applications, while necessarily removing energy at the <b>gridscale</b> but minimizing artificial dissipation at the resolved scales. Filtering requirements for atmospheric models and filters used in the ARW model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{organisation}} of deep convection and its misrepresentation in many global {{models is}} the focus of much current interest. We present a new method for quantifying convective organisation based on the identification of convective objects and subsequent derivation of object numbers, areas and separation distances to describe the degree of convective organisation. These parameters are combined into a ‘convection organisation potential’ based on the physical principle of an interaction potential between pairs of convective objects. We apply this technique to simulated and observed fields of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) over the West African monsoon region using data from Met Office Unified Model simulations and satellite observations made by the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget instrument (GERB). We evaluate our method by using it to quantify differences between models with different horizontal grid lengths and representations of convection. Distributions of OLR, precipitation and organisation parameters, the diurnal cycle of convection, and relationships between the meteorology in different states of organisation are compared. Switching from a configuration with parameterised convection to one which allows the model to resolve convective processes at the model <b>gridscale</b> is the leading order factor improving some aspects of model performance, while increased model resolution is the dominant factor for others. However, no single model configuration performs best compared to observations, indicating underlying deficiencies in both model scaling and process understanding...|$|E
40|$|Ensemble sets of {{simulation}} {{experiments were}} conducted with a single column model (SCM) using the Goddard GEOS II GCM physics containing a recent version of the Cumulus Scheme (McRAS) and a biosphere based land-fluxes scheme (SSiB). The study used the 18 July to 5 August 1995 ARM-CART (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement-Cloud Atmospheric Radiation Test-bed) data, which was collected at the ARM-CART site in the mid-western United States and analyzed for single column modeling (SCM) studies. The new findings affirm the earlier findings that the vegetation, which increases the solar energy absorption at the surface together with soil and soil-moisture dependent processes, which modulate the surface, fluxes (particularly evapotranspiration) together help to increase the local rainfall. In addition, the results also show that for the particular study period roughly 50 % of the increased evaporation over the ARM-CART site would be converted into rainfall with the Column, while the remainder would be advected out to the large-scale. Notwithstanding the limitations of only one-way interaction (i. e., the large-scale influencing the regional physics and not vice versa), the current SCM simulations show a very robust relationship. The evaporation-precipitation relationship {{turns out to be}} independent of the soil types, and soil moisture; however, it is weakly dependent on the vegetation cover because of its surface-albedo effect. Clearly, these inferences are prone to weaknesses of the SCM physics, the assumptions of the large-scale being unaffected by <b>gridscale</b> (SCM-scale) changes in moist processes, and other limitations of the evaluation procedures...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal {{momentum}} flux {{in a global}} ocean climate model is formulated as an anisotropic viscosity with two spatially varying coefficients. This friction can be made purely dissipative, does not produce unphysical torques, and satisfies the symmetry conditions required of the Reynolds stress tensor. The two primary design criteria are to have viscosity at values appropriate for the parameterization of missing mesoscale eddies wherever possible and to use other values only where required by the numerics. These other viscosities control numerical noise from advection and generate western boundary currents that are wide enough to be resolved by the coarse grid of the model. Noise on the model <b>gridscale</b> is tolerated provided its amplitude is less than about 0. 05 cm s 21. Parameter tuning is minimized by applying physical and numerical principles. The potential value of this line of model development is demonstrated by comparison with equatorial ocean observations. In particular, the goal of producing model equatorial ocean currents comparable to observations was achieved in the Pacific Ocean. The Equatorial Undercurrent reaches a maximum magnitude of nearly 100 cm s 21 in the annual mean. Also, the spatial distribution of near-surface currents compares favorably with observations from the Global Drifter Program. The exceptions are off the equator; in the model the North Equatorial Countercurrent is improved, but still too weak, and the northward flow {{along the coast of}} South America may be too shallow...|$|E
40|$|Convection-permitting {{ensembles}} {{have led}} to improved forecasts of many atmospheric phenomena. However, to fully utilize these forecasts the dependence of predictability on synoptic conditions needs to be understood. In this study, convective regimes are diagnosed based on a convective timescale which identifies {{the degree to which}} convection is in equilibrium with the large-scale forcing. Six convective cases are examined in a convection-permitting ensemble constructed using the Met Office Unified Model. The ensemble members were generated using small-amplitude buoyancy perturbations added into the boundary layer, which can be considered to represent turbulent fluctuations close to the <b>gridscale.</b> Perturbation growth is shown to occur on different scales with an order of magnitude difference between the regimes (O(1 km) for cases closer to non-equilibrium convection and O(10 km) for cases closer to equilibrium convection). This difference reflects the fact that cell locations are essentially random in the equilibrium events after the first 12 h of the forecast, indicating a more rapid upscale perturbation growth compared to the non-equilibrium events. Furthermore, large temporal variability is exhibited in all perturbation growth diagnostics for the nonequilibrium regime. Two boundary condition driven cases are also considered and show similar characteristics to the non-equilibrium cases, implying that caution is needed to interpret the timescale when initiation is not within the domain. Further understanding of perturbation growth within the different regimes could lead {{to a better understanding of}} where ensemble design improvements can be made beyond increasing the model resolution and could improve interpretation of forecasts...|$|E
40|$|Discretized {{numerical}} simulations are {{a powerful}} tool for investigation of nonlinear MHD turbulence in accretion disks. However, confidence in their quantitative predictions requires a demonstration that further refinement of the spatial <b>gridscale</b> would not result in any significant change. This has yet to be accomplished, particularly for global disk simulations. In this paper, we combine data from previously published stratified shearing box simulations and new global disk simulations to calibrate several quantitative diagnostics by which one can estimate progress toward numerical convergence. Using these diagnostics, we find that the established criterion for an adequate numerical description of linear growth of the magneto-rotational instability (the number of cells across a wavelength of the fastest-growing vertical wavenumber mode) can be extended to a criterion for adequate description of nonlinear MHD disk turbulence, but the standard required is more stringent. We also find that azimuthal resolution, which has not often been extensively examined in previous studies, can significantly affect the evolution of the poloidal magnetic field. We further analyze the comparative resolution requirements of a small sample of initial magnetic field geometries; not surprisingly, more complicated initial field geometries require higher spatial resolution. Otherwise, they tend to evolve to qualitatively similar states if evolved for sufficient time. Applying our quantitative resolution criteria to a sample of previously published global simulations, we find that, with perhaps a single exception, they are significantly under-resolved, and therefore underestimate the magnetic turbulence and resulting stress levels throughout the accretion flow.

40|$|Dynamic TOPMODEL {{is applied}} to the Maimai M 8 {{catchment}} (3. 8 ha), New Zealand using rainfall–runoff and water table information in model calibration. Different parametric representations of hillslope and valley bottom landscape units (LU's) were used to improve the spatial representation of the model structure. The continuous time series water table information is obtained from tensiometric observations from both near stream (NS) and hillslope (P 5) locations having different responses to rainfall events. For each location, and within an area equivalent to an effective model <b>gridscale</b> (25 m 2), a number of tensiometer readings at different depths were available (11 for the NS site and nine for the P 5 site). Using this information a distribution of water table elevations for each time step at each location was calculated. The distribution of water table elevations was used to derive fuzzy estimates of the water table depth for the whole time series that includes the temporal variability of the uncertainty in the observations. These data were used to constrain the spatial representation of the model having previously conditioned the model using the rainfall–runoff data. Model conditioning was assessed using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation procedure. Results show that many combinations of parameter values for the two LU's were able to simulate the rainfall–runoff data. Further constraining of the model responses using the fuzzy water table elevations at both locations considerably reduced the number of behavioural parameter sets. An evaluation of the distributions of behavioural parameter sets showed that improvements to the model structure for the two LU's were required, especially for simulations of the response at the hillslope location...|$|E
