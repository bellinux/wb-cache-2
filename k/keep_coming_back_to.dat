During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, [...] "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. And they <b>keep</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market." [...] The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, Coco, continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.|$|E

The intros are from 4 to 27 seconds long and are all spoken-word. Every skit follows the same theme. In the first skit, a man talks about feeling lonely while walking alone on a cold night, ultimately coming to a disco and entering ("for no reason, I go in"). The man, who by the second skit is clearly the main character and narrator of the story, goes on to talk about seeing a woman at the disco, but it is clear to the listener that they never meet. He <b>keeps</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the disco night after night, looking for her. The general feeling is that she became an obsession, and that without her, the narrator could not be happy ("without her, the world was darker").
