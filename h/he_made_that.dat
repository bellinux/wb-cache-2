25|$|Paramount {{purchased}} the screen {{rights to the}} play Detective Story as a possible vehicle for Ladd, and he was keen to do it, but the role ended up going to Kirk Douglas. Instead Ladd was cast in Branded, a Western. In February 1950 Paramount announced that Ladd would star in a film version of the novel Shane. Before <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> film, he appeared in another Western, Red Mountain, produced by Hal Wallis.|$|E
25|$|Illingworth {{can perhaps}} be {{considered}} {{responsible for the}} victories in several of those tighter contests. For example at Headingley in 1969 the West Indies were 219 – 3 chasing 280 when Illingworth's inspired bowling change had Basil Butcher caught behind and wickets fell with just about every bowling change <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> afternoon. Similarly at Sydney in the 7th Test of the 1970–71 series it was Illingworth, deprived of his star batsman Geoff Boycott and his star bowler John Snow, who somehow pressurised the Australian batsmen into capitulation.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 2009, Dayton {{announced}} his candidacy for Governor of Minnesota. In a crowded Democratic field of challengers, Dayton chose {{to bypass the}} state caucuses and convention {{in favor of the}} primary election. He stated <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> decision because the primary election is a more democratic method of choosing a candidate. Possibly due to his known dislike of fundraising for campaigns, he relied on personal funds for his campaign. On May 24, 2010, he announced State Senator Yvonne Prettner Solon of Duluth as his running mate for Lieutenant Governor. On August 10, 2010, Dayton defeated the DFL-endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher in a close primary election, 41.33% to 39.75%;) Dayton was later endorsed by the Minnesota DFL to earn his party's nomination for governor.|$|E

He made his first-class debut for Southern Punjab {{at the age of}} 14 in a 1960–61 Ranji Trophy match against Jammu and Kashmir.

25|$|The {{event that}} finally took {{him off the}} road came in Houston in 1993. He had made a large score playing high-stakes pool one night. The {{following}} morning while attempting to leave his hotel room with his then girlfriend, two men shoved the two {{back into the room}} and at gunpoint demanded the money he had won. Not satisfied with the amount of money Wetch handed over, they placed a bag over his head and beat him. Though he escaped the ordeal with only minor injuries, he promised himself he would only make one more road trip to gather a stake, and then he would quit. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> final trip and used the money to open up a pool room with partner David Wagner, Jimmy's Pro Billiards in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. The following year, in 1994, he took the ultimate step for a road player, shucking aside his anonymity by going pro.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 {{season was}} to be his last with Sussex, with Mansell making twenty {{first-class}} appearances, the last of which came against Lancashire in that season's County Championship. He scored 448 runs in his final season, which came {{at an average of}} 16.00, with a high score of 52.

500|$|The fourth English edition, {{published}} in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on {{different parts of}} the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German [...] "electric tube" [...] with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.|$|E

500|$|Entering the Phillies' 2013 season, {{despite his}} quick {{ascension}} through {{the minor leagues}} and strong performance late in 2012 for the Triple-A IronPigs, Pettibone {{was considered to be}} behind Tyler Cloyd, Adam Morgan, and Ethan Martin on the organizational depth chart for starting pitchers. He began the year with Lehigh Valley, and despite a 7.71 ERA in his first three starts, the Phillies called him up to make his major league debut, admittedly [...] "sooner than ... anticipated", according to Pettibone. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> debut on April 22, 2013, starting for the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates, pitching 5 innings, striking out six, while reaching base on a walk and scoring a run for Philadelphia; he earned a no decision in the Phillies' 3–2 defeat of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He remained in the starting rotation for the next several months, but in July, the Phillies ended his season due to an inflamed rotator cuff. In total, his numbers were commensurate with those he posted in the minor leagues – 18 starts, 5–4 record, 4.04 ERA, 100 innings pitched.|$|E
500|$|Alfred, by [...] in {{full control}} of Wessex and {{at the height of}} his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the {{exclusion}} of his brother Æthelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at all. That it did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season, Wally Hammond's England cricket team travelled to Australia for the 1946–47 Ashes series. [...] In {{a warm-up}} match before the series, McCool performed well for Queensland against the English tourists at the Brisbane Cricket Ground (the 'Gabba), taking nine wickets and [...] "the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated {{in the presence}} of a snake". He was selected for the First Test at the same ground the following week. He just missed out on a century on his Ashes debut, scoring 95 and only bowling one over as Australia won the Test by an innings and 332 runs. [...] In the Second Test at Sydney, McCool took eight wickets, including the prize wicket of Hammond twice. [...] Australia won by an innings and 33 runs. [...] The Third Test at Melbourne saw McCool make his maiden Test century, 104 not out in a drawn match. [...] The Melbourne businessman and underworld figure, John Wren had promised McCool one pound for every run <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> innings; this was at a time when ten pounds was the average weekly wage in Australia. The cheque—given to McCool the next day—allowed him to place a deposit on a house.|$|E

[...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
