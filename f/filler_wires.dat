40|$|AbstractIn {{laser beam}} welding of copper its {{material}} properties require high intensities of the laser beam for a stable process, which are often realized by small focal diameters.

A way to increase tolerable gap widths {{is the use of}} <b>filler</b> <b>wires,</b> which leads to higher energy consumption per unit length of the process, as extra energy is necessary to melt the filler wire. As some surface coatings are known to reduce energy consumption in laser beam welding of copper, this paper investigates the influence of surface coated <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> on weld seam properties of laser beam welded of copper alloys with the aim of improved usage of the energy provided for the process. For this reason different coating materials and thicknesses of the <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> are used within the experiments.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was undertaken {{to examine the}} suitability of pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steels in groove joint configurations with metal cored filler wire. Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of metal cored <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires.

40|$|AbstractAlthough laser brazing is well established, the {{energy-related}} {{efficiency of}} this joining method is quite low.

40|$|Abstract. Joining of iron with {{aluminium}} in {{the liquid}} phase is complicated {{due to the}} formation of brittle intermetallics within Fe-Al melts. In this work we present the technology of a laser welding-brazing (LWB) process to join zinc-coated steel and aluminium sheets in an overlap geometry. The process is divided into welding of the aluminium sheet and brazing of filler material and molten aluminium sheet onto the zinc-covered steel sheet to avoid the liquid stage of iron. It is possible to join those materials with a single laser beam. However, with a second laser beam, the melt flow can be controlled more effectively and the wetting behaviour can be improved by preheating the zinc-covered steel sheet surface. This is beneficial since the process works without any flux agent. Wetting lengths increase by using this technique and generate a joint that exceeds the tensile strength of the base material. Due to the zinc cover on the steel sheet there are two possible filler materials that have miscibility with zinc as well as aluminium. Zinc based filler materials have the advantage of a lower melting point and thus lower process temperatures. And aluminium based <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> result in more ductile brazed seams, making it possible to deform such joints in a later application as tailored blanks...|$|E

The modern arc technologies such as modified pulsed spray arc have been used to promote the deeper penetration of the filler material in the narrow laser weld.

40|$|Multi-material {{structures}} pose {{an attractive}} option for overcoming {{some of the}} central challenges in lightweight design. An exceptionally high potential for creating cost-effective lightweight solutions is attributed to the combination of steel and aluminum. However, these materials are also particularly difficult to join due to their tendency to form intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The growth of these compounds is facilitated by high temperatures and long process times. Due to their high brittleness, IMCs can severely weaken a joint. Thus, it is only possible to create durable steel-aluminum joints when the formation of IMCs can be limited to a non-critical level. To meet this goal, a new joining method has been designed. The method {{is based on the}} combination of a continuous wave (pw) and a pulsed laser (pw) source. Laser beams from both sources are superimposed in a common process zone. This makes it possible to apply the advantages of laser brazing to mixed-metal joints without requiring the use of chemical fluxes. The double beam technology was first tested in bead-on-plate experiments using different filler wire materials. Based on the results of these tests, a process for joining steel and aluminum in a double-flanged configuration is now being developed. The double flanged seams are joined using zinc- or aluminum-based <b>filler</b> <b>wires.</b> Microsections of selected seams show {{that it is possible to}} achieve good base material wetting while limiting the growth of IMCs to acceptable measures.

All <b>filler</b> <b>wires</b> investigated contained 19 %Cr and 1. 8 %Mo, equivalent to the base metal K 44 X chemistry, but various titanium and niobium contents. Chemical analyses and microstructural observations of fusion zones revealed the need of a minimum Ti content of 0. 15 % to obtain a completely equiaxed grain structure. This structure conferred on the fusion zone a good ductility even in the as-welded state at room temperature.

Two post-weld heat treatments (i. e. stress relief annealing, solution treatment and aging) are investigated and compared with the as-welded condition. Although some welding defects such as underfill and porosity have been observed, high quality welds can be obtained using a high power Nd:YAG laser. Underfill defect is found to increase but the porosity area decreases with increasing welding speed. The use of the filler wire decreases the underfill defect. However, the porosity area increases with increasing joint gap. The hardness is maximum in the fusion zone (FZ) followed by a sharp decrease in the heat affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The low temperature annealing process increases the hardness of the fusion zone but the combination of the high temperature solution treatment followed by aging decreases the fusion zone hardness almost to the base metal values. Tensile testing shows that the joint efficiency varies between 95 and 105 %. The porosity and underfill are the two main defects for failure in the FZ and HAZ, respectively.
