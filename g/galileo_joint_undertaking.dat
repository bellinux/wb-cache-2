40|$|A {{combined}} GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS user receiver {{represents a}} key {{technology for the}} upcoming European satellite navigation system GALILEO. The receiver is the main physical interface between the system and the user. It transforms the GALILEO signal-in-space into services for the citizens. Within the project GAMMA a consortium of nine industrial and research partners, lead by Fraunhofer IIS, located in Nuremberg, Germany, develop an assisted GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS receiver prototype and perform research {{on the development of}} a Multichannel GALILEO/GPS/EGNOS Signal Generator for the design and evaluation of the receiver. For the assistance data link an UMTS communications link will be emulated. The GNSS Signal Generator will be responsible for GPS/GALILEO signal generation and the correction and acquisition aiding data provision. Further work encompasses studies of indoor navigation capabilities, reconfigurable and hence reusable digital hardware components, assisted acquisition co ncepts and finally low cost optimizations. The GAMMA receiver will fulfill both main requirements of the second call of <b>GALILEO</b> <b>JOINT</b> <b>UNDERTAKING</b> to elaborate core technologies and to implement a low cost/low power receiver solution for mass market applications. Low cost and a high degree of integration is mainly dependent on the design of the RF-front-end. The project was started in Nov. 2005 and will run for 2 years until Oct. 2007. The initial work was focused on application scenarios, specification and system design. Now the receiver front-end and baseband solutions will be developed, complemented by the research on the development of a GNSS Signal Generator and an emulated assistance data link for a complete end-to-end demonstration.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the performance that can be expected from future global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The next decade promises drastic improvements and additions to existing satellite navigation infrastructure. Plans for GPS modernization include a civilian code measurement on the L 2 frequency and a new L 5 signal at 1176. 45 MHz. Current speculations indicate that a fully operational constellation with these improvements could be available by 2013 (Hothem, 2004). Simultaneously, the <b>Galileo</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> is in the development and validation stages of introducing a parallel GNSS called Galileo. Galileo will also transmit freely available satellite navigation signals on three frequencies and is scheduled to be fully operational as early as 2008 (Wibberley, 2004). In response to these momentous changes, this research investigates the impact that the new signals will have on precise kinematic positioning. Effective techniques for processing future GNSS measurements are presented and a thorough treatment of the measurement correlations and processing strategies is given. These strategies have bee...|$|E
40|$|User {{requirements}} {{for the performance of}} GlobaL Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) -based road applications have been significantly increasing in recent years. Safety systems based on vehicle localization, electronic fee-collection systems, and traveler information services are just a few examples of interesting applications requiring onboard equipment (OBE) capable of offering a high available accurate position, even in unfriendly environments with low satellite visibility such as built-up areas or tunnels and at low cost. In addition to that, users and service providers demand from the OBEs not only accurate continuous positioning but integrity information of the reliability of this position as well. Specifically, in life-critical applications, high-integrity monitored positioning is absolutely required. This paper presents a solution based on the fusion of GNSS and inertial sensors (a Global Positioning System/Satellite-Based Augmentation System/Inertial Navigation System integrated system) running an extended Kalman filter combined with an interactive multimodel method (IMM-EKF). The solution developed in this paper supplies continuous positioning in marketable conditions and a meaningful trust level of the given solution. A set of tests performed in controlled and real scenarios proves the suitability of the proposed IMM-EKF implementation as compared with lowcost GNSS-based solutions, dead reckoning systems, single-model EKF, and other filtering approaches of the current literature.

40|$|Among its priorities, the <b>Galileo</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> (GJU) is {{in charge}} of {{managing}} the Research and Development activities related to the Galileo Programme. In the context of the European Commission 6 th Framework Programme, GJU has initiated the Galileo Receiver Preliminary Development. Presently the GAlileo Receiver Development Activities (GARDA) project is running at this scope. This paper focuses on the Galileo Receiver ANAnalysis and Design Application (GRANADA), a new concept of Galileo SW Receiver Simulator, which development is part of the GARDA project [1], [2]. The tool has been developed by Deimos Space under Alenia Spazio specification. A Software (SW) Receiver is a key element in the GARDA project. GRANADA covers a dual role: test-bench for integration and evaluation of receiver technologies on one side, and SW receiver as asset for GNSS application developers on the other side. GRANADA is conceived as a modular and configurable tool, in which the user can embed and test his/her own algorithms with a user-friendly interface. It runs on a standard Windows PC, allowing the maximum use form people not involved in the development. The application recreates the bit-true signal processing chain of a Galileo receiver. It models the RF front-end, and processes IF measurements, including the correlation and 1 This paper has been published at the conference ENC-GNSS 2005, held in MUNICH, GERMANY from 19 to 22 JULY 2005. filtering, signal and data processing and PVT computation, allowing the use of GPS combined with Galileo.

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt {{that one of the most}} {{interesting}} and revolutionary, but also complicated and challenging space projects of today is Galileo, Europe’s own full-fledged second-generation navigation satellite system. Developed jointly by the European Union through the Commission and the European Space Agency, Galileo should by the end of the decade have thirty operational satellites in middle-earth-orbits providing timing, positioning and navigation signals across the globe. From the very beginning Galileo was envisaged in particular by the Commission as a public-private-partnership (PPP). On the one hand, a private concessionaire should operate the system as of full operational capability (originally scheduled for 2008, but more likely to occur not until a few years thereafter) and provide, market and sell its services – the Open Service (OS), the Commercial Service (CS), the Safety-of-Life Service (SOL), the Public Regulated Service (PRS) and a contribution to existing Search-and-Rescue services (SAR). On the other hand, a public body should monitor all such activities and the evident public interests in them – keeping them safe, secure and in mankind’s interest in general. Such a public side to the PPP-equation was given its first embodiment with the creation of the Galileo Interim Support Structure (GISS) in 2001. The GISS was essentially a number of ESA officials being seconded under Commission funding (and control) to supervise and guide the various projects under the EU’s Fifth Framework Programme supporting the definition and development phase of Galileo. The major task of the GISS ended up to be dealing with the intricacies of what had become the GALILEI Study, a cluster of originally separate projects dealing with key Galileo issues. A next level of institutionalisation was achieved with the establishment of the <b>Galileo</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> (GJU), a unique daughter entity of ESA and the European Commission as the two principal international entities behind Galileo. 3 The GJU kick-started the next phase of Galileo by, most fundamentally, initiating and supervising the tendering process for the private Galileo operator, which was to lead to the signing of a concession contract by the end of 2005 or shortly thereafter. In addition, the GJU should prepare the introduction of Galileo more generally speaking, which included responsibility for the guidance of a number of Galileo-related research projects under the EU’s Sixth Framework Programme. Currently, the third stage of institutionalisation has been given effect by means of the creation – at least on paper – of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority (EGSA) in 2004. With the proper start of operations of EGSA, expected by mid- 2006 or shortly thereafter, the GJU will be dissolved. Contrary to EGSA, the GJU was from the beginning envisaged to be a temporary entity. The current article tries to provide a first, rather preliminary and provisional evaluation of what EGSA will be able to do, by way of supervision of the private operation of the Galileo system – and hence also what it will likely not be able to do...|$|E
