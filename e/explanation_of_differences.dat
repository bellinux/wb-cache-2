The present experiment examined attention in <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> national group <b>differences.</b> Two hundred and thirty-nine Irish and British students read vignettes that attributed either relatively more overconsumption of alcohol, or of fatty foods, to either Irish or British people, and wrote <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> these group <b>differences</b> in their own words. As predicted, the explanations focused more on the group described as over-consumers. Participants did not explain the national out-group more than the national in-group and did not explain the Irish or the British more. Rather, explanations focused particularly on the Irish only when they were described as over-consumers of alcohol. These findings show flexibility in the setting of norms for comparison, and an influence of essentialist stereotypes, rather than ethnocentrism or historical power differences, on the spontaneous framing <b>of</b> <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> group <b>differences...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is {{currently}} a lack of empirical work on cross-cultural differences in ethical attitudes towards day-to-day management decision making in organizations. Work that currently exists {{in the area of}} management ethics also lacks cultural <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> <b>differences.</b> The present study tries to overcome these deficiencies by providing a model of ethical decision-making that is based on cultural antecedents, which may explain <b>differences</b> in judgements <b>of</b> ethicality, and consequential ethical attitudes or professed behaviour. This article reports a 10 -nation empirical study that focuses on ethical ‘grey areas’ that form part of the day-to-day decision-making in organizations across the globe. Countries were selected to represent variation along two cultural dimensions of ‘collectivism–individualism’, and ‘uncertainty avoidance’. These dimensions were then used to explain national cultural <b>differences</b> in judgements <b>of</b> ethicality of decision items concerned with relations with external stakeholders, with the corporation and with the group. Results generally confirm that these dimensions, once elaborated to consider more recent detailed research, provide explanations for differences in ethical attitudes among national groups. This study points the way to further investigations based on cultural <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> in managers’ ethical attitudes and behaviour...|$|R

State antiquity contributes significantly to the <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>differences</b> in growth rates, explaining half {{of the difference in}} growth rates between countries like China and Mauritania, which are located at the two ends of the spectrum.

We study the impact of institutional factors on the efficiency of 67 public German universities (1998 - 2003). We present some evidence that university costs and outputs are correlated with institutional settings such as the university management structure. Furthermore, econometric evidence from a single-stage stochastic frontier model (based on a cost function) suggests that universities located in states with a comparatively liberal legal framework are more efficient than those universities operating under more restrictive state regulation.

Both studies find that in surveys the rate of individuals who state that they would prefer to be self-employed to working as an employee is far higher than the actual rate of self-employment. The authors argue that differences in {{job satisfaction}} {{might be due to}} capital constraints for becoming self-employed. Capital constraints imply that {{only a small percentage of}} individuals who prefer self-employment can afford to do so. The group of employees therefore consists, at least to a large extent, of persons who would prefer to be self-employed and are therefore less satisfied with their works an employee.|$|E
