25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In summer 2014, Allardyce signed midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté, left-back Aaron Cresswell, {{attacker}} Enner Valencia, right-back (on {{loan from}} Arsenal) Carl Jenkinson, striker Diafra Sakho, defensive midfielder Alex Song (on loan from Barcelona), midfielder Morgan Amalfitano, and forward Mauro Zárate. In October 2014, pundits like BBC's Robbie Savage were commenting about the team's [...] "more attractive and attacking playing style" [...] or [...] "the statistics [...] show {{the progress that}} West Ham have {{made in the last}} few months." [...] Allardyce was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Month for October 2014 after three wins for West Ham out of four games played that month. Allardyce left West Ham on 24 May 2015, {{the final day of the}} season, after his contract was not renewed. Allardyce stated that [...] "I didn't want to stay. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either". His West Ham side had finished 12th in the 2014–15 season, one place higher than in the 2013–14 season.|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
6000|$|Colville {{forced a}} nervous laugh. [...] "Really, I'm so little {{used to this}} sort of affair that I don't know whether I have any wish. Imogene is here with <b>you,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> would wish to do something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> would say, Mr. Kenton, but I must say I didn't expect it of you. I think it's cowardly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was very}} unsatisfactory. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> {{went to find}} out whether Tom was in love with the girl. Was she as pretty as ever?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Albarn {{has been}} a vocal critic of celebrity culture: [...] "We need to {{dismantle}} very significant parts of our culture and really re-examine them. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> start with the celebrity thing... {{you have to get}} rid of things like The X Factor immediately." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the October 16, 2011 {{episode of}} Larry King Live, {{when asked if}} he had faith, Depp replied, [...] "Yes. I have faith in my kids. And I have—I have faith, you know, that as long as you keep moving forward, just keep walking forward, things will be all right, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>you</b> know. Faith in terms of religion, I don't—religion is not my specialty, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in Playboy magazine in January 1979, Brando said: [...] "You've seen every single race besmirched, but you never saw {{an image of the}} kike because the Jews were ever so watchful for that—and rightly so. They never allowed it to be shown on screen. The Jews have done so much for the world that, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>you</b> get extra disappointed because they didn't pay attention to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not so}} good a lawyer, Miss Clack," [...] {{he remarked}} in a meditative manner, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>supposed.</b> <b>You</b> don't know how to let well alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I endured {{it all in}} silence. So long as {{you were}} his, or so long as <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> to be his, I hid my secret loyally. Did I not?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly,' said Ernest. 'I said he couldn't go, {{because before}} he asked you I had refused him permission, and <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{know he was}} asking you to reverse my decision.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1917, Heifetz {{was elected}} as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the {{national}} fraternity {{for men in}} music, by the fraternity's Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. As he was aged 16 at the time, he was perhaps the youngest person ever elected to membership in the organization. Heifetz remained {{in the country and}} became an American citizen in 1925. An apocryphal story circulates that tells of an interaction with one of the Marx brothers: when he told the brother (usually Groucho or Harpo) that he had been earning his living as a musician since the age of seven, he received the reply, [...] "Before that, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>you</b> were just a bum." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, Toulmin's {{daughter}} Jane drowned. In {{the face}} of this hardship and his longtime political persecutions, he stood strong. For example, during his ministry in Taunton at the Mary Street Unitarian Chapel, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, in a 1798 letter to John Prior Estlin, [...] "I walked into Taunton (eleven miles) and back again, and performed the divine services for Dr. Toulmin. [...] <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> must have heard that his daughter, (Jane, on 15 April 1798) in a melancholy derangement, suffered herself to be swallowed up by the tide on the sea-coast between Sidmouth and Bere (sic. Beer). [...] These events cut cruelly into the hearts of old men: but the good Dr. Toulmin bears it like the true practical Christian,— there is indeed a tear in his eye, but that eye is lifted up to the Heavenly Father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{begun the}} Ministry of All the Talents. Fitzwilliam {{did not take}} a {{prominent}} role in this new government, preferring to leave this to those who he could trust to implement policies he was in agreement with. He still opposed Fox on abolition of the slave trade but did nothing to stop the government from passing it, though he did speak in the Lords on 24 June 1806 that he [...] "felt rather alarmed at the consequences the resolutions might produce" [...] but [...] "he could not help feeling disposed to support them". Following Fox's death in September Fitzwilliam offered to resign his office to Addington (now Viscount Sidmouth) so Lord Holland could become Lord Privy Seal. Fitzwilliam remained in the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio, with Lord Grenville saying that this was [...] "a condition to which we all attach the highest importance". The Cabinet proposed that Fitzwilliam be made Marquess of Rockingham, with Grey writing to him on 25 September: [...] " [...] would be particularly gratifying to myself as marking at this moment a just respect for the principles and character of the party first united under the Marquess of Rockingham, and so long supported by Fox, and not as one upon which <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> to be personally solicitous". Fitzwilliam replied two days later that the decision was not a Cabinet but an individual one and that Rockingham's memory might have been honoured if the marquessate was revived in 1782 or 1783, when: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] said Mrs Null. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> had {{got through}} with your {{business}} with Junius, I {{did not wish}} to detain you here any longer than was necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I kept your breakfast waitin' {{for you for}} a good while," [...] said she, [...] "but as <b>you</b> didn't come, <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> were takin' {{breakfast in}} your own house, and I cleared it away." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel {{are still}} {{critical}} of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a [...] "fashionable trend" [...] being promoted due to [...] "sexual hedonism" [...] and broached {{the question of}} whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers. Lesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. She later admitted that [...] "the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy" [...] and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. [...] "The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs {{and all the rest of}} it. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...." [...] She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially but objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. [...] "'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'" [...] While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution [...] "which everyone thought I would oppose" [...] in order to [...] "preempt any debate" [...] and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she grew}} up in Peoria, Illinois, she knew only one gay man. She said, [...] "the whole idea of {{homosexuality}} made me profoundly uneasy".

She accepted lesbian sexuality, albeit not its politicization. In 1995, at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, she found advice given by Chinese authorities to taxi drivers that naked lesbians would be [...] "cavorting" [...] in their cars so that the drivers should hang sheets outside their cab windows, and that lesbians would have AIDS and so drivers should carry disinfectants, to be [...] "ridiculous", [...] "incredibly stupid" [...] and [...] "insulting". In 1997, she wrote that [...] "children…will ideally come from mother and father." [...] She wrote in 2000, [...] "I'm more relaxed about the whole issue now".|$|E

6000|$|... "If you {{had asked}} me to keep track of your growl, I might be able to tell you," [...] remarked the Lion sleepily. [...] "But frankly, Toto, <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> were taking care of it yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly I did not, Miss Hawtrey. I {{heard that}} you left town a {{fortnight}} before I did, but, though I had no particular reason for doing so, <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> had gone down to Lincolnshire. When did you arrive here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] asked Fulkerson. [...] "Well, we {{must see}} {{what can be}} done. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> would be all settled by this time, or I should have humped myself to find you something. None of those places I gave you amounts to anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Skinner, {{there you}} are!" [...] he said breezily. [...] "Miss Chester {{was telling me}} that you had left my step-mother. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> sailed on the boat before mine. I came over on the Caronia. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> didn't expect to see me again so soon, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] she remarked. [...] "If you are {{determined}} to rush into danger, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> must.

6000|$|... "Well; lies mean lies.

6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} all this," [...] replied Colville. [...] "Who has proposed to exclude you?

6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have told you the story at all, Ben Ibyn, had <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>you</b> would have cared to inquire into the matter. Of course, I {{will tell you the}} name if you insist upon it, but I would much rather you did not ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> do till it's {{necessary}} to decide them.
