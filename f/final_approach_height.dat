5000|$|On 4 April 1994, a Saab 340 {{operating}} KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 crashed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, killing {{three and}} seriously injuring nine people. A faulty warning light caused {{the crew to}} mistakenly believe that the engine suffered from low oil pressure. On <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> at a <b>height</b> of 90 ft, the captain decided to go around and gave full throttle, however only on the number one engine leaving the other in flight idle. Because of this, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.|$|R
50|$|On 4 April 1994, Flight KL433 to Cardiff, a Saab 340 {{operated}} by KLM Cityhopper, returned to Schiphol after setting {{the number two}} engine to flight idle because the crew mistakenly believed that the engine suffered from low oil pressure because of a faulty warning light. On <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> at a <b>height</b> of 90 ft, the captain decided to go-around and gave full throttle on only the number one engine leaving the other in flight idle. The airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank. Of the twenty-four people on board, three were killed including the captain. Nine others were seriously injured.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{landing gear}} of the {{aircraft}} hit the seawall short of the runway as the crew attempted to abort the landing and execute a go-around. Based on preliminary data from the flight data recorder (FDR), the NTSB said the plane's airspeed on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fell to 34 knots below its target approach speed of 137 knots (254km/h; 158mph). A preliminary review of FAA radar return data did not show an abnormally steep descent curve, although the crew did recognize that they began high on the <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> At a <b>height</b> of , eight seconds before impact, the airspeed had dropped to [...] According to initial reports from the cockpit crew, the plane's autothrottle was set for the correct reference speed, but until the runway's precision approach path indicator (PAPI) showed them significantly below the glide path, the pilots were unaware the autothrottle was failing to maintain that speed. The instructor pilot stated that the PAPI indicated a deviation below the glide path at approximately 500 feet above ground level, and he attempted to correct it at that time. Between 500 and 200 feet, the instructor pilot also reported a lateral deviation which they attempted to correct.|$|R
5000|$|In the US, it {{is called}} the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix (FAF) and marked on a NACO IAP by a {{lightning}} bolt symbol and on a Jeppesen terminal chart {{by the end of the}} glide slope path symbol. It is the point in space where the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment begins on the instrument approach; the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point on a non-precision approach is marked by a maltese cross symbol. In the US, where the approach navigation aid is on the field and there is no depicted, the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point is [...] "where the aircraft is established inbound on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course from the procedure turn and where the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> descent may be commenced".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Final</b> <b>approach</b> segment: For a PA or APV, {{this segment}} starts where the {{glideslope}} intercepts the glideslope intercept altitude plane. For an NPA, this segment {{starts at the}} FAF, <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> point (FAP), or where the aircraft is established on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> course. This segment ends at either the designated MAP or upon landing.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Final</b> <b>approach.</b> A {{descending}} {{flight path}} {{in the direction of}} landing along the extended runway centerline from the base leg to the runway. The last section of the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> is sometimes referred to as short final.|$|R
50|$|The eight-pointed {{cross is}} also used to {{identify}} the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix in a non-precision instrument approach (one that lacks precision vertical guidance), in contrast to the use of a lightning bolt type icon, which identifies the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> fix in a precision approach.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>final</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> (also called <b>final</b> leg and <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> leg) is {{the last}} leg in an aircraft's approach to landing, when the aircraft is lined up with the runway and descending for landing. In aviation radio terminology, it is often shortened to [...] "final".|$|R
25|$|Failure {{to use the}} {{automatic}} direction finder (ADF) and other equipment for an integrated control of the airplane during the <b>final</b> <b>approach,</b> while using the satellite navigation system, KLN-90B (in violation of the Airplane Flight Manual which prohibits the use of GPS information during <b>final</b> <b>approach).</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> over an upsloping terrain {{with a flat}} runway, or to {{an unusually}} narrow or long runway may produce the visual {{illusion}} of being too high on <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> The pilot may then increase their rate of descent, positioning the aircraft unusually low on the approach path.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} speed control law for precision in-trail airborne self-spacing during <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> This control law {{was designed to}} provide an operationally viable means to obtain a desired runway threshold crossing time or minimum distance, one aircraft relative to another. The control law compensates for dissimilar <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> speeds between aircraft pairs and provides guidance for a stable <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> This algorithm has been extensively tested in Monte Carlo simulation and has been evaluated in piloted simulation, with preliminary results indicating acceptability from operational and workload standpoints...|$|R
50|$|This {{accident}} was blamed {{entirely on the}} bad judgment of the Captain, Gale C. Kehmeier, for conducting the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> from a position that was too high and {{too close to the}} airport to permit a descent at the normal and safe rate. He allowed the plane to fly the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment (in visual conditions) at a descent rate of 2,300 feet per minute (3 times the safe descent rate). When the plane crossed the outer marker, which marks the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> segment, it was 2,000 feet too high.|$|R
