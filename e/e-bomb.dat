5000|$|... "Null-O" [...] is a 1958 {{science fiction}} short story by Philip K. Dick. This rather brief story {{examines}} {{the concept of}} totally unempathic and 'logical' humans ("Null-O"'s) in an obvious parody of the plot and concepts of The Pawns of Null-A by A. E. van Vogt. These beings view individual collections of matter, i.e. any object, as subjective structures and see the true state of reality as an 'undifferentiated world of pure energy'. They can also move their ears independently, giving them excellent hearing. After attaining positions of power they proceed {{with a plan to}} ultimately return everything in the universe to this state. This is to be done by the construction of successively more powerful bombs, ultimately resulting in the rather improbable 'U-bomb' that will homogenise the whole universe. The Null-O plan is halted, however, when the 'ordinary' people of the world, who have survived the nuclear destruction of Earth's surface in the shelters built by their employers, rise up in drilling machines to stop the construction of an 'E-Bomb' designed to destroy Earth, and succeed in destroying both the <b>E-Bomb</b> prototype and the Null-O's themselves.|$|E

Electromagnetic weapons seem to involve key elements for the future battlefield; they offer advantages over conventional weaponry by providing nonlethality, the advantage of attack at the speed of light, fast engagement of multiple targets, potentially low operational cost, and wide-area coverage for offensive and defensive purposes. This thesis proposes hypothetical electromagnetic bombs (<b>e-bomb)</b> and classifies e-bombs into three isocategories depending on power sources. It also assesses the potential lethality effects on different targets based on a developed MATLAB Simulation Model. It also provides an understanding of the principles of High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) and High Power Microwave (HPM) Weapons. In addition, a measure of effectiveness model is proposed to compare the hypothetical <b>e-bomb,</b> HEMP and HPM weapons. The strategic effects on military affairs will be assessed. Finally, this study will help the Turkish Armed Forces decide on investment in <b>e-bomb</b> research and development (R&D) to improve combat capabilities in the future battlefield.

50|$|The {{range of}} NNEMP weapons {{is much less}} than nuclear EMP. Nearly all NNEMP devices used as weapons require {{chemical}} explosives as their initial energy source, producing only 10−6 (one millionth) the energy of nuclear explosives of similar weight. The electromagnetic pulse from NNEMP weapons must come from within the weapon, while nuclear weapons generate EMP as a secondary effect. These facts limit the range of NNEMP weapons, but allow finer target discrimination. The effect of small <b>e-bombs</b> {{has proven to be}} sufficient for certain terrorist or military operations. Examples of such operations include the destruction of electronic control systems critical to the operation of many ground vehicles and aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedLike High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP), high power microwaves (HPM) produce intense energies, which may overload or damage various electrical system components such as microcircuits. This thesis investigates possible {{effects of a}} hypothetically designed HEMP-like weapon, an "e-bomb," on electronically equipped target systems. The procedure to determine these possible effects is to estimate the electromagnetic coupling from first principles and simulations using a coupling model program (CEMPAT), pursuing a feasible geometry of attack, practical antennas, best coupling approximations of ground conductivity and permittivity, a reasonable system of interest representation from specifications, threat waveshape and operating frequency. The analysis procedure investigates roles of these factors contributes to the <b>e-bomb</b> coupling scenario. Those possible <b>e-bomb</b> effect results are then compared to a published and experimentally created threshold level table to determine whether any upset or damage is formed on the target system. Based on this comparison, the results are evaluated {{with respect to the}} factors that caused them to exceed, or not exceed, the threshold levels. Additionally, a conventional weapon attack scenario for the same target system is created. Its results are compared to the <b>e-bomb</b> attack. Finally, operational recommendations are given along with advantages and disadvantages for each type of attack. Turkish Air Force author...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Like High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP), {{high power}} {{microwaves}} (HPM) produce intense energies, which may overload or damage various electrical system components such as microcircuits. This work theoretically investigates possible {{effects of a}} hypothetically designed HEMP-like weapon, an “e-bomb, ” on electronically equipped target systems whether it can overload, upset or damage {{any part of the}} targeted system. The procedure to determine these possible effects is, quantitatively, to estimate the electromagnetic coupling from first principles and simulations using a coupling model program, pursuing a feasible geometry of attack, practical antennas, best coupling approximations of ground conductivity and permittivity, a reasonable system of interest representation from specifications, threat waveshape and operating frequency. The analysis procedure investigates the role each of these factors contributes to the <b>e-bomb</b> coupling scenario and the end-to-end process is described as follows: A simple topographical system of interest transmission-line coupling model is created as a target that consists of some mission-essential distributed equipment nodes, which include electronic device components. A range, which {{turns out to be the}} detonation altitude over the target, is selected based on the desired frequency span, antenna diameter, and the geometry for the deployment platform source...|$|E
