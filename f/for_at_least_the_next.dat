5|$|In 1845, local {{members of}} the Church of England, {{as part of a}} {{petition}} calling for funding, stated that they had established a new school.

5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 2–3 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} {{demonstrates that the}} continents of the Earth are moving across the surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 1.1 billion years.|$|E

On the campaign trail, he demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including Democratic Senator and failed 2004 presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.|$|E
25|$|The {{fear that}} the Americans might again attempt to conquer Canada {{remained}} a serious concern <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> half century, and was the chief reason for the retention of a large British garrison in the colony. From the 1820s to the 1840s, there was extensive construction of fortifications, as the British attempted to create strong points around which defending forces might centre {{in the event of}} an American invasion; these include the Citadels at Quebec City and Halifax, and Fort Henry in Kingston. The Rideau Canal was built to allow ships in wartime to travel a more northerly route from Montreal to Kingston; the customary peacetime route was the St. Lawrence River, which constituted the northern edge of the American border, and thus was vulnerable to enemy attack and interference.|$|E
25|$|The 1996–97 {{season was}} a year of {{transition}} for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward Samaki Walker remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A. C. Green. By far {{the most important of}} these acquisitions was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near 20 ppg <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004–05 season.|$|E

25|$|In late 1924 or 1925, Spielrein left Moscow. She and her {{daughter}} rejoined her husband Pavel in Rostov-on-Don. As well as probably being disillusioned by her experience in Moscow, Spielrein may have been impelled to return because her husband by now was {{in a relationship with}} a Ukrainian woman, Olga Snetkova (born Aksyuk), and they now had a daughter, Nina. Pavel returned to his wife, and their second daughter Eva was born in 1926. <b>For</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade, Spielrein continued to work actively as a pediatrician, carrying out further research, lecturing on psychoanalysis, and publishing in the west until 1931. In 1929 she presented a vigorous defense of Freud and psychoanalysis at a congress of psychiatry and neuropathology in Rostov, possibly the last person to mount such a defense at a time when psychoanalysis was on the point of being proscribed in Russia.|$|E
