40|$|The {{theory of}} quantum {{harmonic}} analysis on phase space introduced by Werner is presented and formulated precisely using the terminology of time-frequency analysis and abstract harmonic analysis. Convolutions of functions with operators and of operators with operators are introduced, {{along with a}} corresponding Fourier transform of operators the Fourier-Wigner transform. Using these concepts we formulate and prove a version of Wiener s Tauberian theorem for operators due to Werner. The main novel result of the thesis is a formulation of the so- called localization operators using the convolution of a function with an operator, which gives a conceptual framework for localization operators and an extension of results by Bayer and Gröchenig. The connection to quantum harmonic analysis provides new perspectives on results in time-frequency analysis. In particular, Lieb <b>s</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> is seen to be a special case of a Hausdorff-Young inequality for operators, which in turn leads to an improvement of this Hausdorff-Young inequality. We also show a generalization of the Berezin-Lieb inequalities, and relate this and the convolutions to results by Klauder and Skagerstam. The theory of Banach modules is used to prove new results on the convolutions, and the Fourier-Wigner transform is shown {{to be related to}} the so-called Arveson spectrum. Finally the convolutions are considered in the context of modulation spaces, inspired by the existing literature on localization operators and modulation spaces...|$|R
40|$|Newtonian {{mechanics}} is {{the foundation}} of Classical Physics. Newton’s mechanics, Thermodynamics, Wave theory of Optics and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory belong to regime of Classical Physics and can be used to explain a wide range of phenomena in the Universe at macroscopic scale. These theories fail spectacularly when applied to phenomenain the atomic and nuclear regime, for example, proton-atom scattering or the flow of electrons in a semiconductor. Quantum mechanics is the most successful scientific theory that has ever been created and it has completely changed our view of the world. The failure of Classical Physics was highlighted by black body radiation and photoelectric effect. Max Planck and Albert Einstein provided explanations of both phenomena based on quantum hypothesis and are thus considered founders of Quantum Physics. The origin of quantum mechanics goes back to the mid- 1920 s. It was formulated first as matrix mechanics by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan; then as wave mechanics by Louis de Broglie and Erwin Schrödinger; and later on asquantum statistics of subatomic particles by Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein. Combining relativistic mechanics with quantum mechanics, Dirac formulated his relativistic quantum mechanics during 1930 <b>s.</b> <b>Uncertainty</b> <b>Principle</b> is thecornerstone of Quantum Physics. The role of randomness in microscopic physical processes shatters the myth that the universe is deterministic. Quantum world is unpredictable in the classical sense and demolishes the idea of an objective universe.

For many <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principles</b> for periodic functions, the lower bound on the uncertainty is not attained.
