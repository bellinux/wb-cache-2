Kunsthal Nord, established in the centre in 2009, arranges up to five exhibitions a year {{of all forms of}} contemporary art, especially of local origin but also from other parts of Denmark and beyond.

5|$|With the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Ahmose, {{a renewal}} of royal support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> monumental {{construction}} occurred. Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards {{the service of the}} traditional gods, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose's reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no more than seven years, and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Robert McSpadden and Bill Dickinson, both music {{teachers}} in the Cincinnati Public Schools, founded the Cincinnati All-City Boy Choir, where they were struck by how the discipline they established for {{the boys in the}} choir carried over into their academic studies. They conceived the idea of a school where basic education was combined with intensive attention to children with artistic talents. With the support of Waldrip and Tom Murray, director for the west-central division of Cincinnati elementary schools, they pushed for $119,000 as part of a tax levy referendum in May 1973; the measure was defeated. The school was approved with a drastically reduced budget of $27,000 plus $9,850 from the Board of Education’s general fund. They turned to private funding and won a $292,000 grant from J. Ralph Corbett, one of the city's foremost philanthropists <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts,</b> <b>and</b> $24,500 for a piano lab from the Baldwin Piano Company, which had manufactured pianos in Cincinnati since 1891.|$|E

5|$|Marjorie Heins is an {{attorney}} {{with a focus on}} civil liberties. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967. Heins graduated from Harvard Law School with a magna cum laude distinction, receiving her juris doctor degree in 1978. At the time of the book's publication in 1993, Heins served as the founding director and chief lawyer for the Arts Censorship Project. The project was formed as a division of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1991 during societal conflict in the U.S. over attempts to decrease financing for the National Endowment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> <b>and</b> to censor the musicians 2 Live Crew. In 2000, Heins became the founding director of the Free Expression Policy Project at the National Coalition Against Censorship.|$|E
5|$|Morris' {{influence}} on Britain's artistic community became increasingly apparent as the Art Workers' Guild {{was founded in}} 1884, although {{at the time he}} was too preoccupied with his socialist activism to pay it any attention. Although the proposal faced some opposition, Morris would be elected to the Guild in 1888, and was elected to the position of master in 1892. Morris similarly did not offer initial support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Crafts Exhibition Society, but changed his opinion after the success of their first exhibit, held in Regents Street in October 1888. Giving lectures on tapestries for the group, in 1892 he would be elected president. At this time, Morris also re-focused his attentions on SPAB campaigning; those causes he championed including the preservation of St. Mary's Church in Oxford, Blythburgh Church in Suffolk, Peterborough Cathedral, and Rouen Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry {{movements}} {{were some of}} Millett's principal causes. Her books were motivated by her activism, such as woman's rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, Bryn Mawr College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are The Politics of Cruelty (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and Mother Millett (2001), a book about {{her relationship with her}} mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono's Courage Award <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts,</b> <b>and</b> was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States regulates the music industry, enforces intellectual property laws, and promotes and collects certain kinds of music. Under American copyright law, musical works, including recordings and compositions, are protected as intellectual property {{as soon as they}} are fixed in a tangible form. Copyright holders often register their work with the Library of Congress, which maintains a collection of the material. In addition, the Library of Congress has actively sought out culturally and musicologically significant materials since the early 20th century, such as by sending researchers to record folk music. These researchers include the pioneering American folk song collector Alan Lomax, whose work helped inspire the roots revival of the mid-20th century. The federal government also funds the National Endowments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> Humanities, which allocate grants to musicians and other artists, the Smithsonian Institution, which conducts research and educational programs, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds non-profit and television broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|SCPA {{had three}} {{different}} homes {{in its first}} four years, including a makeshift campus in the Mount Adams neighborhood and another in Roselawn. In 1976, it occupied the Old Woodward High School building, {{on the site of}} one of the oldest public schools in the country. The school rose to national prominence in the 1980s, but was nearly closed in the 1990s following a series of scandals, leadership struggles, and an arson fire which destroyed the auditorium. Its reputation recovered {{in the years that followed}} and in 2009–10, the school was featured in the MTV reality series Taking the Stage, filmed at the school and featuring SCPA students. In 2010 SCPA combined with the Schiel Primary School for Arts Enrichment to create the first kindergarten through twelfth grade (about ages five to seventeen) arts school and first private sector/public arts school in the US. A new facility in Over-the-Rhine was championed by the late Cincinnati Pops Maestro Erich Kunzel and funded through a unique public-private partnership that raised over $31million in private contributions to match public funding. The building features specialized facilities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> three separate theaters and is the key to redevelopment plans for the area.|$|E
