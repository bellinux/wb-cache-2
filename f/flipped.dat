5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was <b>flipped</b> halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being <b>flipped,</b> the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E
5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, <b>flipped</b> to cook the other side, and then <b>flipped</b> onto a plate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flip</b> tricks can be {{executed}} by 'popping' the boards nose or tail, or {{by using the}} foot to lift the board up from underneath (underflip). Basic <b>flip</b> tricks are performed by popping the board with one foot, and using the other foot to <b>flip</b> the raised end. Less common <b>flip</b> variations can be achieved popping the board in an unusual way, where the pop itself makes the board <b>flip.</b> These include pressure <b>flips</b> and toe <b>flips</b> that were more popular in early skateboarding. <b>Flip</b> tricks are usually performed while the skateboarder is rolling, although they may be performed while stationary.|$|R
50|$|Many {{variations}} of <b>flips</b> exist, with usage {{depending on the}} particular type of activity. In gymnastics, for example, <b>flips</b> conform to {{a small number of}} specific, rigorously defined forms and movements. In activities such as free running and tricking, however, there are seemingly endless {{variations of}} <b>flips,</b> though many of these are variations of the fundamental gymnastics <b>flips.</b> As a result, gymnastics nomenclature is often applied to <b>flips</b> found in other disciplines. In many cases, <b>flips</b> are generally categorized according to the direction of body rotation. For example, the body rotates in the forward direction (i.e., face first) in a front <b>flip</b> and in the opposite direction in a back <b>flip.</b>|$|R
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Ricky Steamboat and Matt Borne. Steamboat took the early {{advantage}} in the match-up, until Borne <b>flipped</b> him over and slammed him to the mat using a belly-to-belly suplex. After performing a flying crossbody Steamboat pinned Borne for the win.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been <b>flipped</b> on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a <b>flipped</b> enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E

5|$|Homemade {{versions}} of pancake machines have been constructed. An {{example of a}} homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which {{was used for the}} organization's annual pancake day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle. The pancakes were manually <b>flipped</b> and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.|$|E

5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had <b>flipped,</b> he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the <b>flipped</b> boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

40|$|Human {{ovarian cancer}} is the most lethal {{gynecological}} malignancy. Although cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel are the first-line chemotherapeutic agents for ovarian cancer, chemoresistance is a major therapeutic problem with mechanisms involved still not well understood. Dysregulation of the apoptotic cascade may be a causative factor for chemoresistance. Indeed gene products involved in the regulation of apoptosis, including the PI 3 K/Akt and Flice-Like Inhibitory Protein (<b>FLIP)</b> are frequently over-expressed and/or dysregulated in chemoresistant cells. <b>FLIP,</b> a caspase- 8 analogue, modulates death receptor-mediated apoptosis by preventing caspase- 8 activation. Since <b>FLIP</b> may have a critical involvement in ovarian cancer chemoresistance, it is importance to understand its role, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which <b>FLIP</b> is regulated, and if and how dysregulated <b>FLIP</b> degradation {{is involved in the}} etiology of chemoresistance. Human ovarian cancer cell lines were used to establish the possible involvement of <b>FLIP</b> in the regulation of CDDP sensitivity in vitro and to assess the mechanism by which CDDP regulates <b>FLIP.</b> We demonstrated that CDDP down-regulates <b>FLIP</b> content, induces caspase- 8 and - 3 activation and apoptosis in chemosensitive ovarian cancer cells, but not in their resistant counterparts. Moreover, we observed that <b>FLIP</b> over-expression in chemosensitive cells attenuates CDDP sensitivity, while <b>FLIP</b> down-regulation sensitizes chemoresistant cells to CDDP. We further demonstrated that CDDP had no effects on <b>FLIP</b> mRNA abundance but down-regulated <b>FLIP</b> protein content in chemosensitive cells, a response attenuated by proteasome inhibitors. Itch is an E 3 ligase protein involved in protein ubiquitination. CDDP also enhances FLIP-p 53 -Itch cell membrane co-localization, and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination in chemosensitive but not resistance cells. In addition, Itch silencing attenuates CDDP-induced <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination. p 53 siRNA also attenuates FLIP-Itch and FLIP-p 53 interactions and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination. While Akt activation inhibits CDDP-induced <b>FLIP</b> degradation and apoptosis in chemosensitive cells, these responses are facilitated by dominant-negative Akt expression in their resistant variants. Finally, p 53 siRNA attenuates CDDP-induced and dominant negative (DN) -Akt-facilitated FLIP-p 53 binding and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination in resistant cells. These studies improve our understanding of <b>FLIP</b> involvement in chemoresistance, the mechanism by which CDDP regulates <b>FLIP,</b> and dysregulation of <b>FLIP</b> degradation in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer...|$|R
