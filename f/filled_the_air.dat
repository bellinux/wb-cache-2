5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines in the tall prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E

25|$|Early {{urbanization}} of Rome {{and surrounding}} areas was focused around {{the ability to}} obtain natural resources. Lowland areas and areas close to water transports were highly urbanized first, but as population increased along with trade and manufacturing, imperial expansion and colonization of conquered territories was needed.

25|$|The bulk of McClellan's army {{concentrated}} around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, {{preparing for}} a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp.

25|$|The city at {{this time}} was in a terrible confusion. Crowds of the people, on horse and foot, rushed in {{disorder}} on the streets, vainly searching for already deceased Khan. Bewildered residents hid {{in their homes and}} barns, women <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with frantic cries. Meanwhile, Russian soldiers with bayonets cleared the street, entirely covered with dead bodies, and seized the booty, finding on a horseback some precious gold jewelry. By noon the battle began to subside, and broke again only for a moment when, according to Tstsianov, the soldiers came upon five hundred men, who have entrenched themselves in the Juma mosque. At first they offered to surrender, but when one Armenian said that among them are some Lezgins, it was the signal for the death of all defenders, because the hatred of Lezghins was so strong among the Russian troops.|$|E
25|$|Commander John Charles Dalrymple Hay led the Royal Navy vessels which {{encountered}} Chui A-poo's fleet. His {{ship was}} the 12-gun brig HMS Columbine, with about 80 crewmen and 20 marines. The steamer Canton also participated, her number of crew and armament {{is not known}} but she was chartered and armed by a Lieutenant Bridges from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. She arrived unsuspected at the battle area and assisted in attacking the pirates. On 27 September 1849, the Columbine left Hong Kong for Harlaim Bay and arrived at noon the following day. There they found the village to have been attacked and burnt by the pirates, who fled further northeast {{to the village of}} Tysami so the expedition went further until within plain view of the village. It was also destroyed by the pirates and was burning, smoke <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> according to Commander Hay's report.|$|E

25|$|Surrealist Street filled {{one side}} of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various surrealists. The main hall was a {{simulation}} of a dark subterranean cave with 1,200 empty coal bags suspended from the ceiling. The floor was covered by Paalen with dead leaves and mud from the Montparnasse Cemetery. In the middle of the grand hall underneath DuchampÂ´s coal sacks, Paalen installed an artificial water-filled pond with real water lilies and reeds, which he called Avant La Mare. Illumination was provided only by a single light bulb, so patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art (an idea of Man Ray), while the aroma of roasting coffee <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Around midnight, the visitors witnessed the dancing shimmer of a scantily dressed girl who suddenly arose from the reeds, jumped on a bed, shrieked hysterically, then disappeared just as quickly. Much to the surrealists' satisfaction, the exhibition scandalized many of the guests.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. For a work force they hired thirty high school {{dropouts}} that were eager to earn a bit of money before being drafted into the Army. They machined 45,000 graphite blocks enclosing 19,000 pieces of uranium metal and uranium oxide. The graphite arrived from the manufacturers in [...] bars of various lengths. They were cut into standard lengths of , each weighing [...] A lathe was used to drill [...] holes in the blocks for the control rods and the uranium. A hydraulic press was used to shape the uranium oxide into [...] "pseudospheres", cylinders with rounded ends. Drill bits had to be sharpened after each 60 holes, which worked out to be about once an hour. Graphite dust soon <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and made the floor slippery.|$|E

500|$|Taylor had {{a crew of}} six camera operators, {{including}} three Denver cinematographers and three others brought in by Taylor. Due to the thick fog and heavy rain {{on the night of}} the concert, very little aerial footage was suitable for the final edit. Although two [...] "master angle" [...] cameras on tripods provided wide and overview shots, most of the camera operators filmed with hand-held cameras. The video cameras used had tube sensors, which created trails in the footage when they were pointed at direct light sources. As a result, much of the concert footage contains red streaks, prompting a notice on the future home video release informing viewers that the coloured lines in the footage [...] "are a result of special lighting effects, and are not caused by a tape defect or your equipment". The weather was cold enough that steam was coming out of the band members' mouths, and the Edge had difficulty playing guitar because his hands felt [...] "frozen stiff". Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. believes the weather contributed a dramatic atmosphere to the concert. Reduced attendance at the event was largely obscured in the concert footage by the thick mist that <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that evening, as well as strategic shots of the crowd. Taylor had a B-stage built onto the set to reduce the gap between the audience and Bono, allowing him to perform close to the audience, surrounded by fans on three sides. Sound mixing was managed by Steve Lillywhite, who produced U2's first three studio albums. Ezratty's portable 24-track recording system, Effanel Music, was used because a conventional mobile recording studio could not be moved close enough to the stage.|$|E

2500|$|During 1874, when Josephine was 13, {{production}} {{of gold and}} silver from the Comstock Lode had fed a feverish stock market, leading to {{a great deal of}} speculation. When the Comstock Lode production began to fade, San Francisco suffered. Her father Henryâs earnings as a baker fell. The family was forced to move in with Josephine's older sister Rebecca and her husband Aaron in the tenements on the flatlands [...] "south of the slot" [...] (south of Market Street). It was a working-class, ethnically mixed neighborhood, where smoke from factory chimneys <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The 1880 census places the family in that area, known as the 9th Ward, between San Francisco Bay, Channel, Harrison and Seventh streets. In early 1880, Henry was living with his son-in-law Aaron, who was employed as a bookkeeper. They lived four blocks south of Market at 138 Perry Street between 3rd and 2nd at Harrison.|$|E
2500|$|... 1938 - A new Exposition Internationale du SurrÃ©alisme {{was held}} at the Beaux-arts Gallery, Paris, with more than 60 artists from {{different}} countries, and showed around 300 paintings, objects, collages, photographs and installations. The Surrealists wanted to create an exhibition which in itself would be a creative act and called on Marcel Duchamp, Wolfgang Paalen, Man Ray and others to do so. At the exhibition's entrance Salvador DalÃ­ placed his Rainy Taxi (an old taxi rigged to produce a steady drizzle of water down the inside of the windows, and a shark-headed creature in the driver's seat and a blond mannequin crawling with live snails in the back) greeted the patrons who were in full evening dress. Surrealist Street filled one side of the lobby with mannequins dressed by various Surrealists. Paalen and Duchamp designed the main hall to seem like subterranean cave with 1,200 coal bags suspended from the ceiling over a coal brazier with a single light bulb which provided the only lighting, as well as the floor covered with humid leaves and mud. The patrons were given flashlights with which to view the art. On the floor Wolfgang Paalen created a small lake with grasses and the aroma of roasting coffee <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Much to the Surrealists' satisfaction the exhibition scandalized the viewers.|$|E
