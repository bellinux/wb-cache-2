5|$|In late August 1878, Sullivan {{used some}} of the Pinafore music, {{arranged}} by his assistant Hamilton Clarke, during several successful promenade concerts at Covent <b>Garden</b> <b>that</b> generated interest and stimulated ticket sales. By September, Pinafore was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique. The piano score sold 10,000copies, and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.|$|E
5|$|Regarding A. p. piscivorus, {{an early}} account by Stejneger (1895) {{described}} a pair in the Berlin Zoological <b>Garden</b> <b>that</b> mated on January 21, 1873, after which eight neonates {{were discovered in}} the cage on July 16 of that year. The young were each 26cm in length and 1.5cm thick. They shed {{for the first time}} within two weeks, after which they accepted small frogs, but not fish.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose <b>garden</b> <b>that</b> allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's compass, north is not where it should be, causing him to believe that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E
5|$|It is {{sometimes}} forgotten that the plants described in herbals were grown in special herb gardens (physic gardens). Such herb gardens were, for example, {{part of the}} medieval monastery <b>garden</b> <b>that</b> supplied the simples or officinals used to treat the sick being cared for within the monastery. Early physic gardens were also associated with institutes of learning, whether a monastery, university or herbarium. It was this medieval garden of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries, attended by apothecaries and physicians, that established a tradition leading to the systems gardens {{of the eighteenth century}} (gardens that demonstrated the classification system of plants) and the modern botanical garden. The advent of printing, woodcuts and metal engraving improved the means of communication. Herbals prepared the ground for modern botanical science by pioneering plant description, classification and illustration. From the time of the ancients like Dioscorides through to Parkinson in 1629, the scope of the herbal remained essentially the same.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle <b>garden</b> <b>that</b> brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
