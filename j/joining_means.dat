Not enough sponsorship was found and the team was forced to start and park four of the five races they ran. After the spring Texas race, they closed down. On April 26, Lepage {{announced that}} he would be <b>joining</b> <b>Means</b> Racing starting at Richmond and would work with the team to procure more sponsorship {{for the rest of the}} season. Sponsorship was found to allow Lepage to run 17 races without having to start and park, with a best finish of 20th at Phoenix.

40|$|Manufacturing {{of complex}} tube-workpieces often {{requires}} medium-based forming processes. Because of the inaccessibility {{to the inside}} of the parts, joining of attached parts is difficult. Additional part handling and process steps are necessary. A loss of the high accuracy of hydroformed parts is disadvantageous especially by shape distortion during thermal joining. One solution is the integration of the joining operation into the hydroforming-process. A new integration method is a combination of hydroforming and spot-joining. Spot <b>joining</b> <b>means</b> a version of joining by forming like clinching or self-pierce riveting or fluid molding of functional elements, e. g. with inside or outside thread. The high pressure fluid takes over the task of the die during hydrojoining. This integrated die-less procedure also increases the range of possibilities which are not available with standard techni...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the field of ceramics and concerns transparent composite panes for safety applications, which are usually constructed from several layers of ceramic, glass and plastic panes connected to one another by a <b>joining</b> <b>means</b> and which have an increased load-bearing capacity. The problem addressed by the invention is that of providing a transparent composite pane for safety applications, which avoids the previous transmission and quality disadvantages of transparent polycrystalline ceramics, as well as the disadvantages of the protection effect that the Al 2 O 3 monocrystals exhibit compared to fine-crystalline, transparent sintered Al 2 O 3 or spinel ceramics. The problem is solved by a transparent composite pane for safety applications, the composite comprising several layers arranged one after another, and at least one layer being a monocrystalline magnesium-aluminate spinel pane or panes arranged in a mosaic or in series...|$|E
40|$|Accepted: 18 August 2012 Many light metals, such as {{aluminum}} and magnesium alloys, are promised to provide sig-nificant weight reduction for automobiles. However, {{the difficulties in}} welding these metals seriously hinder their large-scale applications. A new, hybrid mechanical joining process is proposed to avoid the inherited metallurgical complications in welding. By spinning and pressing a solid rivet into the metals, a joint is formed with the locking from the rivet, a stirred/mixed zone around the rivet, and solid bonding at the faying interface. This rivet-ing process combines the actions of friction-stir welding in which metals of different sheets are mechanically mixed, and self-piercing riveting process which embeds a rivet in the sheets. Experiments have shown that such a friction-stir riveting process can produce joints of compa-rable strength to those created by other <b>joining</b> <b>means,</b> and {{can be applied to}} difficult-to-weld metals and dissimilar metals, such as aluminum-to-aluminum, magnesium-to-magnesium, and aluminum-to-magnesium...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} joining join partners, wherein a reactive material system made {{of at least two}} reaction partners, which reacted exothermally to each other, is located between the join partners, which are arranged over and/or next to each other, an exothermic reaction of the reaction partners is triggered via at least one local electrical, optical, mechanical, magnetic, electromagnetic, chemical, thermal and/or x-ray radiation based energy application on the reactive material system, and reaction heat occurring in said reaction is used to form a connection between the join partners. The invention further relates to a <b>joining</b> <b>means</b> which is positioned between at least two join partners and produces a connection between the join partners. The invention further relates to a method for structure and/or material composition modification of the material of at least one layer or structure on a component or substrate and to a method for securing at least one component or substrate and to a security system having at least one component or substrate which has an active component, at least one passive component, at least one memory and/or at least one conductor path. The method and system aspects according to the invention are characterized in that the reaction partners of the reactive material system are directly isolated and no solder or solder-like material and no adhesive is applied, wherein at least the liquidus temperature of the join partners and/or the materials to be modified in the structure and/or material composition thereof and/or the materials to be secured is formed by the reaction heat...|$|E
