5|$|Three {{days after}} the war began on April 12, 1861, at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln {{offering}} 10,000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion. By the end of April, about 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up {{to fight for the}} Union, exceeding the state's <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> of six regiments (4,683 men). In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24, 1861, Morton called for Indiana's politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union. He also received the state legislature's authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops.|$|E
30|$|Given these considerations, {{we do not}} {{advocate}} a full implementation of our system to begin with. Instead, we believe our proposal should be tested on a reduced number of refugees, and possibly member states, before scaling it up. The objective would be {{to show that it}} actually generates substantial welfare gains both for refugees and for participating member states. It would also allow us to elicit some useful information on how to manipulate <b>initial</b> <b>quotas</b> so that a larger number of participating countries benefit from the market.|$|R
50|$|The grant {{approach}} is inherently political, with attendant benefits and costs. For example, related {{industries such as}} fish processing and other non-participants may seek quota grants. Also, fishermen are often excluded from receiving quota {{if they are not}} also boat owners, however boat owners who do not fish do receive quota, such {{as was the case in}} Alaskan IFQ distributions.

In his Bretton Woods Debates: A Memoir, Mikesell notes that he provided White with data that supported the United States' free trade position and calculated the <b>initial</b> <b>quotas</b> for the World Bank and IMF. He was a close friend of White, Frank Coe, and Sol Adler, and believed that they were not Communist sympathizers.|$|R
25|$|Creation of {{the park}} had {{immediate}} benefits to some Virginians. During the Great Depression, many young men received training and jobs through the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The first CCC camp in Virginia {{was established in the}} George Washington National Forest near Luray, and Governor Pollard quickly filled his <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> of 5,000 workers. About 1,000 men and boys worked on Skyline Drive, and about 100,000 worked in Virginia during the agency's existence. In Shenandoah Park, CCC crews removed many of the dead chestnut trees whose skeletons marred views in the new park, as well as constructed trails and facilities. Tourism revenues also skyrocketed. On the other hand, CCC crews were also assigned to burn and destroy some cabins in the park, to prevent residents from coming back. Also, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes who had jurisdiction over the NPS and partial jurisdiction over the CCC, tried to use his authority to force Byrd to cooperate on other New Deal projects.|$|E
2500|$|During the American Civil War, Indianapolis was {{loyal to}} the Union cause. After the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Indianapolis {{citizens}} proclaimed, [...] "We unite as one man to repel all treasonable assaults upon the Government, its people, and citizens in every department of the Union––peaceably, if we can, forcibly if we must." [...] Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army troops as they prepared to enter Confederate lands. On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a gathering point for the state's volunteer soldiers.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{efficacy}} of price and quantity controls as environmental policy instruments in a stochastic setting in which agents are risk averse. We demonstrate that the assumption of risk aversion may improve {{the performance of a}} tax relative to that of a system of tradable quotas, and that restricting quota trade may enhance e. ciency even though risk aversion in itself limits volumes of trade. The government may be able to improve the performance of a tradable quota system by judicious choice of distribution and amount of <b>initial</b> <b>quotas</b> and by trading pro-actively in the quota market...|$|R
30|$|In this case, only {{a quarter}} of the <b>initial</b> {{distribution}} of <b>quotas</b> would be traded. The reason is that the differences in preferences are not as extreme as in Table  1. The difference between the most refugee-friendly country (Sweden) and the less refugee-friendly one (Hungary) is less than 8 to 1, compared to 166 to 1 (Germany vs. the UK) in Table  1. Given that there would be fewer trades, the total cost reduction with respect to the <b>initial</b> EU <b>quotas</b> is smaller than in Table  1, just 27 percent instead of 62 percent.|$|R
40|$|During the {{six decades}} which {{encompass}} state planning {{of the sugar}} and alcohol industry in Brazil, production quotas were possibly the most important instrument for control of its productive activities. Their distribution obeyed rules, which, though general, contained a clear political character, specially regarding their geographical distribution. This text details some results of its allocation, showing how their redistribution, from the North-Northeast to the Center-South region, specially to São Paulo, occured.

50|$|At {{the major}} league winter {{meetings}} in Cincinnati in December 1939, the BBWAA held a special election to act on Lou Gehrig, who had announced his retirement that summer. The writers elected Gehrig to the Hall of Fame (the results of that election are unknown) and also determined to postpone the next regular election until 1942, as the <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> of 10 inductees from the 20th century had been met.|$|E
5000|$|For example, the Byelorussian SSR was {{estimated}} to have 2,000 (Cat. I) & 10,000 (Cat. II), a total of 12,000 anti-Soviet social elements. It was specifically stressed that quotas were estimates {{and could not be}} exceeded without personal approval of Yezhov. But in practice this approval was easy to obtain, and eventually these <b>initial</b> <b>quotas</b> were exceeded by orders of magnitude. One instance in July 23, 1938, the Omsk NKVD chief named Gorbach requested an increased quota of thousands of more executions, since his men had already fulfilled their plan; the request was approved by Stalin personally, who promoted Gorbach to a larger district. By the autumn of 1937, the pressure to achieve arrests was so great that the NKVD interrogators began picking out names from the telephone directory or preselecting married men with children who, as every agent knew, were the quickest to confess. Within 1939, the system of repression was bursting at the seams—one tenth of the population might be arrested, but not half.|$|R
30|$|The first {{component}} is the tradable quotas system. Its principle {{is to determine}} a total number of asylum seekers/refugees to be hosted by the EU and a distribution of <b>initial</b> <b>quotas</b> across countries. We are agnostic {{with respect to the}} total number and the initial allocation, which could be done according to any of the eight rules mentioned above. These issues must be addressed in any solidarity mechanism, not just ours. The advantage of a tradable quotas system, however, is that it allows for revealing information on the true costs of accommodating refugees in the participating countries, and it allows (actually, forces) countries to exploit their comparative advantages in either “hosting” or “funding.” In other words, there are two ways by which countries can contribute to the public good of the “international protection of refugees:” through visas or through money. The market for admissions will allocate refugees so that the marginal cost of hosting them is equalized across destinations. The solution is efficient in that it minimizes the total cost (or, for a given total cost, allows for the accommodation of more refugees).|$|R

50|$|War also engendered a {{heightened}} sense of patriotism across many sections of Queensland society. Recruiting for the Australian Imperial Force, the volunteer force which was to form the bulk of Australia's military contribution to the war, commenced on the same day the Brisbane Exhibition opened. Queensland was set an <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> of approximately 2500 men based on its population, which it had met by September 1914.

5000|$|A quota group (or qgroup) imposes {{an upper}} {{limit to the}} space a {{subvolume}} or snapshot may consume. A new snapshot initially consumes no quota because its data is shared with its parent, but thereafter incurs a charge for new files and copy-on-write operations on existing files. When quotas are active, a quota group is automatically created with each new subvolume or snapshot. These <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> groups are building blocks which can be grouped (with the [...] command) into hierarchies to implement quota pools.|$|E

30|$|Still, {{even though}} both {{approaches}} give us different results {{in terms of the}} efficiency of the market and the final distribution of costs that it would generate, they are useful in understanding the difficulties the EU is having in coordinating a response to the Syrian crisis. Both approaches conclude that a majority of countries lose with respect to an uncoordinated solution, at least given the <b>initial</b> distribution of <b>quotas</b> that has been proposed by the European Union. There are very few countries, mostly Germany and Sweden, that would actually benefit from a coordinated solution even if this was globally efficient as in our simulation presented in Table  2.

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of war created {{a heightened sense}} of patriotism; the call for Queenslanders to volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force met its <b>initial</b> <b>quota</b> of 2500 men by September 1914. With so many willing to enlist, the army could insist of a high standard of physical fitness. However, the only women accepted by the army were single women nurses. Women doctors were not accepted by the army, arguing they could not stand the conditions (despite nurses enduring the same conditions) and, perhaps more tellingly, that male doctors would be unwilling to work with them. This led to a number of Queensland women finding unofficial ways to serve the war effort, e.g. Lilian Violet Cooper, Queensland's first female doctor served in the Scottish Women's Hospitals serving in Serbia while her companion Josephine Bedford also served in the Scottish Women's Hospitals as an ambulance driver in Serbia. Eleanor Bourne, another Queensland doctor, travelled to England to enlist as a medical officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps and later served in the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps. Visiting London during the {{outbreak of}} the war, Annie Wheeler, a married nurse, remained in London and, with the assistance of her daughter Portia, became a volunteer worker for the comfort of Central Queensland soldiers, maintaining a comprehensive card index through which she ensured the soldiers and their families were kept well-informed and supported through practical and financial assistance.

Then FDR appointed Virginia's other Senator, Claude Swanson, Secretary of the Navy. After Congress concurred in that post, Governor Pollard quickly appointed Byrd to the vacant U.S. Senate seat.

40|$|The central {{question}} {{addressed in this}} paper is whether {{the presence of the}} MFA made the NAFTA politically more acceptable. Assuming that the government maximizes a weighted sum of welfare and producer profits, we derive four key results. First, taking the initial level of trade restriction as exogenously given, it is possible for an FTA to be endorsed by both parties under the MFA-like quota in one country though it is unambiguously rejected under a tariff that provides equal protection. Second, if the <b>initial</b> MFA <b>quota</b> is itself chosen endogenously, as long as all quota rents accrue to exporting countries, the quota is set so as to yield either autarky or free trade. Third, an intermediate outcome can obtain if quota rents are shared between the trading partners as is true, for example, under a tariff quota. Depending on the degree of the government’s bias in favor of producers, this outcome may be more or less restrictive than that obtained under a tariff. Finally, assuming parameter values that give rise to the intermediate outcome initially, it remains possible for an FTA to be endorsed under the MFA-type quota when it is turned down by one of the potential partners under a tariff.
