To minimize the angular sensitivity of the sensors several photodiodes {{can be used in}} parallel.

30|$|QA {{programs}} are recommended <b>for</b> all <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> facilities. A QA program consists of planned and systematic actions providing confidence that a facility will produce consistently high-quality images with minimal exposure. The program has to guarantee periodic checks of all {{components of a}} diagnostic x-ray system. It relies on a clear definition of responsibilities of the team members and starts with the specifications of the equipment for purchase. Monitoring and maintenance include {{a series of tests}} that can be performed by different assigned people; they are directed to x-ray generation, exposure, detector performance, post-processing and viewing at a workstation. QA programs use different adapted procedures for different radiological procedures and thus will differ for radiography, CT and fluoroscopy. Images are compared to standards of acceptable image quality. In case of a problem, corrective actions must be in place. The QA program is incomplete without records, a manual and systematic training for all persons involved in it. Finally, it has to be reviewed periodically for all components.|$|R

40|$|The <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> {{space and}} {{healthcare}} {{in general is}} a slow adopter of new software technologies and patterns. Despite the widespread embrace of mobile technology in recent years, altering {{the manner in which}} societies in developed countries live and communicate, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> has not unanimously adopted mobile technology <b>for</b> remote <b>diagnostic</b> review. Desktop applications in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> space commonly leverage a validated toolkit. Such toolkits not only simplify desktop application development but minimize the scope of application validation. For these reasons, such a toolkit is an important piece of a company’s software portfolio. This thesis investigated an approach for leveraging a Java validated toolkit for the purpose of creating numerous ubiquitous applications <b>for</b> 3 D <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology.</b> Just as in the desktop application space, leveraging such a toolkit minimizes the scope of ubiquitous application validation. Today, the most standard execution environment in an electronic device is an Internet browser; therefore, a ubiquitous application is web application. This thesis examines an approach where ubiquitous applications can be built using a viewport construct provided by a client-side ubiquitous toolkit that hides the client-server communication between the ubiquitous toolkit and the validated visualization toolkit. Supporting this communication is a Java RESTful web service wrapper around the validated visualization toolkit that essentially “webifies” the validated toolkit. Overall, this ubiquitous viewport is easily included in a ubiquitous application and supports remote visualization and manipulation of volumes on the widest range of electronic devices. Overall, this thesis provided a flexible and scalable approach to developing ubiquitous applications that leverage an existing validated toolkit that utilizes industry standard technologies, patterns, and best practices. This approach is significant because it supports easy ubiquitous application development and minimizes the scope of application validation, and allows medical professionals easy anytime and anywhere access to diagnostic images...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} is {{proposed}} for the calculation of relative depth doses <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> using a direct photon transport/ray tracing technique which incorporates both primary and first scatter dose. The x-ray spectra are generated from computer algorithms based on the Birch and Marshall semi-empirical model; the spectra are established by matching calculated and measured transmission data. The algorithms for the generation of x-ray spectra and for the calculation of depth doses are described. Relative depth doses are determined {{for a number of}} radiographic techniques. The calculations are compared with measured and published depth doses; the agreement is very good for tube voltages below 90 kV$ sb{ rm p}$. It is suggested that relative integral doses obtained from relative depth doses give an accurate representation of risk reductions obtained with different radiological techniques. The integral dose reductions predicted by the model are within 8. 5 % of those from measured data...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an intelligent assistance agent <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> faces a number of challenges: e. g., how {{to gain access to}} the knowledge used an such visual problem solving tasks, how to operationalize it for further processing, and how to present it an the most useful manner for diagnosis. Our previous work an this domain placed an emphasis on the first two issues, and has shown that both perception and problem solving need to be supported an these types of tasks. However, the interface to the underlying intelligence in our first prototypes did not reflect how medical practitioners physically interact with images in the context of their work. This paper describes current work in progress on an image-centered approach to the agent’s interface design. This approach will allow users to interact dynamically with the image, and to store these interactions for future retrieval...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The Royal College of Radiologists' {{guidelines}} aim {{to encourage}} more appropriate use of diagnostic radiology and so reduce the use of clinically unhelpful x-ray examinations. AIM. The object {{of this study was}} to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the introduction of the guidelines into general practice. METHOD. A total of 62 practices (170 general practitioners) referring patients to St George's Hospital, London <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> were randomly allocated into two groups. Guidelines were sent to the 30 practices in the intervention group. Radiological referral patterns were compared in both groups before and after the introduction of guidelines. RESULTS. Practices which had received guidelines requested significantly fewer examinations of the spine, and made a significantly higher proportion of requests which conformed to the guidelines compared with practices which had not received the guidelines. There were no significant differences in the proportion of forms giving physical findings or in the proportion of positive findings at radiology. CONCLUSION. Introduction of guidelines can influence general practitioners' radiological referrals in the short term. Wider use of guidelines might help to reduce unnecessary irradiation of patients...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the {{interest}} for application of silicon radiation detectors to the detection of X-rays in the 15 - 30 keV region has been growing. One of the main reasons of such an interest is the development of devices for medical and biological applications, in particular <b>for</b> the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> of soft tissues. For these applications, to ensure a high detection efficiency is of crucial importance. This leads to the use of ''on purpose'' geometrical arrangements and technological solutions for the detector, as well as the use of specifically designed read-out electronics. In this paper we present results and images obtained with silicon microstrip detectors in a ''pixel-like'' geometry, with the X-ray beam impinging parallel to the strips. An efficiency close to 80 % has been obtained for photons of energies around 20 keV. The ongoing developments, concerning the realisation of a dedicated silicon detector for digital radiology at the SYRMEP (SYnchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics) beam line of the ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, are described...|$|R
30|$|J.A. Brink, {{representing}} the American College of Radiology (ACR), gave {{a report on}} the USA’s perspective on IR residency and on developing a new IR training programme that incorporates the necessary clinical training by increasing the length of IR-specific training without extending the overall length of training or disenfranchising and interfering with DR training, but giving more flexibility to the programmes and the trainees, who can enter from medical school, during DR or after DR, which is a complex but flexible formula. The goals are to allow trainees to be certified in both diagnostic and IR, to bring individuals directly into training from medical school and to continue to bring individuals in from <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology.</b> The formula minimises extra training time by utilising change in the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> examination paradigm, and provides options and flexibility. There are two pathways: Integrated Residency (clinical year internship plus five residency years) or Independent Residency (completed internship and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> residency with 2  years of IR residency). All training will be transitioned to this new system and the 1  year IR fellowships will eventually be phased out. In the Integrated Residency programme, the first 3  years are essentially <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> residency, with an American Board of Radiology core exam taken after 36  months. The two final years are spent in IR, which qualify for the American Board of Radiology IR/DR certificate. IR Independent Residency requires completion of DR residency. The IR residency programme may be reduced to 1  year <b>for</b> those <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Radiology</b> residents who complete ESIR (Early Specialisation in Interventional Radiology). J.A. Brink gave a detailed overview of the ESIR structure that requires 12 IR or IR-related rotations and 500 procedures. This means that the DR programmes must have adequate IR facilities and personnel to provide IR training and it allows DR programmes to have an “approved” IR curriculum that would allow DR graduates who complete the ESIR training and satisfy the IR procedural requirements to be eligible to enter directly into the 2 nd year of the Independent IR Residency programme. It is expected that in 2020 – 21 the first Interventional Radiology Independent residents will graduate, while in 2022 – 23 the first residents that matched to Interventional Radiology Integrated Residency at end of 2017 will finish training.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{dosimetry}} is {{a fundamental}} requirement for the safe and efficient use of radiation in medical applications. International Codes of Practice, such as IAEA TRS- 398 (2000) for radiotherapy beams and IAEA TRS- 457 (2007) <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> beams, provide the necessary formulation for reference and relative dosimetry and the data required for their implementation. Research {{in recent years has}} highlighted the shortage of such data for radiotherapy small photon beams and for surface dose estimations in diagnostic and interventional radiology, leading to significant dosimetric errors that in some instances have jeopardized patient’s safety and treatment efficiency. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and determine key data for the reference and relative dosimetry of radiotherapy and radiodiagnostics beams. For that purpose the Monte Carlo system PENELOPE has been used to simulate the transport of radiation in different media and a number of experimental determinations have also been made. A review of the key data for radiotherapy beams published after the release of IAEA TRS- 398 was conducted, and in some cases the considerable differences found were questioned under the criterion of data consistency throughout the dosimetry chain (from standards laboratories to the user). A modified concept of output factor, defined in a new international formalism for the dosimetry of small photon beams, requires corrections to dosimeter readings for the dose determination in small beams used clinically. In this work, output correction factors were determined, for Varian Clinac 6 MV photon beams and Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion  60 Co gamma-ray beams, for a large number of small field detectors, including air and liquid ionization chambers, shielded and unshielded silicon diodes and diamond detectors, all of which were simulated by Monte Carlo with great detail. Backscatter factors and ratios of mass energy-absorption coefficients required for surface (skin) determinations in diagnostic and interventional radiology applications were also determined, as well as their extension to account for non-standard phantom thicknesses and materials. A database of these quantities was created for a broad range of monoenergetic photon beams and computer codes developed to convolve the data with clinical spectra, thus enabling the determination of key data for arbitrary beam qualities. Data presented in this thesis has been contributed to the IAEA international dosimetry recommendations for small radiotherapy beams and <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> in paediatric patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of a test for breast cancer utilizing synchrotron x-ray diffraction analysis of scalp hair from women undergoing diagnostic radiology assessment. Design and Setting: A double-blinded clinical trial of women who attended diagnostic radiology clinics in Australia. Patients: 1796 women referred <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology,</b> with no previous history of cancer. Main Outcome Measures: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the hair test analysis compared to the gold standard of imaging followed by biopsy where indicated. Results: The hair-based assay had an overall accuracy of > 77 % and a negative predictive value of 99 %. For all women, the sensitivity of both mammography and x-ray diffraction alone was 64 %, but when used together the sensitivity rose to 86 %. The sensitivity of the hair test for women under the age of 70 was 74 %. Conclusion: In this large population trial the association between the presence of breast cancer and an altered hair fibre X-ray diffraction pattern previously reported has been confirmed. It appears that mammography and X-ray diffraction of hair detect different populations of breast cancers, and are synergistic when used together...|$|E

The data were collected retrospectively from the hospital records, patient charts, pharmacy records, and from the hospital billing system. RESULTS: The total sum spent for diagnosis and treatment of these 51 patients was US$ 1, 457, 500. 00. This value encompassed expenses with a total of 85 hospitalizations, 2, 875 outpatient visits, 16 emergency room visits, and all expenses associated with these stays at the hospital. The expenditure for treatment of each patient submitted to biopsy, breast conserving surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy without trastuzumab (a regime with taxane followed by anthracycline), radiotherapy, and 5 years of tamoxifen was approximately US$ 25, 500. 00.

40|$|The {{development}} of digital detectors for X-ray imaging in medical diagnostics receives an increasing amount of attention. The detector under {{development at the}} Department of Radiation Sciences at Uppsala University is a hybrid pixel detector, which consists of a semiconductor sensor mounted onto a readout chip. The readout chip is capable of performing photon counting and has an externally adjustable threshold. A simulation tool for the detector and a model applying the linear-systems transfer theory to X-ray hybrid pixel detectors have been developed. Also a characterization of the readout chip has been done.

By means of the detector simulations, the influence of threshold setting, noise sources, level of exposure and charge sharing on the DQE have been studied. By means of the linear-systems theory, a single analytical expression is provided to obtain the DQE of a hybrid pixel detector. The method developed in this thesis will make it possible to optimize a detector design according to a particular medical application.

40|$|The {{human brain}} anatomy is {{characterized}} by dramatic structural changes during fetal development. It is extraordinarily complex and yet its origin is a simple tubular structure. Revealing detailed anatomy {{at different stages of}} brain development not only aids in understanding this highly ordered process, but also provides clues to detect abnormalities caused by genetic or environmental factors. However, anatomical studies of human brain development during the fetal period are surprisingly scarce and histology-based atlases have become available only recently. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures water diffusion to delineate the underlying neural structures. The high contrasts derived from DTI can be used to establish the brain atlas. With DTI tractography, coherent neural structures, such as white matter tracts, can be three-dimensionally reconstructed. The primary eigenvector of the diffusion tensor can be further explored to characterize microstructures in the cerebral wall of the developmental brains. In this mini-review, the application of DTI in order to reveal the structures of developmental fetal brains has been reviewed in the above-mentioned aspects. The fetal brain DTI provides a unique insight for delineating the neural structures in both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The resultant DTI database will provide structural guidance for the developmental study of human fetal brains in basic neuroscience, and reference standards <b>for</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>radiology</b> of premature newborns...|$|E

The image quality of the monitors was evaluated using the TG 18 -QC test pattern. The display time of images was measured in 20 cases when the shared folder was used and when it was not.

In 1994, the number of physicians, radiologists, x-ray units, and x-ray examinations per 1, 000 population was 0. 45, 0. 005, 0. 065, and 183, respectively. (Level I countries had averages of 2. 6, 0. 072, 0. 35, and 860, respectively). In 1994, a total of 3. 6 million x-ray examinations were performed; the annual effective dose per capita to the population was 0. 05 mSv, and the collective effective dose aas 1, 000 person-Sv. Chest examinations contributed 63 of the total. Almost all examinations experienced increasing frequency from 1990 to 1994 except for barium studies, cholecystography, and intravenous urography (- 23, - 36, - 51).
