5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> years, {{due to a lack}} of funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|Life in Nelson {{remained}} {{difficult for}} Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration.

He appeared {{as a replacement for}} Bledsoe when he was hurt, but only started three games during this time. He was released {{at the end of the}} 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring.

5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. The threat to the hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E
5|$|After {{a rather}} lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven-E, a {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 21. Initially taking a westward track, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fausto on August 22. It {{turned to the}} west-northwest and stayed on that path <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> days. Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on August 22. It continued to intensify, peaking as a Category4 on August 24, and also substantially increased in size. The hurricane began to weaken thereafter, and was a minimal tropical storm {{by the time it}} entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 27. The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non-convective swirl of clouds on August 28.|$|E
5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>six</b> hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

50|$|By 1825 {{the early}} evangelical {{influence}} {{had all but}} {{come to an end}} following the departure of Arthur and Armstrong, and thanks to the efforts {{of the majority of the}} settlers. Arthur was replaced by General Edward Codd, and Armstrong by Matthew Newport in 1824. Newport was ‘a high Churchman of the old eighteenth century type’ who believed in the historic orthodoxy of the Church. His determination to return to traditional Anglicanism characterized the approach to his chaplaincy. He was to make the settlement his home <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> thirty <b>six</b> years.|$|R
