500|$|After his {{military}} retirement, from 1971–74, Hartmann {{worked as a}} flight instructor in Hangelar, near Bonn, and also flew in an aerobatics team with Adolf Galland. In 1980 he caught a cold that developed into angina pectoris — the condition that had killed his father {{at the age of}} 58. He recovered and, by 1983, was medically cleared to fly, after which he resumed instructing at the various flying schools. However, fearing a second attack, he became cautious and limited his appearances at public events. [...] He stated: [...] "I am retired and I am a civilian, and now <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> my rest and peace. [...] I do not live for exhibitions." [...] Hartmann {{was a member of the}} Gemeinschaft der Jagdflieger (Association of German Armed Forces Airmen).|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E
2500|$|Armatrading {{performs}} on both six- and twelve-string acoustic {{and electric}} guitars. She has played on Ovation acoustic instruments since 1973, {{and said this}} about them {{in an interview with}} the magazine Guitar Player: [...] "I'm a bit of a hitter, you see – I bash – and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> everything going at once: bass, harmony, and melody. This is why I love Ovations. They are very powerful-sounding guitars, and when I hit those strings, they ring with a nice, clear, percussive – but not overly bright – sound that highlights the rhythms I like to play." [...] She has played Stratocaster and Gibson electric guitars. For her 2012–13 tour, she performed on six- and 12-string Ovations and customised Tom Anderson guitars.|$|E

2500|$|To {{maximize}} the output from their holdings, the Bradleys lease their lands during hunting season. Minnie Lou has issued ten suggestions to her temporary tenants. One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> hunters call {{ahead of time and}} let me know when they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick to let me know if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} February 17, with Marvel confirming that Russell {{had joined the}} cast, and revealing that Elizabeth Debicki and Chris Sullivan had also been cast, all in undisclosed roles. The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta, an increase in stage space from what {{was used for the}} first film. Gunn said the sequel required more sets than the first and [...] "our sets are very large, even though a lot of the film is CGI. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as many practical sets as we can and make the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements." [...] Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel, with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with the fewer places shown. Sets constructed for the film included: several for the Sovereign planet, for which Chambliss used a [...] "1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s art deco design aesthetic"; the Ravager's main ship in the film, the Eclector, which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the [...] "pleasure planet" [...] of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together from [...] "a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away and industrial materials that aren't of use anymore are just left to rot", creating a [...] "kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow." [...] Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of blue screen the actors had to interact with; this includes the cockpit of Quill's ship that had been built for the first film before being stored in London which was transported to Atlanta for the sequel.|$|E
