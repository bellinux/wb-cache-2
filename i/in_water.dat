40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and spread}} of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) are pressing public health problems worldwide, and aquatic ecosystems are a recognized reservoir for ARB.

5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year.

With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, <b>in</b> <b>Water</b> Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings.
