40|$|Colorimetric aptasensors using unmodified gold {{nanoparticles}} (AuNPs) {{have attracted}} much attention because of their low cost, simplicity, and practicality, {{and they have been}} developed for various targets in the past several years. However, previous research has focused on developing single-target assays. Here, we report the development of a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>multiplex</b> aptasensor by using more than one class of aptamers to stabilize AuNPs. Using sulfadimethoxine (SDM), kanamycin (KAN) and adenosine (ADE) as example targets, a KAN aptamer (750 nM), an SDM aptamer (250 nM) and an ADE aptamer (500 nM) were mixed at a 1 : 1 : 1 volume ratio and adsorbed directly onto the surface of unmodified AuNPs by electrostatic interaction. Upon the addition of any of the three targets, the conformation of the corresponding aptamer changed from a random coil structure to a rigid folded structure, which could not adsorb and stabilize AuNPs. The AuNPs aggregated in a specific reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl containing 20 mM NaCl and 5 mM KCl), which led to a color change from red to purple/blue. These results demonstrate that the multiplex colorimetric aptasensor detected three targets simultaneously while maintaining the same sensitivity as a single-target aptasensor for each individual target. The multiplex aptasensor could be extended to other aptamers for various molecular detection events. Due to its simple design, easy operation, fast response, cost effectiveness and lack of need for sophisticated instrumentation, the proposed strategy provides a powerful tool to examine large numbers of samples to screen for a small number of potentially positive sample...|$|E

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{crowdsourcing}} increases, it {{is important}} to think about performance optimization. For this purpose, it is possible to think about each worker as a HPU(Human Processing Unit), and to draw inspiration from performance optimization on traditional computers or cloud nodes with CPUs. However, as we characterize HPUs in detail for this purpose, we find that there are important differences between CPUs and HPUs, leading to the need for completely new optimization algorithms. In this paper, we study the specific optimization problem of obtaining results fastest for a crowd sourced job with a fixed total budget. In crowdsourcing, jobs are usually broken down into sets of small tasks, which are assigned to workers one at a time. We consider three scenarios of increasing complexity: Identical Round <b>Homogeneous</b> tasks, <b>Multiplex</b> Round <b>Homogeneous</b> tasks, and Multiple Round Heterogeneous tasks. For each scenario, we analyze the stochastic behavior of the HPU clock-rate {{as a function of the}} remuneration offered. After that, we develop an optimum Budget Allocation strategy to minimize the latency for job completion. We validate our results through extensive simulations and experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a simple {{analytical}} technique to determine P({Q>q}), {{the tail of}} the queue length distribution, at an ATM multiplexer. The ATM multiplexer is modeled as a fluid queue serving a large number of independent sources. Our method is based on the central limit theorem and the maximum variance approximation, and enables us to avoid the state explosion problem. The approach is quite general and not limited by a Markovian framework. We apply our analytical method to study the buffer behavior for various traffic sources suchas <b>multiplexed</b> <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous Markov modulated sources, sources that are correlated at multiple time scales, sources whose autocorrelation function exhibits heavy (sub-exponential) tail behavior, and sources generated from real MPEG-encoded video sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{estimation}} of resource usage in network nodes {{is a basic}} issue {{from the point of}} QoS (Quality of Service) provisioning. Within this paper the {{estimation of}} the buffer overflow is considered in network elements represented by a service curve property. The existing results [1] [2], define bounds on buffer overflow for such elements, <b>multiplexing</b> <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous independent regulated inputs. The require-ment of independence for the inputs can be reduced by setting up new bounds for the homogeneous case, using a bounding technique, which relies only on the limited independence among the inputs [3]. Beside the presentation of the new bounds, it will be shown, that they improve the existing ones in all cases, and an investigation is given about the independence properties, which are required from the input flows...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundHuman interferon-gamma (hiFN-γ) is {{produced}} by lymphocytes and {{has a variety of}} biological properties. Measurement of hIFN-γ is widely used for various immunological responses for allergic or autoimmune diseases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an established immunoassay used to quantify cellular metabolites or cytokines. ELISA requires many incubation and wash steps and is not practically suitable for screening large numbers of samples. MethodsWe have developed a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) method for the detection of hIFN-γ. We measured the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value of the hIFN-γ production by interleukin (IL) - 18 binding protein and anti-IL- 18 monoclonal antibody. The IC 50 described by FLISA was compared with that by ELISA. ResultsWe developed a new system for measuring hIFN-γ using Allophycocyanine (APC) fluorescent protein and compared it with the previous method using Cy 5. 5. The proposed FLISA had a smaller coefficient of variation than ELISA, and the means of coefficient of variation using the same samples measured by ELISA and FLISA were, respectively, 11. 1 % and 3. 8 %, suggesting that the edge effect often giving non-specific results may be smaller in FLISA than in ELISA. ConclusionsThe improved FLISA system proposed is ideally suited for efficient measurements of hIFN-γ.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{analytical}} model {{for the study of}} two different routing strategies in an ATM network supporting multimedia traffic flow: the Multimedia Virtual Circuit (MVC) and the Independent Virtual Circuit (IVC). The first strategy consists of assigning a single virtual channel to all the monomedia streams which make up the multimedia flows; the second strategy consists of <b>multiplexing</b> <b>homogeneous</b> monomedia streams belonging to different multimedia sources on the same virtual channel. With this aim a multimedia source is modeled as an arrival process defined as the superposition of heterogeneous correlated arrival processes, each of which models one monomedia source. In order {{to take into account the}} intermedia relationships which exist in a multimedia stream, each monomedia source is modeled as an Interrupted Bernoulli Process in which the transition and the arrival probabilities are functions of the states of the other monomedia sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} {{development}} of a novel single-step, <b>multiplexed,</b> <b>homogeneous</b> immunoassay platform for sensitive detection of protein targets based on our realization of high surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS) signal enhancement by controlled assembly of SERS nanoparticles. An essential design of this platform is the use of gold nanoparticles or nanorods codecorated with specially reduced antibody half-fragments, nonfluorescent Raman-active dyes, and passivating proteins as the SERS nanoparticles. These nanoparticles offer a facile approach to accomplish orientational immobilization of antibodies, minimized interparticle distance, multicolor Raman fingerprint coding, low fluorescence background, as well as excellent biocompatibility and stability. Through sandwiched antibody−antigen interactions, controlled assembly of SERS nanoparticles is realized with a strong SERS signal achieved via plasmonic coupling, creating an immunoassay platform for rapid, sensitive, multiplexed quantification of proteins. This platform is demonstrated for reproducible quantification of three cytokines, interferon gamma, interleukin- 2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, with large signal-to-noise ratio. It is also successfully applied to multiplexed cytokine analysis for T cell secretion studies in complicated biological samples. The developed SERS immunoassay platform may create a simple but valuable tool for facilitating accurate validation and early detection o...|$|R
40|$|The {{main network}} {{solutions}} for supporting QoS rely on traf- fic policing (conditioning, shaping). In particular, for IP networks the IETF has developed Intserv (individual flows regulated) and Diffserv (only ag- gregates regulated). The regulator proposed could {{be based on}} the (dual) leaky-bucket mechanism. This explains the interest in network element per- formance (loss, delay) for leaky-bucket regulated traffic. This paper describes a novel approach to the above problem. Explicitly using the correlation structure of the sources’ traffic, we derive approxi- mations for both small and large buffers. Importantly, for small (large) buffers the short-term (long-term) correlations are dominant. The large buffer result decomposes the traffic stream in a stream of constant rate and a periodic impulse stream, allowing direct application of the Brownian bridge approximation. Combining the small and large buffer results by a concave majorization, we propose a simple, fast and accurate technique to statistically <b>multiplex</b> <b>homogeneous</b> regulated sources. To address heterogeneous inputs, we present similarly efficient tech- niques to evaluate the performance of multiple classes of traffic, each with distinct characteristics and QoS requirements. These techniques, applica- ble under more general conditions, are based on optimal resource (band- width and buffer) partitioning. They can also be directly applied to set GPS (Generalized Processor Sharing) weights and buffer thresholds in a shared resource system...|$|R
