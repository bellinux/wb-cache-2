5|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} call a special session to repeal the law, and Bradley {{was in favor of}} the action, but a poll of the legislators showed that too many of them were noncommittal to justify the call. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals found it constitutional. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked the members of the Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats – W. S. Pryor, <b>former</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission.|$|E

5|$|Goebel {{was chosen}} {{president}} pro tem of the Senate for the 1898 legislative session. On February 1, 1898, he sponsored a measure later called the Goebel Election Law. The law created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed by the}} General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties and were empowered to decide disputed elections. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving to Goebel; it was opposed even by some Democrats. Nevertheless, Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Governor Bradley's veto, making the bill law. As leader of the party, Goebel essentially hand-picked {{the members of the}} Election Commission. He chose three staunch Democrats—W. S. Pryor, <b>former</b> <b>chief</b> <b>justice</b> of the Kentucky Court of Appeals; W. T. Ellis, former U. S. Representative from Daviess County; and C. B. Poyntz, former head of the state railroad commission. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but the Court of Appeals found it constitutional.|$|E

25|$|There was {{speculation}} in mid-2014 that Rajapaksa {{would call}} another early presidential election: on 20 October 2014 Minister of Mass Media and Information Keheliya Rambukwella {{confirmed that the}} election would be held in January 2015.
