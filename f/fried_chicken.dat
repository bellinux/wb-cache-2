5|$|<b>Fried</b> <b>chicken</b> (also {{referred}} to as Southern <b>fried</b> <b>chicken</b> for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates <b>fried</b> <b>chicken</b> from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made <b>fried</b> <b>chicken.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the United States, <b>fried</b> <b>chicken</b> has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various.

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning).

Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, <b>fried</b> <b>chicken</b> was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, <b>fried</b> <b>chicken</b> has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E

5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep <b>fry</b> the <b>chicken,</b> which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to <b>fry</b> <b>chicken.</b> The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|R
