500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a quantum}} {{absorption}} refrigerator, {{in which a}} target qubit is cooled by two machine qubits in a nonequilibrium steady-state.

2500|$|Less {{than three}} months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: [...] "That'll cost you extra," [...] whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his carotid artery with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes. Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body. He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> for later consumption. Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a [...] "jelly-like substance" [...] using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{starts from}} {{the hypothesis that}} {{a new approach to}} new product development is required to meet the future requirements and expectations of customers and consumers and product and service providers. The investigation focuses upon domestic food refrigeration and its position within the retail food supply chain, with the domestic refrigerator {{as an example of a}} mature product, the future development of which, it is argued, may depend upon a new approach to new product development. A review of established and emerging new product development strategies suggests that such future requirements might be met through collaboration between organisations from different industrial sectors and across supply chains, and that existing strategies would not support such collaborations. A new methodology, Collaborative Envisioning is proposed which engages the business of academia and the tools of the designer to facilitate multidisciplinary trans-sectoral collaboration. It is further proposed that a demonstration project, Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge,</b> is <b>the</b> most effective test for the methodology. Key participants <b>in</b> Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge</b> are Sainsbury's, Electrolux, 3 M, University College Northampton and University of East London. Results from Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge</b> suggest that <b>the</b> Collaborative Envisioning methodology is effective in bringing together partners from different industrial sectors and uniting them around a shared and mutually supported vision of future business. However, the low start-up cost and high level of concept realisation inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> methodology have led to some overestimation of the tactical deliverables from an essentially strategic process. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> light of Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge</b> it is recommended that structures are established at the initiation of a Collaborative Envisioning project so that tactical solutions which may be derived from the strategic objective are differentiated and separately funded from the core project. The reflection upon Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge,</b> and <b>the</b> recommendations for future work derived from it, is followed by reviews of evolving consumer demographics and perceptions of food storage and preparation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> home, and recent initiatives to integrate new technologies into domestic and personal products, thus establishing the historical and social context for Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Fridge...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceEnergy waste due to inhabitants' {{behaviour}} {{in residential}} buildings {{has emerged as}} a potential research area due to the increasing worldwide population and growing energy needs. However, existing approaches for simulating energy consumption are mainly limited to office buildings and are based on static profiles. In this paper we propose a 4 -step co-simulation methodology to assess how inhabitants' interactions with household appliances affect energy consumption. The approach is validated using a case study showing how human activities influence the energy consumption patterns of a refrigerator. <b>The</b> <b>fridge</b> was specifically chosen because it is a high energy-consuming appliance that is strongly affected by inhabitants' behaviours. <b>In</b> addition, modelling <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> is nontrivial, and in choosing this appliance we show {{that it is possible to}} apply the approach to less complex appliances. A co-simulation approach is adopted with <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> being physically modelled in Matlab and with human behaviour being modelled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brahms language and simulation environment. The consumption distribution from the simulated scenario is compared with the actual distribution (using data from a consumption database), to find optimum values of tuning parameters with less than 10 % variation. This methodology enables us to simulate how human behaviours affect energy appliance consumption...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fridge</b> Gate {{method is}} a {{theoretical}} application {{of using a}} single logic gate to drive a refrigerator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates {{on the fact that}} there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> gate. <b>The</b> first is on the interior of <b>the</b> <b>fridge,</b> <b>the</b> second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish <b>the</b> source. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cooling step on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>fridge,</b> <b>the</b> g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to <b>the</b> e state. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second step, on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> where <b>the</b> particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating <b>the</b> outside particles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.|$|R
40|$|The Collins Dictionary {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> as a 'chamber {{in which}} food, drink etc. are kept cool' {{but such a}} simple description belies the complex realities of <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> {{and its impact on}} and relationship to sustainability. Sustainability itself is difficult to define, as it remains an aspirational rather than particular reality, nonetheless it is important to outline a definition so the rest of this paper is conceptualised within it and the reader and myself are 'on the same page'. David Orr describes 'sustainable design [as] the careful nesting of human purposes with the larger patterns and flows of the natural world'. While he is referring to 'design', the metaphor of 'careful nesting' can be expanded to convey a sense of what sustainability means. <b>The</b> <b>fridge's</b> impact on sustainability, that is on ourselves and the rest of nature, is not simply about energy efficiency or even its material realities. <b>The</b> <b>fridge</b> is not only a 'cool box', something seemingly so ordinary it is largely invisible to us, but as an enabler of apparent human transcendence beyond the 'natural world' by arresting death and decay and allowing us to eat outside of geographical or seasonal food limitations. By opening the doors of <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> we can explore gender roles, social history and industrial capitalism, all of which intersect {{to tell the story of}} <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> and its relationship to sustainability.
