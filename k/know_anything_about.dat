5|$|Do {{you know}} how to write a song? Do you <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> writing? If you're going to write for records, it goes like this: A, B, C, B, C, C. I don't know what you're doing. You're doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don't know how to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here... and buy some rock-and-roll records.|$|E
5|$|In November 1533, {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the fifth edition, Sepúlveda sent Erasmus a description of the ancient Vatican manuscript, informing him that it differed from the text which he had edited in favour of the Vulgate in 365 places. We do not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> these 365 readings except for one. Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda). In another letter sent to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{none of you}} fellows <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the business," [...] said Harry. [...] "Kate and I got up the company, and we needn't {{have had}} a Board of Directors at all, if we hadn't wanted to. If any of you boys had <b>known</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{telegraphs}} we would have given you an office." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly Ronald, at supper, put the question, {{but none}} of the {{officers}} admitted they <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the matter.|$|R
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth Vaillant is Henri Vaillant's wife. She {{married him}} when he was a simple mechanic, but does not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> cars, motor racing, or mechanics.|$|E
25|$|In February 2016, Olivia Colman gave an {{interview}} on This Morning where she stated that series 3 would be shot in May 2016, {{and said that she}} did not yet <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the plot.|$|E
5000|$|... "No one <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Ishida and {{therefore}} {{there is no}} evidence that Kawakami's claims are correct. How very ninja-like." ...|$|R
60|$|Ethel started. Mrs. Olcott {{was young}} and pretty; nobody <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> her husband; Andrew's visits had already excited comment.|$|R

25|$|Lula da Silva claimed on Brazilian public {{television}} {{that he did}} not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the scandals. He also said that people who did not agree with paying a tax for each check issued and/or financial transaction were people who illegally failed to pay their income tax.|$|E
25|$|Trinny and Susannah Undress... {{starts with}} Woodall and Constantine {{becoming}} {{acquainted with the}} couple who are experiencing difficulties in their relationship and due to receive a makeover. Trinny and Susannah do not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the couple's situation and problems so they talk with them to establish what is lacking in their relationship and {{to see how it}} has changed from previous years. Woodall and Constantine then evaluate their clothing and ask the couple to put on an outfit in which they feel most confident.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This might happen if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century.|$|E
60|$|But nobody <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> {{the matter}} {{excepting}} George Mason himself, {{and he was}} not there to give the village any information.|$|R
6000|$|... "This gentleman is {{certainly}} mistaken," [...] Mr. Parker declared with dignity. [...] "Neither my friend nor myself <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> his pocketbook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{pretty sure}} he don't. Leastwise I didn't tell him, an' there's nobody else down there as <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> you." ...|$|R
25|$|Reformed theologians {{believe that}} God {{communicates}} knowledge of himself to {{people through the}} Word of God. People {{are not able to}} <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> God except through this self-revelation. Speculation about anything which God has not revealed through his Word is not warranted. The knowledge people have of God is different from that which they have of anything else because God is infinite, and finite people are incapable of comprehending an infinite being. While the knowledge revealed by God to people is never incorrect, it is also never comprehensive.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} matroid is a matroid {{together with}} a function from its elements to the nonnegative real numbers. The weight of a subset of elements is defined to be {{the sum of the}} weights of the elements in the subset. The greedy algorithm can be used to find a maximum-weight basis of the matroid, by starting from the empty set and repeatedly adding one element at a time, at each step choosing a maximum-weight element among the elements whose addition would preserve the independence of the augmented set. This algorithm does not need to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the details of the matroid's definition, as long as it has access to the matroid through an independence oracle, a subroutine for testing whether a set is independent.|$|E
25|$|Moving to Columbus, Mueller taught {{electrical}} engineering {{and the new}} field of system engineering, and continued his research, focusing his PhD thesis on dielectric antennas. Upon obtaining his doctorate in physics in 1951, he became associate professor of {{electrical engineering}}. Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, later part of TRW, recruited him {{and he took a}} one-year sabbatical in 1953. A consultant to Ramo-Wooldridge, Mueller got involved in the review of radar designs and the Bell Labs radar for the Titan rocket (which was originally radio-guided). Mueller was peripherally involved with some of the developments of the inertial systems and generally began to help out wherever there was a problem. Mueller admitted in 1987 that at this time he did not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> missiles.|$|E

25|$|The {{next day}} the Czech {{authorities}} issued an international arrest warrant for Dahlgren, who, as was later revealed, had already passed through the passport control at Vienna International Airport before his name appeared in the international database. Subsequently, at around 1PM the Austrian authorities alerted the crew of Austrian Airlines flight OS93 of the arrest warrant. The flight, carrying Dahlgren, had left Vienna at 10:46AM and was at time flying over the United Kingdom. After contemplating an emergency landing or a return to Vienna, the pilots {{decided it would be}} safer to continue the flight. The cabin crew were instructed to pretend not to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the suspect on the flight. Immediately after landing at Washington Dulles International Airport, the plane was stormed by U.S Customs and Border Protection Officers, who arrested Dahlgren and turned him over to the FBI.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ambush}} in via Fani the terrorists took {{only the most}} {{interesting}} for them of the five bags that Moro carried with him. Those containing the politician's medicines and his reserved documents. Further, the necessity of inflicting a coup de grâce {{to any of the}} bodyguards is in contrast with a hurried attack typical of such acts, and is motivated only by the necessity to eliminate any possible witness that would reveal that Moro was not there. In a letter to his wife Moro wrote during captivity he asked her {{to take care of his}} bags. Since Moro was surely aware that if his bags had been found in the massacre location, they had been taken by the investigators. Also the absence from his letter of any word about the victims of via Fani has been taken as an element in favour of the theory that Moro was captured while in his Gladio escort (see Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services) and not in via Fani and so did not <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> their assassination.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it, he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E

500|$|The couple {{ultimately}} {{decided to}} begin a relationship, however, the two experience difficulties, but eventually reunite. Rhimes commented on their reconciliation: [...] "I love [...] with Arizona. [...] I like that they make me feel hopeful about love." [...] Rhimes has mentioned of their relationship in the sixth season: [...] "I {{would like to see}} Callie happily in a long-term relationship. We have so much to explore with them, because we barely <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{debate over}} Speer's {{knowledge}} of, or complicity in, the Holocaust {{made him a}} symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have (or claimed not to have had) {{an active part in}} the regime's atrocities. As film director Heinrich Breloer remarked, [...] " [...] a market for people who said, 'Believe me, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> [...] Just look at the Führer's friend, he didn't know about it either.|$|E
500|$|Dorival Caymmi {{died at age}} 94 {{of kidney}} cancer and {{multiple}} organ failure on August 16, 2008, {{at his home in}} Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, [...] "He did not know that he had cancer, and {{he did not want to}} know. He did not ask much about this. He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did not want to <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish." ...|$|E
