5|$|Although he {{continued}} to use rotoscoping in American Pop, Hey Good Lookin', and Fire and Ice, Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a mistake}} to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{rejected}} {{materialism and}} disavowed personal property. He held that jealousy, doubt, {{and the fear}} of losing the love of another caused much of the disease people experienced. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> rejecting personal possessions was a means of attaining the Fruit of the Universal Spirit.|$|E
60|$|On {{the third}} day he found his mind still further changed. <b>He</b> no longer <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> God was in Pall Mall or St. James's Park, whither he resorted to walk and muse. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> now <b>that</b> God was somewhere about the horizon....|$|R

5|$|Frankel {{generally}} {{approved of}} his editor's choices, but differed on one scene, showing more of Andrea on her errand to the Calvin Klein showroom. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> scene showed Andrea's job was {{about more than}} running personal errands for Miranda.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 2009 the Pumpkins' website {{announced}} that Chamberlin {{was leaving the}} band. Chamberlin released a blog stating that he left as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the band would not further his commitment to music.|$|E

5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> his languages changed and developed over time, as with the historical languages which he studied professionally—not in a vacuum, {{but as a result}} of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{views on}} NATO {{reflected}} his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social {{development in the}} former Eastern Bloc countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev and his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Akitoshi Kawazu {{was pleased}} by Famitsus rating but {{admitted that he}} thought the game was not perfect; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the storyline did not meet some fans' expectations.

5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Sasha {{spoke to}} Resident Advisor about his {{decision}} to change from using Live and the Maven controller {{to a combination of}} Native Instruments' Traktor and CDs in his DJ sets. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> whilst Ableton Live had developed significantly as production software, it had become less successful as a DJing tool.|$|E

5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> religion {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity. His second {{purpose was to}} identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though he noted that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall {{had been replaced by}} newer shooter games.|$|E

5|$|Jovanović did not assign titles to his works, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if a {{painting}} was well composed viewers {{would be able}} to deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles. The Wounded Montenegrin also appears under the titles The Wounded Herzegovinian (Ranjeni Hercegovac), The Wounded Bosnian (Ranjeni Bosanac), Sad Encounter (Žalosni susret), Sad Farewell (Žalosni rastanak) and Unsuccessful Banditry (Neuspelo razbojništvo).|$|E
5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, felt that Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, but felt that mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E
5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
