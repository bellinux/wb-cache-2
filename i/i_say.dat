5|$|I {{will never}} break {{the word of}} a prince spoken in public place, for my honour's sake. And {{therefore}} <b>I</b> <b>say</b> again, I will marry as soon as I can conveniently, if God take not him away with whom I mind to marry, or myself, or else some other great let happen.|$|E

That's what you can't try,' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'But you {{rest assured that}} that's the secret of my sweet peas,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'nothing less and {{nothing more than the}} vibritation of the trains.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, rats, Clarence,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'I looked 'em {{all over}} carefully, and they didn't {{have any more}} bombs 'n a rabbit,' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'Course,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'they're foolish, but they're a good deal like you and me, after all.' ...|$|R
5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall <b>I</b> <b>say</b> it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bin {{here every}} day, he 'as, sir, {{for the last}} week. Well, <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to myself, {{supposition}} is he'll come once too often. He'll come once too often, <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> And then, <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> I'll cotch him. And I cotched him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'All right, old woman,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'I'll git {{up as you}} <b>say</b> <b>I</b> must, and I'll smash him. Get me {{something}} to put on,' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was on my}} beat, sir, and I thought I heard a disturbance. <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to myself, ''Allo,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'a frakkus. Lots of {{them all}} {{gathered}} together, and fighting.' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> beginning to suspect something, 'Wot's this all about, <b>I</b> wonder?' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'Blow me if I don't think it's a frakkus.' And," [...] concluded Mr. Butt, with the air of one confiding a secret, [...] "and it was a frakkus!" ...|$|R
5|$|Springbok was sired by the {{imported}} horse Australian {{and out of}} the mare Hester. Hester was by Lexington and out of a mare named Heads <b>I</b> <b>Say</b> by imported stallion Glencoe. Springbok was foaled in 1870, and was a chestnut stallion, bred by A. J. Alexander of Woodburn, Kentucky. Springbok was one of 26 stakes winning foals sired by Australian. Springbok was Hester's only stakes winning foal.|$|E
5|$|That's why <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{the players}} didn't stab the ACB in the back. The administrators had {{numerous}} opportunities {{to reach a}} compromise but displayed {{little interest in the}} welfare of the players. It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E
5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and <b>I</b> <b>say</b> now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Climb in {{the front}} seat, dad,' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'It's me and Nance to the private box. Turn on the juice,' <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to the driver.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yus. And {{everyone}} knew Reggie was the fav'rit. Smiled {{all over his}} fat face, the old serpint did! And when it come to my turn, 'e says to me, 'Sorry, Elbert!' 'e says, 'but there ain't no more names. They've give out!' 'Oh, they 'ave, 'ave they?' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'Well, wot's the matter with giving a fellow a sporting chance?' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'Ow do you mean?' 'e says. 'Why, write me out a ticket marked [...] "Mr. X.",' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> 'Then, if 'er lidyship marries anyone not in the 'ouse-party, I cop!' 'Orl right,' 'e says, 'but you know the conditions of this 'ere sweep.

Do all you gents agree that if anyone not in the 'ouse-party and 'oo's name ain't on one of the other tickets marries 'er lidyship, I get the pool?' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> They all says that's right, and then <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to 'em all straight out, <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'I 'appen to know', <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'that 'er lidyship is in love with a gent that's not in the party at all. An American gent,' <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> They wouldn't believe it at first, but, when Keggs 'ad put two and two together, and thought of one or two things that 'ad 'appened, 'e turned as white as a sheet and said it was a swindle and wanted the drawin' done over again, but the others says 'No', they says, 'it's quite fair,' they says, and one of 'em offered me ten bob slap out for my ticket. But I stuck to it, I did. And that," [...] concluded Albert throwing the cigarette into the fire-place just in time to prevent a scorched finger, [...] "that's why I'm going to 'elp yer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen {{from the}} school they come in 'ere and says ain't it all a joke and {{exciting}} and what not. But <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to them, you 'aven't got to live in it, <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> That's what it is. You 'aven't got to live in it, <b>I</b> <b>says.</b> Glad when it's all over, that's what I'll be." ...|$|R
25|$|This {{is where}} {{comprehensive}} campaign organizing programs come into existence and why <b>I</b> <b>say</b> not a corporate campaign. A corporate campaign, per se, is too narrow in focus.

6000|$|... "'Here's the {{difference}} it makes,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> just to devil him. 'How {{do you know}} I like YOUR looks?' Maybe he didn't look sore! 'Nope,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> thinking it all over, 'I don't like your application for a loan. Take it to another bank, only there ain't any,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> and <b>I</b> walks off on him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all. <b>I</b> <b>says</b> to 'er {{the next}} morning, 'Now you know,' <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> 'what I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't {{have to say}} {{anything}} more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>says,</b> {{shaking hands}} with him, [...] "and I could move on again from this shop without feeling sad. But you've got on a bit?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>says.</b>|$|R
25|$|And again <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> {{these little}} things that one does - considerate, compassionate, courageous - I guess it's pretty hard {{to be able to}} realize the impact they have.|$|E
25|$|Behold, it {{is written}} by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; but <b>I</b> <b>say</b> unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath {{committed}} adultery already in his heart.|$|E

25|$|Fundamentalism is in {{the process}} of {{stifling}} culture and creation in the Arab world, <b>I</b> <b>say</b> it is shameful. I am ashamed. We should all be ashamed. If Marcel Khalife is found guilty, it will be an insult to culture.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{answered}} them, saying, “The hour {{has come}} that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most assuredly, <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to you, unless {{a grain of}} wheat falls {{into the ground and}} dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps I have a {{bias toward}} facts over words, but <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{the reality of}} Iranian civility toward Jews tells us more about Iran – its sophistication and culture – than all the {{inflammatory}} rhetoric.

6000|$|... "But {{this time}} I done him proper. 'E didn't want {{me in the}} thing at all. Said I was too young. Tried to do the drawin' without me. 'Clip that boy {{one side of the}} 'ead!'
