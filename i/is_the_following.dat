Cryptoviral extortion <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> three-round protocol carried out between the attacker and the victim.|$|E

25|$|A {{function}} is injective (one-to-one) if every possible {{element of the}} codomain is mapped to by at most one argument. Equivalently, a {{function is}} injective if it maps distinct arguments to distinct images. An injective function is an injection. The formal definition <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} is surjective (onto) if every possible image is mapped to {{by at least}} one argument. In other words, every element in the codomain has non-empty preimage. Equivalently, a {{function is}} surjective if its image is equal to its codomain. A surjective function is a surjection. The formal definition <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following.</b>|$|E
25|$|Near the {{aforementioned}} Kanze-ji, {{there is a}} jizō statue named Koigoromo Jizō and it is stated to deify {{a woman who was}} killed by the onibaba, Koigoromo.

25|$|One {{proof of}} the number's irrationality <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> proof by {{infinite}} descent. It is also a proof by contradiction, also known as an indirect proof, in that the proposition is proved by assuming that {{the opposite of the}} proposition is true and showing that this assumption is false, thereby implying that the proposition must be true.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{decision}} problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following.</b> The input is an arbitrary graph. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected, or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs—of course, to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, {{the county}} {{switched}} from government by a Board of Supervisors, {{consisting of the}} elected heads of town governments, to having a 21-member elected county legislature and executive.

25|$|The derived {{category}} {{allows us}} to encapsulate all derived functors RnF in one functor, namely the so-called total derived functor RF: D+(A) → D+(B). It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> composition: D+(A) ≅ K+(Inj(A)) → K+(B) → D+(B), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors {{are related to the}} total one via RnF(X) = Hn(RF(X)). One might say that the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes.|$|E
25|$|The synod also {{proposed}} {{the adoption of}} an astronomical rule for Easter: Easter {{was to be the}} Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (35°13′47.2″E or UT+22055 for the small dome) during which the first full moon after the vernal equinox occurs. Although the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> Sunday. However, all Eastern Orthodox churches rejected this rule and continue to use the Julian calendar to determine the date of Easter (except for the Finnish Orthodox Church and the Estonian Orthodox Church which now use the Gregorian Easter).|$|E
