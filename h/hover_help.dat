To obtain the cost {{information in the}} concurrent system the metrics throughput, latency, and jitter are evaluated by analyzing generated synthetical data as well as using an industrial related application in the future. As fall-out an Eclipse plugin for S-Net has been developed to provide support for syntax highlighting, content assistance, <b>hover</b> <b>help,</b> and more, for easier and faster development. The presented {{results of the current}} work are on the one hand an indicator for the status quo of the ADVANCE vision {{and on the other hand}} used to improve the applied statistical analysis techniques within ADVANCE. Like the ADVANCE project, this work is still under development, but further improvements and speedups are expected in the near future...|$|E
25|$|When in forward flight, the Aeroscraft is {{controlled}} by the aerodynamic control surfaces (vertical stabilizers, empennages and canards); however, the low speed control system aids the pilot in lower wind conditions such as during VTOL and hover. The LSC system acts as a rear thruster to propel the vehicle in forward flight, and permits the thrust to be redirected while in <b>hover</b> to <b>help</b> the vehicle maintain desired positioning and orientation.|$|R

2500|$|The Hoverbarge {{technology}} is somewhat different from high-speed hovercraft, which {{has traditionally been}} constructed using aircraft technology. The initial concept of the air cushion barge {{has always been to}} provide a low-tech amphibious solution for accessing construction sites using typical equipment found in this area, such as diesel engines, ventilating fans, winches and marine equipment. The load to move a 200ton payload ACV barge at [...] would only be 5tons. The skirt and air distribution design on high-speed craft again is more complex, as they have to cope with the air cushion being washed out by a wave and wave impact. The slow speed and large mono chamber of the <b>hover</b> barge actually <b>helps</b> reduce the effect of wave action, giving a very smooth ride.|$|R
