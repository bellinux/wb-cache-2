40|$|I {{propose a}} new model, called the "RNA memory" model, for the {{possible}} role of RNAs {{in the maintenance}} and establishment of cell identity. This is cytoplasmic memory obtained by the transmission of mother noncoding (nc) RNAs to daughter cells. These RNAs are able to activate transcription via sequence homology in <b>daughter</b> cells. <b>Regulation</b> of RNA memory is strictly linked to the regulation of ncRNAs with repressive features, such as the RNAs involved in RNA interference (RNAi). Misregulation of this system could lead to misidentity, and thus it could be involved in cancer transformation, progression of viral or genetic diseases, and progression of senescence...|$|R
40|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{is a highly}} dynamic and phasic process {{controlling}} cell growth, DNA duplication, and successful division into two <b>daughter</b> cells. <b>Regulation</b> {{of this process is}} key to avoiding errors and activation of cell death. Tumour suppressor proteins, such as Tuberin, and cell cycle proteins, such as Cyclin B 1 are highly important in co-ordinating adequate cell growth and properly timed cell division, respectively. It is known that mutation, truncation, and misregulation of the Tuberin protein can result in diseases like Tuberous Sclerosis and cancer. This study demonstrated that a clinically relevant Tuberin truncation, S 664 Δ, increases cellular proliferation and exhibits aberrant localization compared to wildtype Tuberin. Additionally, our study showed that S 664 Δ is able to bind Cyclin B 1, which may derange proper co-ordination of the G 2 /M transition. Findings here may have clinical implications towards better understanding the progression of disease involving misregulated Tuberin...|$|R

50|$|In the year, {{leading up}} to Kamm's arrest, Blau also {{published}} another article regarding Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Gaby Ashkenazi. The reporter claimed that Barak, on becoming minister, had transferred his private consulting company to his three <b>daughters,</b> violating the <b>regulation</b> allowing such a transfer only if the daughters were actually employed by the company. Furthermore, the company which he gave to his daughters took in nearly $2-million from unknown sources after he entered the government. Blau also claimed that after leaving the army and joining the private sector, Ashkenazi approached Barak about entering into business with him.|$|R

40|$|Cellular DNA is a long, thread-like {{molecule}} with remarkably complex topology. Enzymes that {{manipulate the}} geometry and topology of cellular DNA perform many important cellular processes (including segregation of <b>daughter</b> chromosomes, gene <b>regulation,</b> DNA repair, and generation of antibody diversity). Some enzymes pass DNA through itself via enzyme-bridged transient {{breaks in the}} DNA; other enzymes break the DNA apart and reconnect it to different ends. In the topological approach to enzymology, circular DNA is incubated with an enzyme, producing an enzyme signature {{in the form of}} DNA knots and links. By observing the changes in DNA geometry (supercoiling) and topology (knotting and linking) due to enzyme action, the enzyme binding and mechanism can often be characterized. This paper will discuss the tangle model for analysis of DNA site-specific recombination experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of cell division {{is critical for}} ensuring the outcome of two viable <b>daughter</b> cells. Improper <b>regulation</b> of the cell cycle can lead to aberrant proliferation and tumor formation. The human pocket proteins retinoblastoma (Rb), p 107, and p 130 are critical regulators of the cell cycle and contribute to tumor suppression. Their growth suppressive function is achieved through the {{regulation of}} E 2 F transcription factors, but within the pocket protein family, there is specificity for the particular E 2 F transcription factors each negatively regulates. The molecular mechanisms governing this specificity remain unknown, as does how E 2 F specificity contributes to the different functions observed among pocket proteins. In this study, I explore the molecular determinants governing the interactions between pocket proteins and E 2 Fs, how this E 2 F specificity may influence the function of pocket proteins, {{as well as the}} evolution of tumor suppression characteristics in the protein Rb. Using structural biology, biochemistry and biophysical techniques, we identified key regions of Rb that evolved to regulate a specific subset of E 2 Fs, giving rise to the unique functional activities associated with Rb...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromosomal}} passenger complex (CPC) -composed of Aurora B kinase, Borealin, Survivin and INCENP-surveys the fidelity of genome segregation throughout cell division. The CPC {{has been}} proposed to prevent polyploidy by controlling the final separation (known as abscission) of the two <b>daughter</b> cells via <b>regulation</b> of the ESCRT-III CHMP 4 C component. The molecular details are, however, still unclear. Using atomic force microscopy, we show that CHMP 4 C binds to and remodels membranes in vitro. Borealin prevents the association of CHMP 4 C with membranes, whereas Aurora B interferes with CHMP 4 C's membrane remodelling activity. Moreover, we show that CHMP 4 C phosphorylation is not required for its assembly into spiral filaments at the abscission site and that two distinctly localized pools of phosphorylated CHMP 4 C exist during cytokinesis. We also characterized the CHMP 4 C interactome in telophase cells and show that the centralspindlin complex associates preferentially with unphosphorylated CHMP 4 C in cytokinesis. Our findings indicate that gradual dephosphorylation of CHMP 4 C triggers a 'relay' mechanism between the CPC and centralspindlin that regulates the timely distribution and activation of CHMP 4 C for the execution of abscission.

40|$|SummaryA bipolar {{mitotic spindle}} {{facilitates}} the equal {{segregation of chromosomes}} to two daughter cells. To achieve bipolar attachment of microtubules to kinetochores of sister chromatids, chromatids must remain paired after replication. This cohesion is mediated by the conserved cohesin complex comprised of SMC 1, SMC 3, SCC 1, and either SA 1 or SA 2 in humans. Because defects in spindle assembly or sister chromatid cohesion can lead to aneuploidy in <b>daughter</b> cells, proper <b>regulation</b> of these processes is essential for fidelity in chromosome segregation [1]. In an RNAi screen for regulators of spindle assembly, we identify the deubiquitinase USP 37 as a regulator of mitotic progression, centrosome integrity, and chromosome alignment. USP 37 associates with cohesin and contributes to sister chromatid resolution. Cohesion defects are rescued by expression of an RNAi-resistant USP 37, but not the catalytically impaired USP 37 C 350 A mutant. Further, USP 37 associates with WAPL, a negative regulator of cohesion necessary for cohesin release in prophase [2, 3], in a manner dependent on USP 37 ’s second and third ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Depletion of USP 37 reduces the stability of chromatin-associated WAPL and increases the fraction of WAPL that is more heavily ubiquitylated in mitosis. Consistently, overexpression of USP 37 C 350 A results in increased modification of WAPL, and addition of purified USP 37 WT, but not USP 37 C 350 A, to WAPL immunoprecipitates results in a reduction of ubiquitylated products. Taken together, our results ascribe a novel function for USP 37 in mitotic progression and further suggest that USP 37 positively regulates the stability of chromatin-associated WAPL to facilitate sister chromatid resolution...|$|R
40|$|Cytokinesis is the cytoplasmic {{division}} of one cell into two independent <b>daughter</b> cells. Precise <b>regulation</b> of cytokinesis during cell cycle {{is essential for}} healthy and rapid multiplication of any organism. Schizosaccharomyces pombe has emerged as an excellent model system to study eukaryotic cell division regulation. This rod shaped organism grows by bipolar elongation in interphase when its actin cytoskeleton is concentrated at the cell ends (poles). However, growth stops in mitosis and the actin cytoskeleton is rearranged to facilitate assembly of the contractile actomyosin ring at the cell middle. Although several {{studies have focused on}} the separate processes of growth and division, it was unclear how cells regulate the cytoskeletal remodeling during the transition between the different stages of the cell cycle. The Septation Initiation Network (SIN) is a signaling cascade essential for fission yeast cytokinesis (Balasubramanian et al., 1998; Mishra et al., 2004) and the MOR (morphogenesis) signaling pathway is essential for interphase bipolar growth (Kanai et al, 2005). Interestingly, inactivation of the SIN not only failed to maintain the cytokinetic apparatus at the cell middle but also caused the redistribution of the cytoskeletal elements like actin to the cell ends that led to bipolar cell elongation similar to cells in interphase (Mishra et al., 2004). These results suggested that SIN signaling inhibits interphase bipolar growth, but it was not clear if the SIN had a direct role in inhibition of interphase growth during mitosis and this question was the major focus of this thesis. The results presented in Chapter II show a novel cross-pathway interaction between the SIN and the MOR in the fission yeast. Our results in Chapter III suggest that some of the MOR pathway components might be important for coordination between nuclear and cytoplasmic divisions in mitosis, revealing novel roles of the pathway. In a separate study (Chapter IV) we sought to identify additional regulators of the SIN and cytokinesis through a suppressor screen and found that the nucleolar rDNA transcription machinery inhibits cytokinesis in fission yeast...|$|R
