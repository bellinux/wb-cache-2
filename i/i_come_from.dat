500|$|... "In My City" [...] {{talks about}} {{resonating}} {{with the party}} culture of urban cities. Chopra said that the song was not inspired by one city, since her father was an army doctor, and her family travelled all over India to cities like Jamshedpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Pune, Bareily, Chandigarh, Mumbai and Ladakh. Chopra told the Hindustan Times that the song was [...] "about being proud of where <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from.</b> It's inviting the world to my city and my city could be anywhere."

But the more I listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Motion Picture, {{executive}} producer Gene Roddenberry wrote his own sequel. In his plot, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise travel back in time to set right a corrupted time line after Klingons use the Guardian of Forever to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This was rejected by Paramount executives, who blamed the poor performance and large budget ($46million) of the first movie on its plodding pace and the constant rewrites Roddenberry demanded. [...] As a consequence, Roddenberry was removed from the production and, according to Shatner, [...] "kicked upstairs" [...] to the ceremonial position of executive consultant. Harve Bennett, a new Paramount television producer, was made producer for the next Star Trek film. [...] According to Bennett, he was called in front of a group including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and asked if he thought he could make a better film than The Motion Picture, which Bennett confessed he found [...] "really boring". When Bennett replied in the affirmative, Charles Bluhdorn asked, [...] "Can you make it for less than forty-five-fucking-million-dollars?" [...] Bennett replied that [...] "Where <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> I can make five movies for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex {{received}} mixed to favourable reviews, {{with some}} critics criticizing {{the game for}} making little changes to the formula established by its predecessors. Louis Bedigian of GameZone wrote a positive review, saying that [...] "any Crash Bandicoot fan would be a fool not {{to go out and}} buy this game. I started playing at 2am one night and did not stop until three in the afternoon!" [...] Doug Perry of IGN described the game as [...] "a decent-playing and pretty-looking Crash Bandicoot game. It's nothing terribly special, but it's not bad, not bad at all." [...] Official US PlayStation Magazine felt that [...] "when the strongest feeling I get from a game is the desire to play its predecessors, something's not quite right." [...] Game Informer criticized the [...] "outrageously bad load times", saying that they [...] "keep the game from being average." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro cautioned that [...] "if you were hoping the new management would give Crash a big kick in the pants, however, this is one pair of pants you will find quite unkicked." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the trial-and-error gameplay, saying that [...] "when forced to blindly jump, die, then discover what you missed, where <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> that’s just cheating." ...|$|E

Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, I figured it was something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show."

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
