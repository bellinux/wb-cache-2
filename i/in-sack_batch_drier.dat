A non-linear dynamic model is developed for <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> of foods. Process disturbances and measurement errors are modeled as stochastic processes and a hybrid extended Kalman filter is employed for state estimation. This filter is based on the local linearization of the process model around the suboptimal filter estimates.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish whether commercial sources of dried blood meals available in New Zealand offer useful sources of digestible protein for chinook salmon. Three blood meals were evaluated to assess their suitability as ingredients in salmon feed. In vitro digestibility was determined using the pepsin and pronase digestibility assays. In vivo digestibility was determined by feeding diets to chinook salmon formulated to contain 20 % <b>dried</b> blood meal (<b>batch</b> <b>dried,</b> ring dried or spray dried), and 80 % of a basal diet and by correcting for the digestible protein supplied by the basal diet. Chromic oxide was included in the diets as an indigestible marker. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and amino acids were determined based on samples of faeces collected after 7 days of feeding the respective test diet to chinook salmon. Feces were collected by a manual stripping of the hindgut. Crude protein contents were uniformly high, at 92. 0 %, 93. 1 % and 89. 6 % for the batch, ring and spray dried blood meals respectively. Amino acid contents were also generally high, with the exception of the essential amino acid methionine. All crude protein digestibility determinations ranked the blood meals as: spray dried > ring <b>dried</b> > <b>batch</b> <b>dried.</b> In vitro N digestibility values determined by pronase assay were 60. 5 %, 25. 5 % and 9. 0 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The pronase assay yielded significantly (P< 0. 001) higher digestibility values than did the pepsin assay in the case of ring and spray dried blood meals, corresponding values for crude protein digestibility with the pepsin assay were 27. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 8. 4 % for spray, ring and <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> bloods, respectively. The in vivo apparent faecal digestibility of protein in the dried blood meals determined in the chinook salmon were highest for the spray dried blood meal (68. 4 %), lower in ring dried blood meal (46. 3 %), and very low in the <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal. The amino acid digestibilities were similarly ranked, with the difference between ring and spray dried blood meal being statistically significant for 9 of 17 assayed amino acids (P< 0. 05). A secondary aim of the study was an evaluation of the laboratory rat as a model animal for determining protein digestibility in the chinook salmon. <b>Batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal was fed to rats in an experimental design closely following that set for the chinook salmon, and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids were determined based on sampling of ileal digesta. Ileal crude protein digestibility for this <b>batch</b> <b>dried</b> blood meal in the rat was also very low (3. 9 %), suggesting that the rat may be a suitable model animal for prediction of protein digestibility in chinook salmon. Differences in the protein digestibility of the blood meals appeared to be inversely related to the time spent in processing and drying. It appears that spray and ring dried blood meals may be suitable for inclusion in chinook salmon diets in partial replacement of fishmeal proteins.

40|$|Grass is an {{excellent}} energy crop; it may be classified as a high yielding, low energy input, perennial crop. Over 90 % of Irish agricultural land is under grass; thus farmers are familiar with, and comfortable with, this crop {{as opposed to a}} "new energy crop" such as Miscanthus. Of issue therefore is not the crop, but the methodology of generating energy from the crop. Numerous farmers across Europe (in particular Germany and Austria) use grass silage as a feedstock for biogas production; in a number of cases the produced biogas is scrubbed to biomethane and used as a transport fuel or injected into the natural gas grid.

Starting as a tool to predict drying time, they evolved to become a replacement for a pilot plant study with the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics. But not many studies have been conducted on Spouted Bed Dryer. Furthermore, only handful of those studies modelled the drying and only one has validated the model. While the present study confirmed the merit of CFD modelling, it also discovered that it is unpractical to model a <b>batch</b> <b>drying</b> because of excessive computational time. A CFD model was built for a Triangular Spouted Bed Dryer with Eulerian-Eulerian approach. The model was only usable as a quantitative design guidance.

Parameter studies on the CFD model showed that air inlet velocity has greater impact on the grain recirculation rate compared to the grain physical properties.

Moreover, in comparison with classical heat transfer modeling approaches, the proposed method does not require any knowledge about the mechanical properties of the system like conduction or emissivity coefficients which are usually inaccurate and subject to change.

As in other anaerobic systems, bacteriological activity is inhibited by lack of moisture and in <b>batch</b> <b>dry</b> digestion liquid is sprinkled over the substrate to encourage biomass degradation and biogas production throughout the process. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out to investigate individual methane generation from the recirculated liquid phase and from the stacked solid material.

Up to 21 % of the total methane generation originated from the recirculated liquid. This suggests that methane generation from the liquid phase {{is not to be}} neglected and needs to be recuperated. The process water tank should be equipped with gas collection facilities. Experimental results further indicate that higher ratios of easily hydrolysable substrates increase the proportion of methane from the liquid phase while slowly hydrolysable material encourages biogas generation in the decomposing biomass bed itself. While the amount of easily hydrolysable biomass in the system and the ratio of methane produced in the liquid phase could be positively correlated, no correlation was possible between the volume of liquid in the process water tank and the methane proportion originating from the liquid phase...|$|R

These results show that the nutritional value of meat meal is not adversely affected by varying the time of cooking from 1 to 2 1 / 4 h, by severe overprocessing or by addition of glucose, but that gross spoilage will decrease the nutritive value...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{electrical}} dryers {{are often}} equipped with end-ofcycle alarms, making their use {{more efficient and}} reducing the need for periodic monitoring. We believe that lowerincome households as well as ecologically aware consumers, drying their laundry on a clothesline, could benefit from a similar mechanism. Such an alarm must be simple to use, compatible with existing systems and low-cost. This work describes {{the design of a}} solid state FSR based alarm device for detecting when a <b>batch</b> of <b>drying</b> clothes on a clothesline is dry. In this paper we outline our design guidelines, product development process, and the mechanical and logical structure of our product...|$|R
40|$|During a {{longitudinal}} study of Salmonella on pig farms in England conducted between 1997 and 2000 some of the participating farms introduced interventions to control Salmonella infection. Interventions such as, feed acidification and fermented liquid feed were not successful. The more successful interventions in terms of Salmonella control were in <b>batch</b> systems; <b>dry</b> cleaning accompanied by disinfection using 2 % formaldehyde solution. In many cases the beneficial effects of the interventions were undermined {{by the introduction of}} pigs already carrying salmonellas, failure to disinfect walkways, ventilation systems and other farm equipment. The use of single interventions is unlikely to result in the control of Salmonella at the farm level...|$|R
