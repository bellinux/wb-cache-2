60|$|Mr. Williams {{went out}} and {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the book.|$|E
60|$|The waiter withdrew, and {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> manager, who bowed with obsequious respect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] cried Carthoris. [...] "There {{is no time}} to be lost. Astok will be back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> enough warriors to {{overpower}} me." ...|$|E
50|$|She {{composed}} poetic {{plays of}} her own, mostly in one act (Revenge of Amur, Eternity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Moment,</b> Lady <b>with</b> Violets, Happy Women, etc.).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well;' {{and there}} was a cloud, but it cleared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few gay words to both, he rode off at a quick pace.|$|R
60|$|Mary retired, {{to return}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> nearly {{speechless}} <b>with</b> merriment.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} {{to see how things}} were going on there. She was back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a new dread. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{stood in}} silence while {{he ran into}} the cottage; {{returning}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My gracious lord {{is pleased}} to jest," [...] she said, all her fears {{returning}} to her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> an overwhelming rush that made her sick with horror.|$|E
6000|$|Ed Brann came <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later <b>with</b> his brother, {{and there}} was a {{significant}} little pause--a pause which grew painful till Albert turned and saw Brann, and called out: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{rose and}} went into the other room, {{returning}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> work basket, from which she drew a soiled and unfinished piece of embroidery.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Angelica was <b>with</b> us, {{her face}} beaming with delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} her." [...] And then, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> a sudden soft smile--"E bella!" [...] said the little girl. She was {{beautiful}} {{herself as she}} said it.|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah well then, she shan’t go there,” {{he threw}} off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a small strange dry laugh that {{attached}} his mother’s eyes in shy penetration to his face.|$|E
6000|$|Nan was on {{the spot}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the case that never left her pocket; and the wound was neatly {{plastered}} up by the time Mrs Jo arrived, demanding tragically: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{disappeared}} {{into the house and}} returned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chair which he placed {{a few feet away from}} Marcia. Then he sat and looked at her steadily.|$|R
60|$|Eliza was called, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> was curtsying, <b>with</b> eagerness, but perfect self-possession.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he was <b>with</b> her again, and {{she stepped}} into the wet punt.|$|R
6000|$|Frank's {{face grew}} saddened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a terrible sadness; {{but he said}} in a firm voice, [...] "I promise," [...] and he never broke his word from that day onward.|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{the wind}} cutting keenly at him sideways, he was {{staggering}} {{down to his}} boat; {{in a few moments}} he was clear, and creeping up the river under their own shore.|$|E
6000|$|How {{dramatic}} it all was, as Ailie said frequently afterwards. She {{was back}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{her hand on}} her heart. [...] "Mr. Sandys," [...] were her astounding words, [...] "a lady wants to see you." ...|$|E
60|$|Ippegoo {{was wide}} awake <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Rising <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} abashed look, he followed his evil genius {{out of the}} hut, where, in another compartment, his mother lay, open-mouthed, singing a song of welcome to the dawning day through her nose.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rivers {{left the}} room and {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> handsome young man, pale, elegant, composed, even to a grave indifference. What his eyes might have said was another thing; the long lashes were scarcely raised.|$|R
60|$|I was not {{prepared}} for what was to follow. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Lowell returned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quantity of stout rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, {{you forget}} yourself," [...] said Mrs. Light, with {{an attempt at}} majestic severity. [...] "Of course," [...] she added, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> a change of note, [...] "the bust would be my own property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am glad!" [...] and Mrs. Penniman {{surveyed}} her cashmere in the glass. Then, [...] "How is your father?" [...] {{she asked}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{her eyes on}} her niece. [...] "Your letters were so meagre--I could never tell!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is very {{possible}} that Verena was provoked, inaccessible as she was, {{in a general}} way, to irritation; for she rejoined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> a little deliberate air: [...] "Well, perhaps it's as well you shouldn't go, if you haven't changed at all." ...|$|E
60|$|Corny {{whispered to}} her mother, who nodded, and took out her pocket-book. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Corny, <b>with</b> some change in her hand, went quietly up to the yard and {{put the money in}} the queen's lap. Then we went away and left her, still asleep.|$|R
5000|$|Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfredo Moreno said [...] "Wikileaks puts in {{risk the}} safety of the communications. To have´them on {{disposal}} for any person, naturally that puts the United States <b>in</b> <b>a</b> difficult <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> this case ... it generates a difficulty and insecurity." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright-looking Chinese boy, {{about ten}} years old, with whose appearance and general intelligence I was so greatly impressed, that I engaged him on the spot. When the business was concluded, I asked his name.|$|R
6000|$|Osmond {{appeared}} to give no heed to this; he sat {{gazing at the}} fire. [...] "Pansy {{would like to be}} a great lady," [...] he remarked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> a certain tenderness of tone. [...] "She wishes above all to please," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, I suppose I {{may look}} at Ada's slate, though you must not,' said Claude, {{laughing}} to himself at poor little honest simplicity, as he applied himself {{to cut a}} new point to her very stumpy slate-pencil, and she scampered away, and returned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> her clean slate.|$|E
60|$|Words failed her. She {{broke off}} with a very faint primly angry smile. She was perhaps the more {{offended}} with him because of that flutter {{at the beginning of}} the conversation. And <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> perfect tact and dignity she got up from her chair and left him alone.|$|E
60|$|The man {{pushed open}} the trap-door and disappeared. He came back again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bottle <b>in</b> one hand and <b>a</b> glass <b>in</b> the other. Fischer poured {{out some of the}} cordial and drew a small table up to Graham's side.|$|R
60|$|My lord {{looked at}} Harry hard, and drank the glass, but clapped {{it down on}} the table <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of groan, rose up, and went out of the room. What was the matter? We all knew that some great grief was over him.|$|R
60|$|Hewson {{instantly}} {{decided that}} this summons {{was related to the}} affair of his apparition, without imagining how or why, and when Miss Hernshaw met him, and almost before she could say that Mrs. Rock would be down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> began <b>with</b> it, he made no feint of having come for anything else.|$|R
