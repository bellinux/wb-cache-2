25|$|AOL's {{strategy}} was to make online services available and accessible to the mass market by making them affordable, easy to use, useful and fun. At a time when competing services like CompuServe were charging for each minute of access (which varied based on modem speeds and added <b>extra</b> <b>charges</b> for premium services), AOL priced its service at $19.95 per month for unlimited use of basic tier services beginning in 1996. Within three years, AOL's userbase grew to 10 million, ultimately reaching 26.7 million subscribers at its peak in 2002.|$|E

Large horse-drawn wagons carried freight, but along with environmental risks and delays, there were additional significant charges for carriage within the city and for unloading by stevedores, so cartage was also not ideal to get finished cloth to the dock warehouses [...] therein the canal boats had the edge, for they delivered directly without <b>extra</b> <b>charges.</b> These sufficed for some time, but as Lowell grew and more industrialists built mills there, problems with both modes soon motivated them to learn more of the newfangled railways {{that had been in}} the European news increasingly since 1820.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Overlook, a {{hospital}} in northern New Jersey {{and away from the}} large urban centers, was contrasted with the urban hospital of St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center. St. Joseph's had a much greater percentage of charity patients; a reporter wrote: [...] "the bills of patients who have health insurance or who can otherwise pay are marked up 33 percent, the surcharge going to pay for charity care;" [...] in contrast, Overlook, which has a wealthier client base, only had a 6 percent charity markup. As a result, Overlook operated with a surplus while St. Joseph's was cash-strapped. Since Overlook could pay suppliers on time, it qualified for discounts based on the [...] "quantity of its purchases" [...] while the urban hospital had to pay <b>extra</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As the United States' Trade Representative, Portman was an {{attendant}} of the World Trade Organization's Hong Kong conference in 2005. He addressed the conference with {{a speech on}} development in Doha, and advocated a 60% cut in targeted worldwide agricultural subsidies by 2010. Portman then sponsored a claim against China for <b>extra</b> <b>charges</b> it levied on American auto parts. U.S. steel manufacturers subsequently beseeched the White House to halt an influx of Chinese steel pipe used to make plumbing and fence materials. This was a recurring complaint and the United States International Trade Commission recommended imposing import quotas, noting [...] "the economic threat to the domestic pipe industry from the Chinese surge." [...] With Portman as his top trade advisor, Bush replied that quotas {{were not part of}} U.S. economic interest. He reasoned the American homebuilding industry used the pipe and wanted to maintain a cheap supply and that other cheap exporters would step in to fill China's void if Chinese exports were curtailed. This occurred {{at a time when the}} U.S. steel industry lost $150 million in profit between 2005 and 2007, although China's minister of commerce cited the U.S. industry's [...] "record high profit margins" [...] in the first half of 2004 and continued growth in 2005. China next lobbied Portman to leave matters alone, meeting with his office twice and threatening in a letter that restrictions and what it called [...] "discrimination against Chinese products" [...] would bring a [...] "serious adverse impact" [...] to the U.S.-China economic and trade relationship. Portman vowed to [...] "hold [...] feet to the fire" [...] and provide a [...] "top-to-bottom review" [...] of the U.S.–China trade relationship. Portman's claim that China had improperly favored domestic auto parts became the first successful trade suit against China in the World Trade Organization. During Portman's tenure as trade ambassador, the U.S. trade deficit with China increased by 21 percent.|$|E

60|$|Havre is the sea-port of Paris, and {{is rapidly}} {{increasing}} in importance. There {{is a project}} for connecting the latter with the sea by a ship channel. Such a project is hardly suited to the French impulses, which imagine a thousand grand projects, but hardly ever convert any of them to much practical good. The opinions {{of the people are}} formed on habits of great saving, and it requires older calculations, greater familiarity with risks, and more liberal notions of industry, and, possibly, more capital than is commonly found in their enterprises, to induce the people to encounter the <b>extra</b> <b>charges</b> of these improvements, when they can have recourse to what, in their eyes, are simpler and safer means of making money. The government employs men of science, who conceive well; but their conceptions are but indifferently sustained by the average practical intellect of the country.

60|$|Hardly a {{word had}} been spoken between {{the mother and}} {{daughter}} during those three days. There had been messages sent backwards and forwards, and once or twice the Countess had violently entered Lady Anna's bedroom, demanding submission. Lady Anna {{was always on the}} bed when her mother entered, and, there lying, would shake her head, and then with sobs accuse the Countess of unkindness. Lady Lovel had become furious in her wrath, hardly knowing what she herself did or said, always asserting her own authority, declaring her own power, and exclaiming against the wicked ingratitude of her child. This she did till the young waiting-woman was so frightened that she was almost determined to leave the house abruptly, though keenly alive to the profit and glory of serving a violent and rich countess. And the old lady who let the lodgings was intensely anxious to be rid of her lodgers, though her money was scrupulously paid, and no questions asked as to <b>extra</b> <b>charges.</b> Lady Anna was silent and sullen. When left to herself she spent her time at her writing-desk, of which she had managed to keep the key. What meals she took were brought up to her bedroom, so that a household more uncomfortable could hardly be gathered under a roof.|$|E
