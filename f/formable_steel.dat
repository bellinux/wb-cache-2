40|$|Dual-phase and transformation-induced {{plasticity}} (TRIP) -assisted multiphase steels {{are related}} families of high-strength <b>formable</b> <b>steels</b> exhibiting excellent mechanical characteristics. This study shows how a ferrite-bainite-martensite microstructure containing retained austenite {{can improve the}} mechanical properties of a cold-rolled low-carbon, low-silicon steel. Such a multiphased microstructure is obtained by a heat treatment involving intercritical annealing followed by a bainite transformation tempering. Depending on the heat-treatment parameters, the samples present a variety of microstructures. Due {{to the presence of}} retained austenite, some samples exhibit a TRIP effect not anticipated with such a low silicon content. A composite strengthening effect also results from the simultaneous presence of a ductile ferrite matrix with bainite and martensite as hard second phases. A true stress at maximum load of 800 MPa and a true uniform strain of 0. 18 can be obtained by forming a ferrite-bainite-martensite microstructure containing up to 10 pct of retained austenite. These properties correspond to a favorable evolution of work hardening during plastic deformation...|$|R
40|$|TRIP-assisted {{multiphase}} steels exhibit enhanced {{strength and}} ductility properties. However, such high-strength <b>formable</b> <b>steels</b> do not seem adequate for applications in which good toughness properties are required. These properties result from the unique combination of various work-hardening and damage mechanisms taking place in a multiphase microstructure consisting of an intercritical ferrite matrix with a dispersion of bainite+martensite+metastable retained austenite grains. Martensite {{plays a crucial role}} in these mechanisms, particularly in the TRIP effect (i. e. the mechanically-induced martensitic transformation) for the improvement of plastic properties, but also in the damaging process. This study aims at establishing how martensitic transformation influences the mechanical properties (plasticity and fracture) when occurring in a multiphase microstructure. On the one hand, the dislocation density generated within ferrite by the martensitic transformation is shown to lead to a high work-hardening rate. On the other hand, it is shown how martensite strongly influences the appearance of microvoids in these steels and deteriorates the resulting fracture toughness. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|Steels {{with higher}} {{strength}} and better formability are increasingly {{required by the}} automotive industry because they can provide higher safety, reduce energy consumption and thus lead to a better environmental protection. To meet these requirements, it is a sustainable effort for steel industry to develop high strength <b>formable</b> <b>steels.</b> One of the commonly used methods for such a development is micro-alloying, that is, the addition of micro-alloying elements such as niobium, vanadium and titanium {{at a level of}} only a few hundredths of a weight percent results in a very pronounced strength-enhancing effect on the steels, provided that an appropriate heat treatment is applied. It is understood that the strength-enhancing effect primarily arises from a strong reduction in the average grain size of the ferrite, originating from the grain-refining effect during the austenisation treatment. The reason for the grain-refining effect is that the micro-alloying elements have a very strong affinity for the interstitial elements such as carbon and nitrogen, leading to the precipitation of extremely fine and widely distributed precipitates. The existence of the precipitates prevents the growth of austenite grains by means of Zener pinning. Therefore it is an essential issue for steel industry to have an accurate control of the nucleation and growth of the precipitates during thermomechanical processing of the steels. In this thesis we focus on several models describing the nucleation and growth of precipitates. This PhD research focusses on this subject.

40|$|A {{new trend}} in forming {{simulation}} {{technology is the}} development of friction models applicable to large scale forming simulations. In this respect, the optimization of forming processes and the success of newly developed friction models requires a complete understanding of the tribological behavior involved. In this paper a frequently used metal-lubricant combination is characterized at one hand, and inter-correlated friction mechanisms acting on the micro-scale are discussed at the other hand. For this purpose, cold-rolled high <b>formable</b> mild <b>steel</b> is used in combination with the deep-drawing oil Quaker N 6130. Results have been used to calibrate a recently developed multi-scale friction model applicable for large-scale forming simulations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} gain a thorough understanding of the tribological behavior involved supporting further optimization of enhanced friction models in forming processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} dual phase steels {{comprising}} of 5 - 20 % martensite in a ferrite matrix {{have come into}} the limelight of high strength cold <b>formable</b> <b>steels</b> because of their potential for vehicle weight saving. They show the following features: no yield point; relatively low initial flow stress; high initial workhardening rate; well sustained work hardening. As a consequence of these characteristics, dual phase steels exhibit a better combination of strength and elongation than other HSLA steels. In this thesis, a broad view of the factors which influence their properties is presented. Mechanical properties and forming ability of a commercially available dual phase steel and an AL-Si killed steel processed to dual phase form are investigated to ascertain the effect of their microstructure on their properties. It is found that the yield phenomena are masked by the transformation induced stresses present during processing and so yield point could be recovered under suitable ageing treatment; that apart from giving the above properties dual phasing gives rise to very low strain-rate sensitivity and a low R value ~ 1; that the mechanical response under rolling conditions is not different from those under tension; {{that there is a}} danger of damage to tooling during forming operations of these steels if fracture should precede instability as a result of grain size dependent strength found for these steels. It is also found that very little deformation of the martensite islands took place during deformation except at high strains. The work-hardening and the strength levels can be controlled by either decreasing the grain size or increasing the martensite volume fraction, but it is found that increasing martensite has a detrimental effect on ductility and the ductility and fracture strength can be controlled better by refining the grain size. A remarkable effect found in the dual phase steel tested is that the compressive strength is higher than the tensile strength. The reason for this observation is not yet clear but it is suggested that it might be due to the introduction of emissary type dislocations into the ferrite lattice as a result of twins formed in the martensite during transformation from austenite. The twins are envisaged to be { 111 } in character...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} undertaken {{to study the}} bond characteristics of Micro-composite Multi-structural <b>Formable</b> reinforcing <b>steel</b> rebars, commercially known as MMFX, with concrete. The objective of the investigation {{is to examine the}} applicability of the current equation of the ACI 318 - 02 Code on bond to predict the bond capacity of the MMFX steel rebars. The experimental program consisted of testing eight beam-splice specimens reinforced with MMFX steel rebars. The bond behaviour of the MMFX steel rebars was found to be similar to that of conventional Grade 420 MPa (60 ksi) steel up to the proportional limit of 550 MPa (80 ksi). The bond strength of the MMFX significantly changes as the tensile stresses developed in the rebar exceed the proportional limit. Therefore, test results indicated that the current ACI 318 - 02 Code equation on bond is adequate and resulted in conservative prediction at low stress levels. However, at high stress levels, the prediction is unconservative due to the nonlinear behaviour of MMFX stress-strain curve. This paper proposes a modification to the ACI 318 - 02 Code equation, using same format, to predict the bond forces beyond the proportional limit for MMFX steel rebars...|$|R
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a <b>formable,</b> high strength <b>steel.</b> Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|R
40|$|Steel {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the primary materials in use today, however, even after 200 years of published research, innovative methods are being discovered and exploited to produce steel with enhanced properties. One such recent discovery has been termed Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P). The Q&P heat treatment process is reported to produce a multiphase microstructure consisting of retained austenite stabilised to room temperature, and a harder martensitic phase. This combination is prospected to form a new generation of high strength, <b>formable</b> sheet <b>steel</b> well suited to the demands of the automotive industry. Previous research has reported on the application of Q&P to commercial grades of steel, however, the temperatures required have hampered study of the process. In this investigation a model alloy has enabled separation of Q&P into its individual stages for closer inspection. Standard metallographic techniques were used to examine the microstructure of the material, followed by X-ray diffraction measurements to determine the stability of the austenite phase fraction before and after partitioning, confirming the effectiveness of the partitioning process in stabilising retained austenite. Estimations of carbon concentration via lattice parameter measurements have provided evidence of austenite carbon enrichment, but also suggest that some carbon remains unaccounted for, possibly as an equilibrium distribution between epsilon carbides and strained interstitial sites. In-situ partititioning in a neutron diffractometer has been utilised to obtain real-time measurements of the partitioning process. These measurements suggest that redistribution of carbon within martensite occurs before partitioning to austenite becomes kinetically significant. The trapping of carbon within energetically favourable locations is postulated to be a major factor in retarding carbon migration from martensite to austenite when compared to mathematical models of the partitioning process. Neutron diffraction measurements of carbon interstitial occupancy in austenite have also provided further evidence of austenite carbon enrichment during the partitioning process.

40|$|Since {{recent times}} {{prototyping}} methods for sheet metal products have mostly {{been related to}} rapid tooling, where traditional hard dies are replaced with softer and more inexpensive short lifetime dies. There have been only a few direct sheet metal prototyping methods, and their use has been limited. On the other hand, the sheet metal industry is growing and metals are replacing plastics in many applications due to stricter recycling regulations and rapid metals development. New <b>formable</b> high strength <b>steels</b> are very attractive to industry, because they enable lighter components with the Same mechanical properties. Many industrial sectors {{take advantage of the}} new material development, and there is clear need for sophisticated forming methods. As customized products become more and more popular, and new models are created, more prototypes and one-part series are needed in a rapid time schedule and with costs as low as possible. A relatively new approach for sheet metal prototyping is lncremental Sheet Forming (ISF), a sheet metal prototyping method suitable for large variety of products without major tool changes. There is a commercially available forming machine, specially designed for ISF. Also milling machines can be used with certain limitations: the spindles are not designed to handle the forces that appear in ISF and the machines may break down in forming. This paper describes two incremental forming methods which use flexible and cost-efficient industrial robots: forming by pressing and by hammering. Using industrial robots brings cost efficiency and flexibility to the forming. The investment costs for robots are relatively low, which makes these processes well suitable for wide range of applications in a variety of business areas...|$|R
