40|$|The {{physiological}} {{activity of}} the seeds begins with water uptake, resulting in tissues rehydration and triggering metabolic events of germination. In this context, the present study aimed to verify {{the influence of the}} physiological quality and initial humidity in the water absorption rate of <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> seeds. The seeds were collected at two different sites, representing lots I and II. Seeds belonging to the two lots were placed to hydrate in water, in desiccators with relative humidity between 95 - 99 % at 15 oC and 25 oC, until they reached near four hydration levels: 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 % of seeds moisture content. The lots were evaluated for germination, germination speed index (GSI) and mean germination time (MGT). Then, the changes in the water uptake by seeds of the two lots were evaluated after they reached the desired moisture levels, by analyzing the curves of imbibition. The experimental design was completely randomized. The lots I and II were classified as presenting high and low vigor, respectively. The results indicated that the rate of imbibition varied with initial moisture content. So the difference between the curves begins at stage II of the water absorption process. <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> seeds with lower physiological quality require longer periods of imbibition to reach phase III and complete the germination process...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> {{produces}} {{a very hard}} and heavy wood, characteristically varied in color from brick red through various shades of brown (medium to nearly black). Pieces that feature veins of black coloration called spider webbing or landscape grain are especially prized. Brazilian rosewood has a distinctive floral fragrance—reminiscent of roses with a distinctive sweetness—and strongest in old growth wood. Another distinguishing feature is its outstanding resonance. An evenly cut piece that is tapped emits a bright metallic ring that sustains. This property, combined with its beauty, has made Brazilian rosewood a favorite of musical instrument makers for centuries.|$|R

40|$|During germination, {{a series}} of {{sequential}} events occur in seeds in response to endogenous and / or exogenous factors. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the physiological changes resulting from the controlled hydration in water and temperature in seeds of jacaranda-da-bahia (<b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra).</b> To this end, two lots of seeds separated as high and low vigor were used in the tests. Seeds belonging to the two lots, after desinfect, were hydrated in water, with the method of humid atmosphere (relative humidity 95 - 99 %) to reach four hydration levels: 10, 15, 20 and 25 % moisture content in seeds, in temperatures (exogenous factor) of 15 and 25 ° C. After hydration and temperature treatments, were analyzed the following variables: curve soaking, germination percentage, germination speed index (GSI) and electrical conductivity. The results showed no significant difference in seeds physiological response between the temperatures. On the other hand, for hydration was found that up to 15 % moisture content increased the seeds physiological quality of both lots, which showed higher germination values, IVG and smaller amounts of leached compounds. From 15 % moisture content were found a reduction in the quality of seeds classified as high vigor, while those of low vigor continued to show positive responses in 20 and 25 % humidity. Given this, it is concluded that the technique of controlled hydration in water favors the germination of <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> seeds, independent of the vigor.

50|$|Planning {{for wood}} {{finishing}} also involves {{thinking about the}} properties of the wood {{that you are going to}} finish, as these can greatly affect the appearance and performance of finishes, and also the type of finishing system that will give the wood the characteristics you are seeking. For example, woods that show great variation in colour between sapwood and heartwood or within heartwood may require a preliminary staining step to reduce colour variation. Alternatively, the wood can be bleached to remove the natural colour of the wood and then stained to the desired colour. Woods that are coarse textured such oaks and other ring-porous hardwoods may need to be filled before they are finished to ensure the coating can bridge the pores and resist cracking. The pores in ring-porous woods preferentially absorb pigmented stain, and advantage can be taken of this to highlight the wood's grain. Some tropical woods, such as rosewood (<b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra),</b> cocobolo (<b>Dalbergia</b> retusa) and African padauk (Pterocarpus soyauxii), contain extractives such as quinones, which retard the curing of unsaturated polyester and UV-cured acrylate coatings, and so other finishing systems should be used with these species.|$|R

Thus, new markers, such as microsatellite sequences, are desirable for improving breeding programs for A. falcata. Based on transferability and in situ localization, these microsatellite sequences can be applied as chromosome markers in the genus Aeschynomene and closely related genera. Here, we report the first microsatellite library developed for this genus; 11 microsatellites were characterized, with observed and expected heterozygosities ranging from 0. 0000 to 0. 7143 and from 0. 1287 to 0. 8360, respectively.

A atividade da PG foi detectada a partir do primeiro dia de embebição, tanto nos cotilédones como no eixo embrionário. A atividade máxima nos cotilédones foi detectada no segundo dia e, no eixo, no sexto dia de embebição. A variação no teor de proteínas foi significativa ao longo do tempo nos cotilédones e no eixo. A atividade de PG foi máxima nas temperaturas de 60 °C nos cotilédones e de 55 a 60 °C no eixo embrionário. O pH 4, 0 foi o de maior atividade da enzima para ambos os compartimentos. O KM foi de 5, 08 e de 4, 39 mM para os cotilédones e o eixo, respectivamente. O Vmax foi de 0, 026 mM min- 1 para cotilédones e de 0, 024 mM min- 1 para eixo embrionário. Nos tegumentos, a atividade específica da PG foi máxima no terceiro dia. O teor de proteína se reduziu a partir da embebição. A atividade de PG foi máxima nas temperaturas de 40 a 50 °C. O pH de maior atividade da enzima ficou na faixa de 3 a 7. O KM e o Vmax foram de 1, 34 mM e 0, 012 &# 956;mol min- 1, respectivamente. Verificou-se que a {{galactose}} é o principal componente da pectina, seguida pela manose. Na parede celular, o principal componente foi a arabinose, seguida pela xilose. Com base nos resultados, conclui-se que as enzimas α-galactosidase e PG atuam durante a germinação das sementes de <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra.</b> This work {{aimed to}} study the enzymes α-galactosidase and polygalacturonase and to verify the composition and the alteration of the cell wall sugars and the pectic component in the teguments of D. nigra seeds during the germination. The seeds were submitted to water imbibition for 168 hours. Samples of seeds were taken for the biochemical and kinetic characterization of the enzymes. Activity of the enzyme α- galactosidase increased with the imbibition, {{although it was not}} present initially in the embryonic axis of dry seeds. The maximum activity was obtained at ph 5. 5 to both compartments. In the cotyledon the activity of the enzyme was higher at temperature of 50 °C, and in the embryonic axis it was between 50 and 60 °C. The enzyme was tolerant to temperature, but {{it was not possible to}} determine its half-life at the temperature of 40 °C, in the period of 10 hours. The activity of the α-galactosidase was inhibited by &# 946;- mercaptoethanol and CuSO 4 in both compartments, the lactose and the sodium chloride stimulated the activity in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis. The KM values for the embryonic axis and cotyledons were respectively 0, 239 and 0, 228 mM. The α-galactosidase is present in the seeds of <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> and its specific activity increases during the germination period. Activity of PG was detected from the first day of imbibition, in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis. Maximum activity in the cotyledons was detected in the second day and in the axis in the sixth day of soaking. The variation in the proteins content was significant along the time in the cotyledons and in the axis. The activity of PG was maximal at the temperature of 60 °C in the cotyledons and in the embryonic axis the maximal activity was observed in a range of temperatures from 55 to 60 °C. The activity of the enzyme was higher at pH 4, 0 to all compartments. The KM was 5, 08 and 4, 39 mM for the cotyledons and axis, respectively. Vmax was 0, 026 mM min- 1 in the cotyledon enzyme and 0, 024 mM min- 1 for embryonic axis enzyme. In the teguments, activity of PG was maximal in the third day. The protein content reduced along the imbibition period. The activity of PG was maximal temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 °C. The pH of higher activity to this enzyme was obtained from pH 3 until pH 7, 0. The KM and Vmax were 1, 34 mM and 0, 012 µmol min- 1, respectively. It was verified that the galactose is the main component of the pectin, followed by the mannose. Arabinose was the most abundant component in the cell wall, followed by xylose. Based on the results, we can conclude that the enzymes α-galactosidase and PG are acting during the germination of <b>Dalbergia</b> <b>nigra</b> seeds...|$|R
