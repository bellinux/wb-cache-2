40|$|We have {{previously}} reported an acute decrease in muscle buffer capacity (βmin vitro) following high-intensity exercise. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify which muscle buffers are affected by acute exercise and the effects of exercise type and a training intervention on these changes. Whole muscle and non-protein βmin <b>vitro</b> were measured <b>in</b> male endurance athletes (VO 2 max[*]=[*] 59. 8 [*]±[*] 5. 8 mL kg− 1 min− 1), and before and after training in male, team-sport athletes (VO 2 max[*]=[*] 55. 6 [*]±[*] 5. 5 mL kg− 1 min− 1). Biopsies were obtained at rest and immediately after either time-to-fatigue at 120 % VO 2 max (endurance athletes) or repeated sprints (team-sport athletes). High-intensity exercise was associated with a significant decrease <b>in</b> βmin <b>vitro</b> <b>in</b> endurance-trained males (146 [*]±[*] 9 to 138 [*]±[*] 7 mmol H+·kg d. w. − 1 ·pH− 1), and in male team-sport athletes both before (139 [*]±[*] 9 to 131 [*]±[*] 7 mmol H+·kg d. w. − 1 ·pH− 1) and after training (152 [*]±[*] 11 to 142 [*]±[*] 9 mmol H+·kg d. w. − 1 ·pH− 1). There were no acute changes in non-protein buffering capacity. There was a significant increase <b>in</b> βmin <b>vitro</b> following training, but this did not alter the post-exercise decrease <b>in</b> βmin <b>vitro.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, high-intensity exercise decreased βmin vitro independent of exercise type or an interval-training intervention; this was largely explained by a decrease in protein buffering. These findings have important implications when examining training-induced changes <b>in</b> βmin <b>vitro.</b> Resting and post-exercise muscle samples cannot be used interchangeably to determine βmin vitro, and researchers must ensure that post-training measurements of βmin vitro are not influenced by an acute decrease caused by the final training bout...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus is a {{versatile}} organism causing mild to life threatening infections. The major threat of this organism is its multidrug resistance. The {{present study was}} carried out to investigate <b>in</b> - <b>vitro</b> activity of conventional antibiotics routinely prescribed for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infections in the Northwest of Iran and other alternating therapeutic agents which are recommended for Gram positive organisms. Materials and Methods: Clinical isolates of S. aureus were subjected to multiplex PCR for simultaneous speciation and detection of methicillin resistance. Antibacterial susceptibility pattern was determined using disk diffusion. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined using E-test strips. Results: The results revealed presence of nuc gene in all S. aureus isolates detected phenotypically earlier whereas, mecA gene was observed in 54 % of strains. On disk diffusion and MIC determination assay, all MRSA and MSSA strains were susceptible to mupirocin (except one MRSA strain), linezolid and teicoplanin. Six vancomycin intermediate S. aureus strains were detected (VISA) with MIC = 4 μg/mL, 5 of them being MRSA. In disk diffusion assay, 17. 3 % and 3. 7 % of isolates showed resistance to rifampin and fusidic acid, respectively. However, MIC 50 and MIC 90 tests shows promising <b>in</b> – <b>vitro</b> impact. Conclusion: <b>In</b> – <b>vitro</b> mupirocin was found as an effective prophylactic ointment for nasal S. aureus eradication.
