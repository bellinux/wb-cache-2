25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not definitely know that Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still thought Griffin could intercept the Confederates. Griffin moved Chamberlain's brigade at the head of his column in line of battle with great care because Griffin thought they might strike the Confederate force if they emerged from White Oak Road while his division moved toward Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Griffin advanced on Crump Road. With a Confederate counterattack still thought to be possible as Crawford moved, Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road when Warren perceived that the Confederates from the White Oak Road Line were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for or follow the moving Union division.|$|E

500|$|Henderson {{would not}} accept {{the end of his}} major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN {{reported}} that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, he claimed [...] "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off", adding, [...] "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> it out and see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|Her love of tattoos, however, gained media {{attention}} in May 2010, after Lavigne and Brody Jenner each got matching tattoos {{of the word}} [...] "fuck" [...] on their ribs. Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> a few years and make sure I still want it then.

The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|E
500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility– moral responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|As [...] the Carondelet {{closed in}} within firing range it {{opened fire on}} the fort, {{signaling}} Grant and the other generals to commence their attacks. After firing ten shells at the fort it withdrew down river. The next day Walke received orders from Grant to resume firing on the fort. Soon after the Carondelet took a hit, causing considerable damage and wounding a dozen men where it withdrew and transferred his men to the Alps and began repairs on his vessel. After repairs were made, the Carondelet resumed its attack on the fort until dusk. When news of the bombardment on the fort reached Foote he was angry that the siege had already begun, as it was his understanding that Grant was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for the arrival of}} his flotilla. in preparation for the battle Foote ordered Phelps to inspect the Pittsburg and the Carondelet, at which time he appointed him acting fleet captain for the day.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1903, Brady left New York {{apparently}} [...] "disgusted" [...] {{with what}} he viewed as continual police harassment and stayed in New Jersey for the following two months. He returned to New York on July 4 and celebrated Independence Day by drinking with several of his friends on James Street. During the festivities, local longshoreman George Stewart kicked a can [...] "full of mixed ale" [...] from Brady's hands as a practical joke. A fight then occurred {{between the two men}} and eventually led to their arrest for disorderly conduct. Once in custody, Stewart made a formal charge against Brady for assault. This [...] "greatly incensed" [...] Brady, and Stewart, when he was not allowed to drop the charges, reportedly became [...] "terror-stricken" [...] and was reduced to tears. As they were taken to their cells, Stewart threatened that [...] "I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until he kills me. I'll kill myself first." [...] 6 Jul 1903 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{confrontation}} {{took place at}} a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine [...] "Botany and Zoology" [...] meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the Vestiges published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the Origin for the Tory Quarterly for a fee of £60. Huxley was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of [...] "deserting them" [...] and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new hydropathic establishment at Sudbrooke Park, Petersham, near Richmond in Surrey.|$|E
2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we were just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until we had made something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E

2500|$|No {{conceptual}} {{music videos}} {{ended up being}} made to promote Invitation to the Dance, {{in part due to}} issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire.

Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until early next year, but we knew that they were folding.

2500|$|The Byzantine army {{marched to}} the north but did not take any actions to take back Mesembria. On 4 May there was a solar eclipse which frightened the Byzantine {{soldiers}} and lowered their morale. They encamped {{in the vicinity of}} Adrianople where the army looted and robbed its own country. In May Khan Krum also headed to Adrianople. In June both armies set their camps close to each other near the small fortress of Versinikia to the north of Adrianople. John Skylitzes in Synopsis Historion, stated that the Byzantine army was 10 times (some historians stated even 20 times) bigger than the Bulgarian hosts. That was probably overestimated but undoubtedly the Byzantine army was significantly larger than the Bulgarian. Therefore, the Bulgarians kept on a defensive position. Despite the numerical, logistic and strategic superiority the Byzantine army did not confront the adversary. Both armies became tense and anxious, having waited for thirteen days in the hot summer of Thrace, while wearing full armor. At the end the Byzantine commanders failed the test of nerve and stamina. Some of them were eager to attack and on 22 June the strategos of Macedonia John Aplakes addressed Michael and said: [...] "How much are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> and die?
