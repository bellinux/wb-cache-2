5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} <b>epistaxis,</b> other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of <b>epistaxis</b> without side effects.|$|E
5|$|Telangiectasia (small {{vascular}} malformations) {{may occur}} in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract. The most common problem is nosebleeds (<b>epistaxis),</b> which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90–95% of people with HHT. Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing; they affect about 80%. The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips, the nose and the fingers, and on {{the skin of the}} face in sun-exposed areas. They appear suddenly, with the number increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to <b>epistaxis</b> (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of <b>epistaxis</b> in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E

25|$|<b>Epistaxis</b> (blood {{coming from}} one or both nostrils) is much less common, {{occurring}} in 0.25–13% of cases. In a survey of over 220,000 horse starts in UK Flat and National Hunt (jump) racing, 185 cases of <b>epistaxis</b> were identified (0.83 per 1000 starts). Similar frequencies {{have been reported in}} Japan (1.5 per 1000 starts) and South Africa (1.65 per 1000 starts), whereas a higher frequency has been reported in Korean (8.4 per 1000 starts).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects are {{mucocutaneous}}: dry lips, skin and nose. Other common mucocutaneous side effects are inflammation and chapping of the lips (cheilitis), redness {{of the skin}} (erythema), rashes, peeling, eczema (dermatitis), itching (prunitis) and nose bleeds (<b>epistaxis).</b> Absence of dryness of the lips is considered an indication of non-compliance with treatment (not taking the drug as advised), as it occurs in almost all patients.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, <b>epistaxis,</b> hematuria, intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, hematuria and <b>epistaxis</b> also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
25|$|EIPH reduces a horse's racing performance. Severe EIPH (<b>epistaxis)</b> shortens a horse's racing career. Moderate {{to severe}} EIPH is {{associated}} with a worsened finishing position in a race, and finishing farther behind the winner. Horses with mild EIPH earn more prize money than those with more severe EIPH. While single bouts of EIPH may not even be apparent to the rider, owner or trainer of a horse unless an endoscopic examination is undertaken, the effect on performance within a single race appears to be significant but relatively subtle. In a 2005 study, horses finishing races with grade 4 EIPH were on average 6 metres behind those finishing with grade 0. However, the effect of repeated bouts of EIPH that occur with daily training may lead to more significant changes and a greater degree of tissue damage over time with consequent loss of lung function.|$|E
2500|$|Unless a horse has severe EIPH, {{with blood}} {{present at the}} {{nostrils}} (known as <b>epistaxis),</b> the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and poor appetite post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by endoscopic examination of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a bronchoalveolar lavage. [...] Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). <b>Epistaxis</b> is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. [...] To confirm whether the blood {{is coming from the}} upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although in some cases {{it is not possible to}} determine the location. [...] In the majority of <b>epistaxis</b> cases, the blood originates from the lung. [...] <b>Epistaxis</b> during or following exercise can less commonly occur as a result of upper airway hemorrhage, for example following head trauma, subepiglottic cysts, atrial fibrillation, or guttural pouch mycoses.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Epistaxis,</b> or nosebleed, is {{a special}} case, where almost all first aid {{providers}} train the use of pressure points. [...] The appropriate point here is on the soft fleshy part of the nose, which should constrict the capillaries sufficiently to stop bleeding, although obviously it does not stop bleeding from the nasopharynx or tear ducts.|$|E
2500|$|Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage (EIPH), {{also known}} as [...] "bleeding" [...] or a [...] "bleeding attack", refers to the {{presence}} of blood in the airways of the lung in association with exercise. EIPH is common in horses undertaking intense exercise, but it has also been reported in human athletes, racing camels and racing greyhounds. Horses that experience EIPH may also be referred to as [...] "bleeders" [...] or as having [...] "broken a blood vessel". In the majority of cases EIPH is not apparent unless an endoscopic examination of the airways is performed following exercise. However, a small proportion of horses may show bleeding at the nostrils after exercise, which is known as <b>epistaxis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Dengue virus causes dengue fever. Common {{names for}} dengue fever include breakbone fever and dandy fever; dengue hemorrhagic fever ( [...] and dengue shock {{syndrome}} (DSS) are the severe forms. Dengue {{is found in}} tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. People of all ages who are exposed to infected mosquitoes can get dengue fever. The disease occurs most often {{during the rainy season}} in areas with high numbers of infected mosquitoes. Only infected mosquitoes transmit dengue virus. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. The incubation period is 3 to 14 days. The period of illness is 3–7 days. [...] A person with dengue fever is not contagious. Signs and symptoms may include severe headache; retroorbital pain; muscle, joint, and bone pain; macular or maculopapular rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations, including petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, <b>epistaxis,</b> bleeding gums, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result.|$|E
