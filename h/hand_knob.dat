40|$|Background Vascular {{damage in}} the central <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area can mimic {{peripheral}} motor nerve deficits. Case presentation We describe {{the case of a}} woman presenting with apparent peripheral neuropathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography revealed an infarct in the precentral <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area, with significant stenosis in the right proximal middle cerebral artery trunk. Subsequent 3 -Tesla magnetic resonance imaging of the brain suggested cerebral angiitis. The patient experienced improved hand function following combined glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide treatment. Conclusion Vascular {{damage in the}} <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area should be considered when evaluating peripheral motor nerve deficits in the presence of normal nerve conduction velocities. The diagnosis of cerebral angiitis remains a major challenge for clinicians...|$|E
40|$|Purpose.  Volume {{rendering}} (VR) of three-dimensional (3 D) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) images shows regional intensity differences, reflecting the central sulcus (CS) region and occipital cortex. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether 3 D FLAIR with VR could be used as an alternative method to localise the CS region in comparison with functional and conventional MR-imaging in patients with perirolandic glioma. Methods.  Eleven patients with intracranial gliomas were studied with single-slab 3 D FLAIR including VR and conventional T 1 -weighted imaging. In all patients, preoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed with a motor paradigm of the hand. The hypo-intense central gyri on 3 D FLAIR with VR were interpreted as the CS area.

40|$|When damaged perinatally, as in {{congenital}} hemiplegia (CH), the corticospinal tract usually undergoes {{an extensive}} reorganization, {{such as the}} stabilization of normally transient projections to the ipsilateral spinal cord. Whether the reorganization of the corticospinal projections occurring in CH patients is also accompanied by a topographical rearrangement of the hand representations in the primary motor cortex (M 1) remains unclear. To address this issue, we mapped, for both hands, {{the representation of the}} first dorsal interosseous muscle (1 DI) in 12 CH patients by using transcranial magnetic stimulation co-registered onto individual three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging; these maps were compared with those gathered in age-matched controls (n = 11). In the damaged hemisphere of CH patients, the representation of the paretic 1 DI was either found in the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> of M 1 (n = 5), shifted caudally (n = 5), or missing (n = 2). In the intact hemisphere of six CH patients, an additional, ipsilateral, representation of the paretic 1 DI was found in the <b>hand</b> <b>knob,</b> where it overlapped exactly the representation of the non-paretic 1 DI. In the other six CH patients, the ipsilateral representation of the paretic 1 DI was either shifted caudally (n = 2) or was lacking (n = 4). Surprisingly, in these two subgroups of patients, the representation of the contralateral non-paretic 1 DI was found in a more medio-dorsal position than in controls. The present study demonstrates that, besides the well-known reorganization of the corticospinal projections, early brain injuries may also lead to a topographical rearrangement of the representations of both the paretic and non-paretic hands in M 1...|$|E
40|$|Isolated hand {{weakness}} due {{to stroke}} is infrequently observed, and often misdiagnosed as peripheral lesions. This {{study investigated the}} clinical and radiologic profiles in such patients. Five men and one woman were studied. All patients underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis. Four patients had uniform weakness {{and the other two}} had either differential radial or ulnar weakness, respectively. MRI showed acute infarctions involving the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area of the primary motor cortex (M 1) in five patients and the postcentral gyrus sparing the precentral gyrus in one patient. Two patients with uniform digit weakness had additional involvement of the inferior parietal lobule. These findings suggest that isolated or predominant hand weakness in patients with cerebral infarctions is not necessarily caused by lesions in the M 1 knob area, and that the control center of hand movement {{is not limited to the}} knob area alone...|$|E

40|$|Isolated hand paresis {{is a rare}} {{presentation}} of stroke, which mostly results from a lesion in the cortical hand motor area, a knob-like area within the precentral gyrus. I report {{the case of a}} patient who experienced recurrent ischemic stroke alternately involving bilateral <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> areas, causing isolated hand paresis. There was no abnormal finding on brain and neck magnetic resonance angiography, transthoracic echocardiography, and 48 -h Holter monitoring, and there were no abnormal immunologic and coagulation laboratory findings. The only embolic source was found to be a patent foramen ovale, which was proven on transesophageal echocardiography. The patient underwent percutaneous device closure of patent foramen ovale after alternately repeated paresis of both hands despite antiplatelet treatment. This case suggests that ischemic stroke affecting the cortical knob area, albeit extremely rare, may recur due to a patent foramen ovale, and it necessitates complete investigation, including transesophageal echocardiography, to identify possible embolic sources...|$|E
40|$|Movement related {{synchronization}} of {{high frequency}} activity (HFA, 76 – 100  Hz) is a somatotopic process with spectral power changes occurring during {{movement in the}} sensorimotor cortex (Miller et al., 2007) [1]. These features allowed movement-related changes in HFA {{to be used to}} functionally validate the estimations of subdural electrode locations, which may be placed temporarily for research in deep brain stimulation surgery, using the novel tool described in Randazzo et al. (2015)  [2]. We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) signals and localized electrodes in the region of the sensorimotor cortex during an externally cued hand grip task in 8 subjects. Movement related HFA was determined for each trial by comparing HFA spectral power during movement epochs to pre-movement baseline epochs. Significant movement related HFA was found to be focal in time and space, occurring only during movement and only in a subset of electrodes localized to the pre- and post-central gyri near the <b>hand</b> <b>knob.</b> To further demonstrate the use of movement related HFA to aid electrode localization, we provide a sample of the electrode localization tool, with data loaded to allow readers to map movement related HFA onto the cortical surface of a sample patient...|$|E
40|$|Globus pallidus interna (GPi) is an {{effective}} deep brain stimulation site {{for the treatment of}} Tourette syndrome (TS), and plays {{a crucial role in the}} pathophysiology of TS. To investigate the functional network feature of GPi in TS patients, we retrospectively studied 24 boys with ‘pure’ TS and 32 age-/education-matched healthy boys by resting state functional magnetic resonance images. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity were used to estimate the local activity in GPi and its functional coordinate with the whole brain regions, respectively. We found decreased ALFF in patients’ bilateral GPi, which was also negatively correlated with clinical symptoms. Functional connectivity analysis indicated abnormal regions within motor and limbic networks in patients (inferior part of sensorimotor area, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, medial temporal lobe, and brain stem). Transcranial magnetic stimulation sites defined by previous studies (<b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area, premotor area, and supplementary motor area) did not show significantly different functional connectivity with GPi between groups. In summary, this study characterized the disrupted functional network of GPi and provided potential regions-of-interest for further basic and clinical studies on TS...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{understanding of}} human brain functions {{makes it possible to}} directly interact with the brain for therapeutic purposes. Implantable brain computer interfaces promise to replace or restore motor functions in patients with partial or complete paralysis. We postulate that neuronal states associated with gestures, as they are used in the finger spelling alphabet of sign languages, provide an excellent signal for implantable brain computer interfaces to restore communication. To test this, we evaluated decodability of four gestures using high-density electrocorticography in two participants. The electrode grids were located subdurally on the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area of the sensorimotor cortex covering a surface of 2. 5 – 5. 2  cm 2. Using a pattern-matching classification approach four types of hand gestures were classified based on their pattern of neuronal activity. In the two participants the gestures were classified with 97 and 74  % accuracy. The high frequencies (> 65  Hz) allowed for the best classification results. This proof-of-principle study indicates that the four gestures are associated with a reliable and discriminable spatial representation on a confined area of the sensorimotor cortex. This robust representation on a small area makes hand gestures an interesting control feature for an implantable BCI to restore communication for severely paralyzed people...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{develop and}} test a novel method for coil {{placement}} in interleaved {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) /functional MRI (fMRI) studies. Materials and Methods Initially, a desired TMS coil position at the subject's head is recorded using a neuronavigation system. Subsequently, a custom-made holding device is used for coil placement inside the MR scanner. The parameters of the device corresponding to the prerecorded position are automatically determined from a fast structural image acquired directly before the experiment. The spatial accuracy of our method was verified on a phantom. Finally, in a study on five subjects, the coil was placed above the cortical representation of a hand muscle in M 1 and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to short repetitive TMS (rTMS) trains were assessed using echo-planar imaging (EPI) recordings. Results The spatial accuracy of our method is {{in the range of}} 2. 9 ± 1. 3 (SD) mm. Motor cortex stimulation resulted in robust BOLD activations in motor- and auditoryrelated brain areas, with the activation in M 1 being localized in the <b>hand</b> <b>knob.</b> Conclusion We present a user-friendly method for TMS coil positioning in the MR scanner that exhibits good spatial accuracy and speeds up the setup of the experiment.

40|$|Background: <b>Hand</b> <b>knob</b> {{infarction}} is {{a well-known}} stroke entity. Based on very limited data, embolic stroke mechanism has been considered the most frequent cause; however, prognosis is considered good. We wanted to shed more light on this phenomenon by assessing a cohort of patients referred to a general hospital stroke unit. Methods: Every subject admitted to our stroke unit with an acute isolated hand paresis in the period from 2007 to 2012 was identified prospec-tively. Patients who had suffered from a stroke in the hand motor cortex or an adjacent area explaining the acute loss of hand function {{were included in the}} study. The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria were used to classify subtypes of stroke according to etiology. The patients were followed up during autumn 2012. Results: Seventeen subjects were admitted, but in 2 of them symptoms were transitory and magnetic resonance imaging was negative. Two patients were excluded due to persisting sensory deficits. The remaining 13 (11 males and 2 fe-males) patients with an average age of 62. 9 (± 13. 4) years were included, representing 1. 5 % of all ischemic strokes diagnosed at the stroke unit in the given period.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between brain structure, cortical physiology, and learning ability in older adults {{is of particular}} interest in understanding mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline. Only a few studies addressed this issue so far, yielding mixed results. Here, we used comprehensive multiple regression analyses to investigate associations between brain structure on the one hand, i. e., cortical thickness (CT), fractional anisotropy (FA) of the pyramidal tract and individual coil-to-cortex distance, and cortical physiology on the other hand, i. e. motor cortex excitability and long-term potentiation (LTP) -like cortical plasticity, in healthy older adults (mean age 64 years, 14 women). Additional exploratory analyses assessed correlations between cortical physiology and learning ability in the verbal domain. In the regression models, we found that cortical excitability could be best predicted by CT of the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> of the primary motor cortex (CT-M 1 HAND) and individual coil-to-cortex distance, while LTP-like cortical plasticity was predicted by CT-M 1 HAND and FA of the pyramidal tract. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant inverse correlation between cortical excitability and learning ability. In conclusion, higher cortical excitability was associated with lower CT and lower learning ability in a cohort of healthy older adults, in line with previous reports of increased cortical excitability in patients with cortical atrophy and cognitive deficits due to Alzheimer's Disease. Cortical excitability may thus be a parameter to identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline and gray matter atrophy, a hypothesis to be explored in future longitudinal studies...|$|E
40|$|Stereotactic {{positioning}} devices {{allow to}} exactly navigate {{the position of}} a TMS coil with respect to the individual cortical architecture. However, the exact stimulation site {{and the size of the}} neuronal pool stimulated still remain unknown. We used a common spherical model to predict the cortical stimulation site in the motor system. In 4 subjects motor responses were registered in a small hand muscle. A stereotactic positioning system allowed to measure continually the position of the figure-of-eight coil with respect to the individual cortical anatomy visualized in an anatomical 3 d MRI scan. The coil was oriented perpendicular to the central sulcus and a hot spot was determined. Then motor responses were measured at several stimulation sites from threshold levels up to maximal responses, increasing stimulus intensity in steps of 10 (input-output function). The stimulation sites were placed in a line perpendicular to the central sulcus. With maximal stimulation intensity motor responses were obtained about 5 cm apart from the hot spot. For each stimulation site a sigmoidal function was fitted to the input-output data and the stimulation intensity for half-maximal motor responses was calculated. The distribution of the electric field strength was calculated on the cortical surface for each site using the spherical model. Finally, the region on the cortical surface was calculated where all different stimulation sites produced the same electric field strength (variance < 7). In all subjects that region was found within the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> of the precentral gyrus. Using the field model a prediction of the effective field strength is possible...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} novel method to {{determine}} the site and size of stimulated cortical area in TMS. Applied to the motor cortex, it allows {{to determine the}} likely cortical representation of muscles. Up to now, the most common procedure for this is motor mapping. In motor mapping, the obtained two-dimensional distribution of coil positions with associated muscle responses {{is used to calculate}} a center of gravity on the skull. However, classical mapping does not allow to determine the exact stimulation site on the cortex and only rough estimates of its size are possible. Our method combines physiological measurements with a physical model used to predict the electric field induced by the TMScoi l to overcome these limitations. In four subjects motor responses in a small hand muscle were mapped with 9 - 13 stimulation sites at the head perpendicular to the central sulcus {{in order to keep the}} induced current direction constant in a given cortical region of interest. Input-output functions from these head locations were used to determine stimulator intensities that elicit half-maximal muscle responses. Based on these stimulator intensities the field distribution on the individual cortical surface was calculated as rendered from anatomical MR data. The region on the cortical surface in which the different stimulation sites produced the same electric field strength (minimal variance 4. 2 ± 0. 8.) was determined as the most likely stimulation site on the cortex. In all subjects, it was located at the lateral part of the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> in the motor cortex. Comparisons of model calculations with the solutions obtained in this manner reveal that the stimulated cortex area innervating the target muscle is substantially smaller than the size of the electric field induced by the coil...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To use diffusion-tensor (DT) {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging {{in patients with}} essential tremor who were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound lesion inducement to identify the structural connectivity of the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and determine how DT imaging changes correlated with tremor changes after lesion inducement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With institutional review board approval, and with prospective informed consent, 15 patients with medication-refractory essential tremor were enrolled in a HIPAA-compliant pilot study and were treated with transcranial MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery targeting the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Fourteen patients were ultimately included. DT MR imaging studies at 3. 0 T were performed preoperatively and 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the procedure. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated from the DT imaging data sets for all time points in all patients. Voxels where FA consistently decreased over time were identified, and FA change in these voxels was correlated with clinical changes in tremor {{over the same period}} by using Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Ipsilateral brain structures that showed prespecified negative correlation values of FA over time of - 0. 5 or less included the pre- and postcentral subcortical white matter in the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area; the region of the corticospinal tract in the centrum semiovale, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in the cerebral peduncle; the thalamus; the region of the red nucleus; the location of the central tegmental tract; and the region of the inferior olive. The contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral portions of the superior vermis also showed persistent decrease in FA over time. There was strong correlation between decrease in FA and clinical improvement in hand tremor 3 months after lesion inducement (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: DT MR imaging after MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy depicts changes in specific brain structures. The magnitude of the DT imaging changes after thalamic lesion inducement correlates with the degree of clinical improvement in essential tremor...|$|E
40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) is used {{in several}} studies to evaluate cortical excitability changes induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor cortex. Interpretation of these results, however, is hindered by the very different spatial distribution of the electric field (E-field) induced by the two techniques and by the different target neurons that they might act upon. In this study we used the finite element method to calculate the E-field distribution induced by TMS and tDCS in a realistically shaped model of a human head. A model of a commercially available figure- 8 coil was placed over a position above the identified <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> (HK) region. We also modelled two configurations of bipolar tDCS montages {{with one of the}} electrodes placed over the HK and a return electrode over the contralateral orbital region. The electrodes over the HK were either rectangular in shape, with an area of 35 cm 2 or cylindrical with an area of π cm 2 (1 cm radius). To compare the E-field distribution in TMS and the two tDCS models, average values of the E-field’s magnitude as well as the polar and azimuthal angle were investigated in the HK region and premotor areas. The results show that both techniques induce fields with different magnitudes and directions in the HK: the field in tDCS is predominantly perpendicular to the cortical surface, contrary to what happens in TMS where the field is mostly parallel to it. In the premotor areas, the magnitude of the E-field induced in TMS was well below the accepted threshold for MEP generation, 100 V/m. In tDCS, the magnitude of the field in these areas was comparable to that induced at the HK with a significant component perpendicular to the cortical surface. These results indicate that tDCS and TMS target preferentially different neuronal structures at the HK. Besides, they show that premotor areas {{may play a role in}} the tDCS-induced after effects on motor cortex excitability...|$|E

Idiopathic focal hand dystonia {{is a movement}} disorder characterized by abnormal postures and loss of motor control of the affected limb. Currently, the underlying pathophysiology responsible for these motor manifestations is not fully understood. Recent empirical evidence suggests a link between deficits of cortical inhibition, maladaptive plasticity and abnormal sensory and motor processing in individuals with dystonia. These factors may contribute to an atypical organization of the <b>hand</b> <b>knob</b> area of the primary motor cortex. The current literature lacks a well designed method to clearly define and quantify healthy cortical activation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to first establish a definition of healthy cortical activation in the primary motor cortex during a finger tapping task and then use this baseline for comparison to a group of participants with focal hand dystonia. Methods. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare the cortical activation of six participants diagnosed with idiopathic focal hand dystonia to eight healthy individuals during a randomly ordered finger tapping task. Quantification of the cortical activation was performed with GLM beta weight analysis to examine for main effects and through a `Selectivity Index' that allowed for activation of a single digit (in the hemisphere contralateral to the moving digit) to be measured relative to the activation of the four other digits of the hand. Results. In the beta weight analysis differences in cortical activation was found at the group, finger and hemisphere levels (p < 0. 05). Significant interaction effects were found in activation for group x finger x hemisphere (p = 0. 02). The analysis demonstrated less selectivity of individual finger activation in both hemispheres for the dystonic group compared to the healthy group (right: p = 0. 0017, left p = 0. 0105). Discussion. This study is the first to define a method for determining the degree to which a cortical area is associated with the movement of one digit related to another. Importantly, it elucidates a potential neuropathophysiological substrate related to individual finger activation in the primary motor cortex in humans with focal dystonia...|$|E
