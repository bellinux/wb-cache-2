5|$|Phase 2: Khalid, {{aware of}} the {{situation}} at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine left wing, while the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three-pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.|$|E

5|$|General General Bernard Montgomery (commanding {{the ground}} forces in Normandy), wanted {{an attack on}} the eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front to capture Falaise, {{intending}} that such a move would precipitate a general German collapse. The First Canadian Army (Lieutenant General Harry Crerar), held this part of the Allied front. It consisted of the British I Corps, responsible for the extreme eastern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied lines and II Canadian Corps (Lieutenant General Guy Simonds) south of Caen. The II Canadian Corps, which was to launch Operation Totalize consisted of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, 1st Polish Armoured Division, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade and the British 33rd Armoured Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of Sedan and seizing the Heights of la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of Sedan and protect the southern <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation for the river crossing.|$|E

30|$|The {{materials}} erupted by the Stromboli volcano, {{which shows}} a volcanic activity constant during geological time, slide on the surrounding slopes and deposit on <b>the</b> submarine <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edifice, which are disrupted by submarine instabilities (gravitative mass fluxes, debris flows, debris avalanches, slides, rock falls, slumpings and erosion along channels). <b>The</b> <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stromboli island {{are characterized by}} <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> lineaments of gravity instability, frequent on <b>the</b> <b>flanks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic islands (Chiocci et al. 1998). Proceeding eastwards a chute of anastomized detritus occurs, generated by channellised fluxes of detritus organized in transversal bottom lineaments. To <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, channellised fluxes act on a flat sea bottom, characterized by a low reflectivity; to the west it occurs <b>the</b> submarine continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Sciara del Fuoco”, representing a main lava flow always active, which can be followed for several kilometers before that it laterally joins the Stromboli canyon.|$|R

5|$|Phase 2: Knowing {{that the}} Byzantine army was {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the left <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had {{at the start of}} the battle.|$|E

5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} left <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British landing zone. Its primary objective on day one was to capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's secondary objective was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville and hold the left <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advance.|$|E
5|$|Rodes {{initially}} sent three brigades south against Union {{troops that}} represented the right <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I Corps {{and the left}} <b>flank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> XI Corps: from east to west, Brig. Gen. George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter, manning a line in a shallow inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.|$|E

5|$|The III Panzer Corps {{met with}} stiff {{resistance}} {{as well and}} had great difficulty creating and maintaining a bridgehead across the Northern Donets River.
