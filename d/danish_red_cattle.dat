50|$|In the 1920s {{they began}} {{crossing}} with Gelbvieh. One decade later {{they changed the}} breeding aim: the draught performance, {{once one of the}} advantages, became less important.

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine renal lipofuscinosis (BRL) is an {{incidental}} {{finding in}} cattle at slaughter. Condemnation of the kidneys as unfit {{for human consumption}} was until recently considered the only implication of BRL. Recent studies have indicated a negative influence on the health of affected animals. The present study investigated the prevalence, genetics and effect of BRL on milk yield and weight at slaughter. Methods BRL status of slaughter cattle was recorded at four abattoirs during a 2 -year-period. Data regarding breed, age, genetic descent, milk yield and weight at slaughter were extracted from the Danish Cattle Database. The prevalence of BRL was estimated stratified by breed and age-group. Furthermore, total milk yield, milk yield in last full lactation and weight at slaughter were compared for BRL-affected and non-affected Danish Holsteins and <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>cattle.</b> Results 433, 759 bovines were slaughtered and 787 of these had BRL. BRL was mainly diagnosed in Danish Red, Danish Holstein and crossbreds. The age of BRL affected animals varied from 11 months to 13 years, but BRL was rarely diagnosed in cattle less than 2 years of age. The total lifelong energy corrected milk (ECM) yields were 3, 136 and 4, 083 kg higher for BRL affected Danish Red and Danish Holsteins, respectively. However, the median life span of affected animals was 4. 9 months longer, and age-corrected total milk yield was 1, 284 kg lower for BRL affected Danish Red cows. These cows produced 318 kg ECM less in their last full lactation. Weight at slaughter was not affected by BRL status. The cases occurred in patterns consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and several family clusters of BRL were found. Analysis of segregation ratios demonstrated the expected ratio for <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>cattle,</b> but not for Danish Holsteins. Conclusion The study confirmed that BRL is a common finding in Danish Holsteins and <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>cattle</b> at slaughter. The disorder is associated with increased total milk yield due to a longer production life. However, a reduced milk yield was detected in the end of the production life in Danish Red. The study supports that BRL is inherited autosomal recessively in the Danish Red breed and Danish Holsteins, but with incomplete penetrance of the genotype in Danish Holsteins. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundSequence {{data can}} {{potentially}} increase {{the reliability of}} genomic predictions, because such data include causative mutations instead of relying on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between causative mutations and prediction variants. However, {{the location of the}} causative mutations is not known, and the presence of many variants that are in low LD with the causative mutations may reduce prediction reliability. Our objective was to investigate whether the use of variants at quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are identified in a multi-breed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for milk, fat and protein yield would increase the reliability of within- and multi-breed genomic predictions in Holstein, Jersey and <b>Danish</b> <b>Red</b> <b>cattle.</b> A wide range of scenarios that test different strategies to select prediction markers, for both within-breed and multi-breed prediction, were compared. ResultsFor all breeds and traits, the use of variants selected from a multi-breed GWAS resulted in substantial increases in prediction reliabilities compared to within-breed prediction using a 50  K SNP array. Reliabilities depended highly on the choice of the prediction markers, and the scenario that led to the highest reliability varied between breeds and traits. While genomic correlations across breeds were low for genome-wide sequence variants, the effects of the QTL variants that yielded the highest reliabilities were highly correlated across breeds. ConclusionsOur results show that the use of sequence variants, which are located near peaks of QTL that are detected in a multi-breed GWAS, can increase reliability of genomic predictions...|$|E

30|$|As {{in other}} areas, the view on {{traditional}} breeds has been reversed {{when it comes}} to agricultural subsidies. Today, there is a specific EU subsidy for farmers keeping traditional breeds, paid out per head for individual animals with the right genealogy (SJVFS 2011). Mountain <b>cattle</b> (fjällko) and <b>red</b> <b>cattle</b> (rödkulla) are both eligible for this subsidy. For mountain <b>cattle</b> and <b>red</b> <b>cattle</b> to be considered pure breeds, their father and grandfather on the mother's side must both be considered 87.5 % pure and their mother 80 % pure (SJVFS 2011).
