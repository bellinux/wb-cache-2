5|$|In Goa, Mohini is worshipped as Mahalasa or Mahalasa Narayani. She is the Kuladevi (family goddess) of many Hindus {{from western}} and {{southern}} India, including Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Karhade Brahmins, Daivajnas and Bhandaris. The chief temple of Mahalasa Narayani is at Mardol, Goa, though her temples also {{exist in the}} states of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu-matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana.|$|E
25|$|According {{to local}} tradition, the church became barracks during the American Revolution and was, {{like most other}} Anglican churches in Virginia, {{abandoned}} after either the Revolution or Episcopal Church's disestablishment circa 1794. American soldiers reportedly slaughtered animals in the courtyard and used the communion table as a chopping block, although its surface was later restored. By the War of 1812, the church had fallen into ruin and an “American patrol” used the baptismal fort as a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> {{so that it was}} carried away and found on a nearby farm. They also allegedly made unspecified repairs to the brick walls.|$|E
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the leather valve. Each tube brings up several dou of brine… Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} cunning folk {{locating}} criminals using magical means concerned {{some people in}} power in England, and there are records from London in the fourteenth century showing that certain cunning folk themselves were brought to trial because of their accusations against {{other members of the}} community: for instance, in 1382 a cunning man named Robert Berewold was brought to court after accusing a woman named Johanna Wolsy of stealing a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl</b> from a house in St Mildred Poultry. In the trial, it emerged that Berewold had come to his conclusion through a form of divination known as [...] "turning the loaf" [...] where a wooden peg was stuck into the top of a loaf of bread with four knives then stuck into the sides. A list of names would then be spoken, and according to the theory, the loaf would supposedly turn when the name of the thief was spoken. Berewold was found guilty of making unsubstantiated and damaging claims, and punished in the pillory.|$|E

30|$|Jebel Khalid is {{a single}} period Hellenistic site {{on the west bank}} of the Euphrates River in {{northern}} Syria. The occupation of the site dates from the early 3 rd century BCE until its abandonment in the late 70 s BCE. The so-called Governor’s Palace, an administrative centre on the Acropolis of the site, overlooked this walled Greek garrison city. A considerable quantity of glass, predominantly <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> was excavated from this building complex. This study concerns the elemental analysis of glass samples from this assemblage by electron probe microanalysis (SEM-WDS).|$|R

While keeping the pot well stirred, they will serve the beverage in <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> [...] - [...] holding up to [...] "three Parisian quarts" [...] each [...] - [...] to the dancing men, as they pass by. While men are supposed to empty their bowls in one go (and perhaps twenty bowlfuls in a single party), the women take sips more or less continuously.|$|R

50|$|Although Kachylion's {{workshop}} only produced <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> and Euphronios {{continued to}} work for him into his maturity, simple bowls soon failed to satisfy his artistic impulse. He began to paint other vase types, probably working with different potters. The Villa Giulia holds two very early pelikes by him. Such medium-size vases offered more space for his figural paintings. A psykter now in Boston is also counted among his early work, as it strongly resembles the work of Oltos: stiff garment folds, almond-shaped eyes, a small protruding chin and ill-differentiated hands and feet. Alternatively, it could be a relatively careless work from a later phase.|$|R
50|$|The fountains {{are not all}} identical, {{but most}} share one of two basic designs. The most common version is 6 ft tall, {{consisting}} of a large circular bowl with a square pillar rising from its center placed on a square pedestal. The main bowl, intended for horses, is 6 ft in diameter and is fed by bronze spigots {{in the shape of}} lion heads on three sides of the upper pillar. The fourth side contains a bronze plaque listing details of the fountain's construction. The lower pedestal is 18 in high and has niches on each side with <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> near ground level for dogs, cats, and other small animals. The fountain is assembled from five pieces of granite weighing 10000 lb in total.|$|R

50|$|Polyphemos {{reclining}} {{and holding}} a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl</b> is a Late Classical terracotta figure that was created in Boeotia, Greece in late 5th- early 4th century BCE. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston purchased the statue in December 1901 from E.P. Warren, who bought the terracotta figure in Paris, in 1901, from a vendor who acquired it in Thebes.|$|E

25|$|During the 2nd {{half of the}} 4th century BC, mythological themes {{disappeared}} from the repertoire of Etruscan painters. They were replaced by female heads and scenes of up to two figures. Instead of figural depictions, ornaments and floral motifs covered the vessel bodies. Large figural compositions, like that on a krater by the Den Haag Funnel Group Painter were only produced exceptionally. The originally large-scale production at Falerii lost its dominant role to the production centre at Caere, which had probably been founded by Falerian painters and cannot be said to represent a distinct tradition. The standard repertoire of the Caere workshops included simply painted oinochoai, lekythoi and <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> of the Torcop Group, and plates of the Genucuilia Group. The switch {{to the production of}} black glaze vases {{near the end of the}} 4th century, probably as a reaction to changing tastes of the time, spelt the end of Etrurian red-figure vase painting.|$|R
50|$|Ice spikes {{have been}} {{reported}} as a rare natural phenomenon for decades. A model of the mechanism of formation was put forth independently by O. Bally and H.E. Dorsey in the early 20th century and this {{is still the most}} widely accepted explanation of the phenomenon today. Spikes tend to form in containers such as bird baths and pet <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> where the water freezes quickly, rather than in large bodies of water such as lakes and ponds. A number of web pages displaying photographs of unusual ice formations and discussing the phenomenon have been published, and a number of cases of ice spikes being formed on ice cubes in domestic refrigerators {{have been reported}}. The ability to grow ice spikes in a controlled environment has prompted a small number of investigations by the researchers in the Physics Department of the California Institute of Technology under the direction of Kenneth G. Libbrecht into the conditions needed for the spikes to form.|$|R

Henry gave Sir John a glass <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> {{in the hope}} that they should prosper so long as it remained unbroken. The glass, which is still intact, and still at the castle, is now known as 'The Luck of Muncaster'.|$|E
50|$|Scyphomancy (Gk. skýphos, cup, or <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl,</b> and manteia, divination), is divination using a cup or goblet. This {{may involve}} {{forecasting}} or representing {{by using a}} cup of water and reading the signs specified by certain articles floating on the water.

5000|$|Granite stones {{from the}} {{original}} bridge were subsequently [...] "presented to {{various parts of the}} British world to further historic links in the British Commonwealth of Nations". Two of these stones are in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, sited between the parallel spans of the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge, one of two major crossings of Lake Burley Griffin {{in the heart of the}} city. Stones from the bridge were also used to build a monument in Wellington, New Zealand, to Paddy the Wanderer, a dog that roamed the wharves from 1928 to 1939 and was befriended by seamen, watersiders, Harbour Board workers and taxi drivers. The monument, built in 1945, is on Queens Wharf, opposite the Museum of Wellington City & Sea. It includes a bronze likeness of Paddy, a drinking fountain and <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls</b> below for dogs. Another piece of the stone is situated under the sundial in the Wellington Boat Harbour Park, next to Clyde Quay Marina, an area of historical significance in Wellington Harbour.|$|R

He awoke to find himself lying in a hut roughly fashioned of branches, and attended by a Kaffir woman of middle age.|$|R
50|$|The archaeological {{record of}} {{woodturning}} {{is limited to}} illustrations because wood is a fiber prone to rot. Egyptian monuments illustrate a strap used by a helper to rotate the lathe while another worker cut the wood. Early bow lathes and strap lathes were developed and used in Egypt and Rome. The Chinese, Persians, and Arabs had their own variations of the bow lathe. Early lathe workers would sometimes use their bare feet to hold cutting tools in place while using their hand to power the lathe. Bow lathes continue in use {{right up to the}} present day, and much of our information about them comes from watching turners use them. Between 500 and 1500 A.D., turned wooden vessels served as the everyday bowls and cups of most of the population of Europe. Our knowledge of these humble vessels comes from bowls excavated from shipwrecks, such as the Mary Rose and the Oseberg burial ship, or dug out of deep wells, where they were preserved in a nonaerobic environment. Much of this ware was turned from green wood on a spring pole lathe. Finely crafted <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls,</b> known as Mazers, were produced in very limited quantities from dry wood, then decorated with gilded rims.|$|R
50|$|To {{honor his}} {{achievement}} in canary breeding he was dedicated an outsized, styliesed Harzbauer in a ceremonial service on 2 May 1999. To {{point out the}} special relationship between mining and canary breeding a vessel for ore processing was mounted in the cage as a symbolised <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> In 2001 the memorial was complemented with a Dennert Fir Tree which describes the breeders deeds.

50|$|Two tombs {{from this}} period with wall {{paintings}} have also been discovered in Lycia. The Karaburun tomb has a scene depicting a man reclining and holding aloft a <b>drinking</b> <b>bowl.</b> This may reflect elements of the Anatolian tradition of the funerary feast, well known from tumulus burials at Gordion. The other painted Lycian tomb is Kızılbel, which depicts Greek legends from the Homeric epics, as well as aspects of kingship similar to those seen in Assyrian imagery.|$|E

30|$|The vertically-fluted and petal-decorated bowls that {{developed}} in the Greek world from the Early into the Late Hellenistic periods, appeared in domestic glass assemblages during the early 1 st century BCE. It is supposed that these later Hellenistic bowls {{were used for the}} same purpose as the similar forms of the plainer, earlier <b>drinking</b> <b>bowls.</b> Based on distribution patterns, O’Hea argued that these carved bowls could have been produced on the Greek mainland or islands, and seem to have been distributed to Asia Minor and the Near East as a result of Hellenised taste in the Levant in the 2 nd to early 1 st centuries BCE [42 : pp. 142 – 143, 43 : p. 154]. Petal-decorated JK 08 (GN 2) and fluted JK 02, JK 12 and JK 39 (GN 10) are examples of these types found at Jebel Khalid [40 : pp. 245 – 254]. The cast fluted bowls belong to a series of Aegean Hellenistic cast bowls that imitated Greek metalware and are found for example on Delos, in the Athenian Agora and on Cyprus. Very few examples have been found in Eastern locations, such as Tel Anafa [40 : p. 256, 43 : p. 256]. Based on this evidence, O’Hea questioned Grose’s [21 : p. 194] attribution of this type to a Syro-Palestinian origin.|$|R
