Content fragmentation solves {{only part of the}} problem, as nodes still need to decide which fragment to send when a contact happens. To address this problem, we propose EPICS, a protocol designed to quickly exchange large contents in opportunistic networks. Using grey relational analysis, EPICS is able to balance the distribution of contents that have different sizes and creation times, providing fairer delay <b>distribution</b> <b>and</b> faster <b>dissemination.</b> We implemented <b>and</b> evaluated EPICS through real experimentation using Android devices.

During the heap leaching of low-grade ore bodies, the crack <b>distribution</b> <b>and</b> mineral <b>dissemination</b> in ore particles are important characteristics that determine the performance of sub-processes, such as the diffusion of reagents {{in and out of}} particle pores. Recent developments in X-ray computed tomography (CT) as an advanced diagnostic and nondestructive technique have indicated the potential for the technology to become a tool for the acquisition of 3 -D mineralogical and structural data. The spatial <b>distribution</b> of cracks <b>and</b> mineral <b>dissemination</b> in particles derived from a sphalerite ore in the Northern Cape, South Africa, was characterized using a high-resolution industrial X-ray CT system. This paper describes the use of image analysis techniques including image segmentation, which uses a combination of thresholding and other methods to characterize and quantify crack <b>and</b> mineral <b>dissemination</b> in the sphalerite particles. The results are validated with those obtained using traditional techniques such as physical gas (with N 2) adsorption, mercury intrusion porosimetry, SEM and QEMSCAN.

40|$|Fifty-six mercury-resistant (Hg-R) Bacillus strains were {{isolated}} from natural environments at various {{sites of the}} world. Southern hybridisation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that 21 of the 56 isolates have closely related or identical mer operons to that of Bacillus megaterium MB 1. These 21 isolates displayed a broad-spectrum mercury resistance and volatilised Hg- 0. PCR amplification with a single primer and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis showed that these 21 isolates had TnMEII-like class II transposons. These transposons can be classified into Tn 5084, Tn 5085, or TnMER 11.

40|$|This ethnographic master’s thesis was {{prompted}} by a fieldwork at the Obubu tea company in Wazuka, a tea farming village in the countryside of Japan. The research method was one of participant observation, primarily by full immersion in the cultivation, manufacturing, <b>distribution,</b> <b>and</b> knowledge <b>dissemination</b> of tea. The village and company were characterized by innovation, openness, informality and spontaneity, giving rise to an impression of social freedom. Very few anthropological studies have ever been done that deal directly with liberty, and even when social scientists employ the term ‘freedom’ their ideas of the concept are seldom made explicitly clear. The aim of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} academic and popular discourse on freedom by developing an appropriate analytical framework. The main discussion of the ethnography explores a range of definitions that provide clarity for future debates and research on the topic. In the thesis, episodic descriptions from the fieldnotes spark the exploration of various freedom concepts, whether these pertain to choice, autonomy, spontaneity, or some other definition. While all the concepts are connected, each offers a unique angle. Besides its main theme of social freedom, the thesis also helps to illustrate the diversity of Japan, all the while suggesting that the link between tea and social liberty might be more than a coincidence. The ethnography concludes with the acknowledgement that its list of definitions is not exhaustive, yet it nevertheless offers some of the evaluative tools necessary to recognize patterns of behavior that can be associated with freedo...|$|R
40|$|IP multicast, after {{spending}} {{much of the}} last 20 years as the subject of research papers, protocol design efforts and limited experimental usage, is finally seeing significant deployment in production networks. The efficiency afforded by one-to-many network layer distribution is well-suited to such emerging applications as IPTV, file <b>distribution,</b> conferencing, <b>and</b> the <b>dissemination</b> of financial trading information. However, {{it is important to understand}} the behavior of these applications in order to see if network protocols are appropriately supporting them. In this paper we undertake a study of enterprise multicast traffic as observed from the vantage point of a large VPN service provider. We query multicast usage information from provider edge routers for our analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study of production multicast traffic. Our purpose is both to understand the characteristics of the traffic (in terms of flow duration, throughput, and receiver dynamics) and to gain insight as to whether the current mechanisms support multicast VPNs can be improved. Our analysis reveals several classes of multicast traffic for which changes to the underlying protocols may yield benefits...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} is an emerging field focusing on assessing the creation, transfer, and utilization of knowledge to address specific challenges. Generally, knowledge management has described efforts {{within and between}} companies to consider knowledge as a manageable asset. In this paper, we suggest that occupational hygiene knowledge {{can be considered a}} manageable asset by businesses and that the entire field of occupational hygiene in the USA can be appraised in terms of knowledge management. The knowledge cycle creates a foundation for knowledge management. Knowledge creation (research, recognition <b>and</b> evaluation), transfer (<b>distribution,</b> <b>dissemination</b> <b>and</b> diffusion), and utilization (risk management and control) make up the key elements of the knowledge cycle. Defining and understanding the roles of knowledge cycle elements facilitate the application of knowledge management to problems, systems, and situations in individual companies and in the field of occupational hygiene in general.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the tnpA genes of the transposons Tn 3, Tn 21, and Tn 501 was assessed in total bacterial community DNA isolated from different marine environments. The PCR technique was employed, together with most probable number statistics, to determine the abundance of the target tnpA genes. All three genes could be detected, and the Tn 21 tnpA sequences predominated in all samples. The smallest amount of total community DNA in which the Tn 21 tnpA sequence could be detected was 0. 037 ng, and {{on the basis of}} our results, we estimated that this sequence was present in 1 of 1, 000 to 10, 000 bacteria. Hybridization of the PCR products with the respective tnpA probes verified the Tn 21 and Tn 501 tnpA sequences but only some of the Tn 3 tnpA amplification products.

Intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of Ad 5 SlacZ (12 nm fibre versus the normal Ad 5 37 nm fibre) or Ad 5 SpKlacZ (shortened fibre with polylysine motif in the H–I loop of fibre knob domain) led to similar levels of lacZ expression compared to Ad 5 LlacZ (native Ad 5 fibre) in the liver of treated animals, but did not enhance extravasation into the tibialis anterior muscle. Direct injection of the short-fibre vectors into the tibialis anterior muscle {{did not result in}} enhanced spread of the vector through muscle tissue, and led to only sporadic transgene expression in the spinal cord, suggesting that modifying the fibre length or redirecting viral infection to a more common cell surface receptor does not enhance motor neuron uptake or retrograde transport...|$|E
