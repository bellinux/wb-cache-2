50|$|Between Chapeltown and Egerton are {{the remains}} of prehistoric stone circles on moorland at Cheetham Close which {{date back to the}} Bronze Age. These stone circles are the {{earliest}} evidence for settlers in the Turton area. One of the circles was 15 metres (51 ft) in diameter and some of the stones were several feet in height. In the 19th century there were many uninvited visitors to the site which caused the local farmer, a tenant of Turton Tower, to break it up in 1871 using his team of carthorses <b>and</b> <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers.</b> Before this happened, antiquarian, Gilbert French, had made sketches, maps and plans and written a detailed description which is now in Bolton Reference Library.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{method for}} extracting copper was heating the rock via large fires, known as fire-setting. When the rock cooled down, {{it would become}} brittle and crack, allowing manual tools such as wedges <b>and</b> <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers</b> {{to be brought to}} bear. After the ore had been transported out of the mine it was roasted to reduce sulfur content in open hearths. The thick, poisonous smoke produced would be a distinguishing feature of the Falun area for centuries. After the roasting, the ore was smelted; the output of which was a copper rich material. The cycle of roasting and smelting was repeated several times until crude copper was produced. This was the final output from the mine; further refinement took place at copper refineries elsewhere. This process was used without any major change for seven centuries, {{until the end of the}} 19th century. It is likely that the methods and technology for fire-setting and drainage were imported from German mines, such as in the Harz Mountains.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Seal of the State of West Virginia {{was adopted}} in September 1863. The obverse {{center of the}} seal {{contains}} a boulder that has been inscribed June 20, 1863, the date West Virginia became a state.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{there were no}} bulldozers, earth moving equipment, etc. Work was done by hand using a star drill <b>and</b> a <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer</b> to pound holes into the very hard {{volcanic}} rock; dynamite was inserted into the holes, fuses lit, everyone ran for cover, and it blew. For construction, they used picks, shovels, crowbars, farm equipment, and $60 worth of dynamite given by the of Ventura County. The resulting rocks and debris were moved by hand and a horse-drawn fresno scraper to build the narrow, one-lane roadway.|$|R
25|$|On 7 January, Belfast City Council met for {{the first}} time since the vote was passed. The PSNI closed roads around City Hall while loyalists protested outside. The protesters called for the {{decision}} to be reversed. About 400 people had gathered near the city hall for a peaceful protest for the first time since the vote as a result of a call through social media. As protesters passed the Short Strand on their return to East Belfast, clashes again broke out between the protesters and nationalist residents. When police tried to disperse the crowds, they were attacked with petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks and bottles. Officers and their vehicles were also attacked with hatchets <b>and</b> <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers.</b> They responded with plastic bullets and water cannon. On 9 January, the Union Jack was raised at the city hall for the first time since the vote in commemoration of Catherine Middleton's birthday. The first meeting of the 'Unionist Forum' took place on 10 January. It was set up by the DUP and UUP to address the flag protests and other concerns among unionists.|$|R
5000|$|By statute, {{the seal}} {{of the state is}} two and {{one-half}} inches in diameter with the following devices inscribed thereon: At the top is the Eye of Providence or [...] "All Seeing Eye" [...] within a triangle, from which golden rays radiate on two sides. Below the eye is a Roman fasces, a bundle of birch or elm rods with a battle axe bound together with a ribbon of red, white and blue with the words, Union and Constitution. The bundle of rods bound together symbolizes strength which is lacking in the single rod. The axe symbolizes authority and leadership. Below the fasces is a heraldic shield bearing across the top a red sky behind three snow-capped mountains and clouds above them. The lower half of the shield has two miner's tools, the pick <b>and</b> <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer,</b> crossed on a golden ground. Below the shield, on a scroll, is the motto, [...] "Nil Sine Numine", Latin words meaning [...] "Nothing without providence" [...] or [...] "nothing without the Deity", [...] and at the bottom the figures 1876, the year Colorado came into statehood.|$|R
5000|$|Phantom Quest Corp. {{has been}} almost universally {{compared}} to Ghost Sweeper Mikami, a franchise with a nearly identical premise that was released slightly earlier. Anime journalist John Oppliger is convinced that Madhouse based Phantom Quest Corp. on the latter series, noting stark similarities between the protagonists of the two works. Christopher Macdonald of the Anime News Network felt the art of Phantom Quest Corp. was subpar for a Madhouse release, but {{was impressed by the}} animation, stating, [...] "Fight scenes and other scenes involving high-speed movement are absolutely astounding in animation quality". Macdonald also enjoyed the comedy found in the series, but disliked the lack of character development and how each episode's plot stands on its own without an actual story arc. Mania.com's Chris Beveridge and Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews agreeably noted that there are several enjoyable moments throughout the OVA despite this seemingly generic quality. They made similar positive comments regarding its visual attributes, with Beveridge calling the final battle in the fourth episode [...] "just great both in choreography and animation". She likened the series to a mix between Ghostbusters, The X-Files, <b>and</b> <b>Sledge</b> <b>Hammer!.</b>|$|R
50|$|The red {{and silver}} {{checkerboard}} {{pattern in the}} lower half of the escutcheon refers to the village’s former allegiance to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim and the Amt of Kastellaun. As early as 1283, Alterkülz was being mentioned in a few Sponheim documents (cule, kultze). The charge here, the <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> <b>sledge,</b> recall the iron ore mining that was undertaken at the Grube Eid (mine) from 1780 (as it is established in historical records) until the First World War. The ears of wheat stand for agriculture, once every villager’s occupation. Many lordships were enfeoffed here, the Sponheims, the Koppensteins, the Hunolsteins and the Bourscheids. The springing billygoat represents the outlying centre of Wehr, where the Wehrer Bick live, Bick being a local form of the German Böcke (“bucks”, “male animals”, and thus in this case, “billygoats”). The billygoat also graces the new town hall’s roof.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{variants}} of asbestos-pottery depending on its asbestos amount. Asbestos pottery had an asbestos amount of 50-60%. It is usually found along with evidence suggesting metal work, i.e. crucibles, moulds, slag, fused clay, artefacts of bronze <b>and</b> copper <b>and</b> stone <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers.</b> There {{are a few}} finds of pure copper artifacts among asbestos ceramic finds. These include a bracelet and a hatchet (Finland) and some pieces of copper (Sweden). Asbestos ceramic {{may also have been}} used as a heat-storage medium. The vessel patterns are identical to the Neolithic and Bronze Age Jōmon culture in Japan (jōmon = rope pattern). The most common patterns, however, are the comb and pit decorations typical of North-Eastern Europe at the time (Finland).|$|R
5000|$|Ice Breakers: Played in {{separate}} {{male and female}} heats, each player has to race toward a pile of oversize ice blocks, retrieve one ice block at a time, then race toward their designated tables, <b>and</b> use a <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer</b> to smash as much ice as possible through the grates (while wearing protective goggles and gloves), in which the containers below will be filled with the smashed ice. The process continues for five minutes, after which each container is weighed at a weigh station. The player whose container weighs the most after five minutes wins.|$|R
50|$|The ear {{of wheat}} on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side symbolizes agriculture, which for centuries held great {{importance}} to the municipality. This charge surmounts (that is, overlays) another, the <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>sledge,</b> mining tools that recall the centuries of slate mining in the municipality. The tincture vert (green) refers to the municipality’s woodlands. The “chequy” pattern on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side refers to Belg’s former allegiance to the “Further” County of Sponheim. It lay in the Oberamt of Kirchberg.|$|R
5000|$|In the DC Comics miniseries DC: The New Frontier, a black man, John Wilson, {{takes on}} the name [...] "John Henry" [...] while donning a black hood secured by a hangman's noose <b>and</b> {{produces}} a <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer</b> {{in an attempt to}} avenge his family, who were murdered by the KKK. He kills two Klansmen and injures many more before being injured; while hiding in a barn he is discovered by a young white girl. He is then killed by the Klansmen. John Henry Irons is seen in the epilogue reading near John Henry's gravestone. This serves to further emotionally connect the hero Steel and his namesake to the folk hero.|$|R
