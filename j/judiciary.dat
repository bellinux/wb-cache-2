5|$|New Zealand's <b>judiciary,</b> {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts. Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence. This theoretically allows the <b>judiciary</b> to interpret the law {{based solely on the}} legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789 had {{provided}} that two judges or justices {{would constitute a}} quorum. The practice of sending a single circuit rider was explicitly authorized by the <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793, but was already common before 1793. Under the Judicial Act of 1802, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the <b>Judiciary</b> Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has {{a typical}} civil law legal system. The <b>judiciary</b> is {{overseen by the}} Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the {{application}} of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's <b>judiciary,</b> along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the <b>judiciary</b> falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The <b>judiciary</b> is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E

5|$|Coolidge {{nominated}} 17 {{judges to}} the United States Courts of Appeals, and 61 judges to the United States district courts. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including Genevieve R. Cline, {{who became the}} first woman named to the federal <b>judiciary</b> when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court in 1928. Coolidge also signed the <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1925 into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.|$|E
5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the <b>Judiciary)</b> and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate <b>Judiciary</b> Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the <b>Judiciary</b> Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E

The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to the <b>judiciary</b> is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v.

The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
