In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and the Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier to play bass guitar. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on 25 March 2008.|$|E

While Dwight locates a stripper named Elizabeth (Jackie Debatin) for Bob Vance's party, Jim orders an educational Benjamin Franklin impersonator (Andrew Daly) as a joke. Pam and Karen have fun gently heckling the impersonator. Jim tells Dwight that the impersonator is the real Ben Franklin. Dwight says he's [...] "99% sure" [...] {{this is not so}} but asks questions to the impersonator that he believes only the real Ben Franklin would know. The well-practiced impersonator answers each question correctly without hesitation, much to Dwight's anger and disbelief. In the break room, Karen confronts Pam about Jim and Pam's kiss and asks if she is still interested in Jim.

500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him.

[...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine.

500|$|Striking at 5:30a.m. on Saturday, 16 December, the Germans {{achieved}} {{almost total}} surprise in {{breaking through the}} allied lines, beginning what is commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. The Germans launched their great attack of 1940 through the same region, with Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt in command then as he was once again in this campaign. His goal was to separate the American forces from the British and Canadian forces, and take the important port city of Antwerp. By late afternoon the Germans had 14 divisions operating in the Ardennes, but this number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions, with 600 tanks and 1,000 aircraft. The 106th Division, located in the most exposed positions along the corps line, and the 28th Division took {{the brunt of the}} attack. Middleton, headquartered in Bastogne, was awakened by a guard and could hear the guns from there. Throughout the day, the 106th was able to hold its position, but additional German units poured in during the night. Much of the 106th was on the German side of the Our River in an area known as the Schnee Eifel. The division's commander, Major General Alan Jones, called Middleton, concerned about his two regiments east of the river. The conversation was interrupted by another call, and then resumed. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> Middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have the two regiments pull back to {{the west side of the}} river. Jones, on the other hand was convinced that Middleton had directed these units to stay, and was further convinced of this based on a written order from earlier in the day, but just received. [...] As a result of the miscommunication, the pullback did not occur, and the two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of the men captured on 17 December. [...] While two of the 28th Division's regiments survived the German onslaught intact, the 110th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Hurley Fuller, was directly in the path of the massive advance. On 17 December Fuller counterattacked, but his lone regiment was up against three German divisions, and when Fuller's command post was attacked his escape was thwarted and he was taken prisoner. Middleton next heard from him in April when he was released. Though the 110th Regiment was shattered, the stubborn resistance given by them and other VIII Corps units greatly slowed down the German timetable.|$|E

The 106th was later described as being [...] "newly arrived and unpracticed", while the 28th had recently suffered heavy casualties in fighting to clear enemy forces from the Hürtgen Forest.

40|$|This {{research}} studies <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations {{in the film}} entitled The Day After Tomorrow. It is conducted to find out <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations employed by the main characters, the way the main characters deliver the elicitations {{with respect to the}} participants' statuses and roles, and the reasons why the main characters employ certain elicitations in the film. This research deals with socio-pragmatics approach. It is a descriptive qualitative study, and it employs a purposive sampling as the sampling technique. The data are all the dialogs containing the elicitations, verbal and non-verbal response in the film, which have significant relationship with the problem statements. There are 61 data found in the film. The 61 data having the same characteristics are then reduced by using criterion-based selection. The data are then identified by using Tsui�s theory on elicitations to identify what types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations are employed by the main characters. The researcher uses SPEAKING formula, Brown and Levinson�s theory <b>of</b> politeness and <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> intonation to reveal how the main characters employ the elicitations. The researcher also uses Holmes� social dimensions and Fishman�s domain of language use to find out the reasons why the main characters employ the elicitations in the film. The elicitations are an adjacency pair event; therefore, Tsui�s classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations� responses is used to analyze the elicitations responses. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this research shows that there are five types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations employed by the main characters. They are elicit: inform (30 data), elicit: confirm (14 data), elicit: agree (7 data), elicit: repeat (1 datum), elicit: clarify (9 data). It is also found that each type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations is delivered by the main characters in various ways. It is closely related to the intonation and the key �the facial expression and the body language� presented by the participants when they have a conversation. It is found that the responses prospected given by the addressees and the receiver are also various. The responses found in the film are positive verbal response, positive non-verbal response, negative verbal response, and temporization verbal response. The researcher also finds that <b>the</b> appearances <b>of</b> certain types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations are influenced by some factors. They are <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> situations, <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation,</b> <b>the</b> social statuses and roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants, the social dimensions and <b>the</b> domains <b>of</b> language use. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this research is expected to give input dealing with <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations and their responses prospected related to the social factors for the students, lecturers, and other researchers. The researcher suggests other researchers who are interested in socio-pragmatics study to conduct a further research on the elicitations and their responses. They may relate it with other social factors such as gender and age. They can also try to conduct a field study to study <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elicitations and their responses related with certain social factors in a real life. �...|$|R
