It took him three attempts and special coaching to pass his intermediate exams, and he had little immediate prospect of passing his accountancy finals. He also estimated that he was earning more from his property business than the partner to whom he was articled. With the expiry of his articles in January 1958 he could no longer avoid conscription into National Service.|$|E
25|$|According to 2006 {{survey by}} Research & Branding Group (Donetsk) 39% of Ukrainian {{citizens}} {{think that the}} rights of the Russophones are violated because the Russian language is not official in the country, whereas 38% of the citizens have the opposite position. According to annual surveys by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences 43.9% to 52.0% of the total population of Ukraine supports the idea of granting the status of state language to Russian. At the same time, this is not viewed as an important issue by most Ukraine's citizens. On a cross-national survey involving ranking the 30 important political issues, the legal status of the Russian language was ranked 26th, with only 8% of respondents (concentrated primarily in Crimea and Donetsk) <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an important issue.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a year}} of fire tiger in Jinki (the year 726). A monk {{from the}} Kii Province, Tōkōbō Yūkei was journeying in Adachigahara when the sun was about to set, and {{requested}} {{to be allowed to}} stay in a cave for lodging. An old lady lived in that cave. The old lady who seemed to have kindly let in Yūkei then left the cave telling Yūkei that there was not enough firewood and she needed go outside to get some more but that during this time Yūkei must not look in the room further in. However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of hostilities, Lloyd George arranged a ceremonial reception for Marshal Foch on 1 December; Haig was asked to travel in the fifth carriage with Sir Henry Wilson but not invited to the reception. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a snub and an attempt to win votes for the imminent General Election, Haig declined to attend at all, although he did swallow his dislike of Lloyd George enough {{to vote for the}} Coalition. In November 1918 Haig refused Lloyd George's offer of a viscountcy, partly as he felt it was another snub, as his predecessor Sir John French had been awarded the same rank on being removed from command of the BEF, and partly to use his refusal to bargain for better state financial aid for demobilised soldiers, whom Henry Wilson told him were amply provided for by charity. Haig held out despite being lobbied by the King, until Lloyd George backed down in March 1919, blaming a recently sacked pensions minister. Haig was created Earl Haig (subsidiary viscountcies and baronies), received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and a grant of £100,000 (his secretary Philip Sassoon had asked for £250,000), to enable him to live in the style appropriate to a senior peer.|$|E

500|$|Siva was remade by Varma in Hindi as Shiva in 1990, and was Nagarjuna's acting {{debut in}} Hindi cinema. It {{was the last}} Hindi film with Amala in a lead role. Minor changes {{were made to the}} remake's cast and crew. All the songs in the Telugu version were used {{unchanged}} except for [...] "Botany", which was reshot at Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in Rajendranagar. Telugu filmmaker Puri Jagannadh was cast as one of Nagarjuna's friends in the remake. Jagannadh wanted to assist Varma and approached him for an opportunity. Varma insisted Jagannadh to act and he obliged, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> experience would teach him something. Produced in association with Atluri Purnachandra Rao on a budget of 11.5 million, Shiva was released on 7 December 1990 and was successful in Mumbai and Kolkata.|$|E

500|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} as arcade-style from the start, as core {{members of the team}} like Kusunoki came from Sega's arcade department. [...] Team Andromeda wanted to create a fully 3D arcade game, having worked on similar games such as Out Run which were not truly 3D. With influences like Space Harrier, Starblade, Star Fox, and RayForce, the project became a 3D rail shooter. Usually, in 3D shooters, the player rides a 3D object like a jet fighter or a tank. Futatsugi and Kusunoki decided, however, that it would be more original for the player to ride an armored dragon, a living creature which would also allow for richer animations. The game's name originates from its original concept, referred to as [...] "armored dragon" [...] (kiko-ryu in Japanese), but Futatsugi, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was too bland, decided to translate it to German.|$|E

[...] Soon after his visit, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song {{describe}} a [...] "tortured romantic scenario" [...] of a newly formed couple's relationship, which, according to McCall, is enhanced by the piano and guitar arrangements. Kelley and Scott alternate on lead vocals. It speaks of the couple who prefer not to take their romantic relationship further anytime soon, want to take things slow, and are satisfied with [...] "just a goodnight kiss". McCall {{also noted that the}} lyrics portray how the female character's lines, sung by Scott, attempt to fight back her lustful feelings, and precariously sighs the line [...] "I don't want to mess this thing up." [...] Scott told Billboard that [...] "there is so much excitement {{at the beginning of a}} new relationship ... all the butterflies and that optimistic <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> person could be 'the one'. This song is about one of those times when your brain kicks in and tells your heart 'good things are worth waiting for.'" [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that the song's production is [...] "emblematic of the album's midtempo complacency." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix noted that the strings [...] "give a nice lift at the end." ...|$|E

Before he is dismissed, Bartimaeus attempts to warn Nathaniel against the typical road of a magician involving power-seeking behavior, materialism, and a generally shallow existence, also adding that Nathaniel should beware of his new master. Bartimaeus tells Nathaniel that he has something other magicians lack, something that he should guard, a conscience.

He spots the blurry outline of a woman trying to flag the auto down, and gestures to her that it is already occupied. As he does, their fingers accidentally touch, and Harsha feels an electric current passing through him, which triggers a few fleeting images. Later, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the girl he {{was destined to be}} with, he enquires about her to a woman named Indira (called [...] "Indu"), without realising that she is the same girl. Indu, thinking that he is stalking her, misdirects him. She and her friends take advantage of Harsha, duping him out of his finances. Meanwhile, Indu's distant cousin Raghuveer, lusts after her. He manipulates Indu and her father into trusting him. However, whenever he attempts to touch a sleeping Indu, he sees visions of a warrior slitting his throat. Raghuveer consults a tantrik, Ghora, who reveals to him that in a prior life, he was a prince who lusted after Indu, and was killed by her lover, a warrior. Raghuveer is determined to find the reincarnation of the warrior and kill him. Meanwhile, Harsha discovers how Indu and her friends have been defrauding him, and she falls in love with him.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|On the D.C. Circuit, Scalia built a {{conservative}} record while winning applause in legal circles for powerful, witty legal writing, which was often {{critical of the}} Supreme Court precedents he felt bound as a lower-court judge to follow. Scalia's opinions drew the attention of Reagan administration officials, who, according to The New York Times, [...] "liked virtually everything they saw and... listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect". In 1985, though there was then no vacancy on the Court, Reagan administration officials put Scalia on a short list with fellow D.C. Circuit Judge Robert Bork, to be considered if a justice left the Court. In 1986, Chief Justice Warren Burger informed the White House of his intent to retire. Reagan first decided to nominate Associate Justice William Rehnquist to become Chief Justice. That choice meant that Reagan {{would also have to}} choose a nominee to fill Rehnquist's seat as associate justice. Attorney General Edwin Meese, who advised Reagan on the choice, seriously considered only Bork and Scalia. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might well be Reagan's last opportunity to pick a Supreme Court justice, the president and his advisers chose Scalia over Bork. Many factors influenced the decision. Reagan wanted to appoint the first Italian-American justice. In addition, Scalia was ten years younger and would likely serve longer on the Court. Scalia also had the advantage of not having Bork's [...] "paper trail"; the elder judge had written controversial articles about individual rights. Scalia was called to the White House and accepted Reagan's nomination.|$|E
40|$|In {{classical}} credibility theory, a linearized Bayesian {{forecast of}} the fair premium for an individual risk contract is made using prior estimates of the collective fair premium and individual experience data. However, collateral data from other contracts in the same portfolio is not used, in spite of intuitive <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> data would contain additional evidence {{about the quality of}} the risk collective from which the portfolio was drawn. By using a hierarchical model, one makes the individual risk parameters exchangeable, in the sense of de Finetti, and a modified credibility formula is obtained which uses the collateral data in an intuitively satisfying manner. The homogeneous formula of Buehlmann and Straub is obtained as a limiting case when the hyperprior distribution becomes "diffuse"...|$|R

For the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> love story examines are built up more through music than through talking, and through mysterious deeds, carried out by one character and observed by the other, that don't seem to add up.

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was critical of the album writing he [...] "literally laughed out loud when I heard the Duffster was releasing a best-of album titled Most Wanted." [...] He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that [...] "apparently there aren't even enough bearable moments in Duff's recording career to fill one CD". Gabriel Leong of MTV Southeast Asia started the review by writing [...] "A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you've only had two albums so far. So let's call this one a compilation album instead." [...] Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves [...] "its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that it was [...] "a little early in the career" [...] to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that [...] "Duff is more product than talent." [...] Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle also commented that it was premature as {{it was too early}} in Duff's career to release a greatest hits compilation. He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they [...] "help alleviate the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a total cash grab." [...] In 2006, Rolling Stone included the album in their Lamest Greatest Hits Albums Ever list.|$|E
