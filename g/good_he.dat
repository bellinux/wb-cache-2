5|$|The captives {{were treated}} quite generously by Carleton. Although the {{conditions}} of their imprisonment were not always <b>good,</b> <b>he</b> provided them with clothing, and eventually had all but the officers transported to New York and released.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959, Hordern {{made his}} debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé's comedy Moonbirds, {{alongside}} the comedian Wally Cox. The play {{was a disaster}} and closed after only two nights and three performances. Little was offered {{in the way of}} praise, although critics singled out Hordern's performance in particular as being <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> was unsure why the play failed, and attributed it to clashes of personality between cast and management.|$|E
5|$|Some Russian nationalists, such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, {{stated that}} they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008. Lukashenko responded that he would not run for the Russian presidency, but that if his health was still <b>good,</b> <b>he</b> might run for reelection in 2011.|$|E

5|$|At the age of16, Buxton was illiterate, {{but with}} the aid of The Common Spelling Book he taught himself to read. He was unable to {{understand}} or pronounce all words correctly and so procured a copy of Jones Pronouncing Dictionary. He read more books, such as A History of England and Goldsmith's History of Greece and Rome. Reading occupied all his spare time, although when trade was <b>good</b> <b>he</b> had to work from 6:00am until 9:00pm. He earned about 14 to 15 shillings (70p-75p) a week, a good wage for the time, but as cloth was superseding leather in making the tops of children shoes, this did not last.|$|E
5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} {{that since the}} marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so <b>good,</b> <b>he</b> {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed {{as a kind of}} confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E

5000|$|After {{moving to}} Chicago he taught for three years. During {{that time he}} became {{interested}} in aluminum ware. At his request his cousin, Arthur Reymond, exhibited some of this aluminum ware at the World's Fair in 1893. [...] Koenig made similar exhibits in San Francisco and St. Louis. Most of the <b>goods</b> <b>he</b> displayed were imported from Germany. Due to the success he had in selling the <b>goods,</b> <b>he</b> decided to start manufacturing aluminum goods in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland {{advanced}} to the NFL championship {{for the third time}} in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and bothered him all season.|$|E
5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to be his own.|$|E

5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople. Despite the success, however, Simeon I {{realized that there was}} still a lot {{to do in order to}} prevail over the Empire for <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
5|$|The {{smell of}} fire brings back bad {{memories}} for Ben, who confesses to Clara {{that his father}} was a real barn-burner. He tells her how, at age ten, he warned a farmer {{that his father was}} about to set another fire. Ben's father got away, never seen again. Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so <b>good,</b> <b>he</b> may have to live forever.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century {{scholastic}} {{philosopher and}} theologian {{heavily influenced by}} Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his Summa Theologica. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his Five Ways, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> concluded that God is goodness, {{and that there is}} no evil in God.|$|E

5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was <b>good,</b> <b>he</b> worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, eight German-built Orjen-class MTBs were added. Also in 1936, a new naval coastal command was {{established}} {{under the command}} of a rear admiral. It was headquartered in Split, and included shore-based commands at Selce, Šibenik and Đenovići. By the end of that year, the KJRM consisted of 27 surface combatants, four submarines, and around a dozen auxiliary vessels, crewed by a total of 487 officers and about 5,000 men. The yacht Lada had been disposed of, as had the minesweeper D2. The training ship Sitnica had been converted into a second submarine depot ship, and the Galeb-class mine tenders had been reclassified as minelayers. The river flotilla consisted of the four monitors, the royal yacht Dragor, two patrol boats—Graničar and Stražar, and three river tugs; Cer, Triglav and Avala. However, in 1936 the only vessels ready for war service were Dubrovnik and the four submarines, and the navy was only considered capable of patrol duties and coastal surveillance, minelaying and minor raids against enemy shipping. Despite this, the United States naval attaché observed that the morale and discipline of the navy was very <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> further stated that higher-level commanders appeared discouraged at the poor position of the navy due to its inadequate budget. He concluded that the fleet was in very good condition considering its funding. During 1936, Nebojša and Osvetnik visited Corfu, and Zmaj and three Galeb-class mine tenders also visited Corfu.|$|E
5|$|In its {{summary of}} the 1927 season, Wisden named him as Kent's best batsman and noted an {{improvement}} in his defensive technique. Against Lancashire, who retained the County Championship, he scored 260 in three hours' batting, the highest score of his career. The Lancashire bowling attack included former Australian Test bowler Ted McDonald, regarded as the fastest bowler {{in the world at}} the time and feared by most county batsmen. Many critics praised Chapman's innings {{as one of the best}} ever played. He was selected to lead the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's for the first time, and led representative sides in two of the three Test trials held that season; the press judged his captaincy to be <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> totalled 1,387 runs in first-class games at an average of 66.04, the highest aggregate and average of his career. The Kent captaincy became available at the end of the season, but Chapman was not appointed; according to Chapman's biographer, David Lemmon, he was probably approached but was unable to dedicate the necessary time to the position.|$|E

25|$|The {{details of}} Rameau's life are {{generally}} obscure, especially concerning his first forty years, before {{he moved to}} Paris for <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> was a secretive man, and even his wife knew nothing of his early life, which explains the scarcity of biographical information available.|$|E
25|$|He {{played only}} five {{first-class}} matches in 1960, {{and after the}} game against Gloucestershire in early July {{he was out of}} the first team for <b>good.</b> <b>He</b> was released by Glamorgan, only discovering his fate when he saw it printed in the local newspaper.|$|E
