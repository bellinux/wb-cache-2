40|$|Worlds Out of Nothing is {{the first}} book to provide a course {{on the history of}} {{geometry}} in the 19 th century. Based on the latest historical research, the book is aimed primarily at undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics but will also appeal to the reader with a general interest in the history of mathematics. Emphasis is placed on understanding the historical significance of the new mathematics: Why was it done? How - if at all - was it appreciated? What new questions did it generate? Topics covered {{in the first part of}} the book are projective geometry, especially the concept of duality, and non-Euclidean geometry. The book then moves on to the study of the singular points of algebraic curves (Plücker’s equations) and their role in resolving a paradox in the theory of duality; to Riemann’s work on differential geometry; and to Beltrami’s role in successfully establishing non-Euclidean geometry as a rigorous mathematical subject. The final part of the book considers how projective geometry, as exemplified by Klein’s Erlangen Program, rose to prominence, and looks at Poincaré’s ideas about non-Euclidean geometry and their physical and philosophical significance. It then concludes with discussions on geometry and formalism, examining the Italian contribution and Hilbert’s Foundations of Geometry; geometry and physics, with a look at some of Einstein’s ideas; and geometry and truth.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{important}} <b>to</b> teach students <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>essays</b> in second/foreign (L 2) effectively by various instructional techniques. Moreover, persuasive writing {{is one of}} the means by which students can be encouraged to create meaning. This study then investigates whether strategy-based instruction is an effective classroom-based practice in raising the ability in persuasive type of writing. Additionally, it compares the effectiveness of process-oriented strategy-based instruction with a nonstrategy-based instruction in an advanced writing course. In so doing, it employed Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD) and non-SRSD (i. e. a more product-oriented traditional method) models in two writing classes at two universities. The SRSD model included six stages (Develop Background Knowledge, Discuss Strategy, Model It, Memorize It, Support It, and Independent Performance) using POW + TREE mnemonic chart, persuasive essay examples, TREE graphic organizer, and transition word chart. To probe the objectives of study, 60 Iranian EFL undergraduates participated in the study which used a pretest-posttest control group design. The analyses of covariance revealed that both SRSD and non-SRSD instructions {{had a significant impact on}} the EFL participants’ persuasive writing ability. But SRSD model was significantly more effective in improving the persuasive writing ability of the EFL learners (i. e., format and content, organization and coherence, sentence construction and vocabulary in writing). By implication, if L 2 learners have the necessary metacognitive knowledge and self-regulation strategies of L 2 writing, they will come to achieve competence in L 2 writing sooner, which allows them to attain a positive sense of self-efficacy in their writing...|$|R

As students need to communicate orally, they also need <b>to</b> <b>write</b> compositions, <b>essays,</b> reports, homework assignments, lesson plans, among others.

40|$|This brief {{work stands}} against a {{four-year}} stretch of writing classes at Northern Virginia Community College, {{with the author}} teaching English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) students <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> academic <b>essays.</b> The courses taught have included high intermediate and advanced writers, many of whom plan to earn a degree at the college or any number of four-year schools around Virginia. For these non-native writers, the clarity expressed above by Dr. Seuss’s Horton is often a foreign experience: these students find it quite difficult <b>to</b> <b>write</b> accurately what they mean. This exploratory paper first looks at the dilemma from the students’ perspective. From their view, overcoming Horton’s problem requires {{a heavy dose of}} grammar fused with vocabulary. Writing instructors address the dilemma through their teaching practice, which is often, according to Joy Reid et al. (2008), founded on misunderstandings of academic writers’ needs. Reid and her co-authors counter those practices with a research-driven series of perspectives on learning writing. Examining the insights drawn from these views, this paper turns to a solution from the past: the Trivium, which was the classical model for teaching writing from the Classical Age through the Renaissance. The Trivium is but one possible solution for helping ESL writers address the Horton dilemma...|$|R

The participants were 6 teacher interns and their (N = 209) secondary-school students in Hong Kong. In a 3 session instruction unit, the teacher interns taught their students <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an expository <b>essay.</b> The students completed the essay and then a questionnaire to report their motivation in the task and {{their perception of the}} instruction. Results of structural equation modeling showed that students' motivation mediated the effects of instructional practices on writing performance. The authors found that when the teachers adopted more motivating teaching strategies, the students were more motivated. When the students were more motivated, they, in turn, had better performance in writing. Copyright © 2006 Heldref Publications. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

In order to manipulate the practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> skills, students could not only focus on memorizing the format and neglect the importance of the content. The neglect of this practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> skills results in many students getting fair marks in practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> paper, and especially they perform poorly in public examinations. Hence, having an effective way of teaching to improve students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability and <b>to</b> enhance their way of thinking is important. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effectiveness of the use of group discussion in lessons on improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability. A sampled class with 32 S. 2 students from a band two local school was invited to participate in this study. The effectiveness of group discussion on improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability would be assessed by the comparison of the pre-test and post-test results, as well as the analysis of the content in pre-test and post-test. Besides, questionnaires were distributed and individual interviews were carried out in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the study. Analysis shows that group discussion is effective in improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability and in enhancing students’ content consciousness. As reflected from students’ improved marks in the post-test compared with the pre-test, group discussion teaching methodology is effective in improving students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability. The improved content in the post-test also shows that it has aroused students’ content consciousness. Besides, the data collected from the questionnaires and the individual interviews reflect that students enjoy learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a practical <b>essay</b> through group discussion, and they do acquire the skills of writing a good practical essay through this means. Therefore, the use of group discussion in lessons does not only improve students’ ability <b>to</b> <b>write</b> practical <b>essay,</b> but also arouses their interest. Thus, it is effective and practical to use group discussion to improve students’ practical <b>essay</b> <b>writing</b> ability in mainstream schools. 實用文寫作是中學生必須學習的元素，亦是生活上常見的文體，學生要掌握實用文寫作的方法，並不可只是注重格式，而不注重內容。很多學生的實用文寫作表現一般，尤其在公開考試中成績表現遜色，這都是因為他們對實用文寫作的忽視。 因此，運用有效的實用文教學法以提升學生的寫作能力及思維模式是不可缺乏的。 本研究旨在探討小組討論於課堂上的使用對提升學生實用文寫作的成效。是次研究有 32 名就讀第二組別學校的中二級學生參與。研究通過比較學生前測及後測成績變化、檢視前測及後測文句上的改變，以及透過問卷及個人訪談等方式以試驗研究成效。 研究結果顯示，小組討論教學法對提升學生實用文寫作能力及語境意識皆有明顯的成效，為實用文教學提供一個有效的教學法。學生的後測成績有明顯的進步，證明學生在小組討論教學法後實用文寫作能力有所提升。從前、後測的文句分析亦可見學生的語境意識有所提高。另外，問卷調查及個人訪談中反映學生喜歡以小組討論的形式進行實用文教學，小組討論教學法能令學生掌握實用文寫作的方法及享受課節。 由此可見，在課堂上使用小組討論教學法能提升學生的實用文寫作能力及興趣，是有效的教學法，在主流學校的中國語文課節上使用是可行的。published_or_final_versionEducationBachelorBachelor of Education in Language Educatio...|$|R
