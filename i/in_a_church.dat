5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s.

5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>church</b> inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E
