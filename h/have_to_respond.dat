25|$|On 29 May 2014, {{a little}} over a {{fortnight}} {{from the end of the}} previous season, cup-winning goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański departed for Welsh club Swansea City upon the completion of his contract, citing his need to be a first-choice keeper given the stage of his career the Pole was entering. Fabiański left with 78 appearances and 25 clean sheets for Arsenal, as well as a winner's medal on his final appearance for the club. The 2014 FA Cup Final also turned out to be the final appearance for Bacary Sagna for Arsenal, as he agreed to join Manchester City upon the completion of his contract. Sagna had an illustrious seven-year period with the club, making 284 appearances for club with the Frenchman becoming an integral part of the Arsenal defence following his transfer from Auxerre. Unfortunately, Sagna did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to distaste from some club supporters over the nature of his move to a Premier League rival, citing the move on the need to boost his career as a player, as opposed to the monetary incentives claimed.|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, Mills {{told the}} BBC {{that she had}} {{received}} death threats, and on 17 December 2006, police stated that a [...] "non-specific threat" [...] {{had been made to}} her safety. This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services too often. In March 2007, Kevin Moore, Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police, said that Mills was running [...] "the risk of being treated as the little boy who cried wolf", and added, [...] "We do <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to a disproportionate high volume of calls from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in, and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters". Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed.|$|E

[...] The U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper testified that the United States knew about the program for a long time and that the test flight was not a surprise.|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Bob Herbert wrote [...] "A {{grotesque}} {{exercise in}} the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour’s ride outside of Vegas. There the women <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> like Pavlov’s dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any {{hour of the day}} or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by".|$|E
2500|$|Infantry units {{can fight}} in both ranged and hand-to-hand combat, and many units will have weapons for {{both types of}} combat, and if {{attacked}} in close combat will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> accordingly. Hand-to-hand combat is played out {{as a series of}} synchronized attack animations between combatants. When one combatant defeats the other, a finishing move known as [...] "Sync Kill" [...] plays out as the victorious fighter finishes his opponent off in a dramatic and violent manner. More powerful units, such as Heroes, Walkers, and monstrous Super Units, may have personalized Sync Kills against each other.|$|E
2500|$|As MNQ president, Simard {{argued that}} francophone Quebecers were unfairly {{singled out by}} Canadian federalists for having condoned racist and xenophobic {{behaviour}} in earlier times. In {{the wake of a}} public controversy over Esther Delisle's The Traitor and the Jew, which addressed historical anti-Semitism and Quebec nationalism, Simard said, [...] "Of course we denounce all forms of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and we don't excuse it even fifty years later. But why should we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to [...] attacks that are obviously politically motivated?" [...] Unlike other Quebec sovereigntist groups, the MNQ under Simard's leadership sought to build links with francophone groups across Canada.|$|E

2500|$|Stanford {{political}} scientist Gary W. Cox argues in a 2017 study,that Europe's political fragmentation interacted with her institutional innovations to foster substantial areas of “economic liberty,” where European merchants could organize production freer of central regulation, faced fewer central restrictions on their shipping and pricing decisions, and paid lower tariffs and tolls {{than their counterparts}} elsewhere in Eurasia. When fragmentation afforded merchants multiple politically independent routes on which to ship their goods, European rulers refrained from imposing onerous regulations and levying arbitrary tolls, lest they lose mercantile traffic to competing realms. Fragmented control of trade routes magnified the spillover effects of political reforms. If parliament curbed arbitrary regulations and tolls in one realm, then neighboring rulers might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> in kind, even if they themselves remained without a parliament. Greater economic liberty, fostered by the interaction of fragmentation and reform, unleashed faster and more inter-connected urban growth.|$|E

However, according to Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the FAA in Atlanta, Morales was not on the name authorization papers. Bergen did not identify the pilot who was on the papers, since [...] "it would not be appropriate" [...] to release it, but confirmed Morales was not qualified to fly the Cessna.
