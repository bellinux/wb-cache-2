500|$|Sandoval's {{first days}} in the majors were marked by a {{tendency}} to free swing. Giants hitting coach Carney Lansford noted that Sandoval contributed to the team's drawing the fewest walks in the National League {{at a time when}} the overall number of walks throughout baseball had increased. [...] "As much as <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him to be disciplined, it's like caging a lion. He leaves the dugout ready to swing the bat. I literally tell him before every at-bat, 'Swing at a strike.'" [...] Sandoval himself characterized his approach as [...] "See ball, swing." [...] In July 2009, he was named a Sprint Final Vote candidate for the 80th annual All-Star Game for the final roster spot on the National League team. He was edged by Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on the last day of voting.|$|E

Today's fads, trends, shortsightedness, ignorance can {{disguise}} a deeper understanding of what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through to the minds. [...] This is natural. For generations to come it is common sense what is hard to fathom today for many. In my life I have reached a significant number of people compared to the masses I will teach after I am gone for decades to come." ...|$|E

On his {{personal}} website he had this to say: [...] "Those who know me know that I am an inconvertible Anglophile – or more broadly, a Britanophile, which includes my affection for Scotland and Wales as well. I love things British. My car is British. My wardrobe, to a good extent, is British. I even love the food in London – I think British food has shaken its prevailing perception as indigestible and become quite wonderful. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Britain for holidays as often as I can.

2500|$|With the {{suspension}} and then Pittsburgh's early elimination from the playoffs, Cooke had {{a considerable amount}} of free time. He spent much of the time with Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma reviewing each of his hits to learn how to change his game to hit within the rules. Cooke said, [...] "The way I played before was to get the biggest hit possible every time no matter what," [...] and that now in [...] "certain situations, I just approach differently. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the puck more than I did before." [...] Well into the 2011–12 season, teammate Craig Adams said of Cooke's play, [...] "I've noticed over the last month or so, he's been feeling more comfortable being physical again, obviously, within the rules. That {{was a big part of}} his game." [...] At season's end, he had scored a career-high 19 goals and posted only 44 penalty minutes, his lowest career total in a full NHL season.|$|E
2500|$|Environmental Golf Course Design is an {{integral}} part of Hurdzan's golf course design style, which has been appreciated by golf lovers through his design of the Widow's Walk Golf Course in Scituate, Massachusetts (opened in 1996) and the Harbor Links Golf Course in North Hempstead, New York. In Howard Richman's article Man with the plans in the Golf Course Management (GCM) Magazine of December 2012, Hurdzan explained his golf course design approach in these words: [...] "Form follows function — you'll hear that a lot around here," [...] Hurdzan says. [...] "The form is something that is a direct result of the function it has to serve. That is why I work so closely with superintendents. I ask them 'How are you going to mow that?' … 'How are you going to rake that?' … 'Are you going to be able to irrigate that?' <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a superintendent to think ahead. I don't want to leave them with problems. I want to leave them with solutions. That's why I like to get them involved." ...|$|E

60|$|Yesterday, for example, I was at {{a luncheon}} party. At {{the end of the}} party a great {{dignitary}} of the English Established Church went away half an hour before anybody else and carried off my hat. Now, that was an innocent act on his part. He went out first, and of course had the choice of hats. As a rule <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out first myself. But I hold that it was an innocent, unconscious act, due, perhaps, to heredity. He was thinking about ecclesiastical matters, and when a man is in that condition of mind he will take anybody's hat. The result was that the whole afternoon I was under the influence of his clerical hat and could not tell a lie. Of course, he was hard at it.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, by {{this time}} it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be a blank space of {{delightful}} mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost {{in the depths of the}} land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.|$|E
6000|$|One day we {{was sitting}} on a bench in The Slopes, enjoying a bit of {{sunshine}} that had just come along, when a middle-aged man, with a very high collar and a silk hat, came and sat down by Jone. He spoke civilly to us, and then {{went on to say that}} if ever we happened to take a house near Liverpool he'd be glad to supply us with coals, because he was a coal merchant. Jone told him that if he ever did take a house near Liverpool he certainly would give him his custom. Then the man gave us his card. [...] "I come here every year," [...] he said, [...] "for the rheumatism in my shoulder, and if I meet anybody that lives near Liverpool, or is likely to, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his custom. I like it here. There's a good many 'otels in this town. You can see a lot of them from here. There's St. Ann's, that's a good house, but they charge you a pound a day; and then there's the Old Hall. That's good enough, too, but nobody goes there except shopkeepers and clergymen. Of course, I don't mean bishops; they go to St. Ann's." ...|$|E
