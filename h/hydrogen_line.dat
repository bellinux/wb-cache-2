Rather, it was more complicated; it strengthened with increasing temperature, it peaked near 9000K, and then declined at greater temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.|$|E
5|$|NGC 7424 is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.4. located around 4 degrees west of the Grus Triplet. Approximately 37.5 million light years distant, it is about 100,000 light years in diameter, has well defined spiral arms and is thought to resemble the Milky Way. Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable {{and was replaced by}} lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova. A massive star of spectral type F, A or B is thought to be the surviving binary companion to SN 2001ig, which was believed to have been a Wolf–Rayet star.|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E

This situation arises for plasma conditions when the interactions with electrons is a major broadening mechanism and the quasi-static electron, or non-binary, effects are important. As examples we find {{that this is the}} case for high-n <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> over a wide range of electron densities and low-n <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> at higher electron density. A solution has been proposed for high-n <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> by using a frequency-dependent electron broadening operator accounting for some overlapping of the impact and the non-binary regimes.

500|$|Leuschner Observatory {{is home to}} {{a single}} [...] radio {{telescope}}. The telescope was one of the prototypes for the Allen Telescope Array that were tested at Leuschner, and has since been used in the undergraduate radio astronomy lab. The telescope operates between 1320–1740 MHz and uses an 8192 element spectrometer with spectral resolution of about 1.5kHz and a 12MHz bandwidth. The operating range allows for it to be used to observe the 21-cm <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> as well as hydroxyl lines from astrophysical masers.|$|E
500|$|The 21cm <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> was {{discovered}} during the telescope's construction; the telescope was subsequently redesigned {{so that it}} could observe at that frequency. [...] Using this line emission, hydrogen clouds both in the Milky Way galaxy and in other galaxies can be observed; for example, the telescope discovered a large cloud around the M81 and M82 galaxies. [...] The motion of these clouds either towards or away from us either redshifts or blueshifts the line, allowing the velocity to the cloud to be measured. [...] This provides a probe of the internal dynamics of galaxies, and can also provide a measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe.|$|E
500|$|A Type IIb {{supernova}} has a weak <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> in {{its initial}} spectrum, {{which is why}} it is classified as a Type II. However, later on the H emission becomes undetectable, and there is also a second peak in the light curve that has a spectrum which more closely resembles a Type Ib supernova. The progenitor could have been a massive star that expelled most of its outer layers, or one which lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to interactions with a companion in a binary system, leaving behind the core that consisted almost entirely of helium. [...] As the ejecta of a TypeIIb expands, the hydrogen layer quickly becomes more transparent and reveals the deeper layers.|$|E
40|$|Internal line {{shifts in}} quasars spectra {{have played a}} more {{prominent}} role {{in our understanding of}} quasar structure and dynamics. The observed different redshift among broad <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> is still an amazing puzzle in the study of quasars. We have argued that the broad <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as the low-ionization lines in quasars, are significantly contributed by the Cerenkov quasi-line emission of the fast electrons in the dense clouds/filaments/sheets (N_ H≥ 10 ^ 14 cm^- 3); whereas this line-like radiation mechanism is invalid for producing the high ionization lines. In order to account for redshift difference, the Cerenkov line-like radiation mechanism could provide a plausible resolution: it is the `Cerenkov line redshift', which is different from line to line, causes the peculiar redshift-differences among Lyα, Hα and Hβ lines. The different redshifts among different broad <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> could stand for an evidence to quantitatively support that the observed broad <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines</b> should be blended by both the real line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission. The good fitting to the observed redshifts of quasars confirms the existence of Cerenkov component in the broad <b>hydrogen</b> <b>lines,</b> which indicates that, in the blended Lyα line, the line-intensity of the Cerenkov component approximately equals that of the accompanying `normal line' (an approximate equipartition of intensity between the two components in the broad Lyα line). This result illustrates the importance of the Cerenkov component in the broad lines of quasars, which can be further confirmed by future observations. Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure, Submitte...|$|R

About a dozen of these found their way into the astronomy field, including Colgate's supernova detector, SNORT. About 2,000 remained in storage at New Mexico Tech until 1980. An assay at that time discovered that there was well over one ounce of gold in each one, and the remaining stocks were melted down to produce $941,966 for the university ($ million in [...] ).

2500|$|The {{failure of}} the two engines in the second stage was traced to the rupturing of a fuel line that fed the engine igniters. The igniter was {{essentially}} a miniature rocket motor mounted in {{the wall of the}} J-2 engine's pressure chamber. It was fed by small-diameter flexible lines carrying liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. [...] During the S-II second stage burn, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>line</b> feeding the engine number two igniter broke due to vibration. As a result, the igniter fed pure liquid oxygen into the pressure chamber. Normally the J-2 engine burns a hydrogen-rich mixture to keep temperature down. The liquid oxygen flow caused a much higher temperature locally and eventually the pressure chamber failed. The sudden drop in pressure was detected and caused a shutdown command to be issued. Unfortunately, the command signals for engine three were partially cross-wired with engine two, so that the shutdown of engine two caused a liquid oxygen valve for engine three to close, resulting in a shutdown of that engine as well.|$|E
