Both drugs caused concentration-related increases in force of contraction and were of similar potency, although the maximum response to <b>impromidine</b> was markedly and significantly less than that to histamine. The positive inotropic responses of <b>impromidine</b> were inhibited by cimetidine 1 X 10 (- 5) M, consistent with histamine H 2 -receptor involvement. <b>Impromidine</b> 1 X 10 (- 4) M inhibited maximal responses to histamine to a level equal to the maximal <b>impromidine</b> response; however, <b>impromidine</b> did not inhibit responses to isoprenaline. Positive inotropic activity and inhibition of maximal responses to histamine occurred over a similar <b>impromidine</b> concentration-range. <b>Impromidine</b> displaced histamine concentration-response curves to the right, whereas mepyramine had no effect on responses to histamine.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{specific}} H 2 receptor agonist <b>impromidine,</b> on gastric acid secretion were measured in six patients with duodenal ulcer in clinical remission before and after three months treatment with ranitidine 150 mg nocte. After treatment basal acid output increased from 1. 2 to 2. 8 mmol/h and after maximal <b>impromidine</b> stimulation from 36. 9 (4. 7) to 44. 2 (6. 2) mmol/h (p less than 0. 02). Intravenous ranitidine 50 mg was given {{at the end of}} the <b>impromidine</b> infusion on each study day; the antisecretory effect of intravenous ranitidine was accentuated after the treatment with ranitidine from a trough acid output of 8. 5 (1. 2) mmol/h before, to 3. 8 (1. 5) mmol/h (p less than 0. 05) after, treatment. The increased response to the H 2 agonist <b>impromidine</b> and the H 2 antagonist ranitidine after treatment with ranitidine suggests an enhanced sensitivity of the H 2 receptor.

40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium on the H 1 - and H 2 -receptor {{components}} of the cyclic AMP response to histamine in rabbit cerebral cortical slices has been investigated. Removal of calcium ions from the incubation medium during the preparation, preincubation and final incubation of brain slices significantly reduced the cyclic AMP responses to adenosine, histamine and the H 2 -selective agonist, <b>impromidine.</b> Removal of calcium ions from the incubation medium during only the final incubation with agonists did not influence the responses to adenosine, histamine, <b>impromidine</b> and the H 1 -selective agonist, 2 -thiazolylethylamine. Final incubation of rabbit cerebral cortical slices in calcium-free buffer containing EGTA (1 mM) however, selectively reduced the cyclic AMP responses to the H 1 -agonists histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine without affecting the response to <b>impromidine</b> or adenosine. These latter incubation conditions significantly reduced the maximal extent of the augmentation of impromidine- or adenosine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation produced by H 1 -receptor stimulation, without affecting the EC 50 values of the H 1 -agonists.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of histamine-stimulated adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in slices of rabbit cerebral cortex have been investigated. The selective H 2 -receptor antagonists, cimetidine, tiotidine, metiamide and ranitidine appeared to antagonize the stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine {{in a competitive}} manner consistent with an interaction with histamine H 2 -receptors. The H 1 -receptor antagonist mepyramine (0. 8 microM) produced only a weak inhibition of the response to histamine. The inhibition appeared to be non-competitive producing {{a decrease in the}} maximal response with little effect on the EC 50 value. The specific H 2 -receptor agonist, <b>impromidine,</b> produced a maximum response of only 31 +/- 2 % of that obtained with histamine. Studies with histamine and <b>impromidine</b> in combination indicated that <b>impromidine</b> was not acting as a partial agonist. 2 -Thiazolylethylamine, a selective H 1 -agonist, produced only a weak response (EC 50 approximately 1 mM) yielding a relative potency with respect to histamine (= 100) of 2. 5. In the presence of a supramaximal concentration of <b>impromidine,</b> histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine further elevated the response to <b>impromidine.</b> In these conditions the relative potency of 2 -thiazolylethylamine was increased to 59 (histamine = 100), a value which was comparable with that reported for H 1 -receptor-mediated contractions of guinea-pig ileum. The H 1 -receptor antagonists mepyramine, promethazine, triprolidine and chlorpheniramine competitively antagonized the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation elicited by histamine and 2 -thiazolylethylamine in rabbit cerebral cortex without affecting the response to <b>impromidine</b> alone. (+) -Chlorpheniramine was some 150 fold more potent than the (-) -isomer in this respect. Histamine and adenosine in combination had a much greater than additive effect on the accumulation of cyclic AMP in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. The potentiation of the adenosine response could be partially but not completely antagonized by either cimetidine or mepyramine. In the presence of H 2 -receptor blockade with 0. 02 mM tiotidine, histamine elicited a significant potentiation (EC 50 44 microM) of the response to adenosine. This response was antagonized competitively by mepyramine yielding a KB value of 0. 05 microM similar to that obtained from inhibition of the potentiation of impromidine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP (0. 02 microM). These results suggest that there are two components in the response to histamine in rabbit cerebral cortical slices. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E

Additionally, such guanidines are histamine H₁ receptor (H₁R) antagonists with preference for the human relative to the guinea pig receptor. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine structure-activity relationships of guanidines at human and guinea pig H₁R and H₂R species isoforms expressed in Sf 9 insect cells. Three <b>impromidine</b> analogues and six arpromidine analogues exhibited agonistic activity at H₂R and antagonistic activity at H₁R as assessed in the steady-state GTPase assay.

40|$|Background: The trophic {{effect of}} gastrin on the histamine-containing enterochromaffin-like cell is {{pronounced}} {{but on the}} stem cell of the oxyntic mucosa it is only modest. In the rat, gastrin stimulates acid secretion mainly by releasing histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells. This {{study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that the trophic effect of gastrin on stem cells is also mediated by histamine released from the enterochromaffin-like cell. Methods: We stimulated rats with the histamine- 2 agonist <b>impromidine.</b> <b>Impromidine,</b> 0. 2 mg/h, was given for 2 days by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps, and the trophic effect on stem cells was assessed by incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Results: The plasma gastrin concentrations were 33. 9 (9. 4) pM and 27. 3 (6. 0) pM, and the stem cell labelling index values were 5. 92 (1. 94) and 8. 09 (3. 78) in the controls and impromidine-stimulated animals, respectively (mean value (SD)). These differences were not statistically significant.

Theophylline sensitive (Ts) cells function as suppressors of pokeweed mitogen induced B cell differentiation into plasma cells, while theophylline resistant (Tr) cells function as helper/inducer cells in this reaction. The Ts fraction is enriched for cells bearing receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (RFc gamma) while the Tr fraction is depleted of RFc gamma bearing cells.

Mixtures of agonist and antagonist either decreased or increased tyrosinase activity, {{depending on}} the relative concentrations of each drug. Nordimaprit, the most effective inhibitor, lowered tyrosinase activity significantly within 36 h and caused a slower loss of tyrosinase protein as judged by reactivity with two monoclonal antibodies. Prolonged treatment of a melanotic cell line with nordimaprit led to complete loss of pigment, with no loss of the 56 -kDa melanosomal antigen 1 C 11. Cells remained amelanotic for 8 weeks after removal of the drug and, even after 26 weeks, melanin content and tyrosinase expression and activity had not fully recovered. Nordimaprit increased the rate of degradation of tyrosinase and of nordimaprit binding proteins. Whereas nordimaprit did not directly inhibit tyrosinase, lysates of treated cells contained an inhibitory activity that partitioned approximately equally across a 10 -kDa ultrafiltration membrane. Overall, these results showed that melanogenesis can be controlled via histamine receptors, the mechanism for the H 2 agonist nordimaprit consisting of three components: induction of a tyrosinase inhibitor, increased degradation of tyrosinase, and long-term down-regulation of tyrosinase expression...|$|E

To elucidate the histaminergic influence on the ovarian vasculature, the mechanical response of the isolated rat ovarian artery to histamine and histamine agonists was investigated. Histamine relaxed the precontracted vessel segments in a concentration-dependent way, amounting to 82. 7 +/- 4. 3 % of the papaverine-induced relaxation. This relaxant effect was counteracted by both the H 1 antagonist, pyrilamine, and the H 2 antagonist, cimetidine. That the effect of histamine was mediated by both histamine receptor subtypes was further confirmed by the relaxant effect produced in the presence of either of the H 1 -specific agonists, 2 -pyridylethylamine and 2 -methylhistamine on the one hand, and the H 2 -specific agonists, <b>impromidine</b> and 4 -methylhistamine on the other. The H 1 receptor-induced relaxation was mediated via an effect on the endothelium, whereas the H 2 receptor-mediated relaxation was mostly a direct effect on the smooth musculature in the vessel wall. No major differences in the mechanical response of the rat ovarian artery were seen during the different stages of the estrous cycle, although at late proestrus, just before ovulation, the maximum relaxation induced by histamine was particularly high, in spite of a low sensitivity of the receptors for the amine...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates whether {{presynaptic}} histamine receptors regulate noradrenaline release from intestinal sympathetic nerves. The experiments {{were performed on}} longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations of guinea-pig ileum, preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline. In the presence of rauwolscine, electrically-induced [3 H]-noradrenaline release was inhibited by histamine or R-α-methylhistamine, whereas it was unaffected by pyridylethylamine, <b>impromidine,</b> pyrilamine, cimetidine, thioperamide or clobenpropit. The inhibitory effects of histamine or R-α-methylhistamine were antagonized by thioperamide or clobenpropit, but not by pyrilamine or cimetidine. In the absence of rauwolscine, none of these drugs modified the release of [3 H]-noradrenaline. The modulatory action of histamine was attenuated by pertussis toxin and abolished by N-ethylmaleimide. Tetraethylammonium or 4 -aminopyridine enhanced the evoked tritium outflow and counteracted the inhibitory effect of histamine. However, the blocking effects of tetraethylammonium and 4 -aminopyridine were no longer evident when their enhancing actions were compensated by reduction of Ca 2 + concentration in the superfusion medium. Histamine-induced inhibition of tritium output was enhanced by ω-conotoxin or low Ca 2 + concentration, whereas it was not modified by nifedipine, forskolin, rolipram, phorbol myristate acetate, H 7 or lavendustin A. The present results indicate that presynaptic H 3 receptors, located on sympathetic nerve endings, mediate an inhibitory control on intestinal noradrenergic neurotransmission. It is suggested that these receptors are coupled to Gi/Go proteins which modulate the activity of N-type Ca 2 + channels through a direct link, thus reducing the availability of extracellular Ca 2 + {{at the level of}} noradrenergic nerve terminals...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} the histamine receptors in the muscularis mucosae, the isotonic responsiveness of the isolated muscularis mucosae of the guinea-pig oesophagus to histamine receptor agonists and antagonists was examined in vitro. Histamine (0. 1 - 100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction of the muscularis mucosae (EC 50 = 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 microM). The contractions were rapid in onset, sustained, reversible by washing and the preparation {{did not show}} tachyphylaxis. 2 -Methylhistamine (2 -MH), 2 -pyridylethylamine (PEA) and 4 -methylhistamine (4 -MH) produced similar sustained contractions of the muscularis mucosae. The order of sensitivity was histamine greater than 2 -MH greater than PEA greater than 4 -MH. <b>Impromidine</b> (10 - 300 microM) and dimaprit (10 - 300 microM) caused no response in this tissue. The contractile responses to histamine, 2 -MH, and PEA were competitively antagonized by diphenhydramine, and the pA 2 values were almost the same (approximately 8. 1). Cimetidine (100 microM) could not modify the contractile response to these agonists. The contractile response to histamine was slightly inhibited by tetrodotoxin (0. 3 microM), atropine (1 microM), indomethacin (0. 1 - 3 microM) or aspirin (30 - 300 microM), and the EC 50 value was increased about 2 - 6 times by these drugs. When the preparation was incubated in Tyrode solution containing various calcium concentrations (0, 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8 mM), the concentration-response curve to histamine was shifted {{to the right and}} downward; the effect was inversely dependent on the calcium concentration, and in a calcium-free medium the response to histamine was abolished. Verapamil (1 - 10 microM) partially inhibited the contractile response to histamine. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Histamine {{inhibits}} {{in vitro}} human neutrophil chemotaxis and T-lymphocyte proliferation via H 2 receptors. The {{aim of this}} study was to verify these inhibitory effects of histamine in man in vivo. Healthy volunteers were challenged with histamine by intravenous (1 mg), subcutaneous (1 mg) and inhalatory (2. 4 mg) routes. Venous blood was taken before and at different times after challenge. Neutrophil chemotaxis was studied by the Boyden assay and T-lymphocyte proliferation by counting H 3 -thymidine incorporation in cultured mononuclear cells. Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay. Histamine infusion caused transient systemic symptoms as well as a significant decrease of neutrophil chemotaxis (mean - 26 % +/- 6) and of PHA-pulsed T-lymphocyte proliferation (mean - 16 % +/- 6) 4 h after histamine challenge. Subcutaneous injection of histamine caused only a significant decrease of neutrophil chemotaxis (mean - 24 % +/- 15) 4 h after injection. Histamine inhalation was well tolerated and caused a significant depression of neutrophil chemotaxis (mean - 40 % +/- 15) and of T-lymphocyte proliferation (mean - 27 % +/- 6) 2 and 4 h after the challenge. Histamine challenges were always accompanied by a rapid and transient rise in plasma histamine. Inhalation of an H 2 agonist (<b>impromidine)</b> but not of an H 1 agonist (betahistine) caused a decrease of neutrophil chemotaxis and of T-lymphocyte proliferation. Oral pretreatment with an H 2 antagonist (cimetidine) before histamine inhalation prevented histamine-induced decrease of neutrophil chemotaxis and T-lymphocyte proliferation, whereas astemizole, an H 1 antagonist, had no effect. In conclusion, during the few hours following administration, exogenous histamine in man causes a depression of neutrophil chemotaxis and T-lymphocyte proliferation via H 2 receptors.

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} both cholinergic and histaminergic neurons in the brain may act to facilitate processes of cortical activation that occur during wakefulness. In the present study, the potential influence of histaminergic neurons upon cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain was investigated in guinea-pig basal forebrain slices. We found that electrophysiologically identified and immunohistochemically verified cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis were depolarized and excited by histamine, as manifested {{by an increase in}} tonic firing. The depolarization was associated with an increase in membrane input resistance. The effect of histamine persisted in the presence of either tetrodotoxin or a high-magnesium/low-calcium solution, indicating that it is postsynaptic. By a process of elimination, the participation in this response of the three described histamine receptors was examined. Involvement of H 3 receptors was excluded on the basis that the H 3 agonist (R) -alpha-methyl-histamine had no direct effect, and the H 3 antagonist, thioperamide, did not block the effect of histamine. In contrast, the presence of a small response to <b>impromidine,</b> a selective agonist of H 2 receptors, and the partial block of the response to histamine by the H 2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine, indicated the participation of H 2 receptors. Finally, the complete elimination of histamine's effect occurred when low doses of the H 1 antagonist, mepyramine, were added to the H 2 antagonist, cimetidine, indicating the involvement and predominance of H 1 receptors in the response. Our data thus suggest that histamine excites nucleus basalis cholinergic neurons by a concomitant activation of H 1 and H 2 receptors. Histaminergic tuberomammillary neurons may accordingly facilitate tonic firing of cholinergic neurons during wakefulness. Cholinergic basalis neurons could thus act in tandem with histaminergic neurons during periods of arousal to collectively promote widespread cortical activation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Impromidine</b> (IMP) and {{arpromidine}} (ARP) -derived guanidines {{are more}} potent and efficacious guinea pig (gp) histamine H 2 -receptor (gpH 2 R) than human (h) H 2 R agonists and histamine H 1 -receptor (H 1 R) antagonists with preference for hH 1 R relative to gpH 1 R. We examined NG-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines (AIPGs), which are less basic than guanidines, at hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, rat H 2 R (rH 2 R), hH 1 R, and gpH 1 R expressed in Sf 9 cells as probes for ligand-specific receptor conformations. AIPGs were similarly potent H 2 R agonists as the corresponding guanidines IMP and ARP, respectively. Exchange of pyridyl in ARP against phenyl increased AIPG potency 10 -fold, yielding {{the most potent}} agonists at the hH 2 R-Gs fusion protein and gpH 2 R-Gs identified so far. Some AIPGs were similarly potent and efficacious at hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs. AIPGs stabilized the ternary complex in hH 2 R-Gs and gpH 2 R-Gs differently than the corresponding guanidines. Guanidines, AIPGs, and small H 2 R agonists exhibited distinct agonist properties at hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, and rH 2 R measuring adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast to ARP and IMP, AIPGs were partial H 1 R agonists exhibiting higher efficacies at hH 1 R than at gpH 1 R. This is remarkable because, so far, all bulky H 1 R agonists exhibited higher efficacies at gpH 1 R than at hH 1 R. Collectively, our data suggest that AIPGs stabilize different active conformations in hH 2 R, gpH 2 R, and rH 2 R than guanidines and that, in contrast to guanidines, AIPGs are capable of stabilizing a partially active state of hH 1 R...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of histamine-stimulated inositol phospholipid breakdown in slices of guinea-pig ileal smooth muscle and cerebellum have been investigated. In cerebellar slices the inhibition of the inositol phospholipid response to histamine by mepyramine {{was consistent with}} competitive antagonism of histamine H 1 -receptors. In slices of the longitudinal smooth muscle of guinea-pig ileum, mepyramine produced only a weak inhibition of the response to histamine, at concentrations up to 1 microM. This was in striking contrast to the potent competitive antagonism of the H 1 -mediated contractile responses obtained with mepyramine in this tissue. The H 1 -receptor antagonists (+) -chlorpheniramine and promethazine similarly {{had no effect on}} the EC 50 value for histamine in guinea-pig ileum, while promethazine competitively antagonized the muscarinic receptor-mediated inositol phospholipid response in this tissue (Ka 3. 6 X 10 (7) M- 1). Cimetidine, on its own, did not significantly inhibit the inositol phosphate accumulation elicited by histamine in ileum. In the presence of 0. 2 microM mepyramine, cimetidine (0. 1 mM) produced a small parallel shift of the histamine concentration-response curve (Ka 3 X 10 (4) M- 1). This inhibition, however, was not consistent with antagonism of an H 2 -receptor-mediated response. The effect of a range of histamine analogues on inositol phospholipid breakdown was determined. Dose-response curves were constructed and characterized in terms of the EC 50, slope and maximal response attainable relative to histamine. The H 1 -agonists, N alpha,N alpha-dimethylhistamine, N alpha-methylhistamine, 2 -pyridylethylamine and 2 -thiazolyethylamine produced the largest accumulations of [3 H]-inositol- 1 -phosphate. A very weak response was produced by the H 2 -selective agonist <b>impromidine,</b> while dimaprit (also H 2 -selective) was without significant effect. Mepyramine appeared to antagonize competitively the response to the H 1 -selective agonist 2 -pyridylethylamine. This was in contrast to the data obtained with other H 1 -agonists, where mepyramine produced only a small dextral shift of the agonist curves at low agonist concentrations and an increase in the Hill coefficient. This was particularly striking in the case of 2 -methylhistamine. The results suggest that an H 1 -receptor component in guinea-pig ileum, may coexist with a larger inositol phospholipid response to histamine which is independent of the activation of H 1 - or H 2 -receptors...|$|E
