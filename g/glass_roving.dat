FHWA studies estimate that the U. S. currently faces a $ 167 billion cost to repair deficient bridges and roads. In many cases, retrofit and rehabilitation by conventional means is very costly (due to both specialized equipment needs and closure of the structure during repair), if not im-possible (e. g., the additional dead load resulting from repair of a deck/beam could very well further damage the structure and cause its final failure). Due to their inherent light-ness, placement flexibility and resistance to corrosion, composites are logical substitutes for steel structural elements often used for the rehabilitation of bridge decks and columns. In this article, we focus on columnar structures where retrofit is needed to strengthen and increase compressive load carrying capacity. The use of a novel resin infusion technique is shown to contribute to substantial improvements in composite wrap efficiency.

The variation of inter laminar shear strength of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed.

An optimal testing arrangement was used to investigate the effect of particulate filler characteristics, e. g. particle strength, size, shape and surface treatment, on the compressive strength of undamaged and impact-damaged laminates. The damage to impacted laminates filled with particulate fillers was examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy and quantified by measuring the maximum damage zone size. Their damage tolerance was determined by compressive strength retention. All the particulate fillers caused a deterioration in the damage tolerance. Mineral fillers increased {{the size of the}} damage zone, and the compressive strength of unimpacted laminates was increased by incorporating hard, high modulus filler. The compressive failure modes before and after impact were distinctly different. Glass beads gave the highest damage resistance and compressive strength retention, but hollow glass microspheres and mica caused the most severe damage and a significant reduction in the retention of compressive strength after impact, while alumina trihydrate, calcium carbonate and quartz showed moderate damage tolerance. The size of the glass beads had a more significant effect on the damage resistance and post-impact compressive strength than the surface treatments. Although the laminates filled with two-dimensional glass flakes showed a lower impact damage resistance than those containing glass beads, they showed a higher compressive strength retention caused by better interlaminar shear strength. Adding rubber modifiers and combining Kevlar fabrics with glass fibre did not improve the damage tolerance of ATH-filled laminates. The use of a hot cure (piperidine) system improved the quality of the filled laminates probably by lowering the void content and/or improving fibre/matrix adhesion, and therefore improved the low energy impact resistance of laminates, but this advantage disappeared at higher impact energies. Based on a theoretical analysis of the impact damage mechanism, the fundamental matrix properties affecting the damage tolerance of laminates were identified, and verified by experimental data. There was a linear relationship between the strength of the matrix and the compressive strength retention of impact damaged laminates. The pre-impact interlaminar shear strength of laminates also correlated well with the compressive strength retention of laminates after impact. But there was no positive correlation between the modulus of the matrix and the impact damage tolerance' of laminates...|$|R
40|$|The {{composite}} materials have significant applications over metallic materials in different fields of structural engineering. Structural elements subjected to in-plane periodic forces {{may lead to}} parametric or dynamic instability under certain combination of load parameters which caused resonant transverse vibrations. The spectrum of values of parameters causing unstable motion {{is referred to as}} the regions of dynamic instability or parametric resonance. Delamination is a very serious concern to composite applications and it arises as a consequence of impact loading, stress concentration near geometrical or material discontinuity or manufacturing defects. The study of dynamic stability itself requires a special investigation of basic problems of vibration and static stability. So the present investigation deals with the study of vibration, static and dynamic stability of delaminated composite plates. However, some studies on static analysis of delaminated composites involving the effects of different parameters on interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) are studied for completeness. The influence of various parameters on the free vibration and static stability (buckling) behavior of delaminated composite plates are investigated both experimentally and numerically. The parametric instability behaviour of delaminated composite plates is examined using finite element method. For numerical analysis, a finite element model is developed with an eight noded two dimensional quadratic isoparametric element having five degrees of freedom per node based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). Element elastic stiffness, geometric stiffness and mass matrices are derived using the principle of Stationery potential energy. A simple two dimensional single delamination model proposed earlier for vibration is extended in the present analysis for the vibration, static and dynamic stability analysis of delaminated composite panels under in-plane uniaxial periodic forces by multiple delamination modelling. A general formulation for parametric resonance characteristics of delaminated composite plates under in-plane periodic loading is presented. Experimental investigations are conducted for ILSS, vibration and buckling analysis of delaminated composite plates. Materials used for fabrication of laminates are woven <b>roving</b> <b>glass</b> fiber as reinforcement, epoxy as resin, hardener, polyvinyl alcohol as a releasing agent and Teflon foil for introduction of artificial delamination. Fiber and matrix are used in 50 : 50 proportion by weight. Material constants are determined from the tensile test as per relevant ASTM standards. The FFT analyzer B&Kñ 3560 is used for modal testing of composite plates. To obtain the buckling result, INSTRON 1195 machine of 100 KN capacities is used. There is a very good agreement between numerical result and experimental result in case of natural frequency and critical buckling loads of woven fiber composite plates with delaminations. Both the results revealed that the fundamental natural frequency and critical buckling load of delaminated composite plates decrease with the increase in area of delaminations and fiber orientations. The instability studies showed a good agreement with the results available in the open literature. The onset of instability occurs at lower exciting frequency with the increase in delamination size and static load factor. It is also observed that with the increase in number of layers, aspect ratio and degree of orthotropy of delaminated plates, the dynamic instability occurs at higher excitation frequency. Thus the instability behavior of delaminated plates is influenced by the geometry, material, ply lay-up, ply orientation and size of delamination. This can be used to the advantage of tailoring during the design of delaminated composite structure. This study can be used as a tool for structural health monitoring for identification of delamination, its location and extent of damage in composites and helps in assessment of structural integrity of composite structures...|$|R
