40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on the relationship between <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and the macroeconomy in order to explain why <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> {{over the past three years}} do not appear to have led to a slow-down the world economy. It makes three arguments. First, that <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have never been as important as is popularly thought. Second, that the most important route through which <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> affect output is monetary policy: when <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> pass through to core inflation, monetary authorities raise interest rates, slowing growth. It is argued that the direct effect of <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> on output is relatively small and that the microeconomic mechanisms proposed in the literature are insufficient to explain the historical impact of <b>oil</b> <b>prices.</b> Based on the second argument, the third argument is that <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> have not reduced growth in the past three years because they no longer pass through to core inflation, so the monetary tightening previously seen in response to <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> is absent...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effects of <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> to {{multinational}} enterprise (MNE). As the global climate change has made energy related issues popular, it has also stimulated the debate over the peaking of oil production and the future of oil based economy. There is a lot of speculation about these topics as nobody knows the exact situation of the remaining <b>oil</b> reserves. <b>High</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> which is usually a result from tight oil supply, can affect negatively to the whole global economy. Thus it is important and interesting to assess how the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> can affect the globally acting multinational enterprises. The modern and global MNE was first modeled by using a global strategy framework and the theory of global production network. The oil production peak predictions and their background were critically assessed and a picture from the oil supply and the price formation was consisted with the aid of related literature. The main insight from the literature was that as cheap conventional oil becomes more difficult to find, the oil supply remains tight in the future. The <b>price</b> formation of <b>oil</b> was revealed to be affected by multiple factors and its long term development is difficult to predict. The possible effects of the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> were then derived from the expert literature related to peaking of <b>oil</b> production and <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> and a data content analysis made by the author. The data consisted of annual reports or Form- 10 Ks of 50 major MNEs from fiscal years 2008 or 2009. The content of these documents were possibly affected by the record <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>prices</b> of 2008. The companies were picked from The Global 2000 list by Forbes. The main results of the data content analysis were that although the companies mentioned oil and oil related effects, the linkages between business operations and oil were generally indirect. MNEs were found to pursue energy efficiency and lower emissions rather than reduce oil dependency. Finally, a framework was created which illustrates the <b>high</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> effects on global strategy and global production network, with the aid of reviewed literature and results of data content analysis...|$|R

The [...] "month-by-month" [...] five-year analysis disputes that increases in global grain consumption and droughts were responsible for price increases, reporting that this had had only a marginal effect and instead argues that the EU and US drive for biofuels has had {{by far the biggest}} effect on food supply and prices. The paper concludes that increased production of biofuels in the US and EU were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without these policies, price increases would have been smaller. This research also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and suggest to remove tariffs on ethanol imports by both the US and EU, to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the EU and the US.|$|E
