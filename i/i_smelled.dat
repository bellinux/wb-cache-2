500|$|... "Frozen", {{the ninth}} track and album's first single, is a mid-tempo {{electronic}} ballad {{which has a}} layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings. The song additionally contains ambient qualities, a moderate dance rhythm during the chorus and techno-influenced beats towards the end. Madonna's vocals throughout the song lack vibrato, and have drawn comparisons to medieval music. Lyrically, the song is about a cold and emotionless man; nevertheless, subtexts have been noticed. According to Jarman-Ivens, lyrics such as [...] "You're frozen, when your heart's not open" [...] reflected an artistic palette, [...] "encompassing diverse musical, textual and visual styles in its lyrics." [...] "The Power Of Good-Bye" [...] is an emotional ballad which lyrically meditates on loss and longing. It was released as the album's fourth single. [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] is about a distant lover and [...] "Little Star" [...] is about her daughter, Lourdes. Both are superficially vibrant but with underlying subtlety and restrained arrangements prevailing. [...] "Mer Girl", the album's final track, is a surreal meditation on mortality {{and the death of}} Madonna's mother, in which she sings, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> her burning flesh/Her rotting bones, her decay/I ran and I ran/I'm still running away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this, Audre Lorde {{was very}} open {{to her own}} {{sexuality}} and sexual awakening. In Zami: A New Spelling of My Name, her famous [...] "biomythography" [...] (a term coined by Lorde that combines [...] "biography" [...] and [...] "mythology") she writes, [...] "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places." [...] According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection—menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother—into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.|$|E

60|$|I {{began to}} be very glad. The colts-foot discs glowed and laughed in a merry company down the path; I stroked the velvet faces, and laughed also, and <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> the scent of black-currant leaves, which is full of childish memories.|$|E

'No I don't,' {{said the}} little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly before her; 'this {{is not a}} flowery neighbourhood.

And yet as I sit at work, <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> miles of flowers. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> roses, till <b>I</b> think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps, bushels, on the floor. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> fallen leaves, till I put down my hand--so--and expect to make them rustle. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> the white and the pink May in the hedges, {{and all sorts of}} flowers that I never was among.

60|$|We {{went down}} the road between the growths of young fir that bordered it. <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> their balsam as we passed, and noticed how clearly and darkly their pointed tops came out against the sky. I heard the tread of my own feet on little twigs and plants in our way, and the trail of my dress over the grass; but Hester moved noiselessly.|$|E
6000|$|About noon the {{following}} day, the horses whinnied, and the mules roused {{out of their}} tardy gait. [...] "They smell water," [...] said Emmett. And despite the heat, and the sand in my nostrils, <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> it, too. The dogs, poor foot-sore fellows, trotted on ahead down the trail. A few more miles of hot sand and gravel and red stone brought us around a low mesa to the Little Colorado.|$|E
60|$|And then it {{was that}} I became {{conscious}} of a warm, sly, youthful hand in mine, and turned, half in dread, to see only happy Sleep laughing under his glistening hair into my eyes. I strove in vain against his sorcery; rolled foolish orbs on that pure, starry face; and then <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> as it were rain, and heard as it were tempestuous forest-trees--fell asleep among the tombs.|$|E

"Not that I ken of," [...] {{said the}} king, in the {{paroxysm}} of his apprehension, (which, by the way, might be pardoned {{in one of}} so timorous a temper, and who, in his time, {{had been exposed to}} so many strange attempts)--"Not that I ken of--but search him--search him.

60|$|He was {{so close}} that I {{scarcely}} dared breathe as I waited, expecting {{him to come out}} farther down the shore. Five minutes passed without the slightest sound to indicate his whereabouts, though I was listening intently in the dead hush that was on the lake. All the while <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> him strongly. One can smell a bear almost as far as he can a deer, though the scent does not cling so long to the underbrush.|$|E
60|$|And in {{that moment}} {{something}} happened. There was no warning. A great body smashed down upon {{the four of us}} locked together. We were driven violently apart and rolled over and over, and in the suddenness of surprise we released our holds on one another. At the moment of the shock, Big-Face screamed terribly. I did not know what had happened, though <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> tiger and caught a glimpse of striped fur as I sprang for a tree.|$|E

60|$|His tone startled me. I faced about, {{to see his}} {{powerful}} arm outstretched and his finger pointing. His stern face added to my sudden concern. Something was wrong with my friends. I glanced in the direction he indicated. There were two rolling slopes or steps below us, and they were like gigantic swells of a green ocean. Beyond the second one rose a long, billowy, bluish cloud. It was smoke. All at once <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> smoke, too. It came on the fresh, strong wind.|$|E
6000|$|The warder {{looked after}} him, shook his head, {{and while he}} drew close and locked a wicket, which, {{crossing}} the staircase, rendered it impossible for any one to ascend higher than the story immediately beneath Mervyn's Bower, as Tressilian's chamber was named, he thus soliloquized with himself--"It's {{a good thing to}} be a favourite. I well-nigh lost mine office, because one frosty morning Master Varney thought <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> of aqua vitae; and this fellow can appear before him drunk as a wineskin, and yet meet no rebuke.

I don't remember much of any account for the next few weeks, till <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> lilacs, and I looked out of the port, and we was moored to a wharf-edge and there was a town o' fine gardens and red-brick houses and all the green leaves o' God's world waiting for me outside.|$|E
