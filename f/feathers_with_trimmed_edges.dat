5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, the deckle edge slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century presses advertised {{two versions of the}} same book: one <b>with</b> <b>edges</b> <b>trimmed</b> smooth and a higher-priced deckle version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods. This tradition carried forward into the 20th and 21st centuries. [...] modern deckle is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true deckle edge by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with the deckle edge and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that the deckle is not a flaw in the product. A deckle edge is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|R

40|$|Severe {{feather pecking}} is a maladaptive {{behavior}} in laying hens {{that may result}} in cannibalism and ultimately death of the victims. Selection methods in which the genetic effect of an animal on the survival of its group members is taken into account, i. e. `group selection¿, {{have been shown to}} be very effective in reducing mortality due to feather pecking and cannibalism in laying hens. It has been suggested that fearfulness and serotonergic functioning are involved in the causation and development of feather pecking. We investigated effects of selection based on survivability in non-beak trimmed groups on fear-related behavior and peripheral 5 -HT concentration and uptake in hens <b>with</b> <b>trimmed</b> or intact beaks, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Hens from the second generation of the low mortality line showed less fear-related behavior than control line hens. In addition, they displayed higher whole blood 5 -HT concentrations and a lower platelet 5 -HT uptake, indicating differences in functional activity of the 5 -HT system. Beak trimming resulted in lowered levels of fear, and in a reduction of <b>feather</b> damage. Hens <b>with</b> <b>trimmed</b> and intact beaks did, however, not differ in peripheral 5 -HT. The results imply that fearfulness and 5 -HT activity are related to feather pecking without distinguishing between cause and effect. However, given that selection altered fear-related behaviors and peripheral 5 -HT concentration and uptake, whereas beak trimming affected fearfulness and feather damage, but not 5 -HT parameters, we suggest that peripheral 5 -HT activity might reflect the predisposition to develop severe feather pecking under adverse conditions in laying hen...|$|R

50|$|Theatre {{organs are}} usually {{identified}} by the distinctive horseshoe-shaped arrangement of stop tabs (tongue-shaped switches) above and around the instrument's keyboards on their consoles. Given their prominent placement in houses of popular entertainment, theatre organ consoles were typically decorated in gaudy ways, with brightly colored stop tabs, and painted bright red and black, or solid gold, or ivory <b>with</b> gold <b>trim,</b> <b>with</b> built-in console lighting. In organs installed in the UK, a common feature was large translucent surrounds extending {{from both sides of}} the console, with internal colored lighting. A spectacular original example is the so-called Rhinestone Barton, installed in 1928 in the former RKO Iowa Theatre (now home to Theatre Cedar Rapids in Cedar Rapids, Iowa). The console of this 3 manual 14 rank Wangerin-built Barton is completely covered in black felt fabric embedded with glass glitter in swirling patterns, <b>with</b> all <b>edges</b> <b>trimmed</b> <b>with</b> bands of rhinestones.

A narrowand enclosed staircase is located toward the northwest portion of the first floor, providing the only access to two upstairs bedrooms. Hand-split vertical and horizontal planks act as wainscotting in the enclosedstaircase area, with the area above the chair railing now wallpapered or, {{in the case of}} the east wall, continuing with pine vertical planks.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on <b>trimmed</b> <b>edges.</b> The mathematical modeling for the prediction of cutting forces was also done using Artificial Neural Network and Regression Analysis...|$|R
