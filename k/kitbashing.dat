500|$|Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) created two Mon Calamari cruiser designs: the {{cylindrical}} Home One {{command ship}} and a [...] "winged" [...] model {{identified in the}} Expanded Universe as the Liberty, which would have its wings removed and thrusters modified to portray another subtype. The ships were designed to be as aesthetically different from the Imperial Star Destroyers as possible, although the filming crew disliked the [...] "pickle ships" [...] due to the models' unflattering angles. The ships' design precluded ILM's modelmakers from <b>kitbashing</b> other models to create the ships; the model was largely vacuformed. Internal neon lights provided lighting, and detail was painted on by using the second Death Star model's exposed framework as a makeshift frisket.|$|E
500|$|The Constellation-class {{starship}} first {{appears in}} [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] as a desktop model in Picard's ready room. Rick Sternbach constructed the model by <b>kitbashing</b> Ertl kits {{of the movie}} Enterprise, using parts from other models such as the VF-1 Valkyrie to add detail. Greg Jein used Sternbach's and Andrew Probert's designs to create the four-foot shooting model of the USS Stargazer for [...] "The Battle". In the original script, the Stargazer {{was to be a}} redress of the movie-era Constitution-class Enterprise model that first appeared in Probert and Sternbach persuaded the producers not to reuse the movie Enterprise model, and the [...] "Constellation"-class label was chosen so that it could match LeVar Burton's lip movement to redub dialogue.|$|E

500|$|Pre-production {{began in}} 2011, and Respawn's first game was {{originally}} planned for seventh generation consoles. The {{idea for the}} game did not come easily, and the team arrived at its multiplayer-only and human-mech focus after much internal debate. The team started with open collaboration about games and game mechanics they found exciting, and no market research. Respawn artist Joel Emslie recalled starting with a human-sized suit as a [...] "second skin", which the designers grew in size. As Respawn didn't have the necessary computers, the artists resorted to <b>kitbashing</b> and model makingâ€”Emslie prototyped by putting a figurine inside a plastic model kit. The team progressed to detailed, foot-high [...] "mechettes" [...] made of wood, wire, and plastic, which became the Atlas Titan. Project influences include Blade Runner, Star Wars, Abrams Battle Tank, and Masamune Shirow of Ghost in the Shell. Emslie refers to the aesthetic as a [...] "used future". Their production was unconventional, similar to Infinity Ward's old practices, and the game didn't have design documentation. At E3 2011, Electronic Arts Labels president Frank Gibeau revealed that Respawn's first project was a science fiction shooter published by Electronic Arts. Two project leads left the company to begin their own studio in mid-2012, and West retired in March 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, <b>kitbashing</b> {{has been}} used to create [...] "art" [...] per se. The Toronto {{sculptor}} Kim Adams has used HO gauge freight cars, containers, detail parts, figures and scenery to create artistic landscapes. American artist Kris Kuksi also uses <b>kitbashing</b> to detail his maximalist sculptures.|$|E
50|$|Steam Era Models {{produces}} a kit for the E type carriages, utilising components from the W type kits and new, six-wheel bogies. Construction requires {{something of a}} <b>kitbash,</b> with the sides, roof and underframe from two W cars merged to form one E car shell. As of 2016, the kits sell for $60 each.|$|R
50|$|Kits are {{produced}} by Steam Era Models for the short, clerestory-roofed AW and BW carriages; these can be <b>kitbashed</b> into an ABW. Resin-cast curved roofs are available for purchase separately, from either Blue and Gold models or End of the Line Hobbies in Adelaide. The latter company also offers kit construction services, so {{it is possible to}} have a carriage built and posted.|$|R

5000|$|The {{basement}} {{of the house was}} severely damaged by fire just ten days after John Allen suffered a fatal heart attack in January 1973. Most of the layout was destroyed in the fire. However, one of the locomotives, No. 34, a 4-10-0 that John <b>kitbashed</b> from parts, resides in the office of Model Railroader magazine executive editor Andy Sperandeo. Sperandeo was a frequent visitor to the G&D, being stationed in California while serving in the United States Army.|$|R
5000|$|Steam Era Models {{makes an}} HO scale plastic kit of the Z vans, which is {{designed}} for the ZP vans, but can be <b>kitbashed</b> {{to any of the}} other variations. The ZL would be the easiest conversion, because the only 1:87 scale change would be the [...] "L" [...] in the code. It would be relatively straightforward to backdate the kit to the D van, or postdate the van to ZD, ZL, ZP or ZZ types. Parts from the kit could be recycled, in conjunction with Steamandthings's carriage side etchings to construct a new body for passenger and mail vans.|$|R

5000|$|As of March 2012, only HO scale plastic {{models of}} the E-series {{carriages}} are available (although there have been brass models released in the past). Kits produced by Steam Era Models can be <b>kitbashed</b> into AE, ABE and BE types and End of the Line Hobbies in South Australia are selling made-up kits plus BCE and Sleeping varieties, while Auscision Models have released a series of [...] "ready-to-run" [...] carriages in VR Heritage Brown (AE, ABE, BE, CE), VR Red (AE with 4-wheel bogies, ABE, BE) and VR Blue (CE only). They are sold as single carriages ($125.00 ea) or as sets of four ($450.00 ea) and arranged by age, with sets from 1921-1954, 1954-1963, 1963-1971 and 1971-1985.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} published on TV Asahi's main website, Hosokawa {{stated that the}} script for the final episode was rewritten {{on the final day}} of filming. He later said that the script was sent in so late that it arrived on set as the final battle was being filmed. This finale was scrapped and then a new ending that, according to Hosokawa, was nothing like the intended ending, was filmed. Later in the interview, Hosokawa said that the Oni suit used by Kiriya was a <b>kitbash</b> of two new suits made especially for the characters of Asumu and Kiriya. Hosokawa said that this was the most upsetting change to him as the final script had been rewritten six times at that point and all but the filmed version contained both Asumu and Kiriya becoming Oni.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Kitbashing</b> or model bashing is a {{practice}} whereby a new scale model {{is created by}} taking pieces out of commercial kits. These pieces may be added to a custom project or to another kit. For professional modelmakers, <b>kitbashing</b> is popular to create concept models for detailing movie special effects. Commercial model kits are a ready source of [...] "detailing", providing any number of identical, mass-produced components {{that can be used}} to add fine detail to an existing model. Professionals often kitbash to build prototype parts which are then recreated with lightweight materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{popularity}} of ready-to-run, pre-assembled models, even {{coupled with the}} increased availability of many unique prototypes using resin castings, {{seems not to have}} seriously impacted the art of <b>kitbashing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In model rocketry, <b>kitbashing</b> refers {{simply to}} using the pieces from a one kit to build a {{different}} model. This is typically used to create unusual and/or especially complex models.|$|E
5000|$|Scratch {{building}} {{is the process}} of building a scale model [...] "from scratch", i.e. from raw materials, rather than building it from a commercial kit, <b>kitbashing</b> or buying it pre-assembled.|$|E
50|$|For the hobbyist, <b>kitbashing</b> saves {{time that}} would be spent scratch {{building}} an entire model. Hobbyists may kitbash to create {{a model of a}} subject (real or imaginary) for which there is not a commercial kit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kitbashing</b> is a {{modelling}} technique where {{parts from}} multiple model kits are combined {{to create a}} novel model form. For example, the effects crews on the various Star Trek TV shows frequently kitbashed multiple starship models to quickly create new classes of ship for use in background scenes where details would not be particularly obvious.|$|E
50|$|Steam Era Models {{produces}} high-quality polyurethane kits of the T vans, which retail {{for around}} $16.00AUD. The T vans covered are 192-417 batch, and a kitbash {{to create the}} 1-191 range. A bogie version of the TP van is available, although <b>kitbashing</b> {{would be required to}} add the extra doors for TP 1 and 2.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{venue for}} <b>kitbashing</b> is diecast {{emergency}} vehicles such as fire apparatuses. Kitbashers frequently utilize models from manufacturers such as Code 3 and Corgi. The kitbash {{in such cases}} {{can be as simple}} as painting or redecaling a model, or as complex as tearing the model down and adding scratch-built components, followed by custom decals.|$|E
50|$|The Trolls: A band of green-skinned and {{diminutive}} thieves {{trying to}} do their best to better their positions {{at the expense of other}} people.

They are eventually captured by King Gregor's knights and remanded to the dungeon in Dunwyn Castle.|$|E
5000|$|As {{would be}} expected, given these origins, greebling is most {{commonly}} associated with the particular kind of large city-like spaceships made popular in Star Wars, but has been generalized to refer to any dense covering by different (usually mechanical) components. Similarly, Borg starships (and drones) in Star Trek appear heavily [...] "greebled" [...] using leftover sprues from previous <b>kitbashing</b> and photoetched bits.|$|E
50|$|Kim Adams (born 17 December 1951) is a Canadian {{sculptor}} who creates assemblage {{in different}} scales. His visual style {{is influenced by}} industrial design, architecture and automotive design. His work incorporates the model railroading technique of <b>kitbashing,</b> and bright stock colours and prefabricated elements are important ingredients in his large-scale sculptures. His small surreal landscapes are reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{distinction}} between 1:6 scale collectors who choose to simply display their figures in the original box, and playscale miniaturists. Consistent with other forms of miniaturism, many enthusiasts make their own custom uniforms, weapons, helmets, and equipment. <b>Kitbashing</b> is another component of playscale miniaturism. This involves the mixing and matching of clothing and accessories from different sources to achieve the desired look.|$|E
