Two infinite determinants representing the characteristic equations {{for the two}} types of hybrid waves (the _eHE_(mn) and the _oHE_(mn) waves) are derived.

40|$|When {{magnetic}} energy density {{is much larger}} than that of matter, as in pulsar/black hole magnetospheres, the medium becomes force-free and we need relativity to describe it. As in non-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), Alfvénic MHD turbulence in the relativistic limit can be described by interactions of counter-traveling wave packets. In this paper we numerically study strong imbalanced MHD turbulence in such environments. Here, imbalanced turbulence means the waves traveling in one direction (<b>dominant</b> <b>waves)</b> have higher amplitudes than the opposite-traveling waves (sub-dominant waves). We find that (1) spectrum of the <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> is steeper than that of sub-dominant waves, (2) the anisotropy of the <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> is weaker than that of sub-dominant waves, and (3) the dependence of the ratio of {{magnetic energy}} densities of <b>dominant</b> and sub-dominant <b>waves</b> on the ratio of energy injection rates is steeper than quadratic (i. e., b_+^ 2 /b_-^ 2 ∝ (ϵ_+/ϵ_-) ^n with n> 2).

40|$|Atrial fibrillation, {{a common}} cardiac arrhythmia, often {{progresses}} unfavourably: {{in patients with}} long-term atrial fibrillation, fibrillatory episodes are typically of increased duration and frequency of occurrence relative to healthy controls. This is due to electrical, structural, and contractile remodeling processes. We investigated mechanisms of how electrical and structural remodeling contribute to perpetuation of simulated atrial fibrillation, using a mathematical model of the human atrial action potential incorporated into an anatomically realistic three-dimensional structural model of the human atria. Electrical and structural remodeling both shortened the atrial wavelength - electrical remodeling primarily through a decrease in action potential duration, while structural remodeling primarily slowed conduction. The decrease in wavelength correlates {{with an increase in}} the average duration of atrial fibrillation/flutter episodes. The dependence of reen try duration on wavelength was the same for electrical vs. structural remodeling. However, the dynamics during atrial reentry varied between electrical, structural, and combined electrical and structural remodeling in several ways, including: (i) with structural remodeling there were more occurrences of fragmented wavefronts and hence more filaments than during electrical remodeling; (ii) <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> anchored around different anatomical obstacles in electrical vs. structural remodeling; (iii) <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> were often not anchored in combined electrical and structural remodeling. We conclude that, in simulated atrial fibrillation, the wavelength dependence of reentry duration is similar for electrical and structural remodeling, despite major differences in overall dynamics, including maximal number of filaments, wave fragmentation, restitution properties, and whether <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> are anchored to anatomical obstacles or spiralling freely. © 2012 Krogh-Madsen et al...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five parts. The first part is an introduction {{with references to}} some recent work on 2 D electromagnetic scattering problems at high frequencies. It also presents the basic integral equation types for impenetrable objects and the standard elements of the method of moments. An overview of frequency modulated radar at low frequencies is followed by summaries of the papers.   Paper I presents an accurate implementation of the method of moments for a perfectly conducting cylinder. A scaling for the rapid variation of the solution improves accuracy. At high frequencies, the method of moments leads to a large dense system of equations. Sparsity in this system is obtained by the modification of the path in the integral equation. The modified path reduces the accuracy in the deep shadow.   In paper II, a hybrid method is used to handle the standing waves that are prominent in the shadow for the cylindrical TE case. The shadow region is treated separately, in a hybrid scheme based on a priori knowledge about the solution. An accurate method to combine solutions in this hybrid scheme is presented.   In paper III, the surface current in the shadow zone of a convex or a concave scatterer is approximated by extracting the <b>dominant</b> <b>waves.</b> An accurate technique based on the symmetric discrete Fourier transform is used to extract the complex wavenumbers and amplitudes for those <b>waves.</b> The <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> constitute a concise form of scaling {{that is used to}} improve the performance of the method of moments. The effect of surface curvature on the <b>dominant</b> <b>waves</b> has been investigated in this work.   In paper IV, frequency modulated continuous wave radar (FMCW) at low frequency is studied as a way to locate targets that are normally not detected by conventional radar. Three separate platforms with isotropic antennas are used for this purpose. The trilateration method is a way to locate the targets accurately by means of spectral techniques.   The problem of ghost targets has been studied for monostatic and multistatic radar. In the case of confluent echoes in the spectra, potentially missing echoes are reinserted in order to locate all targets. The Capon method is used to obtain high resolution spectra and thus reduce the confluence problem. The need for bandwidth is also reduced...|$|R

With the increase of the paddle wave steepness the stress level returns to the stress level characteristic of the pure wind waves.

The WOWC model explains this peculiarity of the stress distribution {{by the fact that}} the paddle waves significantly damp the wind waves in the spectral peak.

40|$|Abstract. This paper extends our {{previous}} {{study of the}} breaking probability of dominant deep water gravity surface waves into the finite water depth environment. It reports a unified behavior of the mean breaking statistics once the effects of finite water depth are taken into account. The shallow water wave data that {{form the basis of}} this study were acquired at a field experiment site at Lake George, New South Wales, Australia. The breaking events were detected through visual observation of videotaped records of the wave field in combination with acoustic signatures of the breaking waves from a collocated hydrophone. Following Banner et al. [2000], we argue that when constant finite depth bottom influence is operative, nonlinear hydrodynamical effects associated with energy and momentum fluxes within deforming wave groups remain the primary determinant of breaking onset. This underpins our proposed finite depth water parameterization for the environmental dependence of <b>dominant</b> <b>wave</b> breaking probability, given by the average number of breakers passing a fixed point per <b>dominant</b> <b>wave</b> period. The additional influence of bottom interaction with the wind drift current shear and wind forcing are also included in our finite constant depth formulation. This is a natural extension of our recently proposed deep water dependence and reduces to it as the significant wave height becomes much smaller than the water depth. In common with the deep water case we propose that there exists a threshold of the significant peak steepness below which negligible <b>dominant</b> <b>wave</b> breaking occurs.

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of beach morphology and sedimentology were made along the Monterey Peninsula and Carmel Bay, California, {{in the spring}} and summer of 1997. These data were combined with low-altitude aerial imagery, high-resolution bathymetry, and local geology to understand how coastal geomorphology, lithology, and tectonics influence the distribution and transport of littoral sediment in the nearshore and inner shelf along a rocky shoreline over the course of decades. Three primary modes of sediment distribution in the nearshore and on the inner shelf off the Monterey Peninsula and in Carmel Bay were observed. Along stretches of the study area that were exposed to the <b>dominant</b> <b>wave</b> direction, sediment has accumulated in shore-normal bathymetric lows interpreted to be paleo-stream channels. Where the coastline is oriented parallel to the <b>dominant</b> <b>wave</b> direction and streams channels trend perpendicular to the coast, sediment-filled paleo-stream channels occur in the nearshore as well, but here they are connected to one another by shore-parallel ribbons of sediment at depths between 2 and 6 m.

We interpret the distribution and interaction or transport of littoral sediment between pocket beaches along this coastline to be primarily controlled by the northwest-trending structure of the region and the dominant oceanographic regime.
