Sewage sludges were generated with either no metal added to the WWTP influent (control), ionic ZnO, AgNO 3 and bulk (micron sized) TiO 2 added (ionic metal-treated) or ZnO, Ag and TiO 2 ENMs added (ENM-treated). A sandy-loam soil was amended with the treated sewage sludge and aged in outdoor lysimeters for six months. Earthworms {{were exposed to}} the aged mixtures and a dilution of the mixtures (using control soil–sludge mix). Separate earthworm exposures to as-synthesized ENM and ionic metals salts (Zn/Ag singly) were carried out in the same soil. Earthworm reproduction was depressed by 90 % in the <b>high-metal</b> ENM treatment and by 22 – 27 % in the ionic metal and low-metal ENM soil–sludge treatments. Based on total metal concentrations in the soil–sludges the as-synthesised metal salt and ENM exposures predicted Zn was driving observed toxicity in the soil–sludge more than Ag. Earthworms from the <b>high-metal</b> ENM treatment accumulated significantly more Ag than other treatments whereas total Zn concentrations in the earthworms were within the range for earthworm Zn regulation for all treatments. This study suggests that current Zn limits set to provide protection against ionic metal forms may not protect soil biota where metals are input to WWTP in the ENM form...|$|E

The latter relies on <b>high-metals,</b> porous enamels to catalyze {{the reduction of}} soils to ash at normal cooking temperatures. The walls of catalytic self-cleaning ovens are coated with materials acting as oxidation catalysts, usually {{in the form of}} catalyst particles in a binder matrix.

Other possibilities are copper, vanadium, bismuth, molybdenum, manganese, iron, nickel, tin, niobium, chromium, tungsten, rhenium, platinum, cobalt, and their oxides, either alone or in mixtures. Highly active coatings typically contain a copper oxide, manganese oxide or cobalt oxide, and copper and manganese oxides are often used together. The binder may be a fluoropolymer or an enamel frit.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{beryllium}} (Be) abundances {{in a large}} sample of 41 extra-solar planet host stars, and for 29 stars without any known planetary-mass companion, spanning a large range of effective temperatures. The Be abundances were derived through spectral synthesis done in standard Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, using spectra obtained with various instruments. The results seem to confirm that overall, planet-host stars have ``normal'' Be abundances, although a small, but not significant, difference might be present. This result is discussed, and we show that this difference is probably not due to any stellar ``pollution'' events. In other words, our results {{support the idea that}} the <b>high-metal</b> content of planet-host stars has, overall, a ``primordial'' origin. However, we also find a small subset of planet-host late-F and early-G dwarfs that might have higher than average Be abundances. The reason for the offset is not clear, and might be related either to the engulfment of planetary material, to galactic chemical evolution effects, or to stellar-mass differences for stars of similar temperature.

40|$|Abstract Mine tailing {{deposits}} in semiarid and arid environments frequently remain devoid of vegetation {{due to the}} toxicity of the substrate {{and the absence of}} a diverse soil microbial community capable of supporting seed germination and plant growth. The contribution of the plant growth promoting bacterium (PGPB) Azospirillum brasilense Sp 6 to the growth of quailbush in compostamended, moderately acidic, <b>high-metal</b> content mine tailings using an irrigation-based reclamation strategy was examined along with its influence on the rhizosphere bacterial community. Sp 6 inoculation resulted in a significant (2. 2 -fold) increase in plant biomass production. The data suggest that the inoculum successfully colonized the root surface and persisted throughout the 60 -day experiment in both the rhizosphere, as demonstrated by excision and sequencing of the appropriate denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band, and the rhizoplane, as indicated by fluorescent in situ hybridization of root surfaces.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this task}} is the {{application}} of desulfurization enzymes to remove sulfur from crude oil, diesel fuel, or resid precursors for needle cokes. The most important question to be answered is how to utilize the Rhodococcus desulfurization complex in a nonaqueous solvent or medium, such as the oil itself. Successful application of nonaqueous enzymology to this problem will involve finding ways to stabilize the active conformations of the enzymes and provide for easy recovery of the enzymes, perhaps in an immobilized-enzyme packed-bed reactor. A second objective is to explore biological systems that can catalyze the cleavage or organometallics in fossil fuels, such as metal porphyrins. A biodemetallation function could greatly aid in the refining of <b>high-metal,</b> high-sulfur crudes and bitumens. During this period, work was initiated to develop new rapid and highly quantitative assays for specific desulfurization activities in isolated and separated enzyme fractions. The preparation of water-soluble chlorophyllin was carried out for use in assaying for demetallation activity in microorganisms. Cleavage of the dark green porphyrin system in the chlorophyllin will be an indicator of activity that may be useful for cleavage of other metal porphyrins in crudes and bitumens...|$|E
40|$|Mineralogical {{characterization}} by X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{and a high}} throughput automated {{quantitative evaluation}} of minerals by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN) was conducted on samples from a sulphate-reducing biochemical reactor (BCR) treating high concentrations of metals (As, Zn, Cu) in smelter waste landfill seepage. The samples were also subjected to energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of specific particles. The bulk analysis results revealed that the samples consisted mainly of silicate and carbonate minerals. More detailed phase analysis indicated four different classes: zinc-arsenic sulphosalts/sulphates, zinc-arsenic oxides, zinc phosphates and zinc-lead sulphosalts/sulphates. This suggests that sulphates and sulphides are the predominant types of Zn and As minerals formed in the BCR. Sphalerite (ZnS) was a common mineral observed {{in many of the}} samples. In addition, X-ray point analysis showed evidence of As and Zn coating around feldspar and amphibole particles. The presence of arsenic-zinc-iron, with or without cadmium particles, indicated arsenopyrite minerals. Copper-iron-sulphide particles suggested chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and tennantite (Cu,Fe) 12 As 4 S 13. Microbial communities found in each sample were correlated with metal content to describe taxonomic groups associated with <b>high-metal</b> samples.

40|$|This {{study is}} one of the very first that investigates the effects of heavy metal {{pollution}} on food consumption and reproduction of terrestrial snails under semi-realistic field conditions. Two experiments were carried out using snails (Cepaea nemoralis) and food (Urtica dioica leaves) from different metal polluted locations and one reference location. The first experiment showed that both polluted and reference snails fed on <b>high-metal</b> leaves from a highly polluted location had significantly lower consumption rates than snails consuming leaves from the reference location. In the second experiment, snails from both locations used in the consumption experiment and from two low-polluted locations were kept on native soil and food in order to reproduce. No negative effect of heavy metal pollution on clutch size was found for the snails from the reference location and the low-polluted locations. Snails from the highly polluted location laid no eggs. This suggests that at high levels of metal pollution, reproduction is strongly negatively affected. We suggest that the absence of egg laying by snails from the highly polluted location results from a combination of decreased consumption and an increased demand of energy for the accumulation and detoxification of metals (decreased scope for growth). © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006...|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 27, 2014). [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this thesis, a possibilistic K-nearest neighbor classifier {{is presented to}} distinguish between and classify mine and non-mine targets on data obtained from wideband electromagnetic induction sensors. The goal of this work is to develop methods for classifying wide-band electromagnetic induction data into one of several target classes or a non-target class. For some landmine detection systems, it could be necessary or helpful to discriminate between the several classes of targets, {{so that they can}} be analyzed and processed according to their specific properties. For example, it might be of importance to distinguish mines with <b>high-metal</b> content versus low-metal content or distinguish between anti-personnel versus anti-tank landmines. The proposed classifier achieves this goal using a method that is motivated by the observation that different buried object types often have consistent signatures depending on their metal content, size, shape, and depth. Given a sparse representation obtained using the joint orthogonal matching pursuits algorithm, particular target types consistently selected the same dictionary elements for their sparse representation. The proposed classifier distinguishes between particular target types using the frequency of dictionary elements selected by an alarm. Possibilistic weights are assigned for each alarm for sixteen landmine target classes as well as a false alarm class. The proposed classifier accuracy is compared to several state of the art methods and it shows improvement in discrimination results...|$|E

It was also able to absorbed 59. 81 - 80. 08 % of chromium and 58. 09 - 79. 41 % of cobalt at pH 7. 3 - 8. 5. The maximum lead uptake was obtained at pH 5. 5 - 8. 5 with an amount of 55. 28 - 91. 06 %. The significant absorption of cadmium was shown at pH 6. 5 with 38 %.

The structure of the microbial community in different soil layers (Top, Middle and Bottom) of the Tui mine tailing was investigated using culture-based and molecular approaches. The zinc resistance of an Acidocella strain, isolated previously, was determined by culturing methods. Growth curves of Acidocella indicated that it could grow at up to 250 mM ZnSO₄, and in the presence of 250 mM MgSO₄, both growth and Zn²⁺ resistance were greatly enhanced with tolerance up to 750 mM Zn²⁺. Acidophilic bacteria were isolated and enumerated on solid media, and were found to be related to Actinobacteridae and Gammaproteobacteria. By contrast, cloning and pyrosequencing analysis of the 16 S rRNA genes revealed that Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans were the most common strains that occurred in the soil environment in all layers. From a clone library of the Top layer DNA, 69 out of 118 clone sequences were phylogenetically affiliated with the iron-oxidizing Leptospirillum ferrooxidans within the Nitrospira and 16 with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans within the Proteobacteria. A broadly similar result was obtained from pyrosequencing analysis. The most abundant OTU (21. 9 %) was affiliated with Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and the second most abundant (8. 4 %) affiliated with Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans.
