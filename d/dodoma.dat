25|$|According to the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010, 15 {{percent of}} Tanzanian women had {{undergone}} female genital mutilation (FGM) and 72 percent of Tanzanian {{men had been}} circumcised. FGM is most common in the Manyara, <b>Dodoma,</b> Arusha, and Singida regions and nonexistent in Zanzibar. The prevalence of male circumcision was above 90 percent in the eastern (Dar es Salaam, Pwani, and Morogoro regions), northern (Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Arusha, and Manyara regions), and central areas (<b>Dodoma</b> and Singida regions) and below 50 percent only in the southern highlands zone (Mbeya, Iringa, and Rukwa regions).|$|E
25|$|Until 1974, Dar es Salaam {{served as}} Tanzania’s capital city, {{at which point}} the capital city {{commenced}} transferring to <b>Dodoma,</b> which was officially completed in 1996. However, as of 2017, it continues to remain a focus of central government bureaucracy, although this {{is in the process of}} fully moving to <b>Dodoma.</b> In addition, it is Tanzania's most prominent city in arts, fashion, media, music, film and television and a leading financial centre, with the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) being the country's first and most important stock exchange market. The city is the leading arrival and departure point for most tourists who visit Tanzania, including the national parks for safaris and the islands of Unguja and Pemba. Dar es Salaam is also the largest and most populous Swahili-speaking city in the world.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 70 {{percent of}} the {{population}} is rural, although this percentage has been declining since at least 1967. Dar es Salaam (population 4,364,541) is the largest city and commercial capital. <b>Dodoma</b> (population 410,956), is located in the centre of Tanzania, is the capital of the country, and hosts the National Assembly.|$|E
25|$|The National Stadium hosts Dar es Salaam's Young Africans Sports Club, Simba Sports Club, Azam F.C. {{and other}} Tanzanian {{football}} clubs, and international matches. There is {{a proposal to}} build a new stadium in <b>Dodoma,</b> much bigger in capacity than the present one in Dar es salaam by the government as a donation from the Moroccan Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{wastewater}} treatment plants are reported {{to operate in the}} municipalities of Morogoro, <b>Dodoma,</b> Iringa, Arusha and Songea and in the cities of Dar es Salaam and Mwanza. Wastewater samples are collected from these {{wastewater treatment}} plants. The result of the analysis of 250 samples showed that national standards for effluent prior to discharge were met in 88% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the twenty}} major urban water utilities, 11 provide some access to sewer connections. In Moshi the {{reported}} connection rate is 45% (although {{this also includes}} some industrial connections), in Morogoro the reported rate is 15% and in <b>Dodoma</b> and Iringa it is 13%. In Dar es Salaam {{the length of the}} sewer network is estimated at 188km, although only 4% of households have access to it.|$|E
25|$|Political developments, {{including}} {{the formation and}} growth of the Tanganyika African National Union, led to Tanganyika attaining independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when in 1964 Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania. In 1973, however, provisions were made to relocate the capital to <b>Dodoma,</b> a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process {{has not yet been}} completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city.|$|E
25|$|UWSSAs {{carry out}} water metering. In Arusha, <b>Dodoma,</b> Moshi, Mwanza and Tanga 100% of {{household}} connections are reported as metered. The figures are above 50% in eleven other cities, with Lindi performing worst with 26% of metered connections. As of 2008 {{there were in}} total over 331,000 metered household connections in the territory served by regional utilities (the figure almost doubled compared to 2007 - about 169,000 metered connections). The maintenance of water meters and the associated costs have been identified by MoWI {{as one of the}} pressing problems for urban water suppliers.|$|E
25|$|As a {{whole and}} on average, Tanzania has {{extensive}} water resources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in 2008 Tanzania had 96.27km3 of renewable water resources per year (by comparison, estimated world water resources are {{in the order of}} 43,750km3/year). This corresponds to 2,266 m3 per person and year. Water resources are however distributed unevenly - both in time and space. During the dry season, which usually lasts from June to October, even large rivers can dry up or their flow declines substantially. Some parts of the country receive, on average, up to 3,000mm of rain per year, while in other regions (such as the <b>Dodoma</b> Region or the Rift Valley) yearly rainfall averages 600mm.|$|E

2500|$|A {{pilot for}} the new policy was {{initiated}} by WaterAid in <b>Dodoma</b> Urban District together with the district government. An innovative feature {{of the project was}} that the water department worked closely with the community development department and the health department. Both had previously not been involved in water projects. Using the acronyms of the three departments and of WaterAid the integrated team was called WAMMA, giving the project its name. Each of the three departmental teams had to have both men and women among its staff, although this was difficult to implement because of a shortage of female staff. Unlike before, communities were selected based on a needs survey. [...] However, government staff at all levels were poorly paid and had little interesting work to do. Some were consequently demotivated. Like many other externally funded projects, the WAMMA project paid allowances to fieldworkers for work undertaken outside their offices in order to motivate them. However, “payments were made at the official rate, as any higher allowances would undermine the government’s capacity to sustain or replicate work without donor inputs.” Interestingly, WaterAid initially worked directly at the district level without any formal agreement with the regional government until 1995. The programme, which was considered a success by WaterAid and the district government, was subsequently extended from <b>Dodoma</b> Urban District to three other districts in <b>Dodoma</b> Region. 86 projects were built under between 1991 and 1996. The innovative collaborative work between three district departments and the participatory approach attracted visitors from all over Tanzania.|$|E

2500|$|Kanyama Chiume, one of {{the main}} leaders in the {{independence}} struggle in Nyasaland (renamed Malawi after the country won independence) where he served as minister of education and then as minister of foreign affairs before going into exile in Tanzania, lived in Dar es Salaam for decades. He grew up in Tanganyika. He spent his childhood in Morogoro and in Dar es Salaam and attended primary school and secondary school in Tanganyika (later renamed Tanzania). When he was in boarding school in Dar es Salaam, he lived in the same dormitory with Rashidi Kawawa who later became vice president of Tanganyika, later Tanzania, after the country won independence. Kawawa was also his classmate at Tabora Secondary School (then known as Upper School). Chiume graduated [...] from Makerere University College in Uganda and went to teach at Alliance Secondary School in <b>Dodoma,</b> Tanganyika.
