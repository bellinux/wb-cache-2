5|$|Charles Suckling {{synthesized}} <b>halothane</b> in 1951. <b>Halothane</b> was {{the first}} organofluorine anesthetic agent to be introduced into clinical practice in 1956. Miller and his team continued to develop organofluorine chemistry {{after the end of}} World War II and methoxyflurane was synthesized in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed vomiting in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and <b>halothane</b> (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative vomiting, {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using <b>halothane</b> or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with <b>halothane,</b> methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|An MH mouse {{has been}} constructed, bearing the R163C {{mutation}} prevalent in humans. These mice display signs similar to human MH patients, including sensitivity to <b>halothane</b> (increased respiration, body temperature, and death). Blockade of RYR1 by dantrolene prevents adverse reaction to <b>halothane</b> in these mice, as with humans. Muscle from these mice also shows increased -induced depolarization {{and an increased}} caffeine sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>halothane</b> in 1956 greatly diminished {{the use of}} TCE as a general anesthetic. TCE was still used as an inhalation analgesic in childbirth given by self-administration. Fetal toxicity and concerns for carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|General anesthetics are a {{class of}} psychoactive drug used on people to block {{physical}} pain and other sensations. Most anesthetics induce unconsciousness, allowing the person to undergo medical procedures like surgery without the feelings of physical pain or emotional trauma. To induce unconsciousness, anesthetics affect the GABA and NMDA systems. For example, <b>halothane</b> is a GABA agonist, and ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Halothane,</b> the world's first {{synthetic}} inhalation general anaesthetic gas, {{was discovered}} in 1951 at ICI's Widnes Laboratory by Wallasey's Charles Suckling, and first tested on a patient in Manchester in 1956; it works by binding to the GABA receptor. Sir John Charnley of Bury invented the hip replacement in 1962 at Wrightington, Lancashire, north-west of Wigan. Clatterbridge Hospital in Bebington has a cyclotron (linear accelerator), {{and is the only}} hospital in the UK to offer proton therapy.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless they are exposed to a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as <b>halothane,</b> sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{research}} in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting's {{research in}} dogs, which {{determined that the}} isolates of pancreatic secretion {{could be used to}} treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade's research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as <b>halothane</b> and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.|$|E
25|$|The Porton Down {{analysis}} by James R. Riches and his colleagues, , showed that while fentanyl or 3-methyl fentanyl were {{absent from the}} urine of one survivor and residues of the agent in the clothing of two other British survivors, the veterinary large animal sedative drug carfentanil and anesthetic agent remifentanil were identified by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry in one hostage's urine and on the clothing of three hostages who had returned to Britain after the hostage rescue. The authors concluded that carfentanil and remifentanil were used as a mixture in the chemical agent employed by Russian troops to subdue the Chechen terrorists and hostages at the Barricade Theater, perhaps suspended in the anesthetic agent <b>halothane.</b>|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: fludrocortisone is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and triamcinolone and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype <b>halothane</b> is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than <b>halothane</b> and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E

2500|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} {{is a rare}} {{reaction to}} common anesthetic agents (such as <b>halothane)</b> or the paralytic agent succinylcholine. [...] Those who have this reaction, which is potentially fatal, have a genetic predisposition.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1930s {{through the}} 1970s, both in Europe and in North America, {{trichloroethylene}} {{was used as}} a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by ICI under the trade name Trilene it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue) to avoid confusion with the similar smelling chloroform. [...] TCE replaced earlier anesthetics chloroform and ether in the 1940s, but was itself replaced in the 1960s in developed countries with the introduction of <b>halothane,</b> which allowed much faster induction and recovery times. [...] Trilene was also used as a potent inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth. [...] It was used with <b>halothane</b> in the Tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. As of 2000, however, TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Approved {{procedures}} for euthanasia of laboratory mice include compressed [...] gas, injectable barbiturate anesthetics, inhalable anesthetics, such as <b>Halothane,</b> and physical methods, such as cervical dislocation and decapitation. In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association issued new guidelines for [...] induction, stating that a flow rate of 10% to 30% volume/min is optimal for euthanasing laboratory mice.|$|E
2500|$|Research into {{malignant}} hyperthermia {{was limited}} until {{the discovery of}} [...] "porcine stress syndrome" [...] (PSS) in Danish Landrace and other pig breeds selected for muscling, {{a condition in which}} stressed pigs develop [...] "pale, soft, exudative" [...] flesh (a manifestation of the effects of malignant hyperthermia) rendering their meat less marketable at slaughter. This [...] "awake triggering" [...] was not observed in humans, and initially cast doubts on the value of the animal model, but subsequently, susceptible humans were discovered to [...] "awake trigger" [...] (develop malignant hyperthermia) in stressful situations. This supported the use of the pig model for research. Pig farmers use <b>halothane</b> cones in swine yards to expose piglets to <b>halothane.</b> Those that die were MH-susceptible, thus saving the farmer the expense of raising a pig whose meat {{he would not be able}} to market. [...] This also reduced the use of breeding stock carrying the genes for PSS. [...] The condition in swine is also due to a defect in ryanodine receptors.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} causes of acute liver failure aside from {{acetaminophen}} toxicity; these include viral hepatitis—including hepatitis A (rarely), hepatitis B, hepatitis C (rarely), hepatitis E (especially in pregnant women), [...] Epstein-Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus and varicella-zoster virus [...] -- Wilson's disease, the toxin {{of the death}} cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides), alcohol, autoimmune hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, other medications (including <b>halothane,</b> hormonal contraception, and isoniazid), recreational drugs (including ecstasy) and, rarely, tumours infiltrating the liver.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{invasive}} diagnostic {{techniques have}} been proposed. Intramuscular injection of <b>halothane</b> 6 vol% {{has been shown}} to result in higher than normal increases in local [...] among patients with known malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 75%. For patients at similar risk to those in this study, this leads to a positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 100%. This method may provide a suitable alternative to more invasive techniques.|$|E
2500|$|EEG {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} {{depends on the}} type of anesthetic employed. [...] With halogenated anesthetics, such as <b>halothane</b> or intravenous agents, such as propofol, a rapid (alpha or low beta), nonreactive EEG pattern is seen over most of the scalp, especially anteriorly; in some older terminology this was known as a WAR (widespread anterior rapid) pattern, contrasted with a WAIS (widespread slow) pattern associated with high doses of opiates. [...] Anesthetic effects on EEG signals are beginning to be understood at the level of drug actions on different kinds of synapses and the circuits that allow synchronized neuronal activity (see: http://www.stanford.edu/group/maciverlab/).|$|E
2500|$|The other known causative {{gene for}} MH is CACNA1S, which encodes an L-type {{voltage-gated}} calcium channel α-subunit. There are two known mutations in this protein, both affecting the same residue, R1086. This residue {{is located in}} the large intracellular loop connecting domains 3 and 4, a domain possibly involved in negatively regulating RYR1 activity. When these mutant channels are expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) [...] cells, the resulting channels are five times more sensitive to activation by caffeine (and presumably <b>halothane)</b> and activate at 5–10mV more hyperpolarized. Furthermore, cells expressing these channels have an increased basal cytosolic [...] concentration. As these channels interact with and activate RYR1, these alterations result in a drastic increase of intracellular , and, thereby, muscle excitability.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{candidates}} for testing are {{those with a}} close relative who has suffered an episode of MH or {{has been shown to}} be susceptible. The standard procedure is the [...] "caffeine-halothane contracture test", CHCT. A muscle biopsy is carried out at an approved research center, under local anesthesia. The fresh biopsy is bathed in solutions containing caffeine or <b>halothane</b> and observed for contraction; under good conditions, the sensitivity is 97% and the specificity 78%. Negative biopsies are not definitive, so any patient who is suspected of MH by their medical history or that of blood relatives is generally treated with non-triggering anesthetics, even if the biopsy was negative. Some researchers advocate the use of the [...] "calcium-induced calcium release" [...] test in addition to the CHCT to make the test more specific.|$|E
2500|$|When inhaled, {{trichloroethylene}} produces {{central nervous}} system depression resulting in general anesthesia. Its high blood solubility results in a less desirable slower induction of anesthesia. At low concentrations it is relatively non-irritating to the respiratory tract. [...] Higher concentrations result in tachypnea. [...] Many types of cardiac arrhythmias can occur and are exacerbated by epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing systems (soda lime) to produce dichloroacetylene and phosgene. Cranial nerve dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO2 absorbing systems. [...] These nerve deficits could last for months. [...] Occasionally facial numbness was permanent. [...] Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor. [...] For these reasons as well as problems with hepatotoxicity, TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthestics such as <b>halothane</b> by the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, acepromazine, and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and <b>halothane,</b> although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
2500|$|In a large {{proportion}} (50–70%) of cases, the propensity for malignant hyperthermia {{is due to a}} mutation of the ryanodine receptor (type 1), located on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the organelle within skeletal muscle cells that stores calcium. RYR1 opens in response to increases in intracellular [...] level mediated by L-type calcium channels, thereby resulting in a drastic increase in intracellular calcium levels and muscle contraction. RYR1 has two sites believed to be important for reacting to changing [...] concentrations: the A-site and the I-site. The A-site is a high affinity [...] binding site that mediates RYR1 opening. The I-site is a lower affinity site that mediates the protein's closing. Caffeine, <b>halothane,</b> and other triggering agents act by drastically increasing the affinity of the A-site for [...] and concomitantly decreasing the affinity of the I-site in mutant proteins. [...] also affect RYR1 activity, causing the protein to close by acting at either the A- or I-sites. In MH mutant proteins, the affinity for [...] at either one of these sites is greatly reduced. The end result of these alterations is greatly increased [...] release due to a lowered activation and heightened deactivation threshold. The process of sequestering this excess [...] consumes large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main cellular energy carrier, and generates the excessive heat (hyperthermia) that is the hallmark of the disease. The muscle cell is damaged by the depletion of ATP and possibly the high temperatures, and cellular constituents [...] "leak" [...] into the circulation, including potassium, myoglobin, creatine, phosphate and creatine kinase.|$|E
2500|$|Ineos Fluor (the {{site was}} {{previously}} owned by ICI Chemicals) is at Runcorn which produces chlorine and caustic soda from Cheshire salt, piped from Lostock Gralam, south of Northwich; {{most of the}} chlorine in the UK comes from this plant; [...] it also makes hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs) for metered-dose inhalers and the anaesthetic <b>halothane.</b> There is Ineos Chlor and Ineos Vinyls. BNFL and its subsidiary Sellafield Ltd (former British Nuclear Group), and ABB UK are based in Daresbury near Runcorn, although most of BNG's operations take place at Sellafield in Cumbria. Daresbury is also home of the EMMA and ALICE FFAG accelerators. Diageo bottles Guinness at Preston Brook, between the A56 and A533, and nearby Saint-Gobain UK make Isover insulation. Kawneer UK (part of Alcoa) make architectural aluminium systems (curtain walls) off the A533 at Astmoor in north Runcorn. APPH (aircraft undercarriage) is based off the A558 on Manor Park in Sandymoor near TALL Security Print, the UK's leading provider of business cheques; further to the west is Yokogawa Electric UK. Schachihata UK (Xstamper and Artline) are based at Ashville Ind Est on the A557 at junction 12 of the M56 next to the Weaver Navigation and the 3,200ft Weaver Viaduct south of Runcorn towards Sutton Weaver. At the A5080 junction in Widnes, {{on the western side}} of the A557 is a Marley Eternit plant (Eternit roofing), {{and on the other side}} is a plant of Rockwood Additives UK (former Laporte). Croda Enterprise Technology Group does its important R in Halebank, Widnes, south of Ditton. The Thermphos factory on the A557 south of Widnes closed in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|In rare cases, {{repeated}} exposure to <b>halothane</b> in adults was noted {{to result in}} severe liver injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome {{was referred to as}} <b>halothane</b> hepatitis, and is thought to result from the metabolism of <b>halothane</b> to trifluoroacetic acid via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled <b>halothane</b> is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of <b>halothane</b> for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by enflurane and isoflurane. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Since the risk of <b>halothane</b> hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, <b>halothane</b> continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for inhalation induction of anaesthesia [...] However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of <b>halothane</b> in children.|$|E
