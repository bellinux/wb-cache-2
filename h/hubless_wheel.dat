The <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented by Franco Sbarro (who has built a variety of working <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> vehicles, including at least two motorcycles and a car, the 1989 Sbarro Osmos), and patented by Globeholding of Geneva.|$|E

50|$|One {{example of}} <b>hubless</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{those used in}} the Tron: Legacy light cycle. The illuminated, street-legal {{motorcycle}} was sold through Hammacher Schlemmer, inspired by the computer animated cycle from the 2010 film Tron: Legacy. Designed for casual cruising and slow ride-bys at shows, it is made from a steel frame covered by a fiberglass cowling that replicates the sleek look of its computer-generated imagery counterpart. Electroluminescent strips built into the tire cowlings, wheel rims, and body illuminate the cycle. It {{is powered by a}} fuel-injected Suzuki , 4-stroke engine. Riders lie at a near-horizontal position astride the padded leather seat, with feet on foot pegs that control its 6-speed constant-mesh manual transmission and hands on the handlebars for throttle and braking. The <b>hubless</b> <b>wheels</b> are former truck tires built up then custom-shaped to fit onto one of two counter-rotating rims spinning within each other, providing the broad-tired authenticity of the computer cycles from the movie.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>hubless</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{striking}} in appearance, their numerous practical disadvantages have precluded their widespread {{use as an}} alternative to conventional wheels. They are difficult and expensive to manufacture, requiring a great deal of precision machining, and the design leaves the bearings and other mechanical parts largely exposed to the elements. The drive system is especially problematic since a conventional axle and CV joint cannot be used; options include using chain or belt drive. Another solution, developed by Sbarro, is to house the entire propulsion system inside the wheel itself.|$|R

He began with preliminary sketches of wheel designs and found a <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> would allow off-set pivot points for added extension of the arms. Each wheel has a small drive motor like those used in robots that are connected to liner actuators that allow sufficient extension to climb steps.|$|E
50|$|The Bluesmart One {{is their}} core carry-on {{suitcase}} that {{connects to the}} user’s phone to enhance their travel experience. It is a standard carry-on size meaning that it fits within the size restrictions of all major airlines. The smart features include a location tracker that allows its user to see the bag's location anywhere in the world, right from their phone and, this service has no fees or charges. The Bluesmart One’s integrated battery charger can charge devices up to 6 times. Users can control their suitcase lock via the Bluesmart App and if it leaves their side with a distance designated by its user, the bag will automatically lock itself. Both the lock and battery are TSA, DOT and, FAA compliant. The digital scale lets its user check {{the weight of their}} bag right on their phone and avoid any airline overweight fees. The Bluesmart One features an easy-access front compartment that allows quick access to your laptop, tablet, and other electronics using only one hand. The case’s <b>hubless</b> <b>wheels</b> provide a lower center of gravity, resulting in smoother, more accurate movement. Its outer shell is water and scratch-resistant, protecting your electronics from the elements.|$|R

40|$|Shrinking {{line width}} {{geometries}} in IC-devices {{translate into a}} substantial {{increase in the number of}} chips per wafer. However, as a consequence, it also results in a greatly extended cut length during wafer dicing. Since the cutting speed is already quite high, no substantial increase of it may be expected. As a solution, the use of a dual gang wheel is suggested in this paper. Whereas conventional gang wheel dicing requires specially designed machines to support the gang wheel arbor, this new approach allows mounting of a dual dicing wheel on the same pair of flanges designed for single <b>hubless</b> dicing <b>wheel</b> use. Dicing tests showed that the dual gang wheel dicing approach is suitable for achieving the same feed rate as single wheel dicing, as well as obtaining a comparable kerf quality...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} based {{on one of my}} own ideas and {{describes}} the development of a propulsion system for a conceptual motorcycle. The main idea is to mount the drivetrain within a <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> and thus fully integrate these two together. The project began with a comprehensive collection of information. This collection mainly focused on an investigation of the traditional automotive drivetrain, tracing different transmission input elements and an investigation of their relative functions. Two visits to the Air Force Museum in Linköping were performed, where the primarily aim was to study different radial engine's physical dimensions. The work with the <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> and the work with the drivetrain were separated in order to facilitate the development of the whole work. Therefore two main problem determinations and one divided specification of conditions were established {{as the basis for the}} construction sub-functions. After the reduction of different design solutions concerning the sub-functions, which mainly were carried out through logical reasoning and discussions, two rather similar proposals of solutions remained as a base for further development of the project. The final drivetrain was based on an Australian radial engine from Rotec Engineering, Rotec R 3600, which was combined with a hybrid module from the German manufacturer ZF Sachs. This combination reduces the need for a torque converter in the driveline. During start-up the driveline will instead use the the electrical motors high torque at low speeds, which reaches about 770 Nm in this case, and then switch to the combustion engine at higher speeds. The included hybrid technology reduces fuel consumption by almost 15 % and also provides the ability to convert braking energy into electrical energy to recharge the batteries. The hybrid technology also offers the ability to connect the electric motor to the drivetrain as an extra "boost" when there is a need for faster acceleration at higher speeds. The work with the <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> resulted in the development of nine separate shafts mounted on the outside of the fixed inner rim. Four radial and two axial bearings were mounted to each shaft. This makes it possible for the outer rim, the tire and the disc brake to rotate freely outside the inner rim. The bearings were selected and dimensioned through a self-developed model concerning possible loads and stresses. Finally the drivetrain was concentric and vibration damped mounted inside the hubless wheels inner rim via a self-developed engine suspension. The impulsion is transferred from the drivetrain to the outer-rim by the spoke system. This system was also designed to reduce vibrations from spreading from the engine to the rest of the construction. The final construction was integrated and visualized as a conceptual motorcycle by Erik Evers, a former student at Luleå University of Technology. The following further development of the project is proposed: Complete the rear wheel mounting to the motorcycle. Determine the final axial center of gravity of the driveline when mounted in the rear wheel. Further develop the engine mount to encompass eight attachment points distributed over two different planes in the inner rim. Develop of one or more drive shafts interconnecting the driveline components. Examine the possibility of transition to fuel injection and digital ignition for better engine operation. Complete the seal between the two rims in the <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> for increased resistance to dirt and moisture. Validerat; 20121028 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|The task {{given to}} us was to develop an {{industrial}} wheel with new {{thinking in terms of}} fresh design and construction, with the ability to brake. While the produced wheels of today only own the property of total braking, a wish was made to integrate the ability of directional locking. The time spent working with the project has been filled with multiple sketches of ideas and function analysis. Choices of material and ways of construction have been verified by calculations, tests and prototype building. The goal of this thesis has been to develop a unique caster with well thought-out design that would be adaptable to different areas of applications. The result was a <b>hubless</b> <b>wheel</b> with the ability of directional locking before total braking. A prototype of the wheel has been made to show the design and functions...|$|E
