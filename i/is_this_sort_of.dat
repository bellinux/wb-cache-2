2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship. The two {{were referred to}} as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, [...] and the pairing's popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau [...] "Bennifer" [...] (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> bleed-over from the tabloids across your movie work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody. I ended up in an unfortunate crosshair position where I was in a relationship and [...] mostly lied and inflated a bunch of salacious stuff for the sake of selling magazines. And I paid a certain price for that. Then, in concert with some movies that didn’t work...|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing {{which makes the}} stay-at-home cultivated chalk- fishing as much harder work than mountain angling, as a gallop over a stiffly enclosed country is harder than one over an open moor. You can do it or not, as you like: but {{if you wish to}} catch large trout on a bright day, I should advise you to employ the only method yet discovered.|$|E

2500|$|By 2001, Michael Logan of TV Guide remarked of Passions, [...] "There hasn't <b>been</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{buzz about}} a soap since the Luke and Laura days on General Hospital...It's unlike {{anything}} else out there. There's {{a real sense}} of hipness to it." ...|$|R
2500|$|For this reason, Pasternak {{regularly}} avoided literary cafes {{where young}} poets regularly {{invited them to}} read their verse.

60|$|In spite, however, of a {{difficulty}} in distinguishing the {{two forms of}} memory in practice, {{there can be no}} doubt that both forms exist. I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning, and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> occurrence that constitutes the essence of memory Until we have analysed what happens in such a case as this, we have not succeeded in understanding memory.|$|E
6000|$|Dinah {{had been}} {{speaking}} {{at least an}} hour, and the reddening light of the parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words. The stranger, who had been interested {{in the course of}} her sermon {{as if it had been}} the development of a drama--for there <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> fascination in all sincere unpremeditated eloquence, which opens to one the inward drama of the speaker's emotions--now turned his horse aside and pursued his way, while Dinah said, [...] "Let us sing a little, dear friends"; and as he was still winding down the slope, the voices of the Methodists reached him, rising and falling in that strange blending of exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny {{was just}} {{then in the}} mood to feel the beauty of this, for the sincerest emotion she had ever known was {{beginning}} to make her dissatisfied with herself, and the aimless life she led. [...] "Men must respect such girls as these," [...] she thought; [...] "yes, and love them too, for in spite of their independence, they are womanly. I wish I had a talent to live for, if it would do as much for me as it does for them. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing that is improving Polly, that makes her society interesting to Sydney, and herself so dear to every one. Money can't buy these things for me, and I want them very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw them}} kill that chap. I saw that flying-machine man hit the funnels {{of the big}} ironclad. I saw that dead chap in the passage. I seen too much smashing and killing lately. That's the matter. I don't like it. I didn't know war <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. I'm a civilian. I don't like it." ...|$|R

60|$|But I {{should do}} little to {{investigate}} this question; these are presented as quite incidental impressions. You must suppose {{that for the most}} part our walks and observations keep us within the more urban quarters of Lucerne. From a number of beautifully printed placards at the street corners, adorned with caricatures of considerable pungency, we discover an odd little election is in progress. This is the selection, upon strictly democratic lines, with a suffrage that includes every permanent resident in the Lucerne ward over the age of fifteen, of the ugliest local building. The old little urban and local governing bodies, we find, have long since been superseded by great provincial municipalities for all the more serious administrative purposes, but they still survive to discharge a number of curious minor functions, and not the least among these <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> aesthetic ostracism. Every year every minor local governing body pulls down a building selected by local plebiscite, and the greater Government pays a slight compensation to the owner, and resumes possession of the land it occupies. The idea would strike us at first as simply whimsical, but in practice it appears to work as a cheap and practical device for the aesthetic education of builders, engineers, business men, opulent persons, and the general body of the public. But when we come to consider its application to our own world we should perceive it was the most Utopian thing we had so far encountered.|$|E
6000|$|To {{hear people}} talk about the great Chancellor--and a very great man he {{certainly}} was,--you would think that it was he who had invented science, {{and that there was no}} such thing as sound reasoning before the time of Queen Elizabeth! Of course you say, that cannot possibly be true; you perceive, on a moment's reflection, that such an idea is absurdly wrong, and yet, so firmly rooted <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> impression,--I cannot call it an idea, or conception,--the thing is too absurd to be entertained,--but so completely does it exist at the bottom of most men's minds, that this has been a matter of observation with me for many years past. There are many men who, though knowing absolutely nothing of the subject with which they may be dealing, wish, nevertheless, to damage the author of some view with which they think fit to disagree. What they do, then, is not to go and learn something about the subject, which one would naturally think the best way of fairly dealing with it; but they abuse the originator of the view they question, in a general manner, and wind up by saying that, [...] "After all, you know, the principles and method of this author are totally opposed to the canons of the Baconian philosophy." [...] Then everybody applauds, as a matter of course, and agrees that it must be so. But if you were to stop them all in the middle of their applause, you would probably find that neither the speaker nor his applauders could tell you how or in what way it was so; neither the one nor the other having the slightest idea of what they mean when they speak of the [...] "Baconian philosophy." ...|$|E
6000|$|In truth {{everything}} I saw told me {{that there}} was a large misunderstanding everywhere; a misunderstanding amounting to a mess. And as this was the last impression that London left on me, so it was the impression I carried with me about the whole modern problem of Western civilisation, as a riddle to be read or a knot to be untied. To untie it it is necessary to get hold of the right end of it, and especially the other end of it. We must begin at the beginning; we must return to our first origins in history, as we must return to our first principles in philosophy. We must consider how we came to be doing what we do, and even saying what we say. As it is, the very terms we use are either meaningless or something more than meaningless, inconsistent even with themselves. This applies, for instance, to the talk of both sides in that Labour controversy, which I merely took in passing, because it was the current controversy in London when I left. The Capitalists say Bolshevism as one might say Boojum. It is merely a mystical and imaginative word suggesting horror. But it might mean many things; including some just and rational things. On the other hand, there could never be any meaning at all in the phrase [...] "the dictatorship of the proletariat." [...] It is like saying, [...] "the omnipotence of omnibus-conductors." [...] It is fairly obvious that if an omnibus-conductor were omnipotent, he would probably prefer to conduct something else besides an omnibus. Whatever its exponents mean, it is clearly something different from what they say; and even this verbal inconsistency, this mere welter of words, is a sign of the common confusion of thought. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing that made London seem like a limbo of lost words, and possibly of lost wits. And it is here we find the value of what I have called walking backwards through history.|$|E
5000|$|Of course I {{recognized}} {{myself in}} the roles Allen wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> novice who had lots of feelings but didnt know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and Im glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.|$|R
6000|$|... "I swear Stalky {{is a great}} man," [...] said Beetle after a long pause. [...] "One {{consolation}} <b>is</b> that <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> secret-society biznai {{will drive}} King wild." ...|$|R

6000|$|A modern Utopian most assuredly {{must have}} a {{practically}} unqualified property in {{all those things that}} become, as it were, by possession, extensions and expressions of his personality; his clothing, his jewels, the tools of his employment, his books, the objects of art he may have bought or made, his personal weapons (if Utopia have need of such things), insignia, and so forth. All such things that he has bought with his money or acquired--provided he is not a professional or habitual dealer in such property--will be inalienably his, his to give or lend or keep, free even from taxation. So intimate <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> property that I have no doubt Utopia will give a man posthumous rights over it--will permit him to assign it to a successor with at the utmost the payment of a small redemption. A horse, perhaps, in certain districts, or a bicycle, or any such mechanical conveyance personally used, the Utopians might find it well to rank with these possessions. No doubt, too, a house and privacy owned and occupied by a man, and even a man's own household furniture, might be held to stand as high or almost as high in the property scale, might be taxed as lightly and transferred under only a slightly heavier redemption, provided he had not let these things on hire, or otherwise alienated them from his intimate self. A thorough-going, Democratic Socialist will no doubt be inclined at first to object that if the Utopians make these things a specially free sort of property in this way, men would spend much more upon them than they would otherwise do, but indeed that will be an excellent thing. We are too much affected by the needy atmosphere of our own mismanaged world. In Utopia no one will have to hunger because some love to make and have made and own and cherish beautiful things. To give this much of property to individuals will tend to make clothing, ornamentation, implements, books, and all the arts finer and more beautiful, because by buying such things a man will secure something inalienable--save in the case of bankruptcy--for himself and for those who belong to him. Moreover, a man may in his lifetime set aside sums to ensure special advantages of education and care for the immature children of himself and others, and in this manner also exercise a posthumous right. [Footnote: But a Statute of Mortmain will set a distinct time limit to the continuance of such benefactions. A periodic revision of endowments is a necessary feature in any modern Utopia.] ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{scattering}} problems, it {{is desirable}} to determine an unknown scattered field [...] that {{is due to a}} known incident field [...] Unfortunately, the EFIE relates the scattered field to J, not the incident field, so {{we do not know what}} J <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> problem can be solved by imposing the boundary conditions on the incident and scattered field, allowing one to write the EFIE in terms of [...] and J alone. Once this has been done, the integral equation can then be solved by a numerical technique appropriate to integral equations such as the method of moments.|$|E

5000|$|It came {{to light}} quite late in his Llanelli Scarlets career that Davies was quite a {{remarkable}} goal kicker. During and ever since the 2003 season Davies would attempt kicks at goal from long distances. His greatest kick was against Ulster in the Magners League at Ravenhill from an estimated distance of 59 metres. Though he did not perform these kicks often, it <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> play on the pitch that earned him the nickname 'Barry the boot' from one commentator during the EDF Energy, then Powergen Cup semi final against Bath.|$|R
5000|$|A novella and {{collection}} of short stories entitled Celebrities in Disgrace was published in 2001. It was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize. When discussing one of the themes of this collection during an interview with Post Road Magazine, Searle said, [...] "I had a phrase in my mind, 'the witch of ambition,' and I do think there <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dark force inside of people and any of those dark forces are hard to write about but they're the ones you want to write about...."

5000|$|The {{magazine}} took to minimalising {{the economic}} {{importance of the}} Commonwealth in its editorials, calling into question the interpretation of statistical data by those who had an emotional investment in the self-image of the UK as one-time head of an Empire: Why <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> clamor set up whenever any new hope of entering the EEC dawns? The truth {{is that there are}} some people in Britain who are bitterly opposed to union with Europe on emotional grounds, or on the grounds of what they call the [...] "bureaucratic monster" [...] at Brussels and in that it interferes with Britons independence to run their own affairs. Such people {{are to be found in}} the economics profession, politics, and the civil service; and this quite clearly does affect their sense of statistical balance.

5000|$|Christine Amor said of {{the series}} that [...] "Are You Being Served? {{is one of the}} few TV comedies we are making in Australia and that's sad. In the days of My Name's McGooley, What's Yours? we had real Australian humour. But we have been very much {{influenced}} by overseas countries. Are You Being Served? is popular because people identify with a department store. It has no Australian idioms and it is a take off of the English series, but there <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> colonial thing where people enjoy English humour. I've always enjoyed it. I like English comedies, I think they're far superior to American comedies." [...] It was Amor's first acting job before a live television audience. [...] "I look at John Inman because he's been doing TV comedy for 10 years and been a comedian for 25 years. He's got it down to a fine art. But it is an accomplished skill which you keep on learning. I've learned a lot from John. The basic hint he gave me was to enjoy it and to have a rapport with the audience." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{she left}} the show, Rebeck, who, citing {{confidentiality}} requirements, {{did not respond to}} the BuzzFeed story at first other than to say she [...] "was treated quite badly", spoke at some length to The New York Observer about Smash: One of the points of contention last year was that the network thinks {{they have the right to}} say to the writer of the show, [...] "We dont want her to do this. We want her to do this ... And I would sometimes say back to them, [...] "She would never do that." [...] And theyd look at me like I was crazy, and Id be like, [...] "Nope, its not crazy, its just who the character is." [...] You have to respect who the character is. It has its own internal truth and you cant betray that. And if you dont betray that, it will not betray you. There <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sense that if you dont fuck with the muse—if you dont fuck with the muse, the muse will stand by you ... It turns into bigger questions about power and art, power and storytelling. Is power itself bigger than storytelling? And I would say no.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue that though the Communicative Approach to Language&# 13; {{teaching}} in its original sense has long been theoretically dead, it has for an almost equally long time at least potentially existed in a new form, and continues to thrive. By no means here for the first time <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> proposal made, but what remains to be done is to firmly pronounce the death of 'Communicative Approach to Language Teaching Mark II' and to formally welcome, if somewhat belatedly, that is to say, by at least 17 years, its successor: 'Communicative Approach to Language Teaching Mark II'. At the same time, the attempt to disambiguate 'Communicative Approach to Language Teaching' from 'Communicative Methodology' is made again, because students of Applied Linguistics often reveal a complete failure to grasp the difference, as well as failure to understand why the term 'Cornrnunicative Method' is meaningless. The story related here will be very familiar to some, but less so to others, which is why it is detailed. It is, of course, only one story, one interpretation, and there are others...|$|E
