40|$|There is {{currently}} {{no consensus on}} the best treatment for unresectable hyaline-vascular variant or for multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD), because none of the reported regimens have consistently produced complete response or durable remission {{in the majority of}} patients. in the present study, we report on the use of 2 -CdA (2 -chloro-deoxyadenosine) in three patients, two of them with MCD and one with unresectable hyaline-vascular type disease. Relapse-free survival of the responding patients was 24 and 20 months. Later, both patients evolved to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (diffuse large B- cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell NHL, respectively). 2 -CdA typically causes a long-lasting state of immunodeficiency and the profound influence of this drug on the immune system has raised questions concerning the emergence of secondary neoplasms after its use. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that: 1) 2 -CdA can induce durable complete remission in MCD patients but unfortunately it cannot cure the disease; 2) the possibility that 2 -CdA may accelerate the transformation of MCD to NHL cannot be ruled out.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effectiveness of two methods of arm skin disinfection used in blood donors at a <b>Hemotherapy</b> Center in Brazil that represents an important centre for distributing haemocomponents to many cities in the country. Methods: Two skin disinfection techniques in 50 blood donors were evaluated. For the first arm, 10 % povidone-iodine/two-stage technique was used. On the opposite arm, 0. 5 % chlorhexidine digluconate alcohol solution/one-stage technique was used. The swabs were seeded on three culture media: blood agar, mannitol salt agar and Mac Conkey agar. Automated bacterial classification based on biochemical tests/specific substrates was performed. Donor characteristics were collected using the computerised system of the <b>Hemotherapy</b> Center. Results: We found that microbial reduction was significantly higher for 10 % povidone-iodine technique (98. 57 - 98. 87 %) when compared with 0. 5 % chlorhexidine technique (94. 38 - 95. 06 %). The species Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Staphylococcus hominis showed resistance to both disinfection techniques. We did not find statistically significant relationships between donor characteristics and microbial reduction. Conclusions: Arm skin disinfection with 10 % povidone-iodine produced better antimicrobial activity. We must acknowledge that 10 % povidone-iodine technique has the limitation of being a two-stage method. However, prevention of adverse events due to bacterial contamination and transfusion reactions should be prioritised.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between professional categories working in transfusion services of the public blood bank network in the State of Minas Gerais and their performance in proficiency tests. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study (2007 - 2008) performed using a specific instrument, based on evidence and the results of immunohematology proficiency tests as mandated by law. RESULTS: The error rates in ABO and RhD phenotyping, irregular antibody screening and cross-matching were 12. 5 %, 9. 6 %, 43. 8 % and 20. 1 %, respectively. When considering the number of tests performed, the error rates were 4. 6 %, 4. 2 %, 26. 7 % and 11. 0 %, respectively. The error rates varied for different professional categories: biochemists, biologists and biomedical scientists (65. 0 %), clinical pathology technicians (44. 1 %) and laboratory assistants, nursing technicians and assistant nurses (74. 6 %). A statistically significant difference was observed when the accuracy of clinical pathology technicians was compared with those of other professionals with only high school education (p-value < 0. 001).

Materials and Methods Two prospective cohorts of neonates with gestational age < 37 weeks and birth weight < 1500 g were studied. Neonates born in Period 1 were submitted to a strict guideline for erythrocyte transfusions. in Period 2, a new stricter protocol was introduced. Infants of both periods were compared regarding number of transfusions and clinical outcome. Results the median number of transfusions decreased from 2 (1 to 14) in Period 1 to 1 (1 - 9), P = 0. 001, in Period 2. the linear regression multivariate analysis showed that the implementation of the stricter guideline was associated with a reduction in the number of transfusions received by patients by 0. 55 (95 % confidence interval: - 0. 08; - 1. 02) units/patients. Number of apnea episodes, weight at 28 days of life and days of hospital stay were similar in both periods. Intra-hospital death was lower in Period 2.

The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize bone marrow donors according to gender, age, ethnicity and HLA groups at a regional <b>hemotherapy</b> center in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING:Descriptive study on registered donors at a regional <b>hemotherapy</b> center in a public university hospital in the southeastern region of Brazil. METHODS: The records of 66, 780 donors who were registered between 2005 and June 2011 were consulted, and the variables studied were tabulated. RESULTS:There were equal numbers of male and female donors and 82. 8 % of them were under 45 years of age. In terms of ethnicity, 77. 3 % declared themselves to be white, 15. 0 % mixed race, 5. 7 % black and 2 % others. In terms of immunogenetic characterization, the most frequent HLA-A allelic group was HLA-A* 02, with 39. 20 % of the donors; in the HLA-B allelic group, the most common was HLA-B* 35, with 14. 18 %; while in the HLA-DRB 1 allelic group, the most frequent was HLA-DRB 1 * 03, with 17. 03 %.

Ao final o autor apresenta uma reflexão sobre o futuro da RBHH e os caminhos que o periódico deve trilhar com a finalidade de aumentar a sua importância no meio científico. The Brazilian Hematology and <b>Hemotherapy</b> Journal (Revista Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia) {{was included in}} the data base of Scientific Electronic library on-line (SciELO) in October of 2001. This achievement encourages a historic registration of the means by which the performance of the Brazilian Hematology and <b>Hemotherapy</b> Society, which began in 1973, has been divulged. Until 1984, the Boletim was the instrument of notification of the work of the society which soon became a scientific journal. In 1999, the title was changed and the journal was modernized. At this time it also became the official publication of the Brazilian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation. To better understand the importance of this victory, a historic review of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), the main international data base and SciELO, the national data base was assembled. Finally the author reflects {{on the future of the}} Journal and the paths that it should follow with the objective of increasing the periodicals importance in the scientific world...|$|E
40|$|Objective: A {{retrospective}} {{cohort study}} was preformed aiming {{to verify the}} presence of transient dysfunction of gas exchange in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery and determine if this disorder is linked to cardiorespiratory events. Methods: We included 942 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery and cardiac procedures who were referred to the Intensive Care Unit between June 2007 and November 2011. Results: Fifteen patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 %), 199 (27. 75 %) had mild transient dysfunction of gas exchange, 402 (56. 1 %) had moderate transient dysfunction of gas exchange, and 39 (5. 4 %) had severe transient dysfunction of gas exchange. Hypertension and cardiogenic shock {{were associated with the}} emergence of moderate transient dysfunction of gas exchange postoperatively (P= 0. 02 and P= 0. 019, respectively) and were risk factors for this dysfunction (P= 0. 0023 and P= 0. 0017, respectively). Diabetes mellitus was also a risk factor for transient dysfunction of gas exchange (P= 0. 03). Pneumonia was present in 8. 9 % of cases and correlated with the presence of moderate transient dysfunction of gas exchange (P= 0. 001). Severe transient dysfunction of gas exchange was associated with patients who had renal replacement therapy (P= 0. 0005), <b>hemotherapy</b> (P= 0. 0001), enteral nutrition (P= 0. 0012), or cardiac arrhythmia (P= 0. 0451). Conclusion: Preoperative hypertension and cardiogenic shock were associated with the occurrence of postoperative transient dysfunction of gas exchange. The preoperative risk factors included hypertension, cardiogenic shock, and diabetes. Postoperatively, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, renal replacement therapy, <b>hemotherapy,</b> and cardiac arrhythmia were associated with the appearance of some degree of transient dysfunction of gas exchange, which was a risk factor for reintubation, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and renal replacement therapy in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery and cardiac procedures...|$|E
40|$|Myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS) is a clonal hematopoietic {{stem cell}} disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and risk for evolving to acute leukemia. Some molecular abnormalities related to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation have been reported, such as FLT 3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) mutations. FLT 3, {{a member of the}} class 3 receptor tyrosine kinase family, mediates stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and its mutations, internal tandem duplication (ITD) and Asp 835, have been reported in rare MDS patients. We studied FLT 3 ITD, prospectively, in 50 MDS patients at diagnosis, at 6 and 12 months follow-up, and at any other time-point if AML transformation was detected. FLT 3 ITD was not observed at diagnosis, but during follow-up the mutation was present in 2 of 50 patients (4 %). of these, one case exhibited FLT 3 ITD {{at the end of the}} 6 months of follow-up in similar to 8 % of bone marrow cells; this case evolved into AML at 8 months, at which time FLT 3 ITD was present in similar to 85 % of bone marrow cells. the other case exhibited FLT 3 ITD in 68 % of bone marrow cells at 7 months, precisely at the time of AML transformation. Although rare in MDS, FLT 3 ITD is associated with a high probability of evolution to AML. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Methylation of p 16 gene is a {{relatively}} frequent molecular finding in multiple myeloma (MM), but its clinical implication is disputable. Cell cycle regulators are now recognized as active in the control of angiogenesis, which is an integral component of pathogenesis and a target for new treatment modalities of this disease. On such background, we focused on determining whether loss of p 16 function by methylation could be associated with increased angiogenesis and VEGF expression, and the prognostic relevance of p 16 methylation in 50 untreated, newly diagnosed MM patients. Thirty-one percent (13 / 42) of 42 patients assessable for p 16 gene methylation showed to be methylation-positive. High-angiogenesis was present in 73 % of cases, but methylation of the p 16 gene did not associate with angiogenesis or with VEGF expression. Also, p 16 methylation did not show prognostic relevance or correlation with the clinical and laboratory parameters of prognostic significance in univariate analysis. PI 6 immunoexpression presented only a faint agreement with the molecular study. Therefore, p 16 methylation {{seems to have no}} correlation with angiogenesis and VEGF expression, neither with overall and event-free survival in MM patients. Besides, P 16 immunohistochemistry seems inadequate to substitute the molecular study of methylation in this type of tumor cells. Additional studies are needed to clarify the correspondence between the epigenetic alteration of the p 16 gene and its protein immunexpression, and the clinical relevance of p 16 methylation in MM patients.

40|$|Background. A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to determine whether conditioning using selective targeting of hematopoietic cells with an alpha-particle emitter, bismuth- 213 (Bi- 213) -labeled anti-CD 45 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is sufficient to overcome the major histocompatibility barrier in a canine model of dog leukocyte antigen-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Methods. Six dogs were administered 0. 5 mg/kg Bi- 213 -labeled anti-CD 45 mAb (dose Bi- 213 = 2. 26 - 4. 9 mCi/kg) in six to eight injections. for postgrafting immunosuppression, all dogs received cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Results. All dogs had initial donor engraftment, with three of six dogs having sustained engraftment to last point of follow-up. Two dogs receiving 2. 26 and 3. 25 mCi/kg of Bi- 213 rejected their grafts at day + 127 and + 125, respectively, whereas dogs receiving Bi- 213 doses of 3. 3 mCi/kg or greater achieved high level donor chimerism. Conclusion. the results suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning with Bi- 213 -labeled anti-CD 45 mAb could be applicable to major histocompatibility haploidentical HCT without excessive nonhematologic regimen-related toxicity.
