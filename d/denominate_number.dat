5000|$|A {{concrete}} number {{is a number}} associated with the things being counted, in contrast to an abstract number which is a number as a single entity. For example, [...] "five apples" [...] and [...] "half of a pie" [...] are {{concrete number}}s, while [...] "five" [...] and [...] "one half" [...] are abstract numbers. In mathematics the term [...] "number" [...] is usually taken to mean an abstract number. A <b>denominate</b> <b>number</b> {{is a type of}} concrete number with a unit of measure attached with it. For example, 5 inches is a <b>denominate</b> <b>number</b> because it has the unit inches after it.|$|E
50|$|Section V was on duodecimals, {{working with}} {{fractions}} {{in which the}} only denominators were twelfths. These types of problems continue in textbooks and appear in the 1870 edition of White's Complete Arithmetic in the appendix. The definition states: A Duodecimal is a <b>denominate</b> <b>number</b> in which twelve units of any denomination make {{a unit of the}} next higher denomination. Duodecimals are used by artificers in measuring surfaces and solids.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Denominate numbers== Denominate {{numbers are}} further {{classified}} as either simple, meaning a single unit is given, or compound, meaning multiple units are given. For example, 6 kg {{is a simple}} denominant number, while 324 yards 1 foot 8 inches is a compound <b>denominate</b> <b>number.</b> The process of converting a denominate numbers to an equivalent form that uses a different unit is called reduction. More specifically, reduction to a lower or higher unit of measurement is called reduction to lower or higher denominations. Reduction to a lower denomination is accomplished by multiplying {{by the number of}} lower units contained in each higher unit. In the case of a compound denominant number, the products are then added together. For example, 1 hour 23 minutes 20 seconds is 1 h × 3600 s/h + 23 min × 60 s/min + 20 s = 5000 seconds. Similarly, a division is used to reduce to a higher denomination, and remainders {{can be applied to the}} next highest unit to form compound denominant numbers. Addition and subtraction of compound numbers can be performed by grouping the amounts associated with each unit and performing the necessary carry and borrow operations. Multiplication and division by a pure number are again similar.|$|E

50|$|The Sakalava <b>denominate</b> a <b>number</b> {{of smaller}} ethnic groups that once {{comprised}} an empire, {{rather than an}} ethnic group in its own right. The origin of the word Sakalava itself is still subject to controversy, {{as well as its}} actual meaning. The most common explanation is the modern Malagasy translation of Sakalava meaning long ravines, denoting the relatively flat nature of the land in western Madagascar. Another theory is that the word is possibly from the Arabic saqaliba, which is in turn derived from Late Latin sclavus, meaning slave.|$|R

5000|$|The mun was {{introduced}} {{as the main}} currency of Korea in 1633 and stayed in use until 1892.

Coins denominated in mun were cast in copper or bronze and were round with square holes. From the 17th century {{until the end of the}} 19th century, coins denominated in mun bearing the inscription Sangpyeong Tongbo ( [...] , [...] ) were the most widely circulated currency. In 1888, coins were struck in small <b>numbers</b> <b>denominated</b> in mun and won (equal to 1000 mun). The mun was replaced in 1892 when the yang {{was introduced}}.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a roof is its {{vertical}} rise divided by its horizontal span (or [...] "run"), {{what is called}} [...] "slope" [...] in geometry and stair construction, or the tangent function in trigonometry.

In the USA, the run is <b>denominated</b> by the <b>number</b> 12, giving a ratio of how many inches of rise or fall there are to each 12 inches (one foot) of run. For example, 3:12, 4:12, 5:12, and so on. Countries which use metric measurement systems use a degree angle, or what fall there is per unit of run, and expressed as a [...] "1 in x" [...] slope, a 1 in 1 slope being 45°.

2500|$|A {{landmark}} {{year for}} Jim Marshall was 1987. It marked 25 {{years in the}} amplifier business and 50 years in music. This was celebrated {{with the release of}} the Silver Jubilee series of amps. The Silver Jubilee series consisted of the 2555 (100 watt head), 2550 (50 watt head) along with other 255x model <b>numbers</b> <b>denominating</b> various combos and even a [...] "short head". The Jubilee amps were heavily based on the JCM800s of the time, featuring a very similar output section along with a new preamp. Their most publicised feature was the half-power switching, which is activated by a third rocker switch next to the standard [...] "power" [...] and [...] "standby" [...] switches. On the 50-watt model this was reflected in the numbering – 2550 is switchable from 25 to 50 watts – and also reflected Marshall amps' 25th anniversary and Jim Marshall's 50 years in music. The amps were trimmed in silver covering, and had a bright silver-coloured faceplate, along with a commemorative plaque.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} to the Stroop Color-Word Test (SCWT), <b>denominated</b> the Colored <b>Numbers</b> Test (CNT), was developed to evaluate the selective attention of illiterate individuals. A total of 30 volunteers with basic education (control group) and 30 illiterate volunteers (experimental group) performed the SCWT and the CNT. Volunteers had to name {{the color of the}} rectangles in the CNT neutral condition, and in the critical condition they had to either name the color of the numbers or, when the numbers were black, read the numbers. An interference index (II) was calculated for both tests by subtracting the time taken to complete the task in the neutral condition from the time taken to complete the task in the critical condition. The control group showed an II of 14. 9 s in the SCWT and of 19. 1 s in the CNT, and the experimental group, which practically presented no interference in the SCWT (II = 0. 2 s), showed an II of 18. 7 s in the CNT. These findings suggest that the CNT can he used to evaluate selective attention. Further work should confirm its validity. Its advantage over the SCWT {{is that it does not}} depend on the ability to read words, being then suitable for illiterate individuals...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the result}} of my research work at the SMACS research group (Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University) and it concerns the analysis of queueing models with batch service. A queueing model basically is a mathematical abstraction of a situation where customers arrive and queue up until they receive some kind of service. These phenomena are omnipresent in real life: people waiting at a counter of a post office or bank, people in the waiting room of a doctor, airplanes waiting to take off, people waiting until they get connected with the call center, data packets which are temporarily stored into a buffer until the transmisssion channel is available, et cetera. The analysis of queueing models constitutes the subject of the applied mathematical discipline called queueing theory and amounts to answering questions such as “How many customers are waiting on average?”, “How long do customers have to wait?”, “Is there a large variation on the waiting time?”, “What is the probability that data packets are lost due to a full buffer?”, “What is the probability that a customer suffers a lengthy delay?”, et cetera. In queueing theory, the number of customers and their waiting time are often denominated by respectively buffer content and customer delay. In addition, the probability that a quantity, such as the buffer content or customer delay, is very large or lengthy, is generally called a tail probability. The models we investigate throughout this dissertation have in common that customers can be served in batches, meaning that several customers can be served simultaneously. An elevator {{can be viewed as a}} classic example, as several people can be transported simultaneously to another floor. Also, in a variety of production or transport processes several goods can be processed together. Furthermore, in quality control, classification of items as good or bad can often be achieved more economically by examining the items in groups rather than individually. If the result of a group test is good, all items within it can then be classified as good, whereas one or more items are bad in the opposite case, where the items can then be retested by considering smaller groups. Group testing is especially of importance when the percentage of bad items is small. In addition, in telecommunications networks, packets with the same destination and quality of service (QoS) requirements are often aggregated into so-called bursts and these bursts are transmitted over the network. This is mainly done for efficiency reasons, since only one header per aggregated burst has to be constructed, instead of one header per single information unit, thus leading to an increased throughput. Technologies using packet aggregation include for instance Optical burst switched (OBS) networks and IEEE 802. 11 n wireless local area networks (WLANs). An inherent aspect of batch service is that newly arriving customers cannot join the ongoing service, even if there is free capacity (we <b>denominate</b> the maximum <b>number</b> of customers that can be served simultaneously by server capacity). For instance, an arriving person cannot enter an elevator that has just left, even if space is available. This person has to wait until the elevator has transported its occupants to their requested floors and has returned, which might take a long time in high buildings. In view of this, it is of importance to take a well-considered decision when the server becomes available and finds less customers than it can serve in theory. This decision is called the service policy. A whole spectrum of service policies exist. The server could, for instance, start serving the already present customers immediately. Although the present customers benefit from this approach, capacity is wasted: customers that arrive later cannot join the ongoing service. An alternative for this so-called immediate-batch service policy is the full-batch service policy. In this case, the available server postpones service until the number of present customers reaches or exceeds the server capacity, which, in turn, has a negative effect on the delay of the customers waiting to form a full batch (postponing delay). The threshold-based policy is a kind of compromise between immediate-batch service policy and full-batch service policy. When the number of present customers is below some service threshold, service is postponed, whereas service is initiated when the number of present customers reaches or exceeds this threshold. It is important to realize that even with this compromise, long postponing delays are possible. Therefore, in this dissertation, we combine a thresholdbased policy with a timer mechanism that avoids excessive postponing delays. The purpose of this dissertation is to calculate a large spectrum of performance measures, which enable to evaluate a broad set of situations with batch service and aid in selecting an efficient service policy. The studied performance measures are moments, such as the mean value and variance, and tail probabilities of the buffer content and the customer delay. This dissertation is structured as follows. In chapter 1, we motivate our work and we introduce crucial concepts such as probability generating functions (PGFs), whose useful properties are frequently relied upon throughout the analysis. Then we deduce moments and tail probabilities of the buffer content in chapter 2. The resulting formulas still contain unknown probabilities that have to be calculated numerically. As this might become unfeasible in some cases, we compute in chapter 3 approximations for the buffer content. Next, moments and tail probabilities of the customer delay are covered in respectively chapters 4 and 5. In order to analyze the moments, we conceive the customer delay as the sum of two non-overlapping parts, whereas for the tail probabilities, it turns out to be more convenient to interpret the delay as the maximum of two time periods. Further, in real life the customer arrival process often exhibits some kind of dependency. For instance, if a large amount of customers have recently arrived, it is likely that many customers arrive in the near future, as it might be an indication of a peak moment. Therefore, we investigate in chapter 6 the influence of dependency in the arrival process on the behaviour of batch-service phenomena and on the selection of an efficient service policy. Finally, the main contributions are summarized in chapter 7...|$|R
