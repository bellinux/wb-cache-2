5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen changes as bigger leaner {{carcasses}} were demanded. This issue of size featured in Galloway circles causes great debate. Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and <b>Embryo</b> <b>Transfer.</b> Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand. This {{is due to the}} demand of high quality meat that requires economical production.|$|E
5|$|As it {{has been}} since the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. On one hand, this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product. On the other, it decreases genetic diversity, increasing the severity of certain disease outbreaks among other risks.|$|E

5|$|The French {{national}} stud, the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer,</b> {{but does not}} allow the registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, {{those used in}} harness, and those destined for meat production. Horses may be {{automatically}} registered if at least 87.5 percent of their ancestors (seven out of eight) were registered Norman Cobs. Purebred stallions may not be bred more than 70 times per year. Foals produced through artificial insemination and <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> may be registered, but cloned horses may not. In general, breeders look to produce horses with good gaits and an aptitude for driving, while keeping the conformation that makes the Norman Cob one of nine French draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> from a French-imported Limousin dam.

Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
40|$|Background: In vitro {{fertilization}} (IVF) is a progressing common reproduction method {{and if the}} number of <b>transferred</b> <b>embryo</b> increases, the pregnancy rate and multiple pregnancies will increase which may lead to higher medical costs and human suffering.

40|$|Background. The aim of {{our study}} was to analyse the results of ICSI {{procedure}} {{with respect to the}} number of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> 3 or 5 days after fertilization. Methods. The outcome of 1498 day 3 <b>embryo</b> <b>transfers</b> and 364 day 5 <b>embryo</b> (blastocyst) <b>transfers</b> was analysed. The percentage of implanted embryos was compared with regard to the number and quality of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred.</b> Differences in pregnancy rate between the groups were established with the chi-square test. Results. Implantation occurred in 21. 3 % (320 / 1498) of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> to the uterus on day 3 post fertilization. In the transfer of one, two, three or four embryos, the pregnancy rate increased from 20. 0 % to 22. 1 %, 54. 5 % and 59. 0 % respectively. In the group with one or two <b>embryos</b> for <b>transfer,</b> the pregnancy rate did not change statistically significantly in correlation with embryo quality. The twin pregnancy rate after the transfer of two good quality embryos was 66. 6 % (8 / 12). The presence of at least one good quality embryo among three or four <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> had a statistically significant effect on the singleton pregnancy rate (37. 8 % and 41. 3 %). The rate of multiple pregnancies remained low (18. 1 % and 16. 6 %). Increasing the percentage of good quality <b>embryos</b> for <b>transfer</b> to three or four had a greater effect on the percentage of multiple implantations (43. 1 % and 54. 5 %) than on the pregnancy rate (55. 5 % and 75. 8 %). After the transfer of 5 -day-old embryos (blastocysts), implantation occurred in 37. 3 % (136 / 364) of <b>embryos.</b> After the <b>transfer</b> of one blastocyst, the pregnancy rate was 36. 2 % (21 / 58), after the transfer of two blastocysts it was 55. 7 % (98 / 176). The twin pregnancy rate after the transfer of two blastocysts amounted to 38. 7 %. Conclusions. The transfer of blastocyst stage embryos results in a statistically significant increase in the success of the ICSI procedure. In the transfer of two blastocysts, the rate of twin pregnancies remains equally high as in the transfer of three good quality embryos on the third post fertilization day. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{reduction}} {{of the number of}} <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> while maintaining a satisfactory rate of pregnancy (PR) with in vitro fertilization calls for a refined technique of embryonic selection. This prospective study investigates the significance of early embryonic compaction at day 3 as a marker of the chances of implantation. METHODS: We examined 317 transfers and their outcome involving 509 embryos including 91 compacted embryos. RESULTS: Early compaction seems linked with the ovarian response to stimulation and embryonic quality. The PR is significantly increased when the embryonic cohort contains at least one compacted embryo (44 % versus 29. 5 %, p = 0. 01), and when at least one compacted <b>embryo</b> is <b>transferred</b> (44 % versus 31 %, p < 0. 05). The analysis of our single <b>embryo</b> <b>transfers</b> shows that the implantation rates are significantly better for compacted embryos (50 % versus 30 %, p < 0. 05) (OR 2. 98; CI 1. 02 - 5. 28). CONCLUSION: Thus, early compaction, sometimes observed at day 3, may serve as a useful additional criterion for selecting the <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike a {{significant}} number of registered breeds today, a horse cannot be registered as a Thoroughbred (with The Jockey Club registry) unless conceived by live cover, the witnessed natural mating of a mare and a stallion. Artificial insemination (AI) and <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> (ET), though commonly used and allowable in many other horse breed registries, cannot be used with Thoroughbreds. One reason is that a greater possibility of error exists in assigning parentage with AI, and although DNA and blood testing eliminate many of those concerns, AI still requires more detailed record keeping. The main reason, however, may be economic; a stallion has a limited number of mares who can be serviced by live cover. Thus the practice prevents an oversupply of Thoroughbreds, although modern management still allows a stallion to live cover more mares in a season than was once thought possible. As an example, in 2008, the Australian stallion Encosta De Lago covered 227 mares. By allowing a stallion to cover only a couple of hundred mares a year rather than the couple of thousand possible with AI, it also preserves the high prices paid for horses of the finest or most popular lineages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> can be {{performed}} after various durations of embryo culture, conferring different stages in embryogenesis. The main stages at which <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> is performed are cleavage stage (day 2 to 4 after co-incubation) or the blastocyst stage (day 5 or 6 after co-incubation).|$|E
25|$|Monozygotic {{twinning}} is not increased after blastocyst transfer {{compared with}} cleavage-stage <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of uniform development of blastocysts was examined {{by comparing the}} effects of asynchro-nous superinduction (Day 6 embryos into Day 7 pregnant recipients and Day 7 embryos into Day 6 pregnant recipients) on the range of embryo development at Days 12 and 13 to subsequent survival to Day 30. Twenty gilts were used to produce five Day 7 recipients that received Day 6 embryos and five Day 6 recipients that re-ceived Day 7 embryos. Embryos from the Day 7 and Day 6 recipients were examined 6 days later. Recovered embryos ranged morphologically from spherical to filamentous blastocysts. This range of embryos was {{within the limits of}} that previously observed for naturally mated sows. However, recovered blastocysts from the Day 6 <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> into Day 7 recipients were morphologically more variable and proportionately less devel-oped than the blastocysts from the Day 7 <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> into Day 6 recipients. Forty additional gilts were subsequently utilized to generate 20 recipients (10 recipients per transfer group) that were examined on Day 30. More Day 7 <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> into Day 6 recipients survived (p< 0. 05) than Day 6 <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> into Day 7 recipients. These experiments suggested that greater variation in early development of embryos, within litters, subsequently resulted in greater mortality of embryos...|$|R
50|$|By 2017, many {{centers have}} adopted embryo {{cryopreservation}} {{as their primary}} IVF therapy, and perform few or no fresh <b>embryo</b> <b>transfers.</b> The two main reasons for this have been better endometrial receptivity when <b>embryos</b> are <b>transferred</b> in cycles without exposure to ovarian stimulation and also the ability to store the embryos while awaiting the results of pre-implantation genetic testing.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was two-fold: to {{investigate}} the association of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and small newborn size, using standardized measures; and to examine within strata of fresh and cryopreserved <b>embryos</b> <b>transfer,</b> whether this association is influenced by parental infertility diagnoses. We used a population-based retrospective cohort from Michigan (2000 - 2009), Florida and Massachusetts (2000 - 2010). Our sample included 28, 946 ART singletons conceived with non-donor oocytes and 4, 263, 846 non-ART singletons. Regression models were used to examine the association of ART and newborn size, measured as small for gestational age (SGA) and birth-weight-z-score, among four mutually exclusive infertility groups: female infertility only, male infertility only, combined female and male infertility, and unexplained infertility, stratified by fresh and cryopreserved <b>embryos</b> <b>transfer.</b> We found increased SGA odds among ART singletons from fresh <b>embryos</b> <b>transfer</b> compared with non-ART singletons, with little difference by infertility source [adjusted odds-ratio for SGA among female infertility only: 1. 18 (95 % CI 1. 10, 1. 26), male infertility only: 1. 20 (95 % CI 1. 10, 1. 32), male and female infertility: 1. 18 (95 % CI 1. 06, 1. 31) and unexplained infertility: 1. 24 (95 % CI 1. 10, 1. 38) ]. Conversely, ART singletons, born following cryopreserved <b>embryos</b> <b>transfer,</b> had lower SGA odds compared with non-ART singletons, with mild variation by infertility source [adjusted odds-ratio for SGA among female infertility only: 0. 56 (95 % CI 0. 45, 0. 71), male infertility only: 0. 64 (95 % CI 0. 47, 0. 86), male and female infertility: 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 36, 0. 77) and unexplained infertility: 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 47, 1. 06) ]. Birth-weight-z-score was significantly lower for ART singletons born following fresh <b>embryos</b> <b>transfer</b> than non-ART singletons, regardless of infertility diagnoses...|$|R
25|$|The {{technique}} of selecting only one embryo {{to transfer to}} the woman is called elective-single <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> (e-SET) or, when embryos are at the blastocyst stage, {{it can also be}} called elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT). It significantly lowers the risk of multiple pregnancies, compared with e.g. Double <b>Embryo</b> <b>Transfer</b> (DET) or double blastocyst transfer (2BT), with a twinning rate of approximately 3.5% in sET compared with approximately 38% in DET, or 2% in eSBT compared with approximately 25% in 2BT. At the same time, pregnancy rates is not significantly less with eSBT than with 2BT. That is, the cumulative live birth rate associated with single fresh <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> followed by a single frozen and thawed <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> is comparable with that after one cycle of double fresh <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer.</b> Furthermore, SET has better outcomes in terms of mean gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, and risk of neonatal intensive care unit necessity than DET. e-SET of embryos at the cleavage stage reduces the likelihood of live birth by 38% and multiple birth by 94%. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials suggests that increasing the number of e-SET attempts (fresh and/or frozen) results in a cumulative live birth rate similar to that of DET.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} single <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer</b> is highest in Sweden (69.4%), but {{as low as}} 2.8% in the USA. Access to public funding for ART, {{availability}} of good cryopreservation facilities, effective education {{about the risks of}} multiple pregnancy, and legislation appear {{to be the most important}} factors for regional usage of single <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer.</b> Also, personal choice plays a significant role as many subfertile couples have a strong preference for twins.|$|E
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} to support the use of mechanical closure of the cervical canal following <b>embryo</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E
50|$|World {{usage data}} {{is hard to}} come by but it was {{reported}} in a study of 23 countries that almost 42,000 frozen human <b>embryo</b> <b>transfers</b> were performed during 2001 in Europe.|$|R
30|$|Different {{mechanisms}} may predispose {{to development}} of HP after ART cycles. More <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> by ART procedures increase both multiple gestation and EP incidences [7]. Other factors predisposing to ectopic gestation are previous tubal {{damage caused by}} PID, endometriosis and tubal surgery, previous ectopic pregnancy, and ovulation induction. The hormonal milieu {{at the moment of}} transfer has been proposed as possible causes as well [8]. Thus, it seems more important {{to limit the number of}} <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred,</b> particularly in patients who present risk factors for HP and in young women, thereby minimizing the risk of EP.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background IVF cycles which {{result in}} only one good quality embryo, and a second poor quality embryo present a dilemma when the {{decision}} involves <b>transferring</b> two <b>embryos.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether a poor quality embryo has a negative effect on a good quality <b>embryo</b> when <b>transferred</b> along with a good quality embryo.

2500|$|Embryos are graded by the embryologist {{based on}} the number of cells, {{evenness}} of growth and degree of fragmentation. The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two <b>embryos</b> are <b>transferred</b> except in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to HFEA regulations, a woman over 40 may have up to three <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred,</b> whereas in the USA, younger women may have many <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> based on individual fertility diagnosis. Most clinics and country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of pregnancies carrying multiples, as it is not uncommon for more implantations to take than desired.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to report from a larger study with {{pregnancy}} and delivery results after transfer of cloned transgenic/non-transgenic Large White or minipig embryos to Large White sow recipients. The effect of both total numbers of <b>transferred</b> <b>embryos</b> as well as site of their deposition (uni- vs. bi-lateral) was studied. Four to five days after natural heat, 85 Large White (LW) sows received Day 5 or 6 handmade cloned embryos. Large White embryos were non-transgenic and were transferred to 36 recipients, while 49 recipients each received Minipig embryos, either non-transgenic or with 1 of 4 types of transgenes. Furthermore, the number of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> was in two categories, as 46 recipients received 40 – 60 embryos while 39 received 60 – 120 embryos. Finally, in 59 of the recipients <b>embryos</b> were <b>transferred</b> to one of the uterine horns (unicornual) while 26 other recipients had <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> to both uterine horns (bicornual). The overall pregnancy rate was 55 % with an abortion rate of 26 % resulting in 41 % deliveries with no difference between LW and Minipig embryos and no difference between transgenic and non-transgenic Minipig <b>embryos.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of 60 – 120 embryos resulted in more pregnancies and deliveries (62 %) than < 60 embryos (24 %). The mean litter size was 5. 1 ± 0. 5 and after transfer of 60 – 120 embryos significantly higher (6. 0 ± 0. 5) than after transfer of < 60 embryos (3. 5 ± 0. 8). Also, the bicornual transfer resulted in significantly higher delivery rate (74 % vs. 44 %) and mean litter size (6. 1 ± 0. 7 vs. 4. 2 ± 0. 6) than the unicornual. The mean rate of piglets/transferred embryos was 7. 3 ± 0. 6 % while the mean rate of piglets/reconstructed embryos was 179 / 18, 000 = 1 % with no difference between breeds or number of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred.</b> The overall perinatal mortality rate was 49 %, and it was significantly lower in LW piglets (20 / 59 = 34 %) than in Minipiglets (67 / 120 = 56 %) (vs. 10 – 15 % in normal piglets at the farm) and the total rate of piglets with one or more malformation was 22 %, and lower in LW (12 %) than in Minipiglets (28 %). This study demonstrate that although the perinatal mortality was rather high, an acceptable birth rate can be achieved after transfer to LW recipients of cloned LW embryos as well as cloned, transgenic/non-transgenic Minipig embryos. Furthermore, the pregnancy rate and litter size were correlated to the number of <b>embryos</b> <b>transferred</b> and to bicornual transfer...|$|R
