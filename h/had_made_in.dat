5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends. During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E

5|$|France was in {{constitutional}} crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris. Although {{moved by the}} death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt {{that the purpose of}} his visit was to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets.

5|$|In August and September, {{the first}} {{screenshots}} of Duke Nukem Forever were released in PC Gamer. However, 3D Realms {{did not receive}} the Quake II engine code until November 1997, and the earlier screenshots were mock-ups with the Quake engine that the team <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> their spare time. 3D Realms unveiled the first video footage of Duke Nukem Forever using the Quake II engine at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The trailer showed Duke fighting {{on the back of}} a moving truck and firefights with aliens. While critics were impressed, Broussard was not happy with the progress being made.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted.

5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was born}} {{five days after the}} September 15 cutoff date for {{eligibility}} in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, there was a significant effort made to allow Tavares into the Draft. Following his 72-goal campaign in 2006–07, Tavares' agents asked the NHL and NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) to make an exception for Tavares similar to the one the OHL <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> 2005. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a spot with the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} lack of progress the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> expanding the rest of the network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{problems}} with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he <b>had</b> <b>made,</b> <b>in</b> particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest. In the parliament of 1301, the King was forced to order {{an assessment of the}} royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession. Ultimately, it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against EdwardI. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign. As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant. Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.|$|E
5|$|Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied {{shipping}} off the American Atlantic coast. By November 1941, Commonwealth {{forces had}} launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians <b>had</b> <b>made.</b> <b>In</b> North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to {{positions at the}} Gazala Line by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942. An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein. On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.|$|E

5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, as he often solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he <b>had</b> <b>made,</b> <b>in</b> his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E
5|$|In April 1972 Van der Byl {{sparked a}} row over the {{agreement}} which Rhodesia and the United Kingdom <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> November 1971. Under this agreement, Rhodesia {{had agreed to}} certain concessions to African nationalism {{in return for the}} prospect of recognition of its independence; however, implementation of the agreement was to be delayed until the Pearce Commission reported on whether the settlement proposals would be approved by the people of Rhodesia. Van der Byl insisted that Rhodesia would not implement any part of the agreement unless Rhodesia's independence was first acknowledged, regardless of the answer from the Pearce Commission. When the Pearce Commission reported that the European, Asian and Coloured (mixed race) populations of Rhodesia were in support but the African population were opposed, the agreement was ditched. Many outside and inside Rhodesia had hoped that the government would implement some of the agreement even if Pearce reported against it.|$|E
5|$|To {{counter the}} {{advances}} the pro-independence forces <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>in</b> South America, Spain prepared a second, large, expeditionary force in 1819. This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, {{it became the}} means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, Rafael Riego, commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in Galicia in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros, and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.|$|E
