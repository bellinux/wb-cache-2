The principal armament of the aircraft is its powered dorsal turret, equipped with four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns.

The Brownings were electrically fired and <b>insulated</b> cut-off <b>points</b> in the turret ring prevented the guns firing when they were pointing at the propeller disc or tailplane.

The applied bias current decomposes the solution by electrolysis into tiny gas bubbles that cling to the metal <b>point</b> <b>insulating</b> the metal tip from the solution thus reducing the bias current.

The active area is segmented in 18 small electrically <b>insulated</b> measurement <b>points</b> (segments), {{in addition to a}} main segment. The profile of current density was investigated up to an average of 0. 6 A/cm 2 and 67 % of fuel utilization, showing as expected a different response depending on the position along the flowpath. In addition, the local Nernst potentials were measured by temporarily disabling the polarization of the concerned segments. The temperature profile was also investigated {{as a function of the}} output current, showing a large heat transfer with the test furnace in this single-element configuration. In addition, local degradation behavior was studied over 1900 hours. In particular, it was found that the repeat-element showed a large sensitivity to fuel composition, with larger degradation rates under pure hydrogen than under diluted fuel mixture. Impedance spectroscopy results showed large differences in degradation behavior, depending on the location in the repeat-element and on the polarization history. In particular, segments that had not been polarized during the test showed lower ohmic resistances than the polarized ones, and zones located near the gas inlets degraded more than those near the outlet. With this experiment, it was clearly demonstrated that degradation processes depend on local operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a simple}} non-interacting-electron model, {{combining}} local quantum tunneling via quantum point contacts and global classical percolation, {{has been introduced}} in order to describe the observed "metal-insulator transition" in two dimensions [1]. Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation scaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. The two species in this model are, on one hand, the "metallic" point contacts, whose critical energy lies below the Fermi energy, {{and on the other}} hand, the <b>insulating</b> quantum <b>point</b> contacts. It is shown that many features of the experiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on temperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on density, the e^ 2 /h scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the metallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of the critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally explained by the model. Moreover, details such as the nonmonotonic dependence of the resistance on temperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic are also a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field dependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is used to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical direction. It is also shown that the resistance on the "metallic" side can decrease with decreasing temperature by an arbitrary factor in the degenerate regime (T≲ E_F). Comment: 8 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} transport {{properties of}} a superconducting junction of many (N > 2) one-dimensional quantum wires. We include the effectofelectron-electron interaction within the one-dimensional quantum wire using a weak interaction renormalization group procedure. Due to the proximity effect, transport across the junction occurs via direct tunneling {{as well as}} via the crossed Andreev channel. We find that the fixed point structure of this system is far more rich than the fixed point structure of a normal metal-superconductor junction (N = 1), where we only have two fixed points - the fully <b>insulating</b> fixed <b>point</b> or the Andreev fixed point. Even a two wire (N= 2) system with a superconducting junction i. e. a normalmetal-superconductor-normal metal structure, has non-trivialfixed points with intermediate transmissions and reflections. We also include electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the quantum wires in our study and hence obtain non-Luttinger liquid behaviour. It {{is interesting to note}} that (a) effects due to inclusion of electron-electron interaction induced back-scattering in the wire, and (b) competition between the charge transport via the electron and hole channels across the junction, give rise to a non-monotonic behavior of conductance as a functionof temperature. We also find that transport across the junction depends on two independent interaction parameters. The first one is due to the usual correlations coming from Friedel oscillations for spin-full electrons giving rise to the well-known interaction parameter (α = (g_ 2 - 2 g_ 1) / 2 πħ v_F). The second one arises due to the scattering induced by the proximity of the superconductor and is given by(α^' = (g_ 2 + g_ 1) / 2 πħ v_F). Comment: Final version to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|Muscovite {{is known}} by its thermal and {{electrical}} insulating properties. Based on this, {{it was hypothesized that}} its addition on paints should increase the thermal resistance. The use of muscovite as mineral <b>insulating</b> is <b>pointed</b> out as advantageous due to its low cost compared to other materials used for this purpose, such as the ceramic microsphere. The use of a low cost material could open the access to the medium and low income families, implying two aspects: the life quality increase by thermal comfort and the increase of energy saving. Thus, this part of the population could open a new market to thermal paints. Aiming to contribute to this issue, this work evaluated the thermal insulation performance of commercial paints containing muscovite additions and determined the economic evaluation for its industrial production. The thermal paint was formulated by adding 10 %, 20 % and 40 % of muscovite to the commercial paint. This was applied on steel reinforced mortar boards. Thermal insulation tests were carried out in bench scale using an adapted box. The economic evaluation of the industrial production of muscovite-based thermal paint was conducted, considering the Brazilian economic market in this activity. The results showed its ability as an insulating agent due to a reduction of 0. 667 °C/mm board by the addition of 40 % muscovite. The economic analysis also demonstrated the feasibility of the thermal paint industrial production. The payback is favorable to 5 years when compared to the Selic short-term lending rate, with 21. 53 % of internal rate return and a net present value of US$ 15, 085. 76...|$|R
25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing <b>point,</b> <b>insulating</b> them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|R

This has led to the conjecture that SmB$_ 6 $ hosts nontrivial excitations within its bulk gap, and has spawned several theories to that effect.

Inspired by this possibility, I consider a minimal model of a Kondo insulator [...] -a flat band hybridized with a parabolic band [...] -that is slightly electron doped, i. e., the chemical potential is in the conduction band but close to the band edge.
