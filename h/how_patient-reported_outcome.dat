40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze three models of <b>how</b> <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> {{measures}} can be connected to clinical outcome measures in cataract surgery to identify opportunities for improvement of quality of care. METHODS: Three models were used to analyze the following questions: Is there a relationship between clinical parameters and patient-reported outcomes? (1) Is there a relationship between clinical parameters and a good or poor patient-reported outcome? (2) When and why do clinical and patient-reported outcomes diverge? (3) The study material to exemplify these models consisted of follow-up data on cataract extractions collected by the Swedish National Cataract Register in 2008 to 2011. Patient-reported outcome was measured using the Catquest- 9 SF questionnaire. A total of 9707 pairs of questionnaires completed before and after a cataract extraction were analyzed together with clinical data. RESULTS: Factors related to any change in patient-reported outcomes after surgery were the preoperative self-assessed visual function, the preoperative visual acuity in both eyes, the postoperative visual acuity, and ocular comorbidity. Factors related to poor patient-reported outcomes after surgery were good preoperative self-assessed visual functions, poor preoperative visual acuity in the better eye, ocular comorbidity, surgical complications, and large refractive deviation. Poor near vision after surgery was the main factor noted in situations where the clinical outcome was good and the patient-reported outcome was poor. Analyses 2 and 3 were the most useful analyses to give ideas for clinical improvement work. CONCLUSIONS: The best models to give ideas for improved quality of care by using a patient questionnaire in our study were analyzing the risk factors for a poor patient-reported outcome and analyzing the factors associated with disagreement between clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{conducted}} a secondary qualitative analysis of consultations between oncologists and their patients to explore <b>how</b> <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures (PROMs) data {{were referred to}} in the process of (1) eliciting and exploring patients' concerns; (2) making decisions about supportive treatment and (3) making decisions about chemotherapy and other systemic treatments. Methods: We purposively sampled audio recordings of 18 consultations from the intervention arm and 4 from the attention control arm of a previous UK randomised controlled trial of the feedback of PROMs data to doctors (Velikova et al. in J Clin Oncol 22 (4) : 714 - 724 [1]). We used a combination of content and conversation analysis to examine how opportunities for discussion of health-related quality of life issues are opened up or closed down within the consultation and explore why this may or may not lead to changes in patient management. Findings: Explicit reference to the PROMs data provided an opportunity for the patient to clarify and further elaborate on the side effects of chemotherapy. High scores on the PROMs data were not explored further if the patient indicated they were not a problem or were not related to the cancer or chemotherapy. Symptomatic treatment was more often offered for problems like nausea, constipation, pain and depression but much less so for fatigue. Doctors discussed fatigue by providing a cause for the fatigue (e. g. the chemotherapy), presenting this as ‘something to be expected', minimising its impact or moving on to another topic. Chemotherapy regimens were not changed {{on the basis of the}} PROMs data alone, but PROMs data were sometimes used to legitimise changes. Conclusions: Explicit mention of PROMs data in the consultation may strengthen opportunities for patients to elaborate on their problems, but doctors may not always know how to do this. Our findings have informed the development of a training package to enable doctors to optimise their use of PROMs data within the consultation...|$|E

This paper aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of RAMP-DM on <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes.</b> This was a prospective longitudinal study on 1039 diabetes mellitus patients (714 / 325 RAMP-DM/non-RAMP-DM) managed in primary care setting. 536 and 402 RAMP-DM participants, and 237 and 187 non-RAMP-DM participants were followed up at 12 and 24 months with completed survey, respectively. <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> included health-related quality of life, change in global health condition and patient enablement measured by Short Form- 12 Health Survey version- 2 (SF- 12 v 2), Global Rating Scale, Patient Enablement Instrument respectively. The effects of RAMP-DM on <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> were evaluated by mixed effect models. Subgroup analysis was performed by stratifying haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) (optimal HbA 1 c[*]<[*] 7 [*]% and suboptimal HbA 1 c[*]≥[*] 7 [*]%). RAMP-DM with suboptimal HbA 1 c was associated with greater improvement in SF- 12 v 2 physical component summary score at 12 -month (coefficient: 3. 80; P-value[*]<[*] 0. 05) and 24 -month (coefficient: 3. 82;P-value[*]<[*] 0. 05), more likely to feel more enabled at 12 -month (odds ratio: 2. 57; P-value[*]<[*] 0. 05), and have improved in GRS at 24 -month (odds ratio: 4. 05; P-value[*]<[*] 0. 05) compared to non-RAMP-DM participants. However, there was no significant difference in <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> between RAMP-DM and non-RAMP-DM participants with optimal HbA 1 c. Participation in RAMP-DM is effective in improving physical component of HRQOL, Global Rating Scale and patient enablement among diabetes mellitus patients with suboptimal HbA 1 c, but not in those with optimal HbA 1 c. Patients with sub-optimal diabetes mellitus control should be the priority target population for RAMP-DM.

Study Design and SettingHistoric developments of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome,</b> electronic health record, and comparative effectiveness research are analyzed in two dimensions: patient centeredness and digitization. We pose the question, “What needs to be standardized around the collection of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> in electronic health records for comparative effectiveness research?”ResultsWe identified three converging trends: the progression of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> toward greater patient centeredness and electronic adaptation; the evolution of electronic health records into personalized and fully digitized solutions; and the shift toward patient-oriented comparative effectiveness research. Related to this convergence, we propose an architecture for <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> standardization that could serve as a first step toward a more comprehensive integration of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> with electronic health record for both practice and research. ConclusionThe science of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measurement has matured sufficiently to be integrated routinely into electronic health records and other electronic health solutions to collect data on an ongoing basis for clinical care and comparative effectiveness research. Further efforts and ideally coordinated efforts from various stakeholders are needed to refine the details of the proposed framework for standardization...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the U. S. and abroad, {{the use of}} <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> {{measures}} to evaluate the impact of total joint replacement surgery on patient {{quality of life is}} increasingly common. Analyses of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> have documented substantial pain relief and functional gain among the vast majority of patients managed with total joint replacement. In addition, postoperative <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> are useful to identify persistent pain and suboptimal outcomes in the minority of patients who have them. The leaders of five U. S. total joint replacement registries report the rationale, current status, and vision for the use of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures in U. S. total joint replacement registries. METHODS: Surgeon leaders of the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement registry, American Joint Replacement Registry, California Joint Replacement Registry, Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, and Virginia Joint Registry report the rationale supporting the adoption of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures, factors associated with the selection and successful implementation of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures, and barriers to complete and valid data. RESULTS: U. S. registries are at varied stages of implementation of preoperative surveys and postoperative total joint replacement outcome measures. Surgeon leaders report unified rationales for adopting <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures: to capture data on pain relief and functional gain following total joint replacement as well as to identify suboptimal implant performance. Key considerations in the selection of a <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measure include its ability to measure both joint pain and physical function while limiting any burden on patients and surgeons related to its use. Complete <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> data will be associated with varied modes of survey completion, including options for home-based completion, to ensure consistent timing and data capture. CONCLUSIONS: The current stage of implementation of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures varies widely among U. S. registries. Nonetheless, evidence from the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement registry supports the feasibility of successful implementation of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures with careful attention to the selection of the outcome measure, mode and timing of postoperative administration, and minimization of any burden on the patient and surgeon...|$|R

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{injuries}} of {{the anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) {{are among the most}} common sports injuries to the knee. Treatment consists of conservative- or surgical treatment. In surgical ACL-reconstructions, currently there is no gold standard in the fixation method of the ACL-graft to the femur. Extracortical- and transfemoral fixation both show decent biomechanics. Thereby, both procedures give comparable stability and there is an indication that the functional outcome is similar as well. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study is to objectify and compare the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> of an extracortical fixation (Endobutton®) and a transfemoral fixation (TransFix®), 2 - 3 years after ACL-reconstruction. Patients and methods: All 112 patients included in this study, underwent an ACL-reconstruction in the Isala Klinieken Zwolle in 2010. Femoral fixation was either with Endobutton® (n= 53) or with TransFix® (n= 59). Primary <b>outcome</b> was the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measured by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Secondary <b>outcome</b> was the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome,</b> determined by the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, the Lysholm knee score and the Tegner Activity Scale (TAS). Furthermore, possible differences in the number of required additional surgical procedures, the duration of the ACL-reconstruction and the contentment of the patients were objectified. The possible correlation of these factors with the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> was objectified as well. Additionally, the surgeon and the patient characteristics (gender/age/BMI) were correlated to <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> between Endobutton® and TransFix® measured by the KOOS (p-value > 0. 05). No major differences were seen in results of the IKDC, Lysholm and TAS. Patient characteristics, duration of surgical procedures and contentment of the patients were comparable between the two methods and did not correlate with <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> of this study did not correlate with the individual surgeon. There were more re-operations required in the TransFix® group than in the Endobutton® group (respectively 20. 34 % and 7. 55 %), although differences were not considered significant. <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> is significantly lower in patients who underwent a re-operation. The mean follow-up was 2 year and 288 days after ACL-reconstruction. Conclusion: The <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> of Endobutton® and Transfix® are comparable after 2 - 3 year follow-up. Results indicate that the number of required additional procedures is remarkably higher in the population with TransFix®. Since <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> are significantly lower in patients who underwent a re-operation, further analysis is clinically relevant. ...|$|R
40|$|PurposeTo analyse the {{relationship}} between <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and clinical outcome measures in 42 individual Swedish cataract surgery settings. MethodsThe study material consisted of follow-up data on cataract extractions collected by the Swedish National Cataract Register in 2008 - 2011. <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> was measured using the Catquest- 9 SF questionnaire. A total of 9707 pairs of questionnaires completed before and after a cataract extraction were analysed together with clinical data. The analyses were performed for each clinic. ResultsFor almost all clinics, a factor related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> after surgery was a good preoperative self-assessed visual function. For some clinics, up to 50 % of the patients stated {{that they were very}} satisfied with their vision before surgery. For single clinics, different factors such as large anisometropia (3 D), capsule complications, biometry prediction error (3 D) and ocular comorbidity were related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> In situations where the clinical outcome was good and the <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> was poor, problems with near-vision activities after surgery was the main factor noted. ConclusionsAnalysing factors related to a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> for each clinic showed large variation. Weak indication for surgery, refractive problems after surgery, surgical complications and a poor chance of visual recovery due to ocular comorbidity were among the reasons for a poor <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome.</b> Post-operative care in terms of establishing a good near vision seemed to be another problem for some clinics...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> are {{increasingly}} {{used to evaluate}} the care of people with schizophrenia. Aims: To review established and emerging <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> in schizophrenia research, assessment tools and key findings. Method: A non-systematic review addressing relevant constructs, the associated scales and key empirical findings. Results: <b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> in schizophrenia relate either to evaluation of illness and benefit from treatment or to resilience of the self. Of the former, needs for care, treatment satisfaction and the therapeutic relationship are most common. Less common are symptoms, insight, attitude towards medication, and clinical communication. Increasing expectations of treatment have led to new measures assessing resilience of the self, including empowerment, self-esteem, sense of coherence and recovery. Scores of different patient-related outcomes overlap and are influenced by a general tendency, largely influenced by mood, for more or less positive appraisal. Conclusions: The conceptual and empirical basis for different <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> varies, with most data available for treatment satisfaction. More than one such outcome should be used only if there is a specific hypothesis. For new <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes,</b> relative independence from existing constructs should be demonstrated...|$|R

Major themes included: pain and discomfort are different – asking about discomfort is nonspecific and should be avoided in future PROs; bowel urgency is multifaceted – PROs should measure bowel immediacy, controllability, and predictability; and PROs should divide bloating into how it feels vs. how it looks. Symptom experience may be determined by 35 -item categories within five domains: (i) pain; (ii) gas/bloat; (iii) diarrhoea; (iv) constipation; and (v) extraintestinal symptoms.

40|$|<b>Patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> {{measures}} are tools that allow clinicians and researchers to gauge patients' {{level of satisfaction}} {{and quality of life}} after a medical intervention. The use of <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcome</b> measures and the clinically relevant score differentials over time as they relate to outcomes (minimum clinically important differences) has been proposed as a way to understand success and failure rates in orthopaedics. We conducted a systematic appraisal of literature in peer-reviewed journals and registry reports to measure the use that registries and other large data repositories make of minimum clinically important differences and to understand methodological approaches for such uses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{influence}} of growth hormone (GH) replacement on <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> (i. e., quality of life, health status and well-being) and cognitive functioning in GH-deficient adults is controversial. DESIGN: We {{carried out a}} meta-analysis of clinical trials concerning the {{influence of}} GH substitution on <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> and cognitive functions (studies were selected from 1985 to 2004). The results of individual studies were combined {{in a series of}} meta-analyses using a random effects model. Effects of GH replacement in GH-deficient adults were compared to baseline and/or placebo. RESULTS: Fifteen studies on GH and <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> were included (830 patients, follow-up 3 - 50 months). Four of these studies also provided data on cognitive functions (85 patients, follow-up 6 - 12 months). Relative to baseline, GH treatment is found to have a large effect on <b>patient-reported</b> <b>outcomes</b> at 3 months, a medium effect at 6 months and a small effect at 12 months.
