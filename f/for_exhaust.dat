25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve <b>for</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{model was}} the {{successor}} to the ageing twin cylinder CB360 and the highly regarded, but expensive for the 400cc class, four-cylinder CB400F. The CB400T has two fewer cylinders than its CB400F predecessor and although the press was initially skeptical of it, reviews stated {{that it was a}} worthwhile successor and more than capable of competing with contemporary rivals. Its overhead camshaft [...] air-cooled parallel-twin had been completely redesigned, with a chain drive that operated three valves per cylinder, two for inlet and one <b>for</b> <b>exhaust.</b> It differs from rival manufacturers 400cc twin-cylinder models because it has a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins instead of the more common 180° crank layout. Counter-rotating balance-shafts help to reduce unwanted vibrations caused by the 360° crank layout. Honda fitted these models with capacitor discharge ignition instead of the points system found on its predecessors, that required frequent maintenance. It uses a five-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling is provided by twin Keihin [...] carburettors. A steel diamond cradle type frame uses the engine as a stressed member to reduce mass and increase ground clearance.|$|E

2500|$|Mazda later {{abandoned}} the Wankel {{in most of}} their automotive designs, continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only, producing the RX-7 until August 2002. The company normally used two-rotor designs. A more advanced twin-turbo three-rotor engine was fitted in the 1991 Eunos Cosmo sports car. In 2003, Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX-8. The Renesis engine relocated the ports <b>for</b> <b>exhaust</b> from {{the periphery of the}} rotary housing to the sides, allowing for larger overall ports, better airflow, and further power gains. Some early Wankel engines had also side exhaust ports, the concept being abandoned because of carbon buildup in ports and the sides of the rotor. The Renesis engine solved the problem by using a keystone scraper side seal, and approached the thermal distortion difficulties by adding some parts made of ceramics. The Renesis is capable of [...] with improved fuel economy, reliability, and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines, all from a nominal 1.3L displacement. However, this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards. Mazda ended production of their Wankel engine in 2012 after the engine failed to meet the improved Euro 5 emission standards, leaving no automotive company selling a Wankel-powered vehicle. [...] The company is continuing development of the next generation of Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R with a new rear wheel drive sports car model announced in October 2015 although with no launch date given. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. [...] Mazda announced the introduction of the series-hybrid Mazda2 EV car using a Wankel engine as a range extender, however no date of introduction has been announced.|$|E

50|$|Using a {{separate}} blower avoids {{many of the}} shortcomings of crankcase scavenging, {{at the expense of}} increased complexity which means a higher cost and an increase in maintenance requirement.
