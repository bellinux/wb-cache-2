5|$|The {{combination}} of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico; wave heights reached 15feet (4.60m). On November 11, a ship reported sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h), although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls. In Key West, the storm's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28inches (591mm); 13.58inches (345mm) fell within six hours. It remains the record 24-hour November rainfall total for the city as of 2012. The previous record was set in 1954. The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front, which {{also contributed to the}} deluge. Schools and most businesses were closed, while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport; authorities urged residents to stay <b>home.</b> <b>Telephone</b> and power services were cut to some areas of the city.|$|E

Yankee manager Joe McCarthy retired during the 1946 season, and after the interim appointment of catcher Bill Dickey as player-manager, Bucky Harris was given the job in 1947. Stengel's name was mentioned for the job before Harris got it; he was backed by Weiss, but Lee MacPhail, then {{in charge of the}} franchise, was opposed. Harris and the Yankees won the World Series that year, but finished third in 1948, though they were not eliminated until the penultimate day. Harris was fired, allegedly because he would not give Weiss his <b>home</b> <b>telephone</b> number. MacPhail could no longer block Stengel's hiring, as he had sold his interest in the Yankees after the 1947 season. Weiss, by then team [...] general manager, urged his partners in the Yankees to allow the appointment of Stengel, who aided his own cause by winning the championship with Oakland during the time the Yankee job stood open. Del Webb, who owned part of the Yankees, had initial concerns but went along. Yankee scouts on the West Coast recommended Stengel, and Webb's support helped bring around co-owner Dan Topping.|$|E
