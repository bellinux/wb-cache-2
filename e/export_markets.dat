5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E

In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history.

The effects of governmental <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> support on firms' exporting activity is found a limited researched issue in international marketing, particularly the measurement of the effects of export promotion programmes (EPPs). Such programmes specifically are directed at assisting exporters' <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry.;The study addresses the role and effectiveness of <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> support as the acquisition of such support is influenced by management's orientation and information search and use behaviour (Reid, 1984; Katiskeas and Piercy, 1993). The analysis involves:; 1 - A comparison of the sample groups of programmes' users (UEP) and programmes' non-users (NUEP).; 2 - A detailed investigation of the export promotion programmes (EPPs) in <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry.;Overall, the thesis findings suggest that certain behavioural differences exist between firms using export promotion programmes (EPPs) in their <b>export</b> <b>market</b> entry and the firms not using EPPs.

However, users of programmes seem more organised and proactive in <b>export</b> <b>marketing</b> activity.;Measurement of the effectiveness of export promotion programmes (EPPs), however, appears complicated by a variety of factors which could not be clearly attributed to the use of EPPs.

5|$|The {{relocation}} of the livestock market had {{done little to}} resolve the problems of congestion {{in and around the}} market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly unpaved. Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18thcentury, this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18thcentury for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly from the loss of <b>export</b> <b>markets</b> during the French Wars, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19thcentury the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.|$|E
