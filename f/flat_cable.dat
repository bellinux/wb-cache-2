500|$|Aldrin entered Eagle first. With some {{difficulty}} the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing [...] of lunar surface {{material to the}} LM hatch using a <b>flat</b> <b>cable</b> pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor. Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve, and Aldrin tossed the bag down; Armstrong then jumped to the ladder's third rung and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM life support, the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, one Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.|$|E

50|$|Twin (2-; and 3- or 4-) {{core and}} earth: <b>Flat</b> <b>cable,</b> usually {{insulated}} by a PVC sheath, used for fixed wiring.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of AS-Interface installations utilize the AS-Interface <b>flat</b> <b>cable,</b> defined {{as part of the}} AS-Interface specifications. A relatively small number of industries (e.g. valve control in process automation) use a round cable, mostly because it is easier to pull through conduit. While the shape of the cable does not matter (any other cable can be used) the electrical characteristics of the selected cable matters greatly. To prevent problems due to improper cable, most professionals suggest the AS-Interface <b>flat</b> <b>cable.</b> This cable is designed to make use of a cable piercing technology. When an AS-Interface module is installed on the network, piercing needles penetrate the cable jacket and displace the internal copper strands without cutting them. This allows AS-Interface modules to be installed anywhere on the network without cutting and preparing (i.e. removing cable jacket, stripping insulation and possibly applying a ferule) the cable first. The result is a faster installation without the chance of inadvertent shorts between the leads.|$|E

40|$|A high {{temperature}} solder device for <b>flat</b> <b>cables</b> includes a microwelder, an anvil which {{acts as a}} heat sink and supports a flexible <b>flat</b> ribbon <b>cable</b> {{that is to be}} connected to a multiple pin connector. The microwelder is made from a modified commercially available resistance welding machine such as the Split Tip Electrode microwelder by Weltek, which consists of two separate electrode halves with a removable dielectric spacer in between. The microwelder is not used to weld the items together, but to provide a controlled compressive force on, and energy pulse to, a solder preform placed between a pin of the connector and a conductor of the flexible <b>flat</b> ribbon <b>cable.</b> When the microwelder is operated, an electric pulse will flow down one electrode, through the solder preform and back up the other electrode.

50|$|Twin-lead {{cable is}} a two-conductor <b>flat</b> <b>cable</b> {{used as a}} {{balanced}} transmission line to carry radio frequency (RF) signals. It is constructed of two stranded copper or copper-clad steel wires, held a precise distance apart by a plastic (usually polyethylene) ribbon. The uniform spacing of the wires {{is the key to}} the cable's function as a transmission line; any abrupt changes in spacing would reflect some of the signal back toward the source. The plastic also covers and insulates the wires.|$|E

50|$|In {{some types}} of {{telephone}} and network plug, including the BS 6312 and the registered jack (RJ) family, generally separate wires in a sheath are used. In these applications, the outer sheath is stripped then the wires are inserted into the connector and a special termination tool is used to force the conductors into the contacts. Traditionally these connectors have been used with <b>flat</b> <b>cable</b> which {{makes it easy to}} ensure the right conductors go into the right slots. However modular connectors used with Category 5 twisted pair cable require careful arranging of the conductors by hand before inserting them into the connector.|$|E
