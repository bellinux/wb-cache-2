5000|$|Matsudaira Yoritaka (March 17, 1810 [...] - [...] December 17, 1886) was a Japanese daimyo of {{the late}} Edo Period who served as daimyo of Shishido han. Retiring early, he was succeeded by his son Matsudaira Yorinori, but Yoritaka {{returned}} to headship following Yorinori's death in 1864. Though the domain was abolished following its involvement in {{the chaos of the}} [...] (extra2="Tengu Party") revolt of 1864, the new Satsuma-Chōshu centered government of the Meiji Emperor forgave Shishido, and allowed Yoritaka to retake his former holdings. Becoming han chiji (domainal governor) by Imperial order in 1869, he remained in that position until the abolition of the domains in 1871. After that he became a Shinto priest and was famed as a prolific writer. His son Matsudaira Yoriyasu (1856 - 1940) succeeded him as family head in 1880. Yoritaka's granddaughter Natsu (the <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> Matsudaira <b>Kō</b> (1858 - 1923) and Nagai Iwanojō (1845 - 1907), son of the famous Nagai Naoyuki), is famous as the grandmother of Mishima Yukio.　Under the new system of nobility, Yoriyasu became a viscount (shishaku 子爵).|$|R

He made an outstanding contribution through his versatility, technical skill and influence on a generation of Burmese painters. In the post-WWII years, many painters sought instruction from Ngwe Gaing, packing his studio to watch him work, just as painters had flocked to Ba Nyan in the pre-war years. Among the painters influenced by Ngwe Gaing were Myat Kyaw, San Win, Hla Shein, <b>Ko</b> <b>Lay,</b> Hla Maung Gyi, Nann Wai, Thein, Han Tin, San Pe, M. Tin Aye, and Lun Gywe.|$|R
