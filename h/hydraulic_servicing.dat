40|$|Introduction: Entrapped trauma victims require extrication, which, on rare occasions, {{may involve}} {{amputation}} of a limb. Standard extrication techniques sometimes fail {{or may be}} impossible, leading {{to the death of}} the entrapped victim. We propose that the use of fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment can be used effectively to urgently amputate a limb, where conventional techniques are unusable. Method: The study aims to determine: (i) the potential use of this equipment to achieve expeditious life-saving amputations and (ii) the effect the fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment has on the bony and surrounding soft tissues. Initially a porcine limb was used followed by fresh-frozen cadaveric lower limbs. We recorded the time, number of cuts, proximal fracture propagation and quality of bone cut when performing amputations at five levels. Results: The experiment confirms that faster guillotine amputations in human cadaveric lower limb specimens can be achieved by using fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment. Overall, the average time to complete an amputation in these ideal experimental circumstances at all five levels was quicker using the hydraulic cutting equipment. Either one or two cutting actions were required to achieve the amputation using fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment. The degree and proximal extent of the comminution were greater using the fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment. Conclusion: If circumstances and time constrains allow, a conventional amputation technique carried out by a trained medical practitioner would be preferable {{to the use of the}} fire <b>service</b> <b>hydraulic</b> cutting equipment. However, we feel that this technique could be used to perform emergent amputation under trained medical supervision, if it is felt that a standard amputation technique would take too long or the environment is too restrictive to perform a standard amputation safely. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{a series}} of large scale {{repeated}} model load tests are performed on geocell reinforced and unreinforced base layers overlying weak sand subgrades. The weak sand subgrades are prepared at 30 % relative density (RD) through pluviation (sand raining) technique in a test tank of dimensions 1 m × 1 m × 1 m (length × width × height). Two different base courses consisting of 75 % RD sand and a granular base material have been tested. The 75 % RD sand base course is also prepared by pluviation technique, while the granular base course is prepared in 5 layers, each of 50 mm thick, by static compaction. A repetitive load of 0. 97 kN and 9. 7 kN was applied on the prepared base layer through a 150 mm diameter plate to replicate the traffic load equivalent to a contact pressure of 550 kPa. Loading was applied through a graphical user interfaced multi-purpose test software along {{with the help of}} a hydraulic power unit, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>service</b> manifold and sophisticated double acting linear dynamic 100 kN capacity actuator which is connected to a 3. 5 m high, 200 kN capacity reaction frame. Four different tests are conducted on both the base courses (75 % RD sand and granular base) with and without reinforcement overlying the weak sand subgrade separately. There is a considerable amount of improvement observed for different number of cycles and plate settlements on quantification of traffic benefit ratios (TBR), cumulative plastic deformations (CPD) and rut depth reduction (RDR) for geocell reinforced base courses.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} fate of {{alkylphenol}} polyethoxylates (APEOs) degradation products (DPs) and the occurrence of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) surfactants in urban ground water at field scale. The occurrence of APEOs DPs in ground water was studied in connection with: (1) sources of recharge or/and pollution containing these substances, (2) ground water redox conditions, (3) occurrence of LAS, which are currently the domestic surfactants more {{used in the study}} area and (4) other common contaminants in urban ground water in the city of Barcelona. The APEOs DPs analyzed included two nonylphenol carboxylates (NP 2 EC, NP 1 EC), two octylphenol carboxylates (OP 2 EC, OP 1 EC), nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP). The highest groundwater concentrations of APEOs DPs were detected in aquifers whose major source of recharge is a river receiving large amounts of effluents from secondary waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). In fact, APEOs DPs concentrations were above those in the river. NP 2 EC was the compound detected at highest concentrations. These increase with ammonium in samples with low dissolved oxygen. These degradation products were virtually absent in oxidizing aquifers whose main source of recharge is not the river. In this case, only the ultimate degradation product (NP) was detected, which suggests that parent compounds have degraded. These results indicate that APEOs are persistent or less degraded in reducing conditions, whereas they are degraded when oxidizing conditions prevail. By contrast, LAS concentrations were more than one order of magnitude lower than expected based on recharge sources in all (oxidizing and reducing) aquifers.

40|$|Generally about 80 {{percent of}} railway tracks are welded by flash-butt welding that {{consists}} of electrical heating and <b>hydraulic</b> forging. The <b>service</b> performance of such welds is affected by their ability to support the service loads without fatigue damage or fracture. Horizontal split-web fractures, which may involve splitting of rail head, are of main concern because of potential risk of a catastrophic derailment. In this paper, failure analysis of three broken flash welded rails is presented. The investigation included chemical analysis, hardness measurement, SEM fractography, and microstructural characterization. The crack path consisted of two regions where after initial propagation parallel to the rail surface it tended to propagate on a slant surface. Fractographic analysis showed that high cycle fatigue was the main failure mechanism. Crack initiation sites were located at welded zones and were associated with large inclusions that were not properly removed during chiseling of upset material. Fatigue crack propagation was confined to planes parallel to the rail surface. Crack branching occurred after considerable unstable fast fracture. Finally it is clarified that trapped inclusions, residual stresses, track irregularities and dipping from localized wear in soft regions of weld, associated with variations in pearlitic microstructure, contribute to horizontal split-web fractures...|$|R
40|$|Space {{applications}} for telerobotics requires a manipulator that is robust {{to the large}} payload variations that occur in a zero-g environment. One approach to provide the required performance for this large payload variation is to provide inertial decoupling to the controller. The equations to generate the required joint torques can be obtained in several manners but the independent parameters required to perform the calculations are difficult to obtain. This presentation consists of {{an overview of the}} inertial decoupling control system and discusses how to reduce the inertial parameter set to a minimum and obtain the required parameter set to a minimum and obtain the required parameter vector using sensed joint positions and torques. In addition, as telerobotic technology becomes more prevalent in the space environments the ability to emulate the effect of zero-g in a one-g environment is critical in learning how to perform tasks in space. To emulate the zero-g environment it is necessary to remove the effect of gravity on the manipulator by determining the feedforward joint torques. A subset of the algorithm developed to obtain the decoupling parameters is used to obtain the gravity offload parameters. These parameters are used to eliminate the effect of gravity.
