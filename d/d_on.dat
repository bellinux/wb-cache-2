40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} different anesthetic techniques on T-helper (Th) cell subsets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hepatectomy. METHODS: Sixty-one HCC patients who received hepatectomies were randomized into an epidural combined general anesthesia (G + E; n = 31) or a general anesthesia (G; n = 30) group. Blood samples were obtained the morning before the operation (<b>d</b> 0), and <b>on</b> the second (<b>d</b> 2) and seventh (d 7) day after the operation. Th cell contents were evaluated using flow cytometry, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In all 61 patients, Th 1 and Th 2 cell frequencies, and interferon-&#x 3 B 3; (IFN-&#x 3 B 3;) mRNA expression markedly increased <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 2, compared to d 0. They recovered slightly <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7, and the Th 1 /Th 2 ratio increased markedly <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7, compared with d 2. In contrast, Th 17, regulatory T cell (Treg), and interleukin- 17 (IL- 17) levels and FOXP 3 mRNA expression showed no significant change <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 2, and then markedly decreased <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7. Similarly, plasma IFN-&#x 3 B 3; concentration <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 2 was much higher than that <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 0, and then partly recovered <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7. As compared with the G group, in the G + E group, Th 1 cell frequencies and the Th 1 /Th 2 ratio were slightly higher <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 2 and significantly higher <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7, while Th 2, Th 17, and Treg cell frequencies were slightly lower <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 2, and significantly lower <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7. Consistently, <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 7, IFN-&#x 3 B 3; mRNA and protein levels and the IFN-&#x 3 B 3;/IL- 4 ratio in the G + E group were higher {{than those in the}} G group. In contrast, the IL- 17 mRNA level, and IL- 17 and transforming growth factor-&#x 3 B 2; 1 concentrations in the G + E group were lower than those in the G group. CONCLUSION: G + E is superior to G in shifting the Th 1 /Th 2 balance towards Th 1, while decreasing Th 17 and Treg, potentially benefiting HCC patients by promoting anti-tumor Th polarization...|$|R
40|$|High {{doses of}} GH, used to induce {{anabolism}} in prolonged critically ill patients, unexpectedly increased mortality. To further explore underlying mechanisms, a valid animal model is needed. Such a model {{is presented in}} this study. Seven days after arterial and venous cannulae placement, male New Zealand White rabbits were randomly allocated to a control or a critically ill group. To induce prolonged critical illness, a template controlled 15 % deep dermal burn injury was imposed under combined general and regional (paravertebral) anesthesia. Subsequently, critically ill rabbits received supplemental analgesia and were parenterally fed with glucose, insulin, amino acids, and lipids. <b>On</b> <b>d</b> 1 and d 8 after randomization, acute and chronic spontaneous hormonal profiles of GH, TSH, and PRL secretion were obtained by sampling blood every 15 min for 7 h. Furthermore, GH, TSH, and PRL responses to an iv bolus of GH-releasing peptide 2 (GHRP- 2) + TRH were documented <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 0, 1, and 8. Hemodynamic status and biochemical parameters were evaluated <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8, after which animals were killed and relative wet weight and water content of organs was determined. Compared with controls, critically ill animals exhibited transient metabolic acidosis <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1 and weight loss, organ wasting, systolic hypertension, and pronounced anemia <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 8. <b>On</b> <b>d</b> 1, pulsatile GH secretion doubled in the critically ill animals compared with controls, and decreased again <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 8 {{in the presence of}} low plasma IGF-I concentrations from d 1 to d 8. GH responses to GHRP- 2 + TRH were elevated <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1 and increased further <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 8 in the critically ill animals. Mean TSH concentrations were identical in both groups <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1 and 8, in the face of dramatically suppressed plasma T(4) and T(3) concentrations in the critically ill animals. PRL secretion was impaired in the critically ill animals exclusively <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 8. TSH and PRL responses to GHRP- 2 and TRH were increased only <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1. In conclusion, this rabbit model of acute and prolonged critical illness reveals several of the clinical, biochemical, and endocrine manifestations of the human counterpart. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In ruminal {{drinkers}} (RD) ingested milk is transported {{into the}} rumen and not into the abomasum. Because {{this is followed}} by changes in digestibility and absorption, we have tested whether this is associated with postprandial metabolic and endocrine changes. Unweaned, bucket-fed calves (one RD, two controls) were studied on seven farms. <b>On</b> <b>d</b> 1, after metabolic and endocrine 12 -h profiles were studied, RD and one control calf were fed for 10 d by nipple, whereas the other control calf was fed by bucket. <b>On</b> <b>d</b> 11, metabolic and endocrine 12 -h profiles were again studied. <b>On</b> <b>d</b> 1, mean plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, urea, insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T 4) and leptin were significantly different between RD and controls, whereas mean concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), total protein, albumin, and glucagon did not differ significantly among groups. In RD concentrations of glucose, NEFA, insulin, growth hormone, IGF- 1, and T 4 were higher, and of urea were lower <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 11 than <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1. Glucose and insulin concentrations increased postprandially in healthy calves <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1, but barely in RD and remained lower than in controls, and there was no rise of NEFA and triglyceride concentrations <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 1 after the initial postprandial decrease in RD, in contrast to controls. But <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 11 postprandial responses of these four traits were similar in RD and controls and urea and T 4 concentrations <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 11 became normalized. However, glucose and T 3 concentrations in RD <b>on</b> <b>d</b> 11 were still lower than in one or both control groups.
