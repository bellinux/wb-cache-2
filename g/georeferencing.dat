To correct for distortions in the surveying and in the original paper sheets, a transformation of the map was required to rectify the images for <b>georeferencing</b> [...] Rauxloh provides an illustration of the requirement. The high resolution digital images of the 1746 map were supplied from the Motco image database which can also be accessed for personal use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Georeferencing</b> {{means that}} the {{internal}} coordinate system of a map or aerial photo image {{can be related to}} a ground system of geographic coordinates. The relevant coordinate transforms are typically stored within the image file (GeoPDF and GeoTIFF are examples), though there are many possible mechanisms for implementing <b>georeferencing.</b> The most visible effect of <b>georeferencing</b> is that display software can show ground coordinates (such as latitude/longitude or UTM coordinates) and also measure ground distances and areas. Doing these things with USGS GeoPDF maps requires the free TerraGo toolbar extension to Adobe Reader. In other words, <b>Georeferencing</b> means to associate something with locations in physical space. The term is commonly used in the geographic information systems field to describe the process of associating a physical map or raster image of a map with spatial locations. <b>Georeferencing</b> may be applied to any kind of object or structure that can be related to a geographical location, such as points of interest, roads, places, bridges, or buildings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} for the problem of automatic verification of <b>georeferenced</b> road network in digital aerial images. The proposed methodology is based on two basic stages, i. e. : 1 - Automatic extraction of <b>georeferenced</b> roads; and 2 - Consistence analysis of extracted roads. In the first stage, a road extraction methodology based on the dynamic programming algorithm is used to automatically extract <b>georeferenced</b> roads. The extraction methodology is initialized with a few points automatically measured along the <b>georeferenced</b> road network and projected into the image-space. The precision of the projected points is also computed, making possible the automatic computation of the search windows used by the dynamic programming algorithm. In the second stage, the consistency analysis aims at checking the compatibility between the extracted roads and the corresponding <b>georeferenced</b> roads projected into the image-space. The checking criterion {{is based on an}} error model that basically embodies the uncertainties of the <b>georeferenced</b> roads. The obtained results have shown that the proposed methodology is promising, as it can automatize the most part of arduous and time-consuming road network verification task, leaving only a little part to be complimented by an operator. It was also shown that the methodology {{has the potential to be}} used in applications like the <b>georeferenced</b> road network's systematic error correction and geometric refinement...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} emerging topics in social media is {{the increase in the number}} of <b>georeferenced</b> documents. These documents include not only text data, but also posted time and location. People have been transmitting information regarding items and events they have witnessed in their daily lives and collecting information on objects of interest through <b>georeferenced</b> documents. Therefore, many researchers are directing their attention to extracting local topics and events from <b>georeferenced</b> documents. In this paper, we propose a novel location-based burst detection algorithm for identifying the burstiness of a keyword related to local topics and events in a sequence of batched <b>georeferenced</b> documents, composed of ordered <b>georeferenced</b> document sets. Burstiness is one of the simplest yet most robust criteria for extracting hot topics and events from a sequence of batched documents. Identifying the burstiness of a keyword related to local topics and events captures not only the peak periods of the trending topics and events, but also the localities at which they are occurring. To evaluate the proposed location-based burst detection algorithm, we used an actual sequence of batched <b>georeferenced</b> documents that were composed by crawling tweets posted on the Twitter site.

40|$|Abstract In recent years, the {{emergence}} of <b>georeferenced</b> media, like geotagged photos, on the Internet has opened up a new world of possibilities for geographic related research and applications. Despite of its short history, <b>georeferenced</b> media has been attracting attentions from several major research communities of Computer Vision, Multimedia, Digital Libraries and KDD. This paper provides a compre-hensive survey on recent research and applications on online <b>georeferenced</b> media. Specifically, the survey focuses on four aspects: (1) organizing and browsing georef-erenced media resources, (2) mining semantic/social knowledge from <b>georeferenced</b> media, (3) learning landmarks in the world, and (4) estimating geographic location of a photo. Furthermore, based on the current technical achievements, open research issues and challenges are identified, and directions {{that can lead to}} compelling applications are suggested...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} application requires that <b>georeferenced</b> {{documents related to}} an observed emergency topic are extracted. <b>Georeferenced</b> documents including the observed emergency topic contain many kinds of keyword. Therefore, a keyword-based search is not effective for extraction. For example, suppose that an observed emergency topic is “rain”. Sequences “It is raining” and “It could rain this weekend” include the keyword “rain”; but, they have different topics. In this case, only “It is raining” is extracted as a relevant <b>georeferenced</b> document related to the topic “rain”.|$|R
