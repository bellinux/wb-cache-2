40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere {{is little}} {{published}} evidence for occupational respiratory disease caused by hop dust inhalation. In the United States, hops are commercially {{produced in the}} Pacific Northwest region. ObjectiveTo describe occupational respiratory disease in hop workers. MethodsWashington State workers' compensation claims filed by hop workers for respiratory disease were systematically identified and reviewed. Incidence rates of respiratory disease in hop workers were compared with rates in field vegetable crop farm workers. ResultsFifty-seven cases of respiratory disease associated with hop dust inhalation were reported from 1995 to 2011. Most cases (61 %) were diagnosed by the attending health care practitioner as having work-related asthma. Seven percent of cases were diagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the remaining cases were diagnosed as allergic respiratory disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis) or asthma-associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea). Cases were associated with <b>hop</b> <b>harvesting,</b> secondary <b>hop</b> processing, and indirect exposure. The incidence rate of respiratory disease in hop workers was 15 cases per 10, 000 full-time workers, which was 30 {{times greater than the}} incidence rate for field vegetable crop workers. A strong temporal association between hop dust exposure and respiratory symptoms and a clear association between an increase in hop dust concentrations and the clinical onset of symptoms were apparent in 3 cases. ConclusionOccupational exposure to hop dust is associated with respiratory disease. Respiratory disease rates were higher in hop workers than in a comparison group of agricultural workers. Additional research is needed before hop dust can be confirmed as a causative agent for occupational asthma...|$|R

The research results show that increasing sum of effective temperatures during the technological maturity stay in negative correlation with accumulation of α-acids in hop cones (r = - 0. 39 *), whereas total rainfalls stays in positive one (r = 0. 46 *) At the same time sum of hours of sun shining stay in not significant negative correlation with the accumulation of α-acids (r = - 0. 38). The results of factorial analysis show significant positive multiple correlation between sum of effective temperatures and total rainfalls with α-acids accumulation (multiple r = 0. 6232 **) {{and at the same}} time show a significant positive multiple correlation between total rainfalls and sunshine hours with α-acids accumulation (multiple r = 0. 5492 *). However, there was a very strong negative {{influence of}} reference crop evapotranspiration during the phenological phase of hop cones formation on yield of hop cones and of α-acids (rs = - 0. 75 * and – 0. 88 *, respectively). The total rainfalls during the hop vegetation in interval of [212. 1; 391. 8] mm and also the sum of effective temperature in interval of [1601. 74; 2000] ºC caused the α-acids accumulation in hop cones of cultivar Aurora in interval of [7. 41; 12. 35] % in dry matter. It is important to point out that the level of provided tillage, plant protection measures and fertilization was the same in all six experimental years, which excluded their effects on accumulation of α-acids. These results could possibly contribute in creating a model of predication of α-acids accumulation and beginning of <b>hop</b> <b>harvest...</b>|$|E

40|$|Korngården AB is {{the biggest}} hop {{producer}} in Sweden. They {{are located in the}} south of the country and their farm currently consists of 5000 m 2. Korngården AB is a newly founded company and is just starting up its business. The next step forward in their development is investing in a hop harvester. Therefore, in this thesis a first draft for a portable hop harvester is presented. The goal of this project was to design a machine that can be easily transported between hop farms in the vicinity and harvest 50 – 100 bines per hour. Starting up this project a study of <b>hop</b> <b>harvesting</b> solutions was made. To give this project a target I was provided with a specification of user demands by Korngården AB. During the concept generation different solutions were developed {{and with the help of}} a Pugh matrix the solutions was compared against each other. The chosen concept was 3 -D modeled in the CAD program SolidWorks. During this process a number of companies was contacted to get an idea of what this hop harvester would cost to produce. This turned in to the cost estimate which was one of the goals of this thesis. From the 3 -d models assembly drawings was created. The result of this thesis is a hop harvester that strips the bines using steel picking fingers that hits the cones and leaves of the bine. The cones and leaves are then separated using a series of tilted rubber bands. When exiting the striping section the bine will be chopped into smaller pieces using a wood chipper. At the moment the cost estimate shows that the hop harvester would cost around 200 000 sek to produce which is 25 000 sek more than what Korngården AB specified in their specification of user demands.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are {{primarily}} {{used to provide}} specific characteristics to beer, such as bitterness, aroma, flavor, and microbial stability. The chemical composition of hops, relative to how they are used during the brewing process, dictates the expression of these characteristics. Of the raw ingredients that go into making beer, hops {{are perhaps the most}} costly. Considerable resources are required to grow quality hops, and therefore, brewers and hop growers alike have a common goal of obtaining the highest quality hops possible. However, quality can be a relative term. While it is commonly agreed upon that high brewing values, such as α-acids and essential oil content, and robust structural integrity are indicators of quality hops, there are many opinions of the ideal aroma. Changes in the chemical composition of hops during plant maturation are a dynamic process requiring a comprehensive, in-depth chemical and sensory analysis in order to maximize the characteristics of interest to brewers. The complex aroma chemistry associated with hops in beer has been a confounding variable for the practical brewer, and a deeper understanding of hop aroma development during cultivation is needed. The effect of harvest date, location, and cultivar on key chemical components of Willamette and Cascade hops was investigated for the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. <b>Hops</b> were <b>harvested</b> at 3 time points (Early, Typical, and Late), within a 3 -week interval from 2 different farms in the Willamette Valley, Oregon.

The response of analytes was dependent on the cultivar being examined, its location within the Willamette Valley, as well as days until <b>harvest.</b> <b>Hop</b> acids did not change appreciably during plant maturation for the period examined, while hop oil content increased hyperbolically to a plateau as the hops aged on the bine. Increases in oil quantity were strongly correlated (r > 0. 90) with increases in α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, methyl heptanoate, and linalool concentrations. For Cascade, α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, ρ-cymene, caryophyllene, E, β-farnesene, and humulene all increased from Early to Typical points but no increase was observed between the Typical and Late time point.
