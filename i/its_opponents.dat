5000|$|A bare king {{may remain}} on the board in {{opposition}} to the other players in an effort to increase its ranking. In a timed game, a bare king can move faster than <b>its</b> <b>opponent,</b> therefore it may attempt to win the game by forcing <b>its</b> <b>opponent</b> to run out of time.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the season, Maryland outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 381–74, {{accumulated}} three shutout wins, and held seven opponents to 7 points or less. It was Maryland's first 10-win season and remains the team's only perfect undefeated season in the modern era.|$|E
5|$|According {{to several}} journalists {{who have worked}} {{independently}} on Opus Dei, such as John Allen, Jr., Vittorio Messori, Patrice de Plunkett, Maggy Whitehouse, Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales. Allen, Messori, and Plunkett say {{that most of these}} myths were created by <b>its</b> <b>opponents,</b> with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach.|$|E
5000|$|Nice: The most {{important}} condition {{is that the}} strategy must be [...] "nice", that is, it will not defect before <b>its</b> <b>opponent</b> does (this is {{sometimes referred to as}} an [...] "optimistic" [...] algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not [...] "cheat" [...] on <b>its</b> <b>opponent,</b> for purely self-interested reasons first.|$|R
50|$|If both robots {{survive the}} three minutes, three judges {{distribute}} {{a total of}} 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins. The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from <b>its</b> <b>opponent</b> will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will. The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits <b>its</b> <b>opponent's</b> weaknesses, protects <b>its</b> own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it {{had good reason to}} do so, while a robot that is able to attack <b>its</b> <b>opponent's</b> weak areas will gain points. The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to <b>its</b> <b>opponent</b> while remaining intact itself.|$|R

5|$|After Georgia's {{outstanding}} 1896 performance, Warner {{returned to}} his alma mater Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach at Iowa State, he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by {{a large proportion of}} the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|During Strupper's {{three years}} playing for Georgia Tech, the team {{compiled}} {{a record of}} 24–0–2 and outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting 222–0 win over Cumberland College in 1916, Strupper scored eight touchdowns. For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred {{as part of a}} renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill. Strupper and teammate Walker Carpenter were the first players from the Deep South selected for an All-America first team.|$|E

5|$|During this season, Maryland outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 298–38, {{accumulated}} six shutout wins, {{and allowed}} only one team, Georgia, to score more than 7 points. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967 and none has ever allowed fewer {{points in the}} regular season (31). Maryland ranked first nationally in terms of rushing defense (83.9 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1 points allowed per game). At the end of the regular season, the three wire services, the Associated Press, International News Service, and United Press, each named Maryland as the national championship team.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Final Four in San Antonio, UConn {{dominated}} {{teams from}} Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played {{little more than half}} the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by Baylor and the 6-foot-8 freshman Brittney Griner; Baylor trailed 39–26 at halftime but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70–50.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 90 and outscored their opponents 252 to 44. The defensive unit led by Dworsky held <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> to just 4.9points per game, including shutouts against Oregon (140), Purdue (400), Northwestern (280), Navy (350), and Indiana (540). The 1948 Wolverines finished the season ranked No. 1 by the AP, but Big Ten Conference rules prohibited {{a team from}} playing in the Rose Bowl {{two years in a}} row. Dworsky did, however, play in the 1948 Blue-Gray All Star game.|$|E

5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle. This demonstrated the changed balance of power {{at this stage of}} the war. At the commencement of the war, the VRS had greater military capabilities than <b>its</b> <b>opponents,</b> particularly in terms of heavy weapons and organisation, but over three years from mid-1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 391–19. The team scored 100 {{points in}} each of the first two contests; the 105–0 victory over Bethel was the largest in Vanderbilt history. The team posted seven shutout victories, being scored upon in only three games. The team's only loss came to {{national}} champion Harvard. The Commodores also played to a tie with the Auburn Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Maryland defense had allowed opponents to score 31points in ten games and {{recorded}} six defensive shut-outs. Only Georgia {{had been able}} to score more than seven points. No ACC team has since held opponents to an equal or lesser amount of points. Maryland's rushing defense (83.9yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (3.1points allowed per game) ranked first in the nation. Maryland had outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 298–31. No ACC team scored more total points until 1967. Maryland's star quarterback, Bernie Faloney, had been injured midseason and saw limited game action {{for the remainder of the}} year. Back-up quarterback Charlie Boxold filled in for the majority of the Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became more vocal, dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored <b>its</b> <b>opponents</b> 162–16. As Kansas's Big 12 {{schedule}} began, the Jayhawks' winning ways continued, as they proved themselves against legitimate competition. On October 6, Kansas traveled to Manhattan, Kansas, home of then-ranked No.24 Kansas State University for the opening game of its Big12 schedule. In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season. Late in the fourth quarter, Reesing threw a ball that bounced off the facemask of wide receiver Dexton Fields before being intercepted. The interception set up a Kansas State touchdown that put Kansas into a 2421 hole with seven and a half minutes remaining. Reesing and the Jayhawks struck back quickly, however, and scored a 30-yard touchdown to take the lead for good.|$|E
