5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> riders in East Contra Costa, Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} a variety of {{sporting}} teams. The major football teams are the historically successful FC København and Brøndby. FC København plays at Parken in Østerbro. Formed in 1992, it is a merger of two older Copenhagen clubs, B 1903 (from the inner suburb Gentofte) and KB (from Frederiksberg). Brøndby plays at Brøndby Stadion in the inner suburb of Brøndbyvester. BK Frem is based {{in the southern part of}} Copenhagen (Sydhavnen, Valby). Other teams are FC Nordsjælland (<b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> Farum), Fremad Amager, B93, AB, Lyngby and Hvidovre IF.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1973 film Metro-land, which {{documented}} life in suburban London, Edward Mirzoeff was commissioned to create a new documentary with John Betjeman. Mirzoeff noticed that aside <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> themes, the Church of England was the other major influence on Betjeman's poetry. His proposal to the poet was for a study of the Church of England to be titled Failed in Divinity, a line derived from Betjeman's poetic autobiography Summoned by Bells, in which the poet relates how was sent down from the University of Oxford after failing a compulsory examination on divinity. In Mirzoeff's first treatment, Betjeman would have embarked on a journey around Britain studying fine cathedrals, churches and their congregations. Betjeman ruled against the title, but liked the idea, although he was keen that the film should be primarily about the Church and its people, and not himself.|$|E

The highway intersects SR 276 (Cross Keys Road) {{a short distance}} northeast of the village of Cross Keys and crosses Mill Creek east of the village. SR 253 curves southwest and crosses the North River into the village of Port Republic, then curves back southeast and exits the village by crossing the South River {{just west of the}} confluence of the two rivers to form the South Fork Shenandoah River. SR 253 has an intersection with the northern end of SR 825 (South River Road) and a level crossing of Norfolk Southern Railway's Roanoke District before reaching its eastern terminus at US 340 (East Side Highway); Port Republic Road continues as SR 659.|$|E

25|$|This was an {{extremely}} busy service for passengers transferring <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> trains at Central, particularly prior {{to the opening of}} the city underground railway lines in 1926. Trams operated from Central station down Castlereagh Street to Circular Quay and back up Pitt Street in a large anti-clockwise loop. These tracks were also used as the city route for some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods.|$|E
25|$|Housing {{in urban}} areas may include more apartments and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major {{difference}} <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures, as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing {{in urban areas}}. Urban residents {{are also more likely}} to travel by mass transit, and children are more likely to walk or cycle rather than being driven by their parents.|$|E

25|$|Passenger rail service {{declined}} {{from a variety}} of factors (particularly the advent of the automobile) in the mid 20th century, even as commuting <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> locations to urban business districts remained common. In 1968, the PRR folded into Penn Central, which took over its passenger operations. On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over most intercity passenger service in the United States, including some trains on the B and PRR. The remaining Washington-Baltimore and Washington-Brunswick commuter service was operated by the B and Penn Central without subsidies.|$|E
25|$|Bicycling is an {{increasingly}} popular transportation mode in Sacramento, which enjoys a mild climate and flat terrain.

Many employees who work downtown commute by bicycle <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> communities on a dedicated bicycle path on the American River Parkway. Sacramento was designated as a Silver Level Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists in September 2006.

25|$|The Airport Line (formerly the R1 Airport) is a {{route of}} the SEPTA Regional Rail {{commuter}} rail system, which officially runs between Philadelphia International Airport and Center City, Philadelphia. In practice however, only a few trains originate or terminate in Center City while most are through routed with lines to the north, primarily the Warminster Line. In a planned reversal of this practice, sometime in late November 2015, SEPTA posted on its website that, beginning December14, more trains would originate/ terminate at Jenkintown station during the weekdays. The line between Center City and the Airport Terminals runs {{seven days a week}} from 5:00 AM to midnight with trains every 30 minutes. The trip length <b>from</b> <b>Suburban</b> Station to the airport is 19 to 24 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1890s, an {{extensive}} streetcar system and railroad stations enabled commuters to travel <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> towns bordering St. Louis City {{into the inner}} city core. Towns such as Kirkwood, Maplewood, Webster Groves, Richmond Heights, University City, and Clayton grew rapidly between 1900 and 1930. Restrictions on immigration and extensive movement to these towns doubled the population of St. Louis County from 1910 to 1920, while St. Louis City only grew 12 percent in the same period. During the 1930s, St. Louis City's population declined by a small amount for the first time, but St. Louis County grew by nearly 30 percent. Nearly 80 percent of new construction in the region occurred outside city limits during the late 1930s, and St. Louis planners were unable to combat the problem via annexation.|$|E
25|$|With the Southern Railway {{concentrating on}} the design of larger {{locomotives}} for the increasingly heavy express passenger traffic on the South Eastern and South Western sections, with designs such as the King Arthur, Schools and Lord Nelson classes, and later the Bulleid Pacifics, as well as the expansion of the electrified third rail system <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> roles (a system which had replaced the LB overhead electrification, which in turn had replaced the role of the D class tanks on suburban traffic from around 1910), the company was not concerned about replacing the veteran tank engines on branch line workings, especially as many of the smaller branch lines were not economically viable for electrification, or were isolated {{from the rest of the}} electrified network. As a result, the Southern Railway felt that perseverance with the older locomotives such as the A1X on rural routes was the most economically viable option.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{towards a}} {{streamlined}} local government to control local infrastructure was made {{as early as}} 1907 by member of federal Parliament, {{and founder of the}} Toronto Globe, William Findlay Maclean, who called for the expansion of the government of the former City of Toronto {{in order to create a}} Greater Toronto. The idea for a single government municipality would not be seriously explored until the late 1940s when planners decided the city needed to incorporate its immediate suburbs. However, due to strong opposition <b>from</b> <b>suburban</b> politicians, a compromise was struck which resulted in the creation of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1953, the portion of York County south of Steeles Avenue, a concession road and township boundary, was severed from the county and incorporated as the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. With the concession of Metro Toronto, the offices of York County were moved from Toronto to Newmarket.|$|E
