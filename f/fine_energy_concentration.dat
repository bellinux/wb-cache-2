40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} effects of changing energy intake, either by restricting feed intake or by altering dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentration,</b> on the growth performance of pigs. The relative abilities of the DE, ME and NE systems to predict pig growth performance were also evaluated. A total of 72 barrows, having initial body-weights of 30 ± 2 kg, {{were randomly assigned to}} one of nine dietary treatments. These treatments were organized in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement consisting of three dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentrations</b> (2. 18, 2. 29 and 2. 40 Mcal NE/kg) and three levels of feed allowance (80, 90 and 100 % of ad libitum). Actual feed allowances of 79, 91 and 100 % of ad libitum were achieved. No interactive effects of feeding level and dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> were observed (P > 0. 10). Increases in feed allowance from 79 to 91 to 100 % of ad libitum resulted in increases in daily intakes of feed (P 0. 10) basis. The efficiency with which dietary energy was used for weight gain was unaffected by feeding level (P > 0. 10). Increases in dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> were accompanied by decreases in daily feed intakes (P = 0. 0016); however, dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> did not affect daily energy intakes (P > 0. 10). Neither average daily gains nor feed conversion efficiencies were affected by changes in dietary <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> (P > 0. 10). Additionally, there were no differences among <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> treatments in terms of the amount of dietary energy available for body-weight gain (P > 0. 10) or the efficiency with which it was used (P > 0. 10). No differences were observed between the DE, ME and NE systems in terms of their abilities to predict the growth performance of pigs. The present study demonstrates that the energy intake of pigs can be effectively manipulated via adjustments in feeding level and that changes in dietary energy density, over the range studied here, are unable to affect changes in energy intake. This finding indicates that extreme caution should be used when extrapolating data obtained from studies in which feed allowance was manipulated to scenarios (e. g. commercial practice) in which energy density is to be altered, and vice versa...|$|R

30|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>concentration</b> of the S-transform in the time-frequency domain {{has been}} {{addressed}} in this paper by optimizing {{the width of the}} window function used. A new scheme is developed and referred to as a window width optimized S-transform. Two optimization schemes have been proposed, one for a constant window width, the other for time-varying window width. The former is intended for signals with constant or slowly varying frequencies, while the latter can deal with signals with fast changing frequency components. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using a set of test signals. The results have indicated that the new scheme can provide much improved <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> in the time-frequency domain in comparison with the standard S-transform. It is also shown using the test signals that the proposed scheme can lead to higher <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> in comparison with other standard linear techniques, such as short-time Fourier transform and its adaptive forms. Finally, the method has been demonstrated on engine knock signal analysis to show its effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to improve the <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> of the Stockwell {{transform}} (S-transform) in the time–frequency domain. Amodified S-transform is proposed with several parameters to control the width of ahybrid Gaussian window. Aconstrained optimization problem is proposed based on an <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> measure as objective function and inequalities constraints to define the bounds of the Gaussian window. An active-set algorithm is applied to resolve the optimization problem. The optimization of the <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> in the time–frequency plane can lead to more reliable applications for non-stationary signals. The simulation results show a significant improvement of the proposed methodology most notably in the presence of noise comparing with the standard S-transform and existing modified S-transform in the literature. Moreover, comparisonwith other knowntime–frequency transforms such as Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and smoothed-pseudo Wigner–Ville distribution (SPWVD) is also performed and discussed. The proposed S-transform is tested also on real non-stationary signals through an example of split detection in heart sound...|$|R

For the determination of dose a relation between the potential alpha <b>energy</b> <b>concentration</b> of the radon progeny exposure (Cp t) and dose the so-called dose conversion factor (DCF = Dose/Cp t) is needed.
