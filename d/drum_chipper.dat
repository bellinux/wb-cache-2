40|$|The study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} chipper type on productivity, power demand, fuel consumption and product quality. Tests were conducted on two commercial chipper models, a disc and a <b>drum</b> <b>chipper.</b> Both chippers had the same diameter capacity, were applied to the same tractor and fed with the same feedstock types. Fifteen replications were conducted per machine and for each of four different feedstock types, reaching a total of 120 tests. The disc chipper had a higher energy efficiency and used 19 % less fuel per unit product, possibly due to its simpler design, integrating comminuting and discharge system in one synergic device. In contrast, the <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> was 8 % more productive, since it cut with the same energy all {{along the length of}} its knives. The <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> produced smaller chips, with a higher incidence of fines. Feedstock type had a strong effect on productivity, energy efficiency and product quality. The effect of feedstock type was mainly related to piece size, and may be stronger than the effect of chipper type. Further studies should determine the effect of blade wear on the relative performance of the two chipper types...|$|E
40|$|Chipper {{design is}} a main driver of {{production}} efficiency within forest fuel supply chains, but little scientific knowledge is available about {{the performance of}} different types. Two alternative <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> designs were tested on different feedstock types and under different knife wear conditions. The closed drum full-length knife design was more efficient than the open drum staggered-knife design, when negotiating branches, especially when knives were dull. Under these conditions, productivity was higher, fuel use lower and product quality better for the closed drum design. These differences were statistically significant. Therefore, a closed drum design is preferable when branches are the main feedstock, especially if product quality specifications are demanding. In general, the performance of both designs was significantly affected by feedstock type and knife wear...|$|E

The reversible feed system allows the newer style <b>drum</b> <b>chippers</b> to handle larger diameter materials. Modern drum-style chippers usually have a material capacity of 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm).|$|R
50|$|Wood chips {{used for}} {{chemical}} pulp must be relatively uniform {{in size and}} free of bark. The optimum size varies with the wood species. It is important to avoid damage to the wood fibres as this {{is important for the}} pulp properties. For roundwood it is most common to use disk chippers. A typical size of the disk is 2.0 - 3.5 m in diameter, 10 - 25 cm in thickness and weight is up to 30 tons. The disk is fitted with 4 to 16 knives and driven with motors of ½ - 2 MW. <b>Drum</b> <b>chippers</b> are normally used for wood residuals from saw mills or other wood industry.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{tested a}} chipper {{prototype}} adopting a new comminution device, designed to produce high quality chips when processing delimbed logs. The machine was fitted with innovative tubular blades, {{mounted on a}} flywheel. The prototype was powered by a 55 kW farm tractor through the standard power take-off. The machine appeared as efficient as most conventional disc or <b>drum</b> <b>chippers</b> in the same size class, but offered a much better chip quality. Chips were free from any particles longer than 45 mm, and with a very limited content of fine particles (max. 2. 5 %). Of course, this was achieved when using premium wood raw material, such as delimbed small logs. Performance varied with tree species: poplar was the softest and easiest to chip, whereas robinia was the hardest and required a much larger effort. Diesel fuel consumption varied between 3. 4 and 4. 3 dm 3 per oven-dry tonne. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The study {{determined}} the productivity, fuel consumption and product quality obtained {{with a new}} tractor-powered <b>drum</b> <b>chipper,</b> designed to reduce the gap between industrial chippers and small-scale chippers. The machine was tested with poplar logs and beech slabs, considered as representative of the raw material commonly used for energy wood production. After accounting for accessory work and delays, productivity of green chips ranged between 4 and 6 tons per scheduled machine hour, which was very good for a tractor-powered unit. Specific fuel consumption of oven-dry chips varied between 2. 5 and 3. 0 L per ton, or 0. 6 L per m 3. These figures compared favourably with those obtained from previous studies of both smaller and bigger chippers. Chip quality was very good. Samples contained no oversize particles, qualifying for use in small-scale plants. The average size of beech chips was significantly larger than for poplar chips, possibly due to the higher strength of beech wood. © 2013 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|The study {{determined}} the time consumption, fuel consumption and chip size obtained with two different industrial chippers, working with logging residues (tops and branches), thinning material and pulpwood. Specific time consumption per oven dry tons (odt) was 83 % {{higher for the}} less powerful disc chipper, and chipping forest residues resulted in a 35 % increase in specific time consumption compared to chipping thinning material. What is more, {{the interaction between the}} two factors pointed at a different suitability of the two machines to chip different materials, since the difference in specific time consumption between the drum and the disc chipper was larger when chipping forest residues rather than thinning. Specific time and fuel consumption of the more powerful <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> increased by 30 % and 39 %, respectively, when working with dull blades compared to working with sharp blades. The best product quality was obtained when applying the disc chipper to pulpwood material. However, the same machine produced more fines when fed with forest residues...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades many Mediterranean sites were planted with conifers, which offered fast growth, good fibre quality and the {{capacity}} to grow on poor soils. If not thinned, these stands cannot develop strong and healthy trees and they become vulnerable to stress agents. The authors designed a complete operation for the thinning of confer plantations under favourable terrain conditions by a feller-buncher, a farm tractor equipped with a skidding grapple, mounted on the three-point hitch and a trailer-mounted <b>drum</b> <b>chipper.</b> The whole investment in mechanical equipment was very limited, in the order of 6 338, 000, including the truck and a tractor to move the chipper. Felling and extraction were quite balanced, with an average productivity around 40 trees hour 1. A spreadsheet was developed {{in order to determine the}} effect of tract size on biomass delivered cost, a crucial issue in Non Industrial Private Forests (NIPF) where the problems inherent to the generally small tract size are compounded by the limited quantity and value of the harvest...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis as been {{implemented}} during the spring term 2009 at the University of Gävle. The company Bruks produces mobile chippers which are used for chipping logging slash, roundwood and parts of trees. The chipper is powered by a separate diesel engine and the chipper can be assembled on trucks, trailers or some other carrier vehicles. When the chip has passed the <b>chipper</b> <b>drum,</b> the chip is collected in an integrated bin which is mounted on the vehicles frame with dumping yokes. When these dumping yokes were designed they were probably created with large material dimensions. The aim with the degree project is hence to study the strengths of materials and, if possible, to suggest an arrangement that can decrease the total weight on the dumping yoke on Bruks´ mobile chippers 805 CT. The CAD-program Pro/ENGINEER was used during the project for outlining the 2 Ddrawings, as distributed of constructors on Bruks, to solid 3 D-parts. The three-dimensional assembly from Pro/ENGINEER was transferred to Pro/MECHANICA. The construction is complex and contains many components, and therefore the model has been divided into two different parts, the external and the internal dumping yoke. The conclusion of the degree project is that the product generally is not over dimensioned. However there are many options for optimizing, mainly on the external dumping yokes...|$|R
40|$|The {{work was}} turned near Crotone (KR), in a 20 year-old {{plantation}} of Eucalyptus occidentalis Endl. positioned in hill zones, with average slope next to 27 %. The utilisation system was the Full Tree System (FTS). The felling {{on the six}} yards {{has been done by}} chainsaw and the first coppice bunching was manual. fts 1, 2 - The extraction has been done by one drum forest winch applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 3, 4 - The extraction has been done by two drums forest winch, applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 5, 6 - The extraction has been done by light tower yarder powered by one drum forest winch applied to the three point hitch of a wheeled farm tractor forest version. fts 1, 3 and 5 - At the landing the coppice have been processed by chainsaw in 2 meters length trunks. The slash accumulated and the trunks staked manually. fts 2, 4 and 6 - At the landing the coppice have been chipped by <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> with manual feed. The machine was a tractor powered chipper. At the landing the wood has been differentiated in two types. The type from the yards “fts 1, 3, 5 ” were 2 meters length trunks and the other type from the yards “fts 2, 4, 6 ” were chips for energy production. For the 2 meters length trunks the transport has been done by truck with 16 t of load capacity, and hydraulic crane. This material at the staple will be chipping by <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> with autonomous engine and mechanical feed. The chips transport will be done by truck with 17 t of load capacity. From the working times analysis and the wood quantitative obtained we studied the energy balance in the yards. We used the GER (Goss Energy Requirement) method. From the results obtained, the best work methodology seems to be that of full trees chipping directly at the landing and the chips transport at the staple. For the bunching and the extraction the best productivity result is given from the tractor with one drum forest winch. Considering the energy balance the yard that guarantees the greater efficiency is the “fts 4 ”, where has been employed for the extraction the tractor with two drums forest winch. The mechanization typology that supplied the better energy efficiency is that of the yards “fts 2, 4 and 6 ” where the full trees has been chipped to the landing...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> was fed alternately and piecewise with poplar {{stems and}} poplar tops, {{in order to}} determine the effect of piece size and tree part on machine performance. Chipping stems required most of the available power (231 kW) delivered by the tractor, whereas chipping tops took about half that much. However, productivity was twice as high with stems, compared to tops (i. e. 25 and 11 t h− 1 of oven dry wood, respectively). As a consequence, specific fuel consumption per unit product was 15 % lower with stems, compared to tops – i. e. 0. 61 and 0. 72 L m− 3, respectively. Mean feeding speed was 0. 37 m s− 1 for stems and 0. 41 m s− 1 for tops, but the difference was not significant (p = 0. 1677). Productivity and fuel consumption were strongly related to piece size, but tree part had its own additional effect, independent from size and possibly related to form. When chipping tops it is advisable to feed more pieces at a time, in order to partly compensate for the effect of piece size. Operators expecting to chip primarily small-size materials may acquire special chipper versions with wider drums and additional side rollers, for smoother mass feeding...|$|E
40|$|Issue: In {{addition}} to contaminant removal and screening, size-reduction {{is one of}} the key processes in preparing recovered wood waste for a variety of commodity feedstock and specialty product markets. There are several types of equipment that processors can employ to accomplish size reduction. Each type of equipment varies with respect to the forms of wood waste it can effectively handle and the quality of the product it produces. Selection and utilization of the appropriate size-reduction equipment allows processors to convert wood waste into the highest value products attainable from the raw material. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using chipping equipment for size-reduction of specific forms of wood waste to produce finished product of a particular quality. Types of Chipping Equipment. Disc Chipper: A disc chipper consists of a series of embedded knives arranged around a large steel ‘disc. ’ As the disc rotates, the knives pass a fixed anvil directly at the chipper’s infeed. Disc chippers can have either vertical or horizontal infeeds. The number, position, and bevel of the knives and anvil are critical to the size and quality of the chips produced, as well as the chipping speed. Drum Chipper: A <b>drum</b> <b>chipper</b> consists of a series of knives evenly spaced around a large rotor. The knives chip the wood waste as they pass over a steel anvil at the chipper’s infeed.

40|$|Wood chips need {{to fulfill}} {{specific}} quality parameters {{in order to}} be used as fuel for industrial or residential use. Moisture content and chip size distribution are recognized as the main physical characteristics affecting energy conversion efficiency. Objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effects of harvesting mode on the quality of wood chips, under the typical conditions offered by SRC poplar grown in Central Italy. Single-pass and two-pass harvesting were compared. Standing stems and cut windrowed stems were harvested using two modified foragers alternately equipped with a drum or a disc chipper, allowing a further comparison of different chipping devices. Data were obtained from 3 fields in Central Italy and allowed analyzing the drying process occurring when stems are felled and stored in the field as windrows. The mean water content at the time of cutting was 59 % (wH 2 O) (wH 2 O), which was reduced below 30 % after about 100 days of storage in the windrows. Regression analysis of storage duration and moisture content showed that air temperature is the main driver of the drying process, under the typical conditions of a Mediterranean climate. Harvest mode (single-pass or two-pass) and chipping device (drum or disc) have a significant effect on particle-size distribution. The incidence of accept particle was higher when chipping windrowed stems or using the <b>drum</b> <b>chipper.</b> The paper discusses the advantages of two-pass harvesting and emphasizes the importance of flexibility when choosing harvest mode and chipper type...|$|E
40|$|Chip size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} quality variable not only for buyers of forest fuels, but also for chipping contractors as it influences both fuel consumption and productivity of chippers. Studies of disc chippers and of drum chippers with closed drums have shown that increased chip target length increases chipper productivity and decreases fuel consumption per ton of chips produced. For open drum chippers, chip length is partly controlled by the mesh size in the sieve. In order to evaluate how this sieve affects productivity and fuel consumption of chippers, two open drum machines for professional chipping of forest fuels were studied. Small chippers were represented by a Kesla 645, and larger ones by an Eschlböck Biber 92. The Kesla 645 was studied with 25, 50, and 100 mm sieves and the Biber 92 with 35, 50, and 100 mm sieves. With the 100 mm sieve the Kesla chipper produced 14. 5 oven dry ton (odt) of chips per effective hour and the Biber 30. 0 odt per effective hour. Fuel consumption per odt was 3. 0 l for the Kesla and 2. 1 l for the Biber. A reduction of sieve mesh size decreased productivity and increased fuel consumption for both machines. Reducing the mesh size decreased the size of produced chips for the Kesla, {{but not for the}} Biber. The sieve on the Biber seems to be a safety measure against oversized pieces whereas chip size is, as on a closed <b>drum</b> <b>chipper,</b> mainly controlled by the cut length of the knives...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the problems of}} energy supply and waste utilization of the forest industries. As a solution, it proposes to use gasification to utilize wood leftovers, which is followed by electric power generation from combustion of producer gas. The plant was {{expected to have a}} power of 150 kW. The proposed power technology plant comprises a line for pre-treatment of wood chips, a gas generator (gasifier) and a gas turbine unit. The paper justifies a need for preliminary preparation of wood waste, particularly chipping and drying. Various drying schemes have been analyzed. A line for pre-treatment of wood chips comprises a <b>drum</b> <b>chipper,</b> a receiving raw material wood container and a drum dryer using fume gases. A co-current gasifier is chosen because of the high content of tar in the original fuel. In the co-current gasifier, most of the tar, passing through the high temperature area, is burned. The paper offers high temperature dry cleaning of producer gas in the cyclone separator. Such a scheme of cleaning provides high efficiency of the plant and simplifies its design, but suspended particles still remain in the producer gas. When analyzing the schemes of power converters this is taken into account. A choice of the gas turbine as a power converter is justified. To reduce the erosion damage of the turbine blades there is a proposal to use an unconventional gas turbine scheme with air turbine and a combustion chamber located downstream of the turbine. In this plant the air rather than the combustion gas passes through the turbine. The air from turbine goes into the combustion chamber, the combustion gas passes through the air heater, where it transfers heat to the air. Such scheme allows reducing power costs for the fuel gas compression before the combustion chamber. Optimization of the gas turbine cycle is performed. The optimum compressor pressure ratio is 3, 7. The plant efficiency for this pressure ratio is 25, 7 %. Calculation results of the main elements are reported. Thus, the power technology plant, which allows us to solve problems of energy supply and waste utilization of the forest industries, is proposed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the competitiveness of various supply systems of small-diameter wood harvested from young stands for fuel. Trees were harvested for the cost comparison either as (i) delimbed longwood or (ii) as whole trees or (iii) the harvesting was based on bundle-harvesting using the Fixteri II bundle harvester. The felling of whole trees and delimbed longwood was carried out using a conventional harvester head equipped with multi-tree-handling accessories. Forwarding was carried out using a standard medium-sized forwarder. The comparison of procurement costs was done at stand level {{as a function of}} breast height diameter (5 - 13 cm) and on-road transportation distance (5 - 160 km). The harvested wood was chipped either at a roadside landing or at a terminal using a trailer-mounted <b>drum</b> <b>chipper.</b> The comparison of the supply systems was done using recently published productivity parameters and data obtained from complementary field studies. According to the cost assessment, whole-tree harvesting and chipping at the roadside landing was almost invariably the most cost-efficient supply system. The cost of whole-tree and delimbed longwood chips was at the same level when the breast height diameter of the harvested trees was 11 cm (pine) or more. The felling of whole trees is cheaper, but the cost difference diminished as a function of tree size. The productivity of forwarding, transportation and chipping of delimbed longwood was significantly higher compared to that of whole trees. When applying roadside chipping in Finnish conditions with small and sparsely located forest holdings, acquiring large enough concentrations of wood for profitable production is a great challenge. Machine relocations can be reduced by transporting raw material to terminals or the end-use facility to be chipped. However, the low bulk density of the initial material restricts the operation radius unless the wood biomass is pre-processed. According to the results of our study, harvesting of delimbed energy wood is a promising way to simplify operations and to reduce transportation and chipping costs. In the case of whole-tree bundling, savings in transportation and chipping costs did not offset the high felling and compaction costs, and the bundling system was the least competitive alternative...|$|E
