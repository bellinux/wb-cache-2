Samuel Taylor Coleridge <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fellwalking during the years when he lived near Keswick. In August 1800, barely a month after moving there, he went to visit his friends William and Dorothy Wordsworth in Grasmere, taking a route over Helvellyn and arriving at ten in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The band <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> experimenting and {{arranging}} in Cardiff {{before going into}} the studio, {{as a result of}} which Love Kraft was recorded in just three weeks. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan also attributes the album sessions' speedy conclusion to producer Mario Caldato Jr. who was very good at keeping the group together and on the right track.|$|E
5|$|The third {{session on}} Saturday {{was held in}} dry conditions. The two Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton set the fastest times, with Rosberg being about three-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo was third, half a second down on Rosberg's 1:33.995 lap time. Kvyat in the other Red Bull {{did not have a}} good session, ending up {{eleventh}} fastest after running wide at both Spoon and the Degner corners. Behind Ricciardo, the Williams cars led the two Ferrari drivers in a session where drivers <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> laps {{to make up for the}} limited running on Friday.|$|E

I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) {{shots were}} done with the Tiger Moth biplane. During one such time {{at the end of}} summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were responsible for the death, the production team <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E

25|$|After {{an absence}} of over twelve months, Ashley {{returned}} to England, and soon succeeded his father as Earl of Shaftesbury. He took an active part, on the Whig side, {{in the general election}} of 1700–1701, and again, with more success, in the autumn election of 1701. At this time, he built a folly structure on the Shaftesbury Estate, known as the Philosopher's Tower. This folly sits in a field, clearly visible from the B3078 just south of Cranborne. It is thought that he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> his philosophising in this tower, and from this suggestion it has become known as the Philosopher's Tower.|$|E
25|$|A fervent {{champion}} of the professional cricketer's rights, Shaw <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work {{in support of his}} contemporaries. He declined to tour with WG Grace in 1873/74 because the professionals in the squad were to be afforded only second-class facilities. In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal contract of employment to guarantee an automatic benefit {{at the end of an}} agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper was the way to go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side. There was eventually a reconciliation, however, and Shaw took on the capaincy once more.|$|E
25|$|Star Académie drew {{criticism}} for the capitalist and vertical integration strategies of producing megacompany Quebecor to publicize {{the show and}} make it profitable. For example, each vote from the public costs one dollar, the website is in large part reserved to paying members and the Quebecor company, massive owner of many Quebec media, heavily promoted the show via TVA (its own television network), all of its magazines and newspapers like 7 Jours and Journal de Montréal. Astral Media's RockDétente also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> heavy promoting themselves during the 2005 edition, as the official stations of Star Académie. Also were criticized the instant celebrity machine and supposed lack of artistic integrity aspects of the whole enterprise.|$|E

25|$|The Rangers <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{retooling}} in the 2011–2012 off season. Staff ace C. J. Wilson {{left the}} team to join the division rival Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels also upgraded their offense with the signing of Albert Pujols, causing more parity within the division. The Rangers responded by signing Yu Darvish of the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Central League in Nippon Professional Baseball of Japan. The team also converted closer Neftalí Feliz to a starting pitcher upon signing Joe Nathan to take over closing duties in the bullpen. The Rangers would not repeat as AL West champions, but would qualify for the postseason as the top wild card team in the AL. They would lose the wild game to the Orioles.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shit talking, and they <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
25|$|Essex needed 299 to win, and {{had four}} {{sessions}} to do it. They lost Ravinder Bopara after 12 minutes, caught off Liam Plunkett, but Andy Flower and Alastair Cook forged a 72-run partnership before Durham medium-pacer Mark Davies struck and had Cook caught behind. At stumps on day three, Essex were 129 for 2. Lewis and Gareth Breese <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bowling for Durham {{on the fourth}} day, totalling 65.1 of Durham's total of 100.1 overs, and after Ronnie Irani departed for 48, Durham limited the Essex partnerships {{to no more than}} 25. Andy Flower stood tall, however, spending six and a half hours at the crease to end with 132 not out - and his eighth-wicket partnership of 25 saw Essex cut the target to 10. Palladino hung in there with Flower, contributing a single, and Essex won by two wickets.|$|E

25|$|Next up was an away {{series against}} the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira didn't turn in his best showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.4. He <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, {{it was time for a}} five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the {{subsequent}} three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Wilder and Chandler had {{intended}} to retain as much of Cain’s original dialogue as possible. It was Chandler who first realized that the dialogue from the novella would not translate well to the screen. Wilder disagreed and was annoyed that Chandler was not putting more of it into the script. To settle it, Wilder hired a couple of contract players from the studio to read passages of Cain’s original dialogue aloud. To Wilder's astonishment, Chandler was right and, in the end, the movie’s cynical and provocative dialogue was more Chandler and Wilder than it was Cain. Chandler also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fieldwork while working on the script and took large volumes of notes. By visiting various locations that figured into the film, {{he was able to}} bring a sense of realism about Los Angeles that seeped into the script. For example, he hung around Jerry's Market on Melrose Avenue in preparation for the scene where Phyllis and Walter would discreetly meet to plan the murder.|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
