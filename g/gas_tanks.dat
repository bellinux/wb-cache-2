5000|$|Roy Suarez Garcia (1945-2003) AKA [...] "Chicano Roy" [...] was an American {{motorcycle}} builder and inventor.

50|$|Flores-Montano ("Flores") {{was driving}} a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon as he {{attempted}} to enter the United States through the port of entry at Otay Mesa, California. A customs inspector referred the vehicle to secondary inspection, where a second inspector tapped the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> and noticed it sounded solid. The second inspector summoned a mechanic who, less {{than half an hour}} later, arrived and removed the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> from the car. The mechanic then removed an access plate from the tank and found 37 kilograms of marijuana. The process of removing the <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> took between 15 and 25 minutes.|$|R

The mission was accomplished in 200 Earth orbits.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} 1993–2004 model year Jeep Grand Cherokees which involves the fuel tanks of these SUVs. Because the <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> are mounted between the bumper and rear axle, a rear collision could cause the fuel tank to leak, causing a fire. The NHTSA claims that it has reports of 157 deaths resulting from fires caused by Grand Cherokees crashing. Also affected are 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty models and 1986–2001 Jeep Cherokee models, which totals about 5.1 million affected vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Photographic expeditions and {{geological}} {{surveys were}} undertaken {{for the duration}} of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on November 28, 1929, the first flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot/radioman Harold June, and photographer Ashley McKinley, flew the Ford Trimotor to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty <b>gas</b> <b>tanks,</b> as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau, but they were ultimately successful.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{announced}} in 2007 that 24 helium and nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> in Atlantis were older than their designed lifetime. These composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) {{were designed for}} a 10-year life and later cleared for an additional 10 years; they exceeded this life in 2005. NASA said it could not guarantee any longer that the vessels on Atlantis would not burst or explode under full pressure. Failure of these tanks could have damaged parts of the orbiter and even wound or kill ground personnel. An in-flight failure of a pressure vessel could have even resulted {{in the loss of}} the orbiter and its crew. NASA analyses originally assumed that the vessels would leak before they burst, but new tests showed that they could in fact burst before leaking.|$|E
500|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} were {{in effect}} from the Virginia Capes to Morehead, North Carolina and a Hurricane alert was issued northward to Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dump trucks loaded with dirt {{were ready to}} make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill, due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood. Recent flooding, from Hurricane Diane, along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike, business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose. New York City officials prepared for the worst, with police officers filling <b>gas</b> <b>tanks</b> of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty {{in advance of the}} hurricane. [...] Flights were canceled in New York, firemen stood at the ready in Staten Island, and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm.

5000|$|Flores argued {{he had an}} {{expectation}} of privacy in his <b>gas</b> <b>tank.</b> But the Court pointed out that a reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished at the international border. [...] "It {{is difficult to imagine}} how the search of a <b>gas</b> <b>tank,</b> which should be solely a repository for fuel, could be more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment." [...] Flores also pointed to the potential of a search like the one at issue in this case to cause damage to the vehicle. But the Court replied that the searches are not truly destructive, and that {{there was not a single}} accident among the [...] "many thousands of <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> disassemblies that have occurred at the border." [...] A <b>gas</b> <b>tank</b> search is a brief procedure that can easily be reversed without damaging the vehicle, and if by chance the vehicle were damaged in the process, the owner could sue for damages.|$|R
