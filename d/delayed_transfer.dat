40|$|Health {{and social}} care {{agencies}} in the UK. have been under pressure {{for some time to}} reduce <b>delayed</b> <b>transfers</b> of older people from hospital because they absorb scarce health service resources and incur a human cost through inappropriate placement. A local study based on an analysis of records and interviews with managers showed that delays reflect the complex needs of older people, and arise from financing and organisational problems at both the planning and implementation stages of a discharge. Family resistance may also be a factor. Budgetary constraints result in delays in confirming public support for some clients. Shortages of professional staff and care assistants limit the provision of domiciliary packages. The contraction of the residential sector has reduced the availability of beds and increased the cost of care home placements.

This study was a semi-empirical and applied research and a pretest-posttest plan with two experimental groups was used. Statistical sample included 28 volunteer girl students, {{with a mean age}} of 16 ± 0. 93 years old, who were all right-handed and had no experience of performing the tracking task. After initial familiarization with designed software, the subjects were randomly divided into two groups of right practice and left practice. The results revealed significant effects of time lags and skill complexity on bidirectional transfer (p≤ 0. 05), as at all stages of research more bidirectional transfer was observed in easy task compared with the hard one. The highest bilateral transfer in easy and hard tasks was found in the second and the seventh day, respectively. Possible reasons for these results include the differences in task processing in terms of skill complexity and the impact of special features of continuous task on retention. Transfer from non-dominant hand to dominant one occurred more frequently than the reverse mode in both groups, which is probably due to higher speed of transfer of data from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in the right-handed...|$|E

40|$|Prevention and {{management}} of <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> of older people from hospital to community settings is an enduring issue in industrialised societies and {{is the subject of}} many recent policies in the United Kingdom. A deeper, evidence-based understanding of the complex organizational and interprofessional issues which contribute to delays in transfer has emerged in recent years. Despite this, and the relative success of recent policies, two recent reviews of the area highlight the lack of studies on patients’ perspectives. We sought to address this deficit by using conversational interviews and a phenomenological approach to explore and interpret participants’ perceptions of <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> from hospital into the community. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to incorporate participants from different categories of delay identified on weekly Situation Reports. Participants aged 65 years and over (mean age 82 ± 5. 4 years) and with a mean delay of 32 days (± 26) were recruited from three hospitals based in two NHS Trusts in the South of England. This paper focuses on their perceptions of the effects of <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> into the community, their involvement in discharge planning and future community care needs. Our findings show that participants actively or passively relinquished their involvement in the processes of discharge planning because of the perceived expertise of others and also feelings of disempowerment secondary to poor health, low mood, dependency, lack of information and the intricacies of discharge planning processes for complex community care needs. Participants expressed a longing for continuity, emphasised the importance of social contact and sometimes appeared unrealistic about their future care needs. While current policies may have helped reduce overall numbers of delayed patients in the UK, our study suggests that there is scope for improvement in the involvement of delayed patients in planning their discharge into the community...|$|E

We examined the determinants and outcomes of <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> of care in older adults. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in a district general hospital with a catchment population of 250, 000 in England, UK. Those >= 65 years admitted to two care of the elderly wards during February 2007 were identified and prospectively followed-up till their discharge. Data was presented descriptively. Results 36. 7 % (58 / 158) of patients had a delay in transfer of care. They tended to be older, had poorer pre-morbid mobility, and {{were more likely to be}} confused at the time of admission. Compared to the 2003 National Audit Report, a significantly higher percentage (29. 3 %vs. 17 %) awaited therapist assessments or (27. 6 %vs. 9 %) domiciliary care, with a lower percentage (Conclusion Awaiting therapy and domiciliary care input were significant contributing factors in <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> of care.

40|$|Directed {{information}} transfer measures {{are increasingly being}} employed in modeling neural system behavior due to their model-free approach, applicability to nonlinear and stochastic signals, and the potential to integrate repetitions of an experiment. Intracellular physiological recordings of graded synaptic potentials provide a number of additional challenges compared to spike signals due to non-stationary behaviour generated through extrinsic processes. We therefore propose a method to overcome this difficulty by using a preprocessing step based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to remove nonlinear trends and discontinuities. We apply the method to intracellular recordings of synaptic responses of identified motor neurons evoked by stimulation of a proprioceptor that monitors limb position in leg of the desert locust. We then apply normalized <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> entropy measures to neural responses evoked by displacements of the proprioceptor, the femoral chordotonal organ, that contains sensory neurones that monitor movements about the femoral-tibial joint. We then determine the consistency of responses within an individual recording of an identified motor neuron in a single animal, between repetitions of the same experiment in an identified motor neurons in the same animal and in repetitions of the same experiment from the same identified motor neuron in different animals. We found that <b>delayed</b> <b>transfer</b> entropy measures were consistent for a given identified neuron within and between animals and that they predict neural connectivity for the fast extensor tibiae motor neuron...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{high-voltage}} {{level shifter}} (HVLS) structure is proposed, {{which has a}} significantly improved transient response over existing structures. To overcome signal <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> of the conventional HVLS caused by parasitic capacitance due to high-voltage MOSFETs, this structure employs a novel circuit module “inverse Schmitt trigger” to drive the pull-up transistors of conventional HVLS. As a result, the “Miller Plateau” caused by parasitic capacitance can be minimized. Hence, the overall <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> of the structure is significantly reduced. The simulation results based on SPECTRE and 0. 5 μm high-voltage CMOS process show that compared to other currently available structures whose <b>transfer</b> <b>delays</b> are several nanoseconds on average, the proposed structure is able to provide a nanosecond <b>transfer</b> <b>delay</b> without using large boost capacitors which are impractical to be integrated or using complex logic units which decrease reliability of circuit.
