Our additional models, which address concerns of self-selection by using only charter applicants as matched <b>comparison</b> students, <b>yield</b> <b>similar</b> effect estimates and thus provide support for the use of matching designs in charter school evaluations...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the heterogeneity and the purity grade of three commercially available plasma-derived clotting factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates, which highly differ {{with regard to}} purification strategies, relative concentrations of stabilizers (von Willebrand factor, with or without albumin) and virus inactivation strategies (solvent/detergent and/or heat/pasteurization treatments). Western blot analyses were used to evaluate product-specific variations from Emoclot (R), Alphanate (R) and Haemate (R) both in the presence and absence of reducing agents (dithiotreithol). All the plasma-derived concentrates showed a strong heterogeneity, as they all included {{a significant amount of}} truncated forms of the full-length (FL) clotting FVIII protein. The intact protein accounted for the 38 % of the total FVIII proteins in Haemate (R) and 29 and 23 % in Alphanate (R) and Emoclot (R), respectively. Lower intact FVIII amounts in Emoclot might be mainly due to the low von Willebrand factor dosage and the absence of albumin. Upon addition of thrombin, both the FL and truncated forms of the FVIII protein were almost completely digested. Indeed, after thrombin activation, we could still observe a mixture of B-domain truncated forms of the FL protein along with biologically active digested-A 1 forms. Batch-to-batch variation was tested with no evident changes appearing among different batches. Despite the variables in manufacturing processes, inter-product <b>comparisons</b> <b>yielded</b> <b>similar</b> results for all the plasma-derived FVIII considered in this study. However, we could individuate in Emoclot a band that was not digested by thrombin, which we could characterize as the 200 kDa FVIII heavy chain. This investigation prompts new concerns about the strong heterogeneity observed upon thrombin digestion of plasma-derived FVIII, which might {{contribute to the development of}} inhibitory antibodies at an early stage of therapy, and to which extent these untoward phenomena could be avoided through direct intervention on routine manufacturing processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulations}} of existing free dendritic growth models were compared, and an extended model was proposed that employs a subregular solution model {{to compute the}} driving force for dendritic growth without Henrian restrictions. These models were also applied to a Ag- 15 mass pct Cu alloy to numerically compare their predictions. Models that address only the thermal, solutal, and curvature supercoolings do not properly account for the interface kinetics, even with modifications with the kinetic partition coefficient and liquidus slope. It is only in models that account for the interfacial driving force,-DG*, that the kinetic supercooling is properly addressed. All of the models in <b>comparison</b> <b>yield</b> numerically <b>similar</b> predictions for the solutal growth regime, but models that employ the kinetic partition coefficient and liquidus slope, but do not address the interfacial driving force, fail to correctly describe the thermal control regime. The solutal-to-thermal transition {{is characterized by a}} rapid increase of interfacial driving force, which causes the tip temperature T * to increase with increasing growth rate V. The criterion for the transition stage is given as d lnðDGÞ=d ln V> 1...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral autoregulation is {{the process}} by which blood flow to the brain is {{maintained}} despite changes in arterial blood pressure. Experiments using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography allow rapid measurements of blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. Measurements of this velocity and a subject's arterial blood pressure are used in the assessment of the dynamic cerebral autoregulatory response. Two mathematical models representing the dynamic cerebral autoregulation response as a feedback mechanism, dependent on pressure and flow respectively, are derived. For each model two parameters are introduced, a rate of restoration and a time delay. Solutions for both flow between fixed plates and flow in a rigid pipe are obtained using Laplace transform methods. In both cases solutions for the velocity are found for a general arterial blood pressure, allowing the model to be applied to any experiment that uses changes in arterial blood pressure to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Velocity profiles are determined for the thigh cuff and vacuum box experiments, modelled as a step change and sinusoidal variation in pressure gradient in the middle cerebral artery respectively. The influence of the underlying heart and breathing cycles on measurements obtained from the vacuum box experiments is assessed, before results derived using the mathematical model with a flow dependent feedback mechanism are compared with data from the two experiments. The <b>comparisons</b> <b>yield</b> <b>similar</b> estimates for the rate of restoration and time delay suggesting that these parameters could be independent of the pressure change stimulus and depend only on the main features of the dynamic cerebral autoregulation process. The modelling also indicates that for imposed oscillatory variations in arterial blood pressure a small phase difference between the pressure and velocity waveforms does not necessarily imply impaired autoregulation. The ratio between the percentage variation in maximum velocity and pressure can be used, along with the phase difference, to indicate more accurately the nature of the autoregulatory response. Finally, the relationship between arterial blood pressure and pressure gradient in the middle cerebral artery is modelled using electrical analogue theory. The influence of this relationship on the autoregulation model for flow in a rigid pipe is investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{investigate}} {{the age and}} gender influence on maximal molar bite force and at outlining the criteria for normal masticatory muscle development {{in a sample of}} 177 Brazilian Caucasian dentate individuals aged 7 - 80 years divided into five age groups: I(7 - 12 years), II (13 - 20 years), III (21 - 40 years), IV (41 - 60 years), and V (61 - 80 years). Except for Group V, which comprised nine women and eight men, all groups were equally divided in respect to gender (20 M/ 20 F). Bite force was recorded with a mouth-adapted 1000 N dynamometer and the highest out of three records was regarded as the maximal bite force. The data were submitted to multivariate statistical analysis (SPSS 17. 0 p < 0. 05). Effects of group and gender were found, but no interactions between them. The ANOVA showed significant differences between groups bilaterally. Bonferroni`s test showed that group I had significantly lower bite force means at both sides as compared to all groups, except group V. No {{differences were found between the}} left and right sides. In all the groups, gender was found to be a significant factor associated with maximal bite force. A global comparison including all the subjects and measures showed that the means of men were approximately 30 % higher than those of women, within-group <b>comparisons</b> <b>yielded</b> <b>similar</b> results in all groups. Muscle thickness was measured with a SonoSite Titan ultrasound tool using a high-resolution real-time 56 mm/ 10 MHz linear-array transducer. Three ultrasound images were obtained from the bilateral masseter and temporal muscles at rest and at maximal voluntary contraction. The means of the three measures in each clinical condition were analyzed with multivariate statistical analysis (SPSS 17. 0 p < 0. 05). A gradual increase in thickness of the masseter and temporal muscles was found both at rest and maximal voluntary contraction for groups I to IV, whereas a decrease in muscle thickness was observed in group V. Multivariate analysis showed that in both conditions there was an effect of group and gender. The study of the development of the stomatognathic system in relation to age and gender can provide useful data for the identification of normal and impaired functioning patterns. The results of this study indicate that age and gender are associated with structural and functional alterations in the muscles of the stomatognathic system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
