Part I discusses the relevant sections of the Copyright Act and their interpretation by the courts. Part II demonstrates that compensated importation should be allowed when a work is out of print in the United States. Part III proposes a solution into eh form of a compulsory license for out-of-print imports where the work {{has been out of}} print in the United States for a certain length of time. This note concludes that the interests of the creators and of the public would be better served by allowing <b>importation</b> of <b>works</b> that are out of print in the United states...|$|R

Rothstein J. noted that this section protected Canadian copyright holders from parallel <b>importation</b> of copyrighted <b>works,</b> because an infringing work in Canada {{may not necessarily be}} infringing in the country of its manufacture. Therefore, s. 27(2)(e) requires, for imported goods, only that the plaintiff prove that the work [...] "would infringe copyright if it had been made in Canada by the person who made it." ...|$|R

The best results in terms of homogeneity of the quality of vegetable crops were achieved using inert substrates and application of nutrients; however, production costs are high due to the cost of irrigation systems and substrate management and <b>importation.</b> This <b>work</b> aims to evaluate the effect of the local substrate mix and the amount of organic fertilizer on different quality parameters of coriander. To evaluate the quality of coriander, we considered different parameters such as size, biomass, antioxidant capacity and aroma (evaluated by volatile compounds detection with gas chromatography). The results show that the culture system differentially affects each parameter, and the compounds associated with the aroma of coriander and the diameter of plants are sensitive to the culture system, while the length of plants, number of leaves and antioxidant activity are not affected by the concentration of fertilizer. Moreover, organic farming conditions do not reduce quality parameters of the crops when using adequate fertilization. Additionally, local substrates would be practical substitutes for expensive importations...|$|R

[p.396]Apostle {{recited the}} first Festival prayers {{after his arrival}} at Al-Madinah, and used {{frequently}} to pray, and to address those of his followers who lived far from the Harim,[FN#22] or Sanctuary. It is a trim modern building of cut stone and lime in regular layers, of parallelogramic shape, surmounted by one large and four small cupolas. These are all whitewashed; and the principal is capped with a large crescent, or rather a trident, rising {{from a series of}} gilt globes: the other domes crown the several corners. The minaret is of the usual Turkish shape, with a conical roof, and a single gallery for the Mu'ezzin. An Acacia-tree or two on the Eastern side, and behind it a wall-like line of mud houses, finish the coup-d'oeil; the interior of this building is as simple as is the exterior. And here I may remark that the Arabs have little idea of splendour, either in their public or in their private architecture. Whatever strikes the traveller's eye in Al-Hijaz is always either an <b>importation</b> or the <b>work</b> of foreign artists. This arises from the simple tastes of the people, combined, doubtless, with their notable thriftiness. If strangers will build for them, they argue, why should they build for themselves? Moreover, they have scant inducement to lavish money upon grand edifices. Whenever a disturbance takes place, domestic or from without, the principal buildings are sure to suffer. And the climate is inimical to their enduring. Both ground and air at Al-Madinah, as well as at Meccah, are damp and nitrous in winter, in summer dry and torrid: the lime is poor; palm-timber soon decays: even foreign wood-work suffers, and a few years of neglect suffice to level the proudest pile with the dust.|$|R
40|$|During Francisco Franco 2 ̆ 7 s {{regime in}} Spain, the {{government}} instituted a rigid control over all media of communication, a control which {{started at the}} end of the Spanish Civil War and ended in 1976, several months after Franco 2 ̆ 7 s death. All Latin American writers whose works were either imported to or edited and published in Spain, suffered its rigors. The effect of the francoist censorship on their work is studied. ^ Extensive archival material found in the Archivos Generales de la Administracion in Alcala de Henares serves as evidence of how the system of censorship functioned. The importation or publication of any work had to receive the approval of the censors. The record of the specific censorship implemented in 453 cases of applications by Latin American authors illustrates the treatment they received. ^ The historical, political, and ideological context in which this system functioned is explored as a background to the study of the censorship applied to literary works of Latin American authors. ^ The part played by the Instituto Nacional del Libro Espanol, and the impact that Spanish exiles of a Republican persuasion had in the development of the Latin American publishing scene are investigated. The effect of censorship on the <b>importation</b> of literary <b>works</b> written by Hispanic American authors is addressed in the context of the Latin American publishing world. ^ The censorship applied to novels (as a genre) of Latin American writers who published in Spain, is studied in depth as a specific example of the evolution of the censorship process during the Franco period. ^ As an example of the impact of the deletions and changes on literary texts, the mutilated work Tres tristes tigres, by Guillermo Cabrera Infante, is examined and a possible reconstruction of the original text is considered. ...|$|R
40|$|This study, {{which is}} the first and main part of a two-volume work, is {{concerned}} with the history and philology of original and translated works Adversus Iudaeos circulating among the Eastern Slavs from the baptism of Rus' c. 988 till the early 16 th century. Excluded is the literature of Lithuanian Ruthenia from the 14 th century onwards. On the material of 11 – 15 th-century MSS the dissemination of the works on East Slav soil has been traced in order to make out the main points in their textual history, particularly the circumstances of their entry into East Slavonic letters. The texts have been divided into four, partly overlapping, categories – Biblical works and works on world history; homiletics; disputations; tracts, epistles, and poems – and aspects of their textual history have been treated in as many chapters. Despite what has been traditionally claimed there is nothing generally to connect the composition, copying, or <b>importation</b> of anti-Judaic <b>works</b> in Rus' with vicissitudes within the Rus' Jewish community or in its rapport with Christian Slavs. On the contrary, nearly all anti-Judaic motives ascend to a common Christian heritage in exegesy, hagiography and homiletics passed on to Rus' from Byzantium and paralleled by its sister cultures in the Balkans, with which Rus' shared its set of translated model texts. The anti-Judaic tendencies of the literature of Kievan Rus', although not quite negligible, have been greatly exaggerated because several masterpieces of Kievan literature are paschal sermons with a highly traditional treatment of exegetical and hermeneutical Jews, playing a rôle in the passion of Christ and in salvation history. The bulk of anti-Judaic works known in Muscovy were imported only in the late 14 th century–early 15 th century, at a time when next to no Jews are recorded on East Slav territory outside Ruthenia and long before the rise of the heresy known in historiography as ‘the Judaisers’, notwithstanding that earlier scholarship has tended to connect the composition/importation of some of them with the campaign against these schismatics. This {{is not to say that}} the texts concerned cannot have been used against heretics or even Jews at a secondary stage. There was a heightened interest in Adversus Iudaeos texts in the second half of the 15 th century, which appears to culminate at the turn of the century, never to vanish entirely thereafter...|$|R
40|$|Concern about feeding an ever {{increasing}} population {{has long been}} one of humankind’s most pressing problems. This has been addressed throughout history by introducing into farming systems changes allowing them to produce more per unit of land area. However, these changes have also been linked to negative effects on the socio economic and environmental sphere, that have created {{the need for an}} integral understanding of this phenomenon. This thesis describes the application of learning machine methods to induct a relationship between the spectral response of farms’ land cover and their intensification levels from a sample of farming of Urdaneta municipality, Aragua state of Venezuela. Data collection like this is a necessary first steep to implement cost-effective methods that can help policymakers to conduct succesful planing tasks, especially in countries such as Venezuela where, in spite of there being areas capable of agricultural production, nearly 50 % of the internal food requirements of recent years have been satisfied by <b>importations.</b> In this <b>work,</b> farm intensification levels are investigated through a sample of farms of Urdaneta Municipality, Aragua state of Venezuela. This area is characterised by a wide diversity of farming systems ranging from crop to crop-livestock systems and an increasing population density in regions capable of livestock and arable farming, making it a representative case of the main tropical rural zones. The methodology applied can be divided into two main phases. First an unsupervised classification was performed by applying principal component analysis and agglomerative cluster methods to a set of land use and land management indicators, with the aim to segregate farms into homogeneous groups from the intensification point of view. This procedure resulted in three clusters which were named extensive, semi-intensive and intensive. The land use indicators included the percentage area within each farm devoted to annual crops, orchard and pasture, while the land management indicators were percentage of cultivated land under irrigation, stocking rate, machinery and equipment index and permanent and temporary staff ratio, all of them built from data held on the 1996 - 1997 venezuelan agricultural census. The previous clusters reached were compared to the ones obtained by applying the learning machine method known as self-organizing map, which is also an unsupervised classification technique, as a way to confirm the groups’ existence. In the second stage, the learning machine known as kernel adatron algorithm was implemented seeking to identify the intensification level of Urdaneta farms from a landsat image, which consisted of two sequential steps: namely training and validation. In the training step, a predetermined number of instances randomly selected from the data set were analysed looking for a pattern to establish a relationship between the label and the spectral response in an iterative process which was concluded when the machine found a linear function capable of separating the two classes with a maximum margin. The supervised classification finishes with the validation in which the kernel adatron classifies the unseen samples by using a generalisation of the relationships learned while training. Results suggest that farm intensification levels can be effectively derived from multi-spectral data by adopting a machine learning approach like the one described.
