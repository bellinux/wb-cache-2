40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of two image enhancement techniques for the picture archiving and communications systems imaging diagnostic workstation applied to computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography images. The first method is a contrast enhancement technique based on a class of nonlinear intensity transformations described by analytic transfer functions derived from <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> characteristic <b>curves.</b> The second method employs antialiasing techniques preventing the formation of Moiré patterns on subsampled CR images containing antiscatter grid lines, designed to achieve a good balance between artifact suppression and resolution degradation. These techniques {{are likely to become}} standard features for all high-end medical imaging workstations in the near future, and thus, we are suggesting that more powerful descriptions of these types of processing {{should be included in the}} Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine standard...|$|R

50|$|In 1888, Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> Vero Charles <b>Driffield</b> {{patented}} {{a device}} for estimating the actinic power of sunlight and for computing exposure times and apertures for cameras, {{based on the}} plate speed, time of day, time of year, and latitude. These were slide rules, not measuring instruments, and did not produce a graph, but <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> adopted the same name for it.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{specialized}} slide rules for photographic applications; for example, the actinograph of <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> was a two-slide boxwood, brass, and cardboard device for estimating exposure from time of day, time of year, and latitude.|$|R
50|$|Another early {{practical}} system {{for measuring the}} sensitivity of an emulsion was that of <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> (H&D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> (1844-1898) <b>and</b> British Vero Charles Driffield (1848-1915). In their system, speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required. For example, an emulsion rated at 250 H&D would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 H&D.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> began {{pioneering}} {{work on the}} light sensitivity of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised. They developed H&D curves, which are specific for each film and paper. These curves plot the photographic density against the log of the exposure, to determine sensitivity or speed of the emulsion and enabling correct exposure.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{is based on}} the late 19th century sensitometry studies of <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield.</b> The Zone System provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black-and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography.|$|R
50|$|Archer {{collaborated with}} Ansel Adams to codify the Zone System, {{which is a}} {{photographic}} technique for determining optimal film exposure and development. The technique {{is based on the}} late 19th century sensitometry studies of <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> <b>Driffield,</b> <b>and</b> provides photographers with a systematic method of precisely defining the relationship between the way they visualize the photographic subject and the final results. Although it originated with black-and-white sheet film, the Zone System is also applicable to roll film, both black-and-white and color, negative and reversal, and to digital photography. Archer and Adams formulated the system while teaching together at the Art Center School in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Sensitometry is the {{scientific}} study of light-sensitive materials, especially photographic film. The study has its origins in the work by Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> <b>and</b> Vero Charles <b>Driffield</b> (circa 1876) with early black-and-white emulsions. They determined how the density of silver produced varied with the amount of light received, and the method and time of development.|$|R
50|$|Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> (1844-1898) <b>and</b> Vero Charles <b>Driffield</b> (1848-1915) were nineteenth-century {{photographic}} {{scientists who}} brought quantitative scientific practice to photography through {{the methods of}} sensitometry and densitometry.|$|R

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century rail {{connected}} facilities at Beverley <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> substantially increased, with additional goods sheds, as well as independent firms operating alongside the railway with connected sidings - agriculture related industries were the norm, with the large East Riding Maltkilns, built 1873/4 at Beverley, <b>and</b> the <b>Driffield</b> <b>and</b> East Riding Pure Linseed Cake Company, founded 1861 in Driffield, amongst others.|$|R
5000|$|Promotion of a {{line between}} Malton <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> dates to at least the mid 1840s when George Hudson subscribed £40,000 towards a Malton <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> Junction Company, which was {{intended}} to link to a proposed branch of the Great North of England Railway from Thirsk to Malton. [...] The Malton <b>and</b> <b>Driffield</b> Junction Railway was promoted as part {{of a line}} of communication from Hull to Newcastle-upon-Tyne and beyond to Scotland as well as opening up the agricultural districts of the East Riding of Yorkshire, and providing a short route to the new seaside resorts on the East Yorkshire coast. A connection via the proposed Thirsk and Malton Railway was required for the connections northward. Both the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway (N&DJR) and York and North Midland Railways (Y&NMR) supported the scheme.|$|R
