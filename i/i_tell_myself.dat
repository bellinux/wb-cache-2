500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> this is not my beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping your job, and it can be a delicate situation. But <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New Statesman magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague's right-ward shift and revealed that he had [...] "never been a [...] Portillo fan". He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher's resignation: [...] "When I {{look at what happened}} to the party, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose I am one of those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister". When asked if he regretted also allowing Major to become Prime Minister, Tebbit responded: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know--I know," [...] said Gertrude, walking restlessly about. [...] "I {{cling to}} a {{persistent}} faith in my dream, too--but every time bad news comes it fails me. Then <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> 'mere coincidence'--'subconscious memory' and so forth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{is exactly}} what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> Will. Still, you know, a dog with two bones in his mouth will growl if he loses one of them. Nevertheless £40,000 {{is not to be}} despised by any means, and I shall have plenty to give my little Alice a good portion when she marries.” ...|$|E
60|$|After {{reading this}} to me Louis has left in tears saying {{that he is not}} worthy that such a letter should be written to him. We hope to so manage that we shall stop at Tahiti and see Rui once more. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that {{pleasant}} story when I wake in the night.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what <b>I</b> have to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different. So <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up". [...] Craven subsequently posted the quotation on the internet and it now appears on hundreds of websites.|$|R
60|$|At night sometimes, as I lay awake, <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that if only I {{could see}} her or even hear from her the {{struggle}} would be easier. It was her total disappearance from my life that made it so hard for me. I had nothing to help me to fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} {{necessary}} that <b>I</b> should <b>tell</b> you <b>myself.</b> Now, <b>I</b> cannot say whether, in all honour, that engagement has been dissolved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will wait}} too. I {{have thought about}} it, and have determined. What's the good of loving a man if one won't go through {{something}} for him? I do love him,--with all my heart. I pray God I may never have a husband, if I cannot be his wife." [...] Patience shuddered in her sister's embrace, as these bold words were spoken with energy. [...] "I tell you, Patty, just as <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> because you love me so dearly." ...|$|E
60|$|At last, at {{the corner}} of a street, I ran into the arms of one who was evidently a gentleman, and who, in all his appointments, from his furred great-coat to the fine cigar which he was smoking, comfortably breathed of wealth. Much as my face has changed from its {{original}} beauty, I still retain (or so <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself)</b> some traces of the youthful lightness of my figure. Even veiled as I then was, I could perceive the gentleman was struck by my appearance: and this emboldened me for my adventure.|$|E
6000|$|We pay dearly for our want of sincerity. We {{are denied}} {{the payment of}} praise: it has ceased to have any value. People shake me warmly {{by the hand and}} tell me that they like my books. It only bores me. Not that I am {{superior}} to compliment--nobody is--but because I cannot be sure that they mean it. They would say just the same had they never read a line I had written. If I visit a house and find a book of mine open face downwards on the window-seat, it sends no thrill of pride through my suspicious mind. As likely as not, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> the following is the conversation that has taken place between my host and hostess the day before my arrival: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{pulled the}} two quills with sharp jerks {{out of my}} hand, pushed all the others through my coat sleeve, and turned to Unk Wunk again, sucking my wounded hand, which pained me intensely. [...] "All your own fault," [...] <b>I</b> kept <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> to keep from whacking him across the nose, his one {{vulnerable}} point, with my stick.|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s what I say," [...] replied Evans; [...] "that’s what <b>I</b> keep <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> but it don’t seem {{to bring}} much comfort. I’m too soft-’earted where wimmen is concerned, Bill, an’ that’s {{the truth of}} it. D’reckly I get {{alongside}} of a nice gal my arm goes creeping round her before I know what it’s doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess <b>I</b> won't <b>tell</b> you <b>myself.</b> You {{ought to}} hear it from his own lips so that you can judge. How are you fixed up for to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have crawled upon {{my belly}} to the utmost {{edge of the}} still {{standing}} [...] pier, until I could feel with my hand the jagged splinters left by the [...] fallen planks, and have looked down. But the chasm was full to the [...] brim with darkness. I shouted, but the wind shook my voice into [...] mocking laughter. I sit here, feebly striking at the madness that is [...] creeping nearer and nearer to me. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> {{the whole thing is}} [...] but the fever in my brain. The bridge was rotten. The storm was [...] strong. The cry is but a single one among the many voices of the [...] mountain. Yet still I listen; and it rises, clear and shrill, above [...] the moaning of the pines, above the sobbing of the waters. It beats [...] like blows upon my skull, and I know that she will never come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{thousand}} years ahead perhaps," [...] said Mr. Britling, [...] "there {{will still be}} men with the same sadness.... And yet--and yet.... No. Just now I have no elasticity. It is not in my nature to despair, but things are pressing me down. I don't recover as I used to recover. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> still that though the way is long and hard the spirit of hope, the spirit of creation, the generosities and gallantries {{in the heart of}} man, must end in victory. But I say that over as one repeats a worn-out prayer. The light is out of the sky for me. Sometimes I doubt if it will ever come back. Let younger men take heart and go on with the world. If I could die for the right thing now--instead of just having to live on in this world of ineffective struggle--I would be glad to die now, Carmine...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another thing is, Walter {{does not}} like him. He {{constantly}} brings [...] the child toys, but Walter does not take to him, refuses absolutely [...] to sit upon his knee, or to be petted by him in any way. I always [...] {{think that it is}} a bad sign when a child won't take to a man. [...] However, I will not bother you more about it now; I will keep him [...] out of my letters as much as I can. I wish I could keep him out of [...] my mind also. As <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> over and over again, he is nothing [...] to me, and whether he possesses all the virtues or none of them is, [...] or at any rate should be, a matter of indifference to me. I can't [...] help wishing that you had come over here two months later, then I [...] should have had the benefit of your advice and opinion, for you [...] know, Netta, how accustomed I was for years to consider you almost, [...] if not quite, infallible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never from me. You may be {{ten times}} his wife, but you cannot {{separate}} yourself from me. Getting {{up in the}} morning and going to bed at night <b>I</b> still <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that you are the one woman that I love. Stay with us, and you shall be honoured,--as that man's wife of course, but still as the dearest friend we have." ...|$|R
5000|$|Impression—I {{was certain}} of it. <b>I</b> was just <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> that, since <b>I</b> was impressed, {{there had to}} be some {{impression}} in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.|$|R
60|$|The {{contrast}} between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute, and for days <b>I</b> had to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've known Beatrice longer--you don't know Elizabeth very well, {{but let me}} {{tell you}} this. Elizabeth is a very {{wonderful}} person. I know something about character, I know something about those hidden powers which men and women possess--strange powers which no one can understand, powers which drag a man to a woman's feet, or which make him shiver when he passes another even in a crowd. You see, these things are a science with me, Mr. Tavernake, but I don't pretend to understand everything. All I know is that Elizabeth is one of those people who can just do what she likes with men. I am her father and I am her slave. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that I would rather be with Beatrice, and I am as powerless to go as though I were bound with chains. You are a young ignorant man, Mr. Tavernake, you know nothing of life, and I will give you a word of warning. It is better for you that you keep away from over there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is well," [...] he said, {{looking at}} it approvingly. [...] "I myself, {{although}} I know that, until my time has come, no creature can harm me, cannot resist a shudder when I hear one rustling amid the leaves of my bed; for they come in, although {{some of my friends}} have had a door placed to exclude their entry at night. I wander but little from my cell, and always close the door after me; but they enter, sometimes, when I am meditating, and forgetful of earthly matters, and the first I know of their presence is the rustling of the leaves in the bed, at night. Were I as strong in faith as I should be, I would heed it not. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> so; but my fear is stronger than my will, and I am forced to rise, turn up the leaves with a stick until I find them, and then I open the door and eject them, with as much gentleness as may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dined at {{home with}} Walter and Jane; they with Anne {{went out in the}} evening, I remained, but not I fear to work much. I feel sorely fagged. I am sadly fagged. Then I cannot get ----'s fate out of my head. I see that kind, social, beneficent face never turned to me without respect and complacence, and--I see it in the agonies of death. This is childish; <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> so, and I trust the feeling to no one else. But here it goes down like the murderer who could not cease {{painting}} the ideal vision of the man he had murdered, and who he supposed haunted him. A thousand fearful images and dire suggestions glance along the mind when it is moody and discontented with itself. Command them to stand and show themselves, and you presently assert the power of reason over imagination. But if by any strange alterations in one's nervous system you lost for a moment the talisman which controls these fiends, would they not terrify into obedience with their mandates, rather than we would dare longer to endure their presence? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly," [...] said he, [...] "we are in straits. Yet, could I but win out of {{this house}} for half an hour, <b>I</b> do {{honestly}} <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that all might still go well; and for the marriage, it should be prevented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very well, and if I had no duty to perform, I {{would be}} silent. But, Violet, {{you have been}} left in my charge. If I see you shipwrecked in life, <b>I</b> shall ever <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that the fault has been partly mine." ...|$|R
50|$|The record had {{fascinated me}} since Moser broke it. It was the {{ultimate}} test - no traffic, one man in a velodrome against the clock. <b>I</b> didn't <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that <b>I</b> will attempt the record, I said I would break it. When your back is against the wall, you can say it's bad or you can say: 'I'll go for it.' I decided, that's it, I've as good as broken the record.|$|R
6000|$|... "But when it {{does come}} I am {{conscious}} of the sweetest colour that ever came upon a lady's cheek. And <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that another grace {{has been added to}} the face which of all faces in the world is to my eyes the most beautiful." [...] What was she to say in answer to a compliment so high-flown as this, to one from whose mouth compliments were so uncommon? She knew that he could not have so spoken without a purpose, declared at any rate to his own heart. He still held her by the arm, but did not once progress with his speech, while she sat silent by his side, and blushing with that dark ruby streak across her cheeks, which her step-mother had intended to vilify when she said that she had blushed black. [...] "Mary," [...] he continued after a pause, [...] "can you endure the thought of becoming my wife?" [...] Now she drew her arm away, and turned her face, and compressed her lips, and sat without uttering a word. [...] "Of course I am an old man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I am {{not here}} to be a judge of men,’ replied the Prince; ‘still less of women. I am now a private person like {{yourself}} and many million others; but I am one who still fights upon the side of quiet. Now, madam, {{you know better than}} I, and God better than you, what you have done to mankind in the past; I pause not to inquire; it is with the future I concern myself, it is for the future I demand security. I would not willingly put arms into the hands of a disloyal combatant; and I dare not restore to wealth one of the levyers of a private and a barbarous war. I speak with some severity, and yet I pick my terms. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> continually that you are a woman; and a voice continually reminds me of the children whose lives and limbs you have endangered. A woman,’ he repeated solemnly—‘and children. Possibly, madam, when you are yourself a mother, you will feel the bite of that antithesis: possibly when you kneel at night beside a cradle, a fear will fall upon you, heavier than any shame; and when your child lies in the pain and danger of disease, you shall hesitate to kneel before your Maker.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true," [...] Mikail replied. [...] "I {{never talk}} of her. I dare not even let myself think of her, it seems {{too great a}} {{happiness}} to be true; and something may occur, one never knows. Ah, Ivan, {{if it had not}} been for you what news would have been taken to her! Think of it, after her long journey out here; after waiting ten years for me, to hear that it was useless. I tremble like a leaf when I think of it. That night I lay awake all night and cried like a young child, not for myself, you know, but for her. She has taken a cottage already, and is furnishing it with her savings. She is allowed to write to me, you know, once every month. At first it was every three months. What happiness it was to me when my first five years was up and she could write once a month! Do you think I shall know her? She will have changed much. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> that always; and I--I have changed much too, but she will know me, I am sure she will know me. I tremble now at the thought of our meeting, Ivan; but I ought not to talk so, I ought not to speak to you of my happiness--you, who have no friend waiting to see you." ...|$|E
