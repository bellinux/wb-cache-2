40|$|Abstract: Process {{capability}} indices such as Cp, Cpk, Cpu and Cpl {{are common}} metrics {{to evaluate and}} predict {{the performance of a}} process. Although higher process capability indices indicate higher process “quality”, but a high quality process does not necessarily guarantee the fewer rates of rejects. Therefore, a process capability index based on rate of rejects or real losses is more reliable and proper. This paper defines a novel process capability index called asymmetric <b>inverted</b> <b>normal</b> loss-based process capability index (AIPCI) with the aid of asymmetric <b>inverted</b> <b>normal</b> loss function. The logical idea is to compare the standard loss for a capable process with other cases. AIPCI is a bounded asymmetric process capability index and can provide a more realistic metric to evaluate and predict the performance of a process.

40|$|Engineering {{tolerance}} design {{plays an}} important role in modern manufacturing. Both symmetric and asymmetric tolerances are common in many manufacturing processes. Recently, various revised loss functions have been proposed for overcoming the drawbacks of Taguchi 2 ̆ 7 s loss function. In this article, Kapur 2 ̆ 7 s economic tolerance design model is modified and the economic specification limits for both symmetric and asymmetric losses are established. Three different loss functions are compared in the optimal symmetric and asymmetric tolerance design: a revised Taguchi quadratic loss function, an <b>inverted</b> <b>normal</b> loss function and a revised <b>inverted</b> <b>normal</b> loss function. The relationships among the three loss functions and process capability indices are established. A numerical example is given to compare the economic specification limits established by using the three loss functions.

40|$|Abstract: Ways {{to combine}} {{normality}} with the fast Fourier transformation ideas are studied by employing various matrix structures. The Toeplitz decomposition is natural for polynomially generating normal matrices while the so-called persymmetric splitting {{provides a framework}} for polynomially extending the Toeplitz matrix structure. In this context fast matrix-vector multiplications with the FFT techniques {{can be applied to}} different Toeplitz related matrices. Two sparse matrix methods for generating normal matrices are introduced to have more alternatives with normality. The method based on embedding matrices in normal matrices allows us to invert nonnormal matrices through <b>inverting</b> <b>normal</b> matrices. This is a potential approach for combining the FFT ideas with preconditioning nonnormal problems. To end with, we introduce a new iterative method...|$|R

This method helps to overcome the existing challenges in assessing impacts of deviations of process variables. In this paper, the modified <b>inverted</b> <b>normal</b> loss function (MINLF) is used to incorporate the effects of process deviations on the safety and quality losses. The probability of undesirable event occurrence is continuously updated by considering real-time disturbances in process variables. The use of loss function in combination with probability updating provides continuously revised risk estimation.

40|$|Geometric {{reconstruction}} and trishear model of folding: {{a case study}} in the western Principal Cordillera, Central Chile (34 º 15 ’S – 34 º 30 ’S) Abstract: The western Principal Cordillera consists of thick volcanic successions accumulated in an extensional basin and deformed in Early Neogene times during tectonic inversion of the basin. In the study region, key-layers are lacking and, for this reason, geometrical reconstructions are difficult. The main structure is a N-S-oriented syncline bounded by faults. Reconstructions using the fault-propaga-tion fold and trishear models indicate that this structure is controlled by faults, a western (WF, cut-off angle ~ 40 - 60 º) and an eastern fault (EF, cut-off angle ~ 20 º).

During the initial ten days, the coseismic stress field shows evidence of permutations between the S 1 and S 2 axes, {{with the presence of}} a local strike-slip regime.

We analyzed how the variation in the rate of magma intrusion, shortening, and syn-compressive sedimentation may affect the final configuration of an inverted system, and the results were compared with field observations.
