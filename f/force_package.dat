5000|$|By 1974 the 1st Battalion, 58th {{infantry}} was a mechanized infantry battalion {{assigned to}} the 197th Separate Infantry Brigade at Ft. Benning, Georgia. The brigade was reorganizing as a separate mechanized infantry brigade with a go to war mission as the XViII Airborne Corps heavy <b>force</b> <b>package.</b> During the period 1973-77 the battalion supported several important Army modernization initiatives. On return from three months of gunnery and maneuver training in 1976 at McGregor Range in New Mexico (the brigade and battalion had previously deployed from Kelley Hill Barracks at Ft. Benning, Georgia to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida for a several week joint exercise), deployed companies A and B for four months {{in support of the}} MICV (Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle) Developmental/Operational Tests 1 and 2. The MICV later became the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the Tests also deployed the MILEs systems with their sensors, laser weapons effect systems and other force on force technologies later deployed to Ft. Irwin and the National Training Center. Company A was assigned a tank platoon and additional tank section from 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor. The company then trained and validated as a unit capable of replicating a Soviet motorized rifle battalion. Company B formed MICV configured platoons along with its M113A1 equipped platoons to operate as a U. S. ground force against a Soviet ground force. The two companies were deployed almost continuously for four months in the Turrentine Range Area and other locations on Ft. Benning performing one force on force exercise after another to develop data that eventually led to the deployment of the Bradley Fighting vehicle to the Army. At the time Company A was an over strength company of some 220 men (the then MTOE authorized 187 men) having also been selected as a unit that would retrain NCOs in over strength MOSs as infantry NCOs. A provisional 4th mechanized infantry platoon was formed. This additional platoon with the three tank sections allowed the company to render a Soviet motorized rifle battalion footprint during the force on force exercises of the tests. All of this work made important contributions to the Army's highly effective heavy force capabilities that deployed in the two following Iraq Wars.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. This thesis explores {{the concept of}} Adaptive Joint <b>Force</b> <b>Packaging</b> (AJFP). Provided first is {{an overview of the}} concept itself, including the factors behind its development, the manner and scope of its implementation, and the benefits proponents claim it will bring. Also reviewed are the various concerns and criticisms that AJFP has created within the defense establishment. Among those are reservations about the concept's impact on unit integrity and doctrine, the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff; training budgets; and traditional combat capability. Operation to AJFP also involves perceptions that it will create an additional layer of bureaucracy, will conflict with other, uncoordinated, <b>force</b> <b>packaging</b> initiatives, will limit force-employment options to a fixed 'menu,' and, finally, will never come to fruition. The discussion of pros and cons {{on both sides of the}} AJFP debate is followed by an overall analysis and evaluation. It is concluded that, on balance, the AJFP concept has considerable potential for helping the U. S. military adapt to the post-Cold War international security environment and smaller force structure. In particular, AJFP promises to bring a greater degree of effectiveness to U. S. military operations at the lower-end of the conflict spectrum, and allows the peacetime forward presence mission to be addressed by a full range of joint forces.

40|$|The Marine Corps {{has embraced}} the {{concepts}} of Operational Maneuver From The Sea (OMFTS) and Ship-to-Objective Maneuver (STOM) as the next progression {{in the evolution of}} amphibious warfare. These related concepts envision harnessing emerging technologies to allow the projection of naval power ashore faster and from greater distances than in the past. Additionally, both concepts identify the ability to conduct sea-based logistics (SBL) as a key requirement for successful implementation. Sea-based logistics involves executing a wide range of logistical functions from a sea-base rather than from sites traditionally established ashore. Acknowledged enhancements are required to realize a complete SBL capability; however, the ability to provide some measure of sea-based sustainment exists today. This thesis models the sea-based sustainment of Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)) forces deployed from Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) ships. Missions are developed for analysis; each is coupled with an appropriate <b>force</b> <b>package</b> of personnel and equipment density. Sustainment requirements and available transportation capacities are then determined and compared for each mission. This comparison along with several excursions provides insight into the nature of sea-based sustainment feasibility. It also gauges potential limitations for sea-based sustainment. NAU. S.

40|$|Student Integrated ProjectIncludes {{supplementary}} material. This thesis {{analyzed the}} Navy's proposed Riverine Force (RF) structure and capabilities of 2006. Systems Engineering and Analysis cohort 10 (SEA 10) developed a cost-effective system of systems which increased battlespace awareness and situational responsiveness for 2010. Riverine missions were decomposed into their functional, physical, and operational architectures using the detect-to-engage sequence. This analysis determined critical RF functions. Critical functions detect and engage were then physically represented by feasible <b>force</b> <b>package</b> alternatives that augmented the baseline RF. SEA 10 analyzed these alternatives using agent based models to identify baseline RF capability gaps and provide insights into possible solutions. Reduction of modeling data indicated the baseline force was {{as effective as}} some upgraded force packages depending on the measure of performance (MOP) or scenario structure under scrutiny. Sensor augmentation demonstrated significant improvements to baseline performance by increasing battlespace awareness. Weapon augmentation alone did not significantly improve baseline performance by increasing situational responsiveness. Combined sensor-weapon augmentation performed well across all MOP and scenarios. The Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) was the most cost-effective alternative. Dedicated helicopter support demonstrated the best performance overall, but was the most costly alternative...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAfter {{eight years of}} conventional U. S. Army involvement in Afghanistan, the Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) have remained organized and trained to defeat a peer or near-peer enemy in a direct, symmetrical conflict. The complex socio-ethnical structure of Afghanistan requires something new, but an analysis of international forces involved in a century of Counterinsurgency Operations (COIN) operations indicates a variety of metrics of successful organization and training. Something new {{can be found in}} something old. Through the analysis of historical COIN conflicts and combatants in Algeria, Philippines, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, the modern military analyst can determine effective metrics for the assessment, selection, organization and training of contemporary COIN forces. Counterinsurgency Operations are not merely a less-intense form of conflict within the Range of Military Operations, but an entirely different arc of the warfare continuum and require specialized units, operations, tactics and skills that are beyond capabilities of an organic IBCT. In the current fight, IBCTs receive a number of these enablers upon arrival into theater, and enjoy a margin of success during their tour. This thesis finds a correlation between training and organizing COIN-specific forces prior to their engagement in the conflict, and the eventual success or failure of that force in a COIN struggle. Though success in COIN comes with higher risk and is more manpower intensive, the lower technological and logistical demands warrant additional research from a force design perspective.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of Wet Brewer’s Grains (WBG) on the growth performance, carcass performance, and meat quality of finishing cattle. Twenty-four (n= 24; 12 heifers – 303 kg, 12 steers – 346 kg) calves of Simmental-Angus genetics were utilized. Calves were paired by sex, blocked by BW within sex in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with three replications per treatment, and fed for 140 d. Control diets were a conventional corn silage – shelled corn finishing-diet. Experimental diets modeled the control diet with the inclusion of WBG on a thirty-percent DM basis. Cattle were visually appraised by an industry procurement agent for degree of finish. Finished cattle were transported 160 km for slaughter under USDA-FSIS inspection. Primal ribs (IMPS # 1103) were obtained and transported to ISU’s Meat Lab. Ribeye steaks (IMPS # 1112) were fabricated from the ninth – eleventh ribs for further meat quality analyses. Statistical analysis was modeled in a two-way fixed ANOVA utilizing the MIXED procedure of SAS. No differences were observed in Total Gain and ADG between diets respectively (P = 0. 6919).
