25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>mating</b> is {{the most}} {{efficient}} method, but requires the most work {{on the part of}} the human involved. A male and female llama are put into the same pen and mating is monitored. They are then separated and remated every other day until one or the other refuses the mating. Usually, one can get in two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once. The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama's reproductive tract more sound. If the mating is not successful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>mating</b> between {{individuals}} of genotypes {{that are too}} similar allows for the accumulation of harmful recessive alleles, which can decrease fitness. Such mating between genetically similar individuals is termed inbreeding which can result {{in the emergence of}} autosomal recessive diseases. Moreover, assortative mating for aggression in birds can lead to inadequate parental care. An alternate strategy can be disassortative mating, in which one individual is aggressive and guards the nest site while the other individual is more nurturing and fosters the young. This division of labor increases the chances of survival of the offspring. A classic example of this is {{in the case of the}} white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). This bird exhibits two color morphs - white striped and tan striped. In both genders, the white striped birds are more aggressive and territorial whereas tan striped birds are more engaged in providing parental care to their offspring. Therefore, disassortative mating in these birds allows for an efficient division of labor in terms of raising and protecting their offspring.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Progesterone was {{administered}} to Merino ewes in February(early breeding season) and May (mid-breeding season) for 2 weeks. The period from the final progesterone injection to the onset of oestrus, the duration of oestrus, and fertility after <b>hand</b> <b>mating</b> were observed. The approximate time of ovulation was also determined in the Feb-ruary experiment. The duration of oestrus was 10 to 50 hr; ovulation took place {{near the end of}} oestrus. The period from the last injection to the onset of oestrus, and the fertility of the ewes were influenced by dose, interval between consecutive progesterone injections, the time of day that the injections were given, and the stage of the breeding season. Variability in onset of oestrus (indicating the degree of synchronization of oestrus) was least when the final injections were given in the morning. The results clearly show that normal levels of fertility may be achieved after synchronization of oestrus in Merino ewes with progesterone...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} part of bachelor thesis describes conditions of horses bred in organic farming system. The assessment of horse breeding on organic farms in South Bohemia based on questionnaire {{and interviews with}} farmers represents the practical part. 70 farmers were willing to provide the required information. It was found out, that respondents had bred 36 breeds mostly in small numbers of horses per farm. 41. 4 % of respondents used alternative medical treatments in horse medical care.

40|$|Efficiency of {{reproduction}} in horses is low when monitored by man. Foaling percentage {{in different countries}} varies from 50 to 70 % per year (Osborne, 1975), but when a stallion is left in pasture with mares a conception rate of 85 % or more is achieved (Martin-Rosset & Palmer, 1977).

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Biologia (Biologia Evolutiva), apresentada à Universidade de Lisboa através da Faculdade de Ciências, 2008 Speciation {{and species}} {{differentiation}} {{are very important}} issues in Evolutionary Biology. This thesis focuses several aspects related with the differentiation between two closely related species, Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila subosbcura, namely the contribution of additive and non-additive genetic effects to that differentiation, the contribution of assortative mating to their reproductive isolation, the analysis of hybrid developmental problems expressed as higher fluctuating asymmetry and their underlying causes (developmental noise), {{and the implications of}} species differentiation in terms of adaptation to a novel, common environment. The results indicate that negative dominance and epistasis are both involved in the genetic differentiation between these species. Both species present assortative mating, conspecific matings being more likely. Furthermore, the two reciprocal cross directions apparently present different reproductive barriers. In the cross involving D. madeirensis females the barrier is mostly prezygotic, with mating being hard to observe, however, this cross direction yields a high number of hybrids with an even sex-ratio. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mating</b> in the reciprocal cross is easy to observe but produces fewer hybrids with a male-biased sex ratio. The analysis comparing fluctuating asymmetry levels between hybrids and parental species indicates that, although hybridization disrupts developmental buffering, hybrid females presenting higher asymmetry, this disruption does not reflect higher developmental noise, as fluctuating asymmetry levels are similar to parental species. The results comparing species differences in life history traits and evolutionary dynamics indicate that these closely related species differ in the adaptation to new conditions (captivity). These findings have important implications for several fields, namely Evolutionary Biology, Speciation, Development and Conservation, which are discussed {{at the end of this}} thesis.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} path {{of bacteria}} is mainly influenced by horizontal gene transfers (HGT) since mobile genetic elements carry {{a panel of}} key metabolic traits to adapt to changing environments. Among these HGT, conjugation and mobilization have been described for over fifty years, in laboratory liquid media. However, it is now generally admitted that, in nature, bacteria are subjected to various stresses and are mostly found in interface-associated communities. This study focuses on members of the Bacillus cereus group which are food contaminants and characterized by a large extra-chromosomal gene pool. One of these elements, pAW 63 which resembles the Bacillus anthracis virulence plasmid pXO 2, {{is used as a}} model to study conjugation in Gram-positive species. This 72 kb-plasmid is a self-transmissible element originating from Bacillus thurigiensis sv. kurstaki and displays an ability to mobilize other plasmids. In this work, the dynamics of pAW 63 transfer in the B. cereus group was investigated under different conditions. On one <b>hand,</b> <b>mating</b> partners in liquid medium were submitted to various chemical and physical stresses including extreme osmotic environment and microgravity. On the other hand, capabilities of plasmid transfer were estimated in biofilms by performing an in situ analysis based on the detection of fluorescent proteins. Moreover, bacterial populations were analysed for their conjugation abilities on simulated food microcosms increasing the relevance of the study with regard to ecological niches of B. cereus and other food borne pathogens. The results showed that pAW 63 transfer efficiency is largely affected by the chemical composition of the mating medium and was found to increase under specific stress conditions. Biofilms were also proved to be a favored environment for conjugation among members of the B. cereus group. Moreover, it appeared that the bacterial behavior inside a structured community impacts on pAW 63 transfer ability resulting in “hotspots” of conjugation inside microcolonies. The food composition of the solid media used as a substrate for biofilm development was also found to dramatically affect the structure of the community and the transfer ability...|$|E
40|$|ERB-S is {{supported}} by a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) studentship and DMS was in part supported by a NERC Advanced Fellowship. Reproductive interference arises when individuals of one species engage in reproductive activities with individuals of another, leading to fitness costs in one or both species. Reproductive interference (RI) therefore has two components. First, there must be mis-directed mating interactions. Second, there must be costs associated with these mis-directed interactions. Here we consider RI between four species of true bug in the family Lygaeidae, focusing in particular on the fitness consequences to Lygaeus equestris. The species we consider vary in their relationships with each other, including species in the same or different genus, and with or without natural overlap in their geographic ranges. First we show that inter-specific mating interactions, although not a certain outcome, are common enough to perhaps influence mating behaviour in these species (arising in up to 10 % of inter-specific pairings). Second, we show that reproductive interference can seriously reduce female fitness in L. equestris. Importantly, different species impose different costs of RI on L. equestris, with interactions with male Spilostethus pandurus inflicting fitness costs of similar magnitude to the costs of mating with con-specifics. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>mating</b> interactions with male Oncopeltus fasciatus appear to have no effect on female fitness. In a follow-up experiment, when we allowed competition amongst just females of S. pandurus and L. equestris, the fitness of the latter was not reduced, arguing more strongly for the role of reproductive interference. However, in our final experiments under mass mating conditions with extended ecological interactions (including scope for competition for resources and cannibalism), the costs of RI were less apparent. Our data therefore suggest that the costs of RI will be context-specific and may act in concert with, or be swamped by, other ecological effects. We suggest that comparative studies of this sort that both mimic naturally occurring reproductive interference events, and also artificially generate new ones, will be necessary if we are to better understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of reproductive interference.

40|$|Alpacas are New World Camelid reared {{worldwide}} for fibre and meat, {{and since}} the 1980 ’s, when they were reclassified from zoo animals to livestock, have become an increasingly popular farm animal in New Zealand. However, there is limited research performed on alpacas farmed under New Zealand conditions. Therefore the aims of this thesis were to determine common farming and health care practices among New Zealand alpaca farmers, and to determine the prevalence of certain diseases known to affect alpacas including Candidatus Mycoplasma haemolamae, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and parasitism in New Zealand. In {{the first part of}} this study, a survey was administered to 18 alpaca owners from 9 regions of New Zealand, encompassing 1065 farmed alpacas. Faecal egg counts were used on 75 % of farms in their worming regime while on 62. 5 % worming was a scheduled task. Macrocylic lactones were the most popular class of anthelmintics, with Dectomax© the most commonly used of the 15 products mentioned. Ten of 18 farmers always used the same deworming product on their farm. <b>Hand</b> <b>mating</b> (64. 7 %) was preferred over paddock mating with females being bred around the same time on 87. 5 % of farms. Repeated failure to conceive was the most common way to diagnose reproductive failure, and 12 / 17 farmers gave up to 3 matings before reporting reproductive failure. Spit off is the most common way to diagnose pregnancy on farms (88. 2 %). Vaccination for clostridial diseases and vitamin D administration occurred on 94 % and 100 % of farms respectively. Ten of 17 farms routinely weigh crias and 94 % of farmers ensure crias suckled within 24 hours. Between 2012 and 2014 more crias died per farm (3. 31) than in other management groups. Congenital defects were the most common case of deaths in crias. The average deaths per 10 alpacas for the same period was 1. 94. Voluntary tuberculosis testing was performed on 13 / 18 farms; facial eczema and zinc supplementation occurred only on farms in the North Island, and ryegrass staggers occurred on both islands. The second part of the study was to determine the prevalence of Candidatus Mycoplasma haemolamae (CMhl), BVDV and gastrointestinal parasitism, as such 206 blood samples and 143 faecal samples were collected from 12 regions. The prevalence of CMhl in this study as determined by PCR was 0. 97 %, while antibodies for BVDV were found in 2. 05 % of alpacas and no animals were positive for BVDV antigen. Anaemia (PCV< 25 %) was found in 21. 76 % of animals sampled and 23. 07 % of alpacas had a significant gastrointestinal parasite burden (over 200 epg).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} if there is a difference in ovulation- and conception rates, in semiintensively managed Dohne-Merino ewes, flush fed with diets containing different nitrogen sources. Four different nitrogen sources were chosen due to the difference in dietary amino acid composition and cost. In order for a sheep farming enterprise to maximize profitability it is essential to optimize ovulation- and conception rates and to minimize lamb losses in order to increase weaning percentage and therefore profitability. However the cost of dietary supplementation is high and may increase production costs and minimize profitability. One hundred and fourty four (144) Dohne-Merino ewes (age between 14 to 85 months) were included in two dietary supplementation trials (autumn and summer) at the experimental farm of the University of Pretoria in Hatfield. The ewes were divided equally into two trial groups (n= 72), with the first trial done in season 1 (started in May 2001, typical breeding season) and the second trial done in season 2 (started in November 2001, out of season; 2 nd breeding season). During the day the ewes had ad-libitum access to graze on Festuca arundinaceace (Tall Fescue). In both trials the ewes (n= 72) were randomly allocated into four dietary supplementation groups, each group receiving a dietary supplement with a different combination of nitrogen sources. The four dietary supplements were formulated on an iso-nitrogen basis, to eliminate the effect of protein level, and to emphasize the possible effect of protein quality (amino acid composition) on ovulation, conception and lambing rates. In both trials the total amount of crude protein intake per ewe was calculated at 256. 40 g/day, while the total daily allowance of digestible crude protein was calculated at 190 g per ewe. The 256. 40 g crude protein intake per ewe per day is 2 times more than the threshold level of 125 g per ewe per day. A minimum daily crude protein intake of 125 g is needed for effective rumen functioning, and this together with the interconvertin of energy by the rumen indicates the complex nature of relating dietary differences to physiological responses. These values were kept the same for both the trials in season 1 and 2. The bulk of the 256. 40 g crude protein per day was obtained from grazing on the Festuca arundinaceace pasture. In season 1 the dietary supplement had to provide 40. 00 g of crude protein per day in order to get to a daily crude protein intake of 256. 40 g, while in season 2 the provision from the dietary supplement was calculated to be 37. 45 g of crude protein. The difference in the crude protein level, obtained from grazing of the Festuca arundinaceace between season 1 and 2 was due to pasture quality differences. The nitrogen sources used in the trials were urea, sunflower oilcake meal, cottonseed oilcake meal and a mixture of cottonseed oilcake meal and fishmeal. These dietary supplements were fed for a period of 9 days before mating; the weight of each ewe was recorded before the onset of the trial and again on the second day after mating to establish any live weight changes. Synchronization of the ewes was done with Chrono-gest grey sponges (40 mg Fluorogestone acetate) from day one and was repeated from day 23. On day 12 each ewe were injected with 1. 0 ml prostaglandin F 2 α (Prosolvin,each milliliter containing 7. 5 mg Luprostiol). On day fourteen the sponges were removed and two days later all the ewes were checked for cyclic activity with the aid of six vasectomized rams. The six vasectomized rams were introduced to the whole laparoscopy group of 12 ewes, and every ewe that stood twice for mating were identified as cyclic. This practice continued for a period of 30 minutes in the morning and repeated for another 30 minutes in the afternoon up to day 18. The second round of sponges were inserted on day 23 and removed on day 37. Ewes were mated by means of <b>hand</b> <b>mating</b> with two different rams from day 39 to 42. A laparoscopy technique was used on day 45 of the trial to count the number of ovulation points (corpora lutea) on each ovarium of each ewe. The number of fetuses of each ewe was counted on day 90 after mating by means of ultrasound scanning and at birth the number of lambs born was also recorded. In both these trials dietary supplementation had no significant effect on ovulation, conception and lambing rates. However, looking at the Odds Ratio Analysis for the 144 ewes over the two breeding seasons, the different dietary supplements had a significant influence on the number of ovulation points (p< 0. 05). Compared to urea (dietary supplement 1), the fishmeal cottonseed oil cake mixture (dietary supplement 4) yielded the best results (1. 306), followed by the cottonseed oil cake meal (dietary supplement 3) (1. 298), and sunflower oil cake meal (dietary supplement 2) (1. 050). The same Odds Ratio Analysis showed that the different dietary supplements had a significant effect on the number of lambs born (p< 0. 01). Compared to urea (dietary supplement 1), the fishmeal cottonseed oil cake mixture (dietary supplement 4) yielded better results (1. 086), followed by urea (dietary supplement 1) (1. 000), and sunflower oil cake meal (dietary supplement 2) (0. 801) and lastly cottonseed oil cake meal (dietary supplement 3) (0. 784). Breeding season (p< 0. 05) had a significant effect on the number of ovulation points but no difference was observed in terms of the number of lambs born. Age (p< 0. 01) had a significant effect on the number of ovulation points, the number of fetuses counted as well as the number of lambs born. Change in live weight (p< 0. 05) had a significant effect on the number of ovulation points per ewe but as with breeding season it had no significant effect on the number of lambs born. Birth status of a ewe (p< 0. 05), had a significant effect on the number of fetuses and the number of lambs born. The data of both the trials in season 1 and 2 suggests that under the conditions of the study with the odds ratio analyses that the four different dietary supplements had a significantly different effect compared to dietary supplement one on the number of ovulation points and the number of lambs born. However, factors like breeding season, age, change in live weight and birth status of the ewe also had a significant effect on ovulation and conception rates in Dohne-Merino ewes.
