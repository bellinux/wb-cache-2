30|$|The {{examinations}} {{were interpreted}} with {{no knowledge of}} the patients' clinical context. Each physician made an initial interpretation of the anonymized examinations. Images were interpreted visually based on averaged acquisitions of two time intervals: 1 to 5 and 6 to 10  min. The first interval enabled visualization without distortions caused by bladder activity. The interpretations were based on a systematic analysis of the following anatomic regions: (i) the prostatic bed or the prostate, (ii) the periprostatic lymph node areas, (iii) the perirectal lymph node areas, (iv) medial <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> areas, (v) lateral <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> areas and the iliac bifurcation lymph node area, (vi) common <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> areas, (vii) lumboaortic and mesenteric lymph node areas, (viii) and supra-diaphragmatic lymph nodes and remote metastatic sites: bone, lung, liver, and central nervous system.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method of}} {{preparing}} hybridomas producing mouse monoclonal antibodies was established, called “the mouse <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> method”. Lymphocytes from enlarged iliac lymph nodes from mice injected intramuscularly {{at the tail}} base with an emulsion of antigen and Freund’s adjuvant were used for cell fusion. For the most part, lymph node lymphocytes from two mice were used for a single cell fusion attempt. Ovalbumin {{was used as the}} antigen and the results of fusion were compared with the results of a previous report (Cell Struct. Funct. 20; 151 – 156, 1995). Approximately 100 positive wells producing antibody of interest were identified using this method. By comparison, approximately 10 positive wells were identified using the more conventional mouse spleen method after three immunization injections. The relative proportions of hybridomas producing IgM, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, and IgG 3, following fusion using <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> lymphocytes obtained 14 days after injection were 14. 0 %, 78. 7 %, 3. 2 %, 3. 5 % and 0. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|The sonographic {{appearance}} of the normal abdominal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in adult dogs has been well described, but the data in puppies are scarce and of poor quality. The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate any differences in abdominal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sonographic measurements in puppies of various sizes and to determine whether any differences were correlated with growth and weight gain during the first 10 weeks of life. By an approach based on prospective and serial measurements, length, width and thickness of jejunal, medial iliac and hypogastric nodes were obtained in twenty-one healthy puppies of various sizes, at six (T 0), eight (T 1) and ten (T 2) weeks of age. The relationship between body weight and length, width and thickness of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was evaluated using a Pearson correlation analysis. An ANOVA test was used to compare the measurements at different ages. Jejunal and <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were the largest in large breed dogs. In large-sized puppies only the length of the jejunal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> correlated positively with width and body weight. Length of medial <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> correlated positively with width and body weight in all three sizes. None of the measurements of hypogastric <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were related to body weight. In large-sized puppies jejunal and <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> increased in length and width with age; in medium-sized puppies only <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> increased; in small-sized puppies jejunal and <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> significantly decreased in length and thickness. In conclusion, the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> sizes in young animals are directly related to body weight and do not decrease with growth during the first 10 weeks of life, except in small-sized puppies...|$|R
30|$|The overall {{conclusion}} of the PET examination included analysis of the prostate, supra- and sub-diaphragmatic nodes and remote metastatic sites (bone, lung, liver, central nervous system) for a given patient. Statistical analyses were also done independently {{for each of the}} aforementioned anatomic regions. Other calculations were made on the pelvic lymphatic nodes of the right and left hemi-pelves. The pelvic lymphatic nodes included all the sub-diaphragmatic lymphatic areas (excluding the inguinal nodes) which were found to be positive or negative by each physician. The right and left hemi-pelves included the common <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> <b>iliac</b> bifurcation <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> lateral and medial <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> periprostatic and obturator <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> on the same side.|$|R

Compared with virgin animals, significant weight gain occurred only in the thymus, spleen and <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of the outbred group. Significant weight loss from the thymus and iliac nodes, and significant reductions in white cell density of the spleen and popliteal nodes occurred in delivered animals {{when compared with the}} virgin group.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{endometrial cancer}} can present with various complicating illnesses, {{including}} obesity, diabetesmellitus, hypertension and advanced aging. These patients {{are at high}} risk of severe post-operative complications. Thus, {{the question of whether or}} not to perform systemic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains controversial for all patients. It is reported that external <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are the most commonly involved <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in endo-metrial cancer, and para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (PAN) metastases spread via a route shared by the common <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of omitting PAN dissection when metastasis of the common iliac and external <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> is negative. Methods: Between January 1994 and June 2004, a total of 101 patients at Akita University Hospital who had undergone total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, total pelvic lymphadenectomy and para-aortic lymphadenectomy to the level of the renal vein for endometrial cancer were enrolled in this study. Results: Eleven patients in all were found to have metastasis for PANs. Among 13 patients with common and/or external <b>iliac</b> positive <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> 10 showed PAN metastasis. Of the 88 patients with negative <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> 87 showed no PAN metastasis. Based on these data, common and/or external <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> had 90. 9 % sensitivity (10 / 11) and 96. 7 % specificity (87 / 90) for detecting PAN metastasis. Conclusion: Para-aortic lymphadenectomy might be avoided by the negativity of such <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> thereby minimizing post-operative complications.

40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our hospital because of gross hematuria, right lumbar pain and lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed hydronephrosis of the right kidney, irregular bladder wall thickening at the right lateral and posterior portion and external <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> swelling of the right side. Laboratory data revealed disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC) and eosinophilia. Because she developed a high fever that was caused by acute obstructive pyelonephritis of the right kidney, percutaneous nephrostomy was placed and the therapy for DIC was initiated. Pathological examination of transurethral resection of bladder tumor performed twice showed no malignancy but inflammatory infiltration of many eosinocytes, leading to the diagnosis of eosinophilic cystitis (EC). We considered the possibility of allergic reaction to the drugs she was taking as the etiology of EC and discontinued all drugs. Although eosinophilia was resolved afterward, she then developed brain infarction, followed by cerebral hemorrhage. She was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for long-term care. CT scan that was performed 4 months after the initial presentation showed the resolution of hydronephrosis of the right kidney and external <b>iliac</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> swelling and the improvement of bladder wall thickness. Hydronephrosis of the right kidney has not recurred after removing the nephrostomy catheter. EC is a rare condition that could mimic an invasive bladder cancer.
