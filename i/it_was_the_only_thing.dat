25|$|Carpenter had {{intended}} Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The Thing was a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, Christine, was the 1983 {{adaptation of the}} Stephen King novel of the same name. The story concerns a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who buys a junked 1958 Plymouth Fury {{which turns out to}} have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. Christine did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> offered to him at the time.|$|E
25|$|While in the Soviet Union, Svetlana {{had written}} a memoir in Russian in 1963. The {{manuscript}} was carried safely {{out of the country}} by Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Svetlana handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle {{at the time of her}} own defection. Rayle made a copy of it. The book was titled Twenty Letters to a Friend (Dvadtsat' pisem k drugu). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> other than a few items of clothing taken by Svetlana on a secret passenger flight out of India. Nevertheless, as noted by Raymond Pearson (Russia and Eastern Europe), her book turned out to be quite disappointing. It featured Svetlana's naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Beria, and whitewash her own father.|$|E

500|$|With John Winchester {{making a}} demonic pact {{in the second}} season première, it was decided early on that the season would also end with another demonic pact. This {{required}} the writers to kill Sam—they felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that could motivate Dean to sell his soul—with the pact {{becoming one of the}} driving forces behind the third season. At the same time, it opened up another new storyline by questioning if what returned was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the [...] "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started with the release of demons through the Devil's Gate {{at the end of the}} second episode. This plotline continues throughout the rest of the series, with the Winchesters attempting to hunt down the demons in the third season.|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that I could change about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Kepler and Roeslin {{engaged in}} a series of {{published}} attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology {{on the one hand and}} overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared Tertius Interveniens [...] Nominally this work—presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius—was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the [...] "evil-smelling dung" [...] in which [...] "an industrious hen" [...] scrapes, there was an [...] "occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget" [...] to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer. Conversely, Sir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology, as Kepler was [...] "continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> for which people would pay him, and on it after a fashion he lived." ...|$|E

500|$|Gosling {{was educated}} at Gladstone Public School, Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B. Pearson High School. As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was {{inspired}} to become an actor. He [...] "hated" [...] being a child, was bullied in elementary school and had no friends until he was [...] "14 or 15". In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension. He was unable to read and was evaluated for {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and, contrary to false reports, never took medication. His mother left her job and homeschooled him for a year. Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him [...] "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost". Gosling performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer. He and his sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act, and was involved with a local ballet company. Performing boosted his self-confidence as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> he received praise for. He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a Canadian accent did not sound [...] "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando. He {{dropped out of high school}} at the age of 17 to focus on his acting career.|$|E

The only thing we haven't done was document the recording of a record.

2500|$|After some exploration, Tasman had {{intended}} to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. Tasman endured a very rough journey from Tasmania to New Zealand. In one of his diary entries Tasman credits his compass, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that kept him alive. On 13 December they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to do so. Tasman named it Staten Landt {{on the assumption that}} it was connected to an island (Staten Island, Argentina) at the south of the tip of South America. He sailed north, then east and five days later [...] anchored about 7km from the coast. He sent ship's boats to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by Māori in a double hulled waka (canoe) and four of his men were attacked and killed by mere.|$|E

2500|$|While {{some historians}} insist Winfield—a {{prolific}} diarist—had the scalp buried with his brother's body, {{no record of}} this claim exists. [...] After Winfield's death in 1865, at least five separate accounts maintain that Ebey's sister, Mary Ebey Bozarth, inherited the relic. Albert Kellogg, the son of Dr. John Kellogg, recalled visiting Bozarth [...] "ten or twelve years" [...] after the murder and [...] "she showed the scalp lock still retaining the long black hair. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> of that kind I had ever seen and I remember it caused cold chills to run over me." [...] After Bozarth died in 1876, Ebey's scalp was passed on to his niece, Almira Enos. The next mention of its location occurred in 1892 when Almira visited Whidbey, an event noted by the Island County Times. In the newspaper's July 29, 1892 issue it was reported: ...|$|E
2500|$|By the age {{of twenty-five}} (between April 146 and April 147), Marcus had grown disaffected with his studies in jurisprudence, and showed some signs of general malaise. His master, he writes to Fronto, was an {{unpleasant}} blowhard, and had made [...] "a hit at" [...] him: [...] "It is easy to sit yawning next to a judge, he says, but to be a judge is noble work." [...] Marcus had grown tired of his exercises, of taking positions in imaginary debates. When he criticized the insincerity of conventional language, Fronto took to defend it. In any case, Marcus' formal education was now over. He had kept his teachers on good terms, following them devotedly. His biographer records that he [...] "kept gold statues of them in his private chapel, and always honoured their tombs by personal visits". It [...] "affected his health adversely", his biographer adds, to have devoted so much effort to his studies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> the biographer could find fault in Marcus' entire boyhood.|$|E
2500|$|Hermione {{is portrayed}} {{during the whole}} series as an {{exceptionally}} talented young witch. Rowling has stated that Hermione is a [...] "borderline genius." [...] She received ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when {{she is able to}} conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is actually a N.E.W.T. level charm. She is also the first one to be able to cast non-verbal spells. Hermione is a competent duellist - Rowling has stated that while during the first three books Hermione would have beaten Harry in a magical duel, by the fourth book Harry had become so good at Defence Against the Dark Arts that he would have defeated Hermione. Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry, and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third year studies. She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> at which she ever lost.|$|E

2500|$|The {{match was}} far from being blissful. Damala {{developed}} the habit of openly criticizing and mocking Bernhardt {{in front of her}} friends. Bernhardt, in return, called him [...] "Gypsy Greek" [...] in an equal attempt to degrade him. However, in most cases, Bernhardt was so overwhelmed by her infatuation for him that she tolerated his insults and even begged him for forgiveness, behaviour which reaffirmed that Damala had the upper hand in the relationship. After Bernhardt left Russia to extend her tour to other European countries, Damala resigned from the Diplomatic Corps and followed Sarah's theatre circle. While in London, completing the final part of her tour, Bernhardt had yet another fight with Damala. Bernhardt was supposed to have created the role of playwright Victorien Sardou Theodora during the tour. Instead, she sent Sardou the telegram: [...] "I am going to die and my greatest regret is not having created your play. Adieu." [...] A few hours later, Sardou received a second message by Bernhardt which simply stated: [...] "I am not dead, I am married". When asked later by Sardou why she had wed, she somewhat naïvely responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> she had never done. Her impulsive decision to marry was probably at her own initiative, as Damala sarcastically admitted to friends that it was she who had proposed to him. The wedding took place on 4 April 1882 on London, a city that proved a convenient choice for marriage, since religious differences would have been a hindrance for a possible marriage in Paris: Bernhardt was a Roman Catholic and Damala Greek Orthodox. Bernhardt's son, Maurice, was hostile to Damala and against this marriage.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
