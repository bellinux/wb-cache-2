40|$|We {{reviewed}} the clinical records of 176 patients with essential tremor (ET) according to sex, age of onset, family history, tremor characteristics and body distribution. The patients {{were divided into}} two groups: familial (F) and non familial (NF). A positive family history for tremor was observed in 47, 2 % of the patients. Action and postural tremor were the most frequent characteristic (49, 4 %), postural alone in 26, 7 % and action alone in 9, 1 %. Rest tremor was recorded in 10, 2 %, always associated with other characteristics. There were no clinical differences between the F and NF groups. Hands were involved in 94, 9 % and the head in 26, 5 %. Isolated tremor of the hands was the most frequent form of presentation with some greater frequency in males. Sixty per cent of the patients who presented head tremor either isolated or not, were females. The presence or absence of family history did not show difference in this proportion. The age of onset ranged between 4 and 85 years. In the F group a lower mean of onset (36, 5 years) was seen in males with statistical significance. In male patients with combined action and postural tremor a lower age of onset was found. The fact of a patient having either parent affected by ET produced no difference in the age of onset. Familial or non familial <b>ET</b> <b>bearing</b> some differences, may not be considered as distinct entities. Revisamos os registros de 176 pacientes com tremor essencial (TE) quanto à história familiar, características do tremor, distribuição anatômica, idade de início dos sintomas. Os pacientes foram divididos em dois grupos: familiar (F) e não familiar (NF). História familiar de tremor foi encontrada em 47, 2 % da amostra. O tremor de ação e postura ocorreu combinadamente em 49, 4 %, somente de postura em 26, 7 % e somente de ação em 9, 1 %. O tremor de repouso foi registrado em 10, 2 %, sempre associado a outras características. Não houve diferenças clínicas entre os grupos Fe NF As mãos foram acometidas em 94, 9 % e a cabeça em 26, 5 %. O acometimento isolado das mãos foi mais frequente no sexo masculino, enquanto o tremor de cabeça foi mais frequente no sexo feminino. A idade de início variou de 4 a 85 anos e se mostrou significantemente menor nos pacientes do sexo masculino com história familiar (36, 5 anos) e também nos pacientes do sexo masculino com tremor de ação e postura combinados. A idade de início não foi diferente quando se compararam grupos de pacientes com a mãe ou o pai acometidos. Embora existam diferenças nesta amostra, elas não são suficientes para considerar o TE familiar e o não familiar como entidades distintas.

A qualitative and quantitative count of the sediment recovered from 10  g samples revealed at least 300 pollen grains in each sample. The composition of the honey sediment was analysed under the microscope, and the pollen grains from each sample were identified and classified {{on the basis of}} the identification keys available at the C.A.R. honey laboratory (Valdés et al. 1987; Carretero 1989; Moore et al. 1991; Saa Otero et al. 1996), and the manual and digital pollen collections already available in the laboratory.

40|$|The {{effects of}} isoelectronic {{replacement}} of a neutral nitrogen donor atom by an anionic carbon atom in terpyridine ruthenium(II) complexes on the electronic and photophysical {{properties of the}} resulting N,C,N'- and C,N,N'-cyclometalated aryl ruthenium(II) complexes were investigated. To this end, a series of complexes was prepared either with ligands containing exclusively nitrogen donor atoms, that is, [Ru(R- 1 -tpy) (R- 2 -tpy) ](2 +) (R- 1, R- 2 = H, CO 2 <b>Et),</b> or <b>bearing</b> either one N,C,N'- or C,N,N'-cyclometalated ligand and one tpy ligand, that is, [Ru(R- 1 -(NCN) -C-Lambda-N-Lambda) (R- 2 -tpy) ](+) and [Ru(R- 1 -(CNN) -N-Lambda-N-Lambda) (R- 2 -tpy) ](+), respectively. Single-crystal X-ray structure determinations showed that cyclometalation does not significantly alter the overall geometry of the complexes but does change the bond lengths around the ruthenium(II) center, especially the nitrogen-to-ruthenium bond length trans to the carbanion. Substitution of either of the ligands with electron-withdrawing ester functionalities fine-tuned the electronic properties and resulted {{in the presence of}} an IR probe. Using trends obtained from redox potentials, emission energies, IR spectroelectrochemical responses, and the character of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals from DFT studies, it is shown that the first reduction process and luminescence are associated with the ester-substituted C,N,N'-cyclometalated ligand in [Ru(EtO 2 C-(CNN) -N-Lambda-N-Lambda) (tpy) ](+). Cyclometalation in an N,C,N'-bonding motif changed the energetic order of the ruthenium d(zx), d(yz), and d(xy) orbitals. The red-shifted absorption in the N,C,N'-cyclometalated complexes is assigned to MLCT transitions to the tpy ligand. The red shift observed upon introduction of the ester moiety is associated with an increase in intensity of low-energy transitions, rather than a red shift of the main transition. Cyclometalation in the C,N,N'-binding motif also red-shifts the absorption, but the corresponding transition is associated with both ligand types. Luminescence of the cyclometalated complexes is relatively independent of the mode of cyclometalation, obeying the energy gap law within each individual series...|$|R
40|$|The {{leaves of}} many tracheophytes {{are covered with}} a cuticle, an {{extracellular}} membrane covering aerial organs of plants. The gas exchanges between the plant and the surrounding atmosphere are mediated by the cuticle; its acts as the main barrier to air pollutants. The study of the plant cuticle, in particular the stomatal apparatuses of conifer, is largely used as a tool analysis revealing ecological and paleoecological features. It {{is worth noting that}} {{little is known about the}} long-term response of micromorphology of natural vegetation to volcanic toxic gases. Fortunately, Campania Region with its numerous volcanic localities (Pisciarelli, Solfatara, complexe du Somma-Vésuve) represents a natural laboratory allowing experiments involving plant-volcano interactions. The object of this research is to study the conifer and angiosperms potentialities (extant and fossil) as ecological indicators useful in the identification of the environmental parameters variations. That is why, macroscopical and microscopical observations in vascular plants in relation to various environmental factors (volcanic gases, light intensity, water availability and salinity), have been analysed. A number of localities have been sampled and SEM, TEM and EDS equipments have been used together with statistic. Observations made on extant plants allowed for the first time, the study of the effects of volcanic gases on the cuticle ultrastructure of Pinus halepensis [Aleppo pine; Pisciarelli (fumigated) and Cigliano (not fumigated) localities] and Erica arborea [tree heather; Solfatara, Pisciarelli (fumigated) and Cigliano (not fumigated) localities]. TEM observations on P. halepensis cuticles fumigated or not by volcanic gases revealed insignificant thickness variations of the cell wall plus cuticle among current- and first-yearold needles of both fumigated and not fumigated trees. In particular, the needle cuticles experiencing chronic fumigation display (TEM) a calcium oxalate accumulation. Moreover, in respect to the cell surface, fibrils are parallel disposed. SEM and TEM observations allowed an identification key enabling distinction between not fumigated and fumigated material with 9 characters, providing a good tool detecting the influence of volcanism for extant and fossil plants. In specimens of E. arborea fumigated or not by volcanic gases, the total thickness of cuticles varies significantly. In plant experiencing chronic fumigation the A 2 layer records an increase of its thickness. Within three localities, a good correlation between the atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the thickness variation of A 2 layer has been found. The cuticle micromorphology of extant and fossil plants as indicator of environmental conditions. A pioneer study on the influence of volcanic gases on the cuticle structure in extant plants. This fact confirms that the cuticle is the main mediator between the plant and the atmosphere. As for fossil plants, the cuticles of Cretaceous Fossil-Lagertätten of Cusano Mutri (Late Aptian) and Pietraroja (Lower Albian) have been studied. In the former: 1) numerous taxa belonging to conifers have been identified; 2) the new species Frenelopsis cusanensis Bartiromo <b>et</b> al. <b>bearing</b> xeromorphic features has been described; 3) the occurrence of Montsechia vidalii is recorded for the first time outside of Spain. Taxonomical studies carried out on Cretaceous cuticles from Cusano Mutri and Pietraroja allowed the description of typical Euro-Sinian fossil plants. Sedimentological and taxonomical studies suggest semi-arid or arid conditions in a subtropical or tropical climate. It is worth noting as for Cusano Mutri locality, evidence of wildfire (fusain) suggests a periodic combination of arid periods, high temperatures and lightning strikes. This study (at least for extant plants) can be considered pioneering, because, for the first time, the relationships between cuticle ultrastructure variations and volcanic gases have been studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{the age of}} {{electronic}} commerce, consumers routinely acquire intangible products without engaging in any direct human interaction. These products-computer programs, digital music, <b>et</b> ceteraâ€šÃ„Ã®often arrive <b>bearing</b> terms that purport to limit the sticks in the consumers 2 ̆ 7 bundles of rights in ways that depart from the background limitations imposed by intellectual property law. For example, a consumer who has downloaded a computer program from the Internet might be presented with a screen of text imposing myriad restrictions on how the program may be used; installation commences only when the consumer clicks â€šÃ„ÃºI agree. â€šÃ„Ã¹ Courts in the United States have increasingly enforced such restrictionsâ€šÃ„Ã®labeling them â€šÃ„Ãºclick-wrap licensesâ€šÃ„Ã¹ and applying to them the same contractual concepts that govern face-to-face exchanges of promises. Similar licensing approachesâ€šÃ„Ã®albeit with quite different substantive termsâ€šÃ„Ã®have been extended into the realms of â€šÃ„Ãºfree softwareâ€šÃ„Ã¹ and â€šÃ„Ãºfree culture. â€šÃ„Ã¹ The law of tangible property offers a different lens through which to view these contemporary techniques for distributing and controlling intangible products. When someone buys land that is purportedly subject to use restrictions imposed by a prior owner, those restrictions are sometimes enforced as â€šÃ„Ãºservitudesâ€šÃ„Ã¹â€šÃ„Ã®non-possessory property interests that attach to land and impose their restrictions and obligations on generation after generation of landowners. Like click-wrap licenses and similar techniques of the digital age, use restrictions imposed by servitudes bind remote purchasers with whom the beneficiaries of the restrictions may have no direct relationship. They do not arise from any human communication, but instead â€šÃ„Ãºrun withâ€šÃ„Ã¹ the burdened assets. Although servitudes are a familiar feature of contemporary real property law, they have long encountered judicial skepticism that has generated a host of doctrinal complications. This skepticism has been even more pronounced {{in the context of}} servitudes applied to items of tangible personal property. But it finds little expression in the current contractual approach to interpreting licenses attached to intangible products. In this Article I develop a comprehensive account of the evolving jurisprudence of servitudes as applied to both land and personal property, identifying the sources of traditional servitude skepticism in order better to evaluate the new generation of running restrictions on intangible informational goods. I apply the lessons I draw from the old servitudes to paradigmatic examples of contemporary licensing practicesâ€šÃ„Ã®including Microsoft end-user license agreements, the Free Software Foundation 2 ̆ 7 s General Public License, and Creative Commons licenses. The lessons I draw from the old servitudes bring the problemsâ€šÃ„Ã®and also the promiseâ€šÃ„Ã®of these new servitudes into sharp focus, providing a new framework within which to analyze emerging electronic commerce practices while contributing doctrinally and historically grounded insights into the ongoing debate about the proper relationship between intellectual property and the public domain.
