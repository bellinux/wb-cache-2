They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best <b>in</b> <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E

25|$|Austrian {{psychiatrist}} Alfred Adler (1870–1937), who parted {{ways with}} Freud, emphasised {{the role of}} goals and motivation in his Individual Psychology. One of Adler's most famous ideas is {{that we try to}} compensate for inferiorities that we perceive <b>in</b> <b>ourselves.</b> A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and <b>in</b> <b>ourselves,</b> celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E

2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars is {{the sixth}} novel by author John Green, {{published}} in January 2012.

The western nations respond with biological warfare and bombard China with dozens of the most infectious diseases.

2500|$|In 2004, Crosby {{recorded}} {{bundles of}} tracks that were titled Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x; {{they were released}} through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band's line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release {{the best of both}} bundles as one album, titled Nude. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing Nude on an indie label was a [...] "nightmare" [...] because [...] "There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level.

2500|$|Martin Heidegger {{rejected}} the philosophical {{basis of the}} concepts of [...] "subjectivity" [...] and [...] "objectivity" [...] and asserted that similar grounding oppositions in logic ultimately refer to one another. Instead of resisting the admission of this paradox {{in the search for}} understanding, Heidegger requires that we embrace it through an active process of elucidation he called the [...] "hermeneutic circle". He stressed the historicity and cultural construction of concepts while simultaneously advocating the necessity of an [...] and immanent apprehension of them. In this vein, he asserted that it was the task of contemporary philosophy to recover the original question of (or [...] "openness to") Dasein (translated as Being or Being-there) present in the Presocratic philosophers but normalized, neutered, and standardized since Plato. This was to be done, in part, by tracing the record of Dasein's sublimation or forgetfulness through the history of philosophy which meant that we were to ask again what constituted the grounding conditions <b>in</b> <b>ourselves</b> and in the World for the affinity between beings and between the many usages of the term [...] "being" [...] in philosophy. To do this, however, a non-historical and, to a degree, self-referential engagement with whatever set of ideas, feelings or practices would permit (both the non-fixed concept and reality of) such a continuity was required—a continuity permitting the possible experience, possible existence indeed not only of beings but of all differences as they appeared and tended to develop.|$|E
2500|$|Adorno's work {{sets out}} from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the {{recognition}} of what is primitive <b>in</b> <b>ourselves</b> and the world itself. Neither Picasso's fascination with African sculpture nor Mondrian's reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with primitivism Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating commodification, sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of [...] "primitive" [...] peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique {{of the ways in}} which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining [...] "how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation". In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in Negative Dialectics, is nothing but [...] "the law of doom thus far obeyed by history." [...] At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.|$|E
