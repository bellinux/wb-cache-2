A better understanding of the diagenetic behaviour of Hg and methylmercury in aquatic environments has lead us to consider methods of enhancing natural processes which would either limit the mobility of Hg in flooded soils or its methylation.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{treatment}} of surface waters containing humic substances. The {{most often used}} method of surface water treatment is coagulation with subsequent separation of aggregates. In this study, only perikinetic coagulation phase was studied. It is the phase when aggregates are formed by the Brownian motion only, i. e. without mixing. Separation of the formed aggregates was made by centrifugation. Coagulation tests were made under the laboratory conditions with model humic water. Humic substances were added from a concentrate, which was taken from a natural peatbog. The influence of temperature on the coagulation process was studied, ranging from 5 to 22 °C. Chitosan (natural biopolymer) was used as coagulant. In present, it is not used in Czech water treatment practice yet. No effect of temperature was observed when chitosan was used as coagulant. Influence of temperature was also studied {{with the use of}} aluminium and <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphates,</b> which are used in common praxis as coagulation reagents. Influence of the temperature was observed and is in agreement with previously reported data of pilot-plant experiments by other researchers.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined for optimal doses. At first, coagulation tests were made under the laboratory temperature.
