5|$|Brady v. Maryland (1963) {{is another}} significant, {{specific}} criminal procedural right {{guaranteed by the}} due process clauses. Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory (or impeachment) material, within the government's possession, from the defendant, {{and there is a}} reasonable probability that, if such material had been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> ("materiality"). Brady is a holistic, rather than piece-by-piece, inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Many Soviet {{citizens}} {{believed that}} the outcome may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if Anatoli Firsov and Vitaly Davydov had not sat out the series to protest a coaching change. In response, some offer that Canada was without Bobby Orr due to his knee injury as well as Bobby Hull (due to his departure from the NHL to the newly formed WHA league). These were arguably the best Canadian players at the time (along with Phil Esposito), so neither team had all of its greatest talent on the ice. The Soviet team also had the obvious advantage of playing year-round. Meanwhile, the Canadian team was picked and prepared {{in only a few}} months and most players were out-of-shape. At the time, NHL players did not regularly train during the summer months, using the period for a holiday or other activities.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{betrayed by}} Muirchertach, Magnus {{may also have}} been betrayed by his own men (in {{particular}} the contingent of nobleman Torgrim Skinnluve from the Uplands, who fled to the ships during the battle). It is possible that Torgrim and his men may have been directed by powerful men in Norway, who wanted Magnus removed from the Norwegian throne. More Irishmen than Norwegians fell in the battle, according to Snorri Sturluson, and Magnus' reign could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if Torgrim and his men had fought as directed. Magnus' son Sigurd returned to Norway without his child bride after his father's defeat, and direct Norwegian control in the region came to an end. Although Norwegian influence remained, no Norwegian king returned for more than 150 years.|$|E
5|$|The Years of Rice and Salt is an {{alternate}} history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson {{and published in}} 2002. The novel explores how world history might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from {{the army of the}} Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.|$|E
5|$|There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> {{approaches}} to co-educational Scouting. Countries {{such as the}} United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls. In other countries, especially within Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, {{and there is a}} single organization for boys and girls, which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts (members of WOSM) and guides (members of WAGGGS), both admitting boys and girls.|$|E

5|$|When the Germans {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} Crete on 20 May, Kippenberger, {{like most of the}} defenders of the island, was surprised at the sight of hundreds of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) descending under parachutes. He quickly recovered and was making his way to his headquarters, when a burst of gunfire from a paratrooper was directed his way. After twisting his ankle in avoiding the gunfire, he stalked and killed the paratrooper with a shot to the head. His brigade was positioned east of Maleme airfield, on the Galatas plains. It was well positioned to counterattack scattered paratroopers who were beginning to consolidate into a good starting position from which an attack on the airfield could be launched. His request to do so was denied by the acting divisional commander, Brigadier Edward Puttick. An attack launched later without Kippenberger's knowledge failed although he believed the outcome could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different</b> if his troops had been involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>different.</b> Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E
