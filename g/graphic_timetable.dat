25|$|The <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable</b> is a {{two-dimensional}} {{image of the}} train journeys. Time is displayed horizontally from midnight XII o'clock to midnight XII o'clock. The stations along the journey, from Zug and Lucerne to Chiasso, Locarno and Luino are displayed vertically. The first scheduled train, an express train with 1st, 2nd and 3rd class carriages, leaves Bellinzona at 03:17am. The train with the number55 {{is powered by a}} steam locomotive and, according to the timetable, does not make a scheduled stop at Giubiasco, Rivera-Bironico and Taverne. Arrival at Lugano is scheduled at 04:09am, from where it leaves again at 04:14am. In 1899 the entire train journey from Bellinzona to Lugano was scheduled to be 52minutes. Today(2017), the same journey on one of the EC trains takes 27 minutes. The illustrations shows that between Giubiasco and Rivera Bironico trains do not pass each other as in 1899 this was, as mentioned in the paragraph above, a single track line. This information can thus be drawn form both, the stations' track layout and the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable.</b> Also visible on the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable</b> is the fact that between Osogna and Biasca, trains however do pass each other along their journeys, it being a double-track line. Further, the Arth-Rigi-Bahn's trains (nowadays Rigi Railways), are also listed in the Gotthard railways' timetable. The timetable's scale is 15mm/hour horizontally and 1.75mm/km vertically.|$|E
25|$|The Gotthard Railway <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable</b> {{contains}} {{a great variety}} of information with regards to material and especially operational aspects in the year 1899, 17years after the inauguration of the Gotthard tunnel and completion of the railway. The map key and captions to each column are to be found {{at the top of the}} page. Leading from left to right information is given on the location of each station's elevation in relation to sea level, the longitudinal profile, signal lights, tunnels and their length, for each route section on southbound journeys the greatest gradient, distances, employed telegraphs and their networking, signal bells and their connection, telephones, block stations, track layout of the respective station and their equipment, total usable length of the remaining tracks, the longest side track, station names and distances between them, distance to point of origin and between main stations. Departure and arrival times are displayed within the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Information can {{be drawn}} as to the tunnel's vertex which lies at 1154,5meters above sea level {{and the fact that}} the tunnel does not run in a {{straight}} line but rather in a slope down from either side of its vertex. The tunnel was designed in such a way that inflowing water would be able to drain. From the railway station of Göschenen to the tunnel's vertex the train lines ascend at an angle of 6‰ and descend at 2‰ from vertex to the village of Airolo. The tunnel's length is indicated to be 14'998meters, its vertex being at kilometre80. It must be noted that the old Gotthard railways' distances were measured from the town of Immensee, as clearly indicated on the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The track {{layout of}} each station {{shows that in}} 1899 the Gotthard railway ran on double-tracks from the villages of Flüelen to Giubiasco. Facing north {{the picture on the}} right shows the [...] at the Mondascia bridge depicts the double-tracks and advance signal to the entry signal before Biasca (at132.5km), {{mentioned}} in the timetable. The next picture on the right shows the Pianotondo viaduct and the Pianotono-spiral tunnel's upper gate with its watchman's house, which came into use during the days of the double-track steam service, roughly {{at the time of the}} <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable's</b> validity.|$|R
40|$|My {{contribution}} {{is linked to}} a certain extent to Marie Kubínová’s contribution on <b>Graphic</b> <b>Timetables.</b> However, here I would like to focus more on the way problems within the Socrates Comenius Project IIATM (Implementing Innovative Approaches to the Teaching of Mathematics) are elaborated and trialled. The partnership of the project consists of four countries – the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom. Each partner has a group of 3 - 5 collaborating practicing teachers and is responsible for one Unit. During their common meetings, problems are suggested (mostly by the teachers themselves) to be used within the Unit. These are elaborated in a team and then trialled at schools. It is necessary to stress that the trials are done during normal teaching with the number of students customary in the country (usually 25 - 30). The trials are recorded by the teachers in pre-prepared tables so that their results can be communicated to others. If possible, the teaching is video or audio recorded. The tables and recordings are basis of the whole team reflections which focus on the evaluation whether the problem met our needs and goals. Some modifications are made and further trials done if necessary. The problems successfully trialled in one country are sent to the other three countries where som...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable</b> sees two tracks running southwards from Giubiasco station. One is signposted [...] "Chiasso", {{the other}} [...] "Luino/Locarno". From this point onwards the railway runs on single tracks. Giubiasco's {{neighbouring}} stations to the south, Rivera-Bironico and Cadenazzo, {{are all on}} single tracks. At each underpass on the Ceneri section it is clearly visible to this day that these were built at greatly different points in time. The Giubiasco-Al Sasso and Al Sasso-Rivera sections were equipped with double-tracks in 1922 and 1934 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The Gotthardbahn {{employed}} signal bells {{within its}} stations {{and along the}} line to signal any approaching train. An alarm was triggered once a train had left a neighbouring station or block station. These signal bells were partly installed along the line and signalled any construction worker an approaching train. In addition, any railway watchman's house and railroad crossing would be equipped with a signal bell. Southbound trains were signalled by 3 triple chimes, northbound trains by two double chimes. The signalling mechanism at each signal bell had to be manually wound up every day by station employees and railway watchmen. Part of the mechanism was a weight having to be raised by help of a pulley. The electric signal triggering the alarm operated a relay, activating the bell's hammer through force of the aforementioned weight. Each signal bell within the Gotthard railway's network is marked on the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable.</b> The railway watchman's house number159 (Casello159) signal bell on the Monte Ceneri line between Giubiasco and Rivera-Bironico is shown as an example in the [...] A southbound train departing Giubiasco for Rivera-Bironico would trigger alarms of eleven different signal bells on its 11 kilometres long journey. Around 1980 these signal bells were decommissioned.|$|E

Subsequently, an analysis of the available technologies for creating custom diagrams and database systems was performed. The product of this thesis is a web application which purpose is a graphic representation of traffic on the track {{in the form of an}} interactive graphic element.

40|$|The {{operation}} of railway traffic {{from a single}} dispatching control centre ensures high quality of traffic management. Even better traffic control could be achieved through the automation of the dispatchers’ routine work. It saves dispatchers´ time which he can be devoted to solving conflicts caused by delayed trains. The process of planning the traffic and the execution of this plan are two independent activities which {{have to be done}} simultaneously. The dispatcher of the remote controlled lines has not just to optimize the railway traffic, he has to care for the properly train route setting as well. The new system of automatic train route setting should help him by doing much work on above mentioned activities for him. System that fulfils these requirements is automatic train route setting system. System or train dispatcher just decides how to handle the conflict situation and the function of automatic train route setting will execute the command at the proper time. This trend can be also seen in other countries. Very helpful for dispatchers who control the railway traffic is the <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable.</b> There is a common used application called GTN on Czech railways which is supplied together with the electronic interlocking from the AZD Praha. This application shows the actual and expected <b>graphic</b> <b>timetable</b> in the most appropriate form for dispatcher and moreover provides many other support functions. New designed function of the graphic train route editor enables precising the predicted timetable and consequently gaining the most probable prediction in the next moments. Given that GTN knows the actual timetable, dispose of data of trains and knows the exact train location in real time, the GTN is nowadays a powerful tool for decision support for traffic control staff. Therefore, GTN {{is an essential part of}} the system of automatic train route setting which is now being developed. Using the existing electronic interlocking, their remote control and the GTN application seems to be the easiest way how to implement automatic train route setting system on the infrastructure of the Czech railways...|$|E
