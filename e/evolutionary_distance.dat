5|$|Fruit flies (Drosophila), {{because of}} the large array of {{techniques}} available for studying their genetics, have been a natural subject for studying the role of genes in brain development. In spite of the large <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distance</b> between insects and mammals, many aspects of Drosophila neurogenetics {{have been shown to be}} relevant to humans. The first biological clock genes, for example, were identified by examining Drosophila mutants that showed disrupted daily activity cycles. A search in the genomes of vertebrates revealed a set of analogous genes, which were found to play similar roles in the mouse biological clock—and therefore almost certainly in the human biological clock as well. Studies done on Drosophila, also show that most neuropil regions of the brain are continuously reorganized throughout life in response to specific living conditions.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and evolutionary biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the evolutionary history of populations. The classic example of this is in human evolutionary genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distance</b> between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E

2500|$|The {{molecular}} clock hypothesis posits that homologous genes evolve at an approximately constant rate across different species.

Therefore, assuming a {{molecular clock}}, the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distance</b> between orthologous genes should be approximately proportional to the evolutionary distances between their respective species. If a putative group of orthologs contains xenologs (pairs of genes related through an HGT), the proportionality of evolutionary distances may only hold among the orthologs, not the xenologs.|$|E

40|$|Estimation of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances</b> {{has always}} been a major issue in the study of {{molecular}} evolution because <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances</b> are required for estimating the rate of evolution in a gene, the divergence dates between genes or organisms, and the relationships among genes or organisms. Other closely related issues are the estimation of the pattern of nucleotide substitution, the estimation of the degree of rate variation among sites in a DNA sequence, and statistical testing of the molecular clock hypothesis. Mathematical treatments of these problems are considerably simplified by the assumption of a stationary process in which the nucleotide compositions of the sequences under study have remained approximately constant over time, and there now exist fairly extensive studies of stationary models of nucleotide substitution, although some problems remain to be solved. Nonstationary models are much more complex, but significant progress has been recently made by the development of the paralinear and LogDet distances.

2500|$|RNA viruses such as {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) evolve at an extremely rapid rate, orders of magnitude faster than mammals or birds. For these organisms, ancestral reconstruction can be applied on a much shorter time scale; for example, in order to reconstruct the global or regional progenitor of an epidemic that has spanned decades rather than millions of years. [...] A team around Brian Gaschen proposed that such reconstructed strains be used as targets for vaccine design efforts, as opposed to sequences isolated from patients in the present day. Because HIV is extremely diverse, a vaccine designed to work on one patient's viral population might not work for a different patient, because the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distance</b> between these two viruses may be large. However, their most recent common ancestor is closer {{to each of the}} two viruses than they are to each other. Thus, a vaccine designed for a common ancestor could {{have a better chance of}} being effective for a larger proportion of circulating strains. Another team took this idea further by developing a center-of-tree reconstruction method to produce a sequence whose total <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distance</b> to contemporary strains is as small as possible. Strictly speaking, this method was not ancestral reconstruction, as the center-of-tree (COT) sequence does not necessarily represent a sequence that has ever existed in the evolutionary history of the virus. However, Rolland and colleagues did find that, in the case of HIV, the COT virus was functional when synthesized. Similar experiments with synthetic ancestral sequences obtained by maximum likelihood reconstruction have likewise shown that these ancestors are both functional and immunogenic, lending some credibility to these methods. [...] Furthermore, ancestral reconstruction can potentially be used to infer the genetic sequence of the transmitted HIV variants that have gone on to establish the next infection, with the objective of identifying distinguishing characteristics of these variants (as a non-random selection of the transmitted population of viruses) that may be targeted for vaccine design.|$|E

40|$|Models of DNA {{sequence}} {{evolution and}} methods for estimating <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances</b> {{are needed for}} studying the rate and pattern of molecular evolution and for inferring the evolutionary relationships of organisms or genes. In this dissertation, several new models and methods are developed. ^ The rate variation among nucleotide sites: To obtain unbiased estimates of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances,</b> the rate heterogeneity among nucleotide sites of a gene should be considered. Commonly, {{it is assumed that}} the substitution rate varies among sites according to a gamma distribution (gamma model) or, more generally, an invariant+gamma model which includes some invariable sites. A maximum likelihood (ML) approach was developed for estimating the shape parameter of the gamma distribution (α) and/or the proportion of invariable sites (θ). Computer simulation showed that (1) under the gamma model, α can be well estimated from 3 or 4 sequences if the sequence length is long; and (2) the distance estimate is unbiased and robust against violations of the assumptions of the invariant+gamma model. ^ However, this ML method requires a huge amount of computational time and is useful only for less than 6 sequences. Therefore, I developed a fast method for estimating α, which is easy to implement and requires no knowledge of tree. A computer program was developed for estimating α and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances,</b> which can handle the number of sequences as large as 30. ^ <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>distances</b> under the stationary, time-reversible (SR) model: The SR model is a general model of nucleotide substitution, which assumes (i) stationary nucleotide frequencies and (ii) time-reversibility. It can be extended to SRV model which allows rate variation among sites. I developed a method for estimating the distance under the SR or SRV model, as well as the variance-covariance matrix of distances. Computer simulation showed that the SR method is better than a simpler method when the sequence length L 3 ̆e 1, 000 bp and is robust against deviations from time-reversibility. As expected, when the rate varies among sites, the SRV method is much better than the SR method. ^ The <b>evolutionary</b> <b>distances</b> under nonstationary nucleotide frequencies: The statistical properties of the paralinear and LogDet distances under nonstationary nucleotide frequencies were studied. First, I developed formulas for correcting the estimation biases of the paralinear and LogDet distances. The performances of these formulas and the formulas for sampling variances were examined by computer simulation. Second, I developed a method for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the paralinear distance, so that statistical tests of phylogenies can be conducted when the nucleotide frequencies are nonstationary. Third, a new method for testing the molecular clock hypothesis was developed in the nonstationary case. ...|$|R
