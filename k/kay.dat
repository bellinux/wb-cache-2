5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred <b>Kay.</b> Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting <b>Kay</b> down for a count of eight. When <b>Kay</b> rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth <b>Kay</b> had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round <b>Kay</b> caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and <b>Kay</b> retained his belt.|$|E
