In addition to competing in triathlons, Pritzker has also run marathons. Pritzker is married to ophthalmologist Bryan Traubert, with whom she has two children.

5|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for The Simpsons ninth season, writer Donick Cary {{stated that}} the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time. Executive producer Mike Scully said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad jokes through the network censors. The stereotypical jokes were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand it was simply emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{after failing}} to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having {{received}} harsh criticism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> turning the airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M.

The Midway Airport parking garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas.|$|E

5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E
5|$|Isoform “a” {{of human}} CASS4 is {{considered}} the predominant species, and at 786 amino acids is the longest one. Amino acid sequence homology of this isoform of human CASS4 with other family members is 26% overall identity and 42% similarity. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the CASS4 protein SH3 domain was shown {{to interact with the}} FAK C-terminus, despite the lowest overall similarity to other SH3 domains in the CAS group. In addition, human CASS4 has a limited number of candidate SH2-binding sites, estimated at 10, which is similar to EFS (estimated at 9) and in contrast to p130Cas/BCAR1 and NEDD9, which have 20 and 18 respectively. The CASS4 C-terminus has a short region of CAS family homology, but lacks obvious similarity at the level of primary amino acid sequence. It also lacks a YDYVHL sequence at the N-terminal end of the FAT-like carboxy-terminal domain, even though this motif is conserved among the other three CAS family proteins and is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. Although this lack of sequence similarity may mean a reduced functionality of the CASS4 protein, molecular modeling analysis performed by Singh and colleagues using p130CAS/BCAR1 structures as templates suggested an almost identical fold between CASS4 and p130CAS/BCAR1 within their SH3 domains, and substantial similarity within 432-591 residues of CASS4 and 449-610 residues of p130Cas/BCAR1 at the level of secondary and tertiary structures. Also, the similar periodicity of α-helices and β-sheets in both CASS4 and p130Cas/BCAR1 provides another confirmation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> well-conserved structures within the family members.|$|E

A significant motivating force behind the success of the British Empire was its use of sophisticated technology; the Martians, also attempting to establish an empire on Earth, have technology superior to their British adversaries. In The War of the Worlds, Wells depicted an imperial power as the victim of imperial aggression, and thus perhaps encouraging the reader to consider imperialism itself.|$|E

25|$|With the {{emergence}} of national states in Europe during the 1800s, the Danevirke became a powerful symbol for Denmark and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a unique Danish people and Danish culture. Throughout the nineteenth century, Denmark and Germany struggled politically and militarily for possession of the territory variously known as Sønderjylland or Slesvig by the Danes and Schleswig by the Germans. Two wars were fought, the First Schleswig War (1848–1851) and the Second Schleswig War (1864), eventually resulting in a Danish defeat and subsequent German annexation. In this hostile context, the Danevirke played an important role, at first as a mental cultural barrier against Germany, but soon also as a concrete military fortification, when it was strengthened with cannon emplacements and entrenchments in 1850 and again in 1861.|$|E
25|$|A key {{development}} {{in the ability to}} use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special IBM Selectric typewriter interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the IBM 1050 and IBM 2741 terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.|$|E
