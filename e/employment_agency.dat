5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure to provide service to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the <b>Employment</b> <b>Agency</b> Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

The unemployment rate in the district of the <b>employment</b> <b>agency</b> without the offices of Dillenburg and Wetzlar Biedenkopf (which includes the city of Wetzlar, and 12 surrounding municipalities) was in July 2009 6.9%, which corresponds to 5698 unemployed.|$|E
25|$|In reality these {{requirements}} are not enforced, {{because there are}} minimal resources devoted to oversight.

In a £26 billion industry with 17,000 agencies, in 2004 the Inspectorate investigated 1,057 complaints, secured 8 convictions (solely in the entertainment industry, 2 agencies were banned for 10 years) and £5,735 in compensation for workers.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, Leigh, aged 40 {{and retired}} from {{modeling}}, {{was living in}} France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France. The police and courts insisted she was running an illegal <b>employment</b> <b>agency,</b> and she was fined. After World War II, employment agencies were declared illegal. Leigh contacted the Fords about starting a legitimate modeling agency, {{the first of its}} kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.|$|E

That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes." ...|$|E

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20 th century, state and local governments in the U. S. began to {{establish}} public employment offices. These non-profit governmental organizations match job seekers and businesses. One of the main objectives of these organizations was to protect job seekers from fraudulent activities by private <b>employment</b> <b>agencies.</b> In this paper, I propose a theory that describes malpractices of private <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> as a situation of asymmetric information between job seekers and private <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> which could cause adverse selection in the labor exchange market. The establishment of public employment offices {{can be viewed as a}} policy device to eliminate low quality private <b>employment</b> <b>agencies</b> that committed malpractices. I show that public employment offices helped lower the degree of asymmetric information. The majority of job seekers who used public employment offices were unskilled workers, immigrants or migrants who were vulnerable to exploitation by private <b>employment</b> <b>agencies.</b> I also find that the role of public employment offices was especially important for interstate migrants who were most lacking in information and networks in this new environment...|$|R
