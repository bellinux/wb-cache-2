5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in <b>figure</b> <b>9,</b> this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in <b>Figure</b> <b>9,</b> the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (<b>figure</b> <b>9)</b> are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} BB-OFDMA with {{variable}} BB power, termed BB-ITS, are {{also included in}} <b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (a)– 9 (d). With BB-ITS, the lower 10 %-ile of user throughput achieved is 1.04 [*]Mbps in uplink and 1.416 [*]Mbps in downlink (see <b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (c)- 9 (d)), at a modest degradation in system throughput (see <b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (a)- 9 (b)) compared to BB-OFDMA with fixed threshold that maximises the respective system throughput. BB-ITS, therefore, not only avoids the need for tuning the interference threshold so as to match a certain interference scenario (e.g., in uplink or downlink), but also achieves a preferable compromise between maximising system throughput and maintaining fairness.|$|R
30|$|<b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (e)– 9 (i) {{contains}} frames from {{a walking}} sequence, where the pixels around the person's neck are mistaken for static pixels, leading to two Activity Areas, one {{corresponding to the}} head and one to the body, shown in <b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (f), 9 (g). When {{there are more than}} one Activity Area, the sequential testing is applied to each Activity Area separately, since there could be more than one different activity taking place. In this example, the area corresponding to the head is too small to provide enough samples for a reliable estimate of the change-point, so only the likelihood ratio values for the Activity Area corresponding to the body of the person with the coat are shown in <b>Figures</b> <b>9</b> (h), 9 (i). Even in this case, the change points are correctly found.|$|R
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in <b>figure</b> <b>9.</b> Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

30|$|The WFO {{was built}} on this idea. The easy {{satisfaction}} of close mobiles (with better spectral efficiency) offers a degree of freedom which ideally should be exploited {{in order to help}} the farther ones. WFO allocates to each mobile the accurate share of bandwidth required for the satisfaction of its QoS constraints, whatever its position is.

25|$|The new {{latching}} clock region {{would be}} completely independent from the other four clocking zones illustrated in <b>figure</b> <b>9.</b> For instance, if the value {{of interest to the}} new latching region were to be the value that D presents every 16th phase, the clocking mechanism of the new region would have to be configured to latch a value in the 4th phase and every 16th phase from then on, thus, ignoring all inputs but D.|$|E
25|$|We then plot {{two points}} A(50,40) and B(-10,-40), {{representing}} {{the state of}} stress at plane A and B as show in both Figure 8 and <b>Figure</b> <b>9.</b> These points follow the engineering mechanics sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (Figure 5), which assumes positive normals stresses outward from the material element, and positive shear stresses on each plane rotating the material element clockwise. This way, the shear stress acting on plane B is negative and the shear stress acting on plane A is positive.|$|E
25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. <b>Figure</b> <b>9</b> shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E

25|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to have at least}} three spacecraft if permanent high elevation coverage is needed for a large area like the whole of Russia where some parts are as far south as 45° N. If three spacecraft are used, each spacecraft is active for periods of eight hours per orbit centered at apogee as illustrated in <b>figure</b> <b>9.</b> The Earth completes half a rotation in 12 hours, so the apogees of successive Molniya orbits will alternate between one half of the northern hemisphere and the other half. For example if the apogee longitudes are 90° E and 90° W, the apogees will alternately serve Europe and Asia (see figures 3 to 5) and next Northern America (see figures 6 to 8). The orbits of the three spacecraft should then have the same apogee longitudes (for example 90° W and 90° E), but pass the apogee with eight hours shift; i.e. the right ascensions of the ascending nodes should be separated with 120°. When one spacecraft has reached the point corresponding to figure 5 (or figure 8) four hours after apogee passage, the next spacecraft has four hours left to reach apogee and having a right ascension of ascending node 120° larger than the previous spacecraft. Said next spacecraft has the visibility displayed in figure 3 (or figure 6) and the switch-over can take place. Note that the two spacecraft at the time of switch-over are separated about 1500km, so that the ground stations only have to move the antennas a few degrees to acquire the new spacecraft.|$|E

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in <b>Figure</b> <b>9,</b> can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water to roll off easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E
500|$|Finline is a {{different}} kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. [...] There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. [...] Finline is a variation of slot-waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. [...] This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. [...] Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. [...] The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. [...] Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. [...] More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of <b>figure</b> <b>9</b> are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal. [...] This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design. [...] Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths.|$|E
