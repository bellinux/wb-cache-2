40|$|In {{views of}} the {{deterioration}} of global warming, the issue of reducing CO 2 emission have been prevailing. Vehicle/Transportation is considered as the second major source of CO 2 emission in the US. This project aims at examining what part of vehicle specification will have correlation and regression relation with the CO 2 emission. With correlation analysis, Engine Displacement and Cylinder are found to have positive relation with CO 2 emission, whereas the MPG have negative correlation with CO 2 emission. The regression relationship among CO 2, <b>Displacement,</b> <b>Cylinder,</b> and MPG {{are found to be}} significant due to relatively large r square value and small p-value. The results and finding may be referenced by vehicle manufacturers to refine their design and sustainability consideration. The customers may also utilize the results in making decision of purchasing vehicle with environment protection focus...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} power {{production}} of their 1 MW wave en-ergy converter, Wavestar {{is developing a}} new transmission based on discrete hydraulics. The discrete hydraulic system allows all cylinders to supply a common accumulator storage while main-taining low-loss individual force control of the 20 absorbers. The system is implemented using multi-chambered cylinders, where the different chambers may be switched between three pressure lines using a manifold with fast on/off valves. Resul-tantly, a Discrete <b>Displacement</b> <b>Cylinder</b> (DDC) is obtained, where force control is implemented by shifting between different area/pressure combinations. Currently, a 420 kN DDC prototype has been implemented and tested at the newly commissioned full size wave energy testbench at Aalborg University.

Probabilistic reliability methods can be used to optimize the structure of WECs. Optimization is often performed for critical structural components, like welded details, bolts or bearings. This paper considers reliability studies with a focus on plain bearings available from stock for the Wavestar device, which exists at the prototype level. The Wavestar device is a point absorber WEC. The plan is to mount a new power take-off (PTO) system consisting of a discrete <b>displacement</b> <b>cylinder</b> (DDC), which will allow different hydraulic cycles to operate at constant pressure levels. This setup increases the conversion efficiency, as well as decouples the electricity production from the pressure variations within the hydraulic cycle when waves are passing. The new PTO system leads to different load characteristics at the floater itself compared to the actual setup where the turbine/generator is directly coupled to the fluctuating hydraulic pressure within the PTO system. This paper calculates the structural reliability of the different available plain bearings planned to be mounted at the new PTO system based on a probabilistic approach, and the paper gives suggestions for fulfilling the minimal target reliability levels.

40|$|The Wavestar Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is a {{multiple}} absorber concept, consisting of 20 hemisphere shaped floats {{attached to a}} single platform. The heart of the Wavestar WEC is the Power Take-Off (PTO) system, converting the wave induced motion of the floats into a steady power output to the grid. In the present work, a PTO based on a novel discrete displacement fluid power technology is explored for the Wavestar WEC. Absorption of power from the floats is performed by hydraulic cylinders, supplying power to a common fixed pressure system with accumulators for energy smoothing. The stored pressure energy is converted into electricity at a steady pace by hydraulic motors and generators. The storage, thereby, decouples the complicated process of wave power absorption from power generation. The core for enabling this PTO technology is implementing a near loss-free force control of the energy absorbing cylinders. This is achieved by using special multi-chambered cylinders, where the different chambers may {{be connected to the}} available system pressures using fast on/off valves. Resultantly, a Discrete <b>Displacement</b> <b>Cylinder</b> (DDC) is created, allowing near loss free discrete force control. This paper presents a complete PTO system for a 20 float Wavestar based on the DDC. The WEC and PTO is rigorously modeled from incident waves to the electric output to the grid. The resulting model of + 600 states is simulated in different irregular seas, showing that power conversion efficiencies above 70 % from input power to electrical power is achievable for all relevant sea conditions...|$|E
