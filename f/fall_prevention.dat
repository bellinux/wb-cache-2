25|$|The University of Essex {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, {{the results indicated that}} Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women who participated in this last mentioned research for <b>fall</b> <b>prevention.</b> As said by investigators, it would not be appropriate to generalize, however one participant who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest positive changes in well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes.|$|E
40|$|The <b>prevention</b> of <b>falls</b> {{is a key}} safety {{priority}} for hospitals. There are no tools that examine the safety climate from a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> perspective. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> safety climate at an Australian metropolitan hospital. The Victorian Safety Climate Survey (SCS) was used to examine the general safety climate, with four items replicated and modified to examine the <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> climate. Data (n = 458) for the six SCS domains compared favourably with statewide data. The <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> items were correlated with the original items from which they were derived but responses regarding <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> tended to be less positive than patient safety more broadly.

40|$|Older {{adults are}} not optimally engaged in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. Peer {{education}} {{may be an}} approach to improving engagement and uptake of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies by community-dwelling older adults. However, empirical research regarding this approach has been inconclusive. Accordingly, the primary aim {{of this research was}} to design a peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education program and evaluate its impact on community-dwelling older adults’ beliefs, knowledge, motivation, and intention to engage in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. This research was a mixed methods study conducted in two phases. Phase 1 comprised three concurrent studies. These aimed to elucidate the issues regarding <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education and information from key stakeholders and to inform the research in Phase 2. The aims of Phase 1 were, first; to seek key stakeholders’ perspectives in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the role of peer educators in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> second; to garner views about community-dwelling older adults’ preferences for seeking and receiving <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> information, and third; to seek expert evaluation and opinion about the peer educators’ presentations of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education for community-dwelling older adults. Feedback from peer educators and expert reviewers indicated that peer education was a feasible and potentially effective approach to deliver education about <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> but that the education should be presented in a personalised manner and incorporate adult learning principles and behaviour change theory. Older adults also suggested that practical strategies and information should be presented in a positive and respectful manner. Their prior experience of falling was found to be an important mediator to receptivity to <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> messages. Based on the findings of Phase 1, Phase 2 involved the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a new contemporary peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education program. A longitudinal quasi-experimental trial (n= 232) was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the presentation with the existing program, using a purpose-developed questionnaire. Peer-led <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education significantly increased older adults’ beliefs that <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> measures would be useful, their knowledge about <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies and intention to take measures to reduce their risk of falling. Older adults who received the contemporary program were significantly more likely to develop a clear action plan to engage in specific measures to reduce their risk of falling compared to the control group. Future research should investigate how well designed peer education programs contribute to improving older adults’ engagement in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} meaning of falling for older people {{who had participated in}} a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> {{programme}} to establish the importance of identity in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions. METHOD: Data were collected in a 14 -week video observation period of two consecutive <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> group programmes, examination of participant referral records and a series of semi-structured interviews with 11 participants. FINDINGS: The meaning of falling for older people is closely related to the individual's identity. Participants attended the <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme because a professional they respected referred them, not because they thought they would gain personal value. Participants used a collective identity, of individuals who fall, to show how they differed from this social construct. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the importance of the personal and collective identity of ageing on <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> Professionals consulting with older people about <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> should offer individual plans that are agreed and valued by the older person...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{types of}} balance {{disorders}} will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures {{as part of}} their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient’s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or outcome measures include {{but are not limited to}} the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go [...] The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, <b>fall</b> <b>prevention</b> and sensory function.

40|$|Strength {{and balance}} {{training}} is widely accepted {{as an important}} part of a multi-factorial <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme. Despite the growing body of research evidence to support the efficacy of exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies, however, their success in a clinical setting is often limited by poor adherence in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> and presents a number of psychological models (Theory of Planned Behaviour, Protection Motivation Theory and Social Cognitive Theory) which have been proposed as suitable frameworks to explain exercise behaviour in older adults. The authors review the research literature regarding adherence with exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programmes and discuss the implications for clinical practice. They conclude by suggesting that successful participation with <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies must be viewed as a form of long term behaviour change by patients and practitioners.

40|$|Objective This study evaluates {{whether a}} {{community}} of practice (CoP) could conduct a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> clinical audit and identify gaps in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> practice requiring action. Methods Cross-sectional <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> clinical audits were conducted in 13 residential aged care (RAC) sites of a not-for-profit organisation providing care {{to a total of}} 779 residents. The audits were led by an operationalised CoP assisted by site clinical staff. A CoP is a group of people with a shared interest who get together to innovate for change. The CoP was made up of self-nominated staff representing all RAC sites and comprised of staff from various disciplines with a shared interest in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> Results All 13 (100 %) sites completed the audit. CoP conduct of the audit met identified criteria for an effective clinical audit. The priorities for improvement were identified as increasing the proportion of residents receiving vitamin D supplementation (mean 41. 5 %, s. d. 23. 7) and development of mandatory <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education for staff and a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> policy, as neither was in place at any site. CoP actions undertaken included a letter to visiting GPs requesting support for vitamin D prescription, surveys of care staff and residents to inform falls education development, defining falls and writing a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> policy.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} how staff responded to individualised patient <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education delivered as part of a cluster randomised trial, including how they perceived the education contributed to <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> on their wards. Design: A qualitative explanatory study. Methods: 5 focus groups were conducted at participatory hospital sites. The purposive sample of clinical staff (including nurses, physiotherapists and quality improvement staff) worked on aged care rehabilitation wards when a cluster randomised trial evaluating a patient education programme was conducted. During the intervention period, an educator, who was a trained health professional and not a member of staff, provided individualised <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education to patients with good levels of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination > 23 / 30). Clinical staff were provided with training to support the programme and their feedback was sought after the trial concluded, to understand how they perceived the programme impacted on <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> Data were thematically analysed using NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Results: 5 focus groups were conducted at different hospitals (n= 30 participants). Staff perceived that the education created a positive culture around <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> and further, facilitated teamwork, whereby patients and staff worked together to address <b>falls</b> <b>prevention.</b> The educator was perceived to be a valuable member of the team. Staff reported that they developed increased knowledge and awareness about creating a safe ward environment. Patients being proactive and empowered to engage in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies, such as ringing the bell for assistance, was viewed as supporting staff <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> efforts and motivating staff to change practice. Conclusions: Staff responded positively to patient <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> education being delivered on their wards. Providing individualised patient education to older patients with good levels of cognition can empower staff and patients to work as a team to address <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> on hospital rehabilitation wards...|$|R

40|$|Falls in {{hospital}} remain a significant safety concern among older patients. They {{are the most}} commonly reported adverse event {{in hospital}}s, {{and can lead to}} serious injury, morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. In 2008, over 12, 000 falls were reported in Queensland Health facilities. The Best Practice Guidelines for <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> in Australian hospitals were introduced in 2005 [3]; however, falls continue to be a daily challenge for frontline staff. Staff are a key component in preventing falls, yet little is known about their safety attitudes, knowledge and compliance with <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies. A pilot 12 -month education and awareness program was conducted to improve the attitudes, engagement, uptake and adherence with best practice strategies for <b>falls</b> <b>prevention,</b> using locally based Falls Specialist Officers to provide ongoing education and support. Project objectives: �To increase awareness of <b>falls</b> and <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> in the participating facilities �To build the capacity of frontline staff in delivering best practice <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies To improve the safety culture around <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> �To increase the organisational involvement in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> activities Methods – how we did it: Participants and setting: All frontline staff working in 11 wards at 3 south-east Queensland metropolitan hospitals – 6 acute and 5 sub-acute wards, ranging in size from 10 to 33 beds.

40|$|People {{living with}} {{dementia}} experience falls at a disproportionate rate than age-matched adults due to several factors: gait dysfunction, balance disorders, and modifiable external hazards. Currently, <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions conducted {{in this population}} have had inconclusive results because <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions tailored for cognitively normal adults do not translate to those living with dementia, thus leaving a gap in knowledge in this field of research. Caregivers of people living with dementia may provide a unique aspect to <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions {{as they are in}} a position to act as co-therapists throughout the course of an intervention. By utilizing caregivers as co-therapists in a dyadic intervention, interventionists are able to rely on them to aid the person living with dementia in the execution of the intervention and to confirm that the person living with dementia is following protocol, which has been shown to be vital in program success in past interventions. In addition to exploring the relationship between caregiver involvement and outcomes of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions in the dementia population, this literature synthesis will also evaluate the effectiveness of a <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> program among people with dementia according to whether people live alone or with family as a proxy for caregiver involvement in <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> that has been conducted in Pennsylvania recently.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain an {{understanding}} of older people's perceptions of <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> advice, and how best to design communications that will encourage older people to take action to prevent falls. Focus groups and interviews were carried out with 66 people aged 61 - 94 years recruited from a variety of settings, using <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> messages to stimulate discussion. Thematic analysis revealed that participants interpreted ‘falls prevention’ principally as meaning hazard reduction, use of aids and restriction of activity. Only one participant was aware that falls risk could be reduced by carrying out exercises to improve strength and balance. <b>Falls</b> <b>prevention</b> advice was typically regarded as useful in principle but not personally relevant or appropriate. Advice about falling was often depicted as common sense, only necessary for older or more disabled individuals, and potentially patronizing and distressing. Our findings suggest that older people do not reject <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> advice because of ignorance of their risk of falling, but because they see it as a potential threat to their identity and autonomy.

The study was part of a prospective cohort study, nested within a larger, randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 333) were asked to suggest strategies to reduce their falls risk at home after discharge, and their responses were compared with current reported research evidence for <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> interventions.  Results:Participants’ strategies (n = 629) were classified into 7 categories: behavioral, support while mobilizing, approach to movement, physical environment, visual, medical, and activities or exercise. Although exercise has been identified as an effective falls risk reduction strategy, only 2. 9 % of participants suggested engaging in exercises. <b>Falls</b> <b>prevention</b> was most often conceptualized by participants as requiring 1 (35. 4 %) or 2 (40. 8 %) strategies for avoiding an accidental event, rather than engaging in sustained multiple risk reduction behaviors.  Implications:Results demonstrate that older patients have low levels of knowledge about appropriate <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> strategies that could be used after discharge in spite of their increased falls risk during this period.

Method: Focus groups were conducted with older people attending a regional falls and syncope service (3 groups, total 12 participants) and local physiotherapists (4 groups, total 18 participants). Framework analysis was undertaken to identify why uptake and adherence with an exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme is currently poor and to provide suggestions for how it might be improved. Results: The older people participated in an exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme to remain independent in activities of daily living. They valued approaches that promoted self-efficacy and self-management. In contrast, the physiotherapists perceived that many older people were reluctant to participate in an exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme. While it was acknowledged that older people should be encouraged to take greater responsibility for the maintenance of their own health, the physiotherapists demonstrated a conflicting desire to remain in control of the treatment programme. Conclusions: A focus on self-management support may provide the key to promoting uptake and adherence with an exercise-based <b>falls</b> <b>prevention</b> programme. Physiotherapists should move from being “experts” to “enablers” who use their professional knowledge and expertise to support older people at risk of falling to maintain optimum levels of health and independence...|$|R
