40|$|We here {{respond to}} Dark's [Dark, P., 2003. <b>Dogs,</b> a <b>crane</b> (not duck) and diet at Star Carr: a {{response}} to Schulting and Richards. Journal of Archaeological Science 30, 1353 - 1356] criticisms of our previous paper [Schulting, R. J., Richards, M. P., 2002. Dogs, ducks, deer and diet: a reappraisal of the stable isotope evidence on early domestic dogs from the Vale of Pickering, north-east England. Journal of Archaeological Science, 29, 327 - 333] in which we supported the previous interpretation of stable isotope data from the Seamer Carr dog [Clutton-Brock, J., Noe-Nygaard, N., 1990. New osteological and C-isotope evidence on Mesolithic dogs: companions to hunters and fishers at Star Carr, Seamer Carr and Kongemose. Journal of Archaeological Science, 17, 643 - 653] as indicating a marine-influenced diet. Additional isotopic data are presented on fauna from Star Carr, most importantly from two piscivorous diving birds. These new data further support the original contention that marine protein {{is the most likely}} source of the elevated carbon and nitrogen isotope values seen in the Seamer Carr dog. In addition, cutmarks on the humerus of a Brent goose, and the presence of an additional element (right femur) attributable to the previously known adult dog from Star Carr, are noted for the first time. Two new AMS determinations are presented for Star Carr, placing an adult dog in the period 9680 ± 55 BP (9270 - 8840 cal BC) and a subadult dog somewhat later at 9342 ± 41 BP (8735 - 8474 cal BC). Unlike Seamer Carr, both dogs show entirely terrestrial (non-marine) diets.

During the trial, Bart quips [...] "the system works. Just ask Claus von Bulow". This is {{a reference to the}} British socialite who was accused of attempted murder, but was acquitted after two trials. Of the twelve jury members, Homer is the only one to vote [...] "innocent", angering the other eleven jurors; the trial ends with Freddy being found innocent. This is a reference to the film 12 Angry Men. During the trial, Homer sings the jingle of the cat food company Meow Mix in his head. Jasper, a member of the jury, wants the trial to be over so that he can go home and watch television. He says that tonight on the science fiction series seaQuest DSV, Eddie, pet <b>dog</b> of Martin <b>Crane</b> on Frasier, will ride Darwin, the talking dolphin character from seaQuest DSV. Both series aired on NBC, which was the highest-rated network in the United States for most of the 1990s. The new [...] "director's cut" [...] of the 1993 film Free Willy that Homer watches at the deadlock hotel features Jesse being crushed by the whale Willy. Homer is later saddened by this, and says, [...] "Oh, I don't like this new director's cut!" [...] Homer stays with Skinner at the hotel, and in a reference to the television series The Odd Couple, Skinner picks up a cigar butt from the floor with his umbrella while cleaning the room, just as Tony Randall does in the opening credits of that series.|$|R
