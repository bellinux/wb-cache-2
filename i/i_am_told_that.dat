5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|Maine Representative Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's {{choice for}} Secretary of the Treasury; he {{declined}} it, preferring {{to remain as}} chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat. The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, [...] "I want peace and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody." [...] Nevertheless, he made the appointment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> {{the more}} you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> failed, because <b>I</b> had {{not done}} any work. When I said that I had brought my work in for {{assessment}} {{and that there were}} paintings in my space, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they didn't count as work, because they didn't show development of ideas. I said that my idea was to paint spontaneously and express what <b>I</b> felt. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> not an acceptable idea in 'contemporary practice'.|$|R
