40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the indicators and variables that form quality of tax services, regional tax regulations, taxpayer satisfaction level, taxpayer behavior, as well their compliance in theory using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach.

The results of this research provided that measurement model using CFA approach is the best model, based on goodness of fit criteria <b>for</b> <b>taxpayer</b> obedience and the indicators on tax service quality, regional tax regulations, taxpayer satisfaction level, taxpayer behavior and tax payer compliance are valid in convergence and discriminant also reliable. The strongest indicator for tax service quality is responsiveness, while the strongest indicator for regional tax regulations is explication of the regulations.

The $300 million site-neutral plan would have featured a $150 million contribution from the Pohlads, $50 million from private enterprises, and the remaining $100 million {{in the form of}} an interest-free loan from the state of Minnesota. Many viewed the deal as significantly better <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers</b> than the 1997 plan. But the details of the financial arrangements once again were very complicated.

25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too much money to qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers</b> than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{income tax}} is often {{collected}} on a pay-as-you-earn basis, with small corrections made {{soon after the}} end of the tax year. These corrections take one of two forms: payments to the government, <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers</b> who have not paid enough during the tax year; and tax refunds from the government for those who have overpaid. Income tax systems will often have deductions available that lessen the total tax liability by reducing total taxable income. They may allow losses from one type of income to be counted against another. For example, a loss on the stock market may be deducted against taxes paid on wages. Other tax systems may isolate the loss, such that business losses can only be deducted against business tax by carrying forward the loss to later tax years.|$|E

25|$|Under a Roth IRA, first {{enacted in}} 1998, individuals, whether {{employees}} or self-employed, voluntarily contribute post-tax funds {{to an individual}} retirement arrangement (IRA). In contrast to the 401(k) plan, the Roth plan requires post-tax contributions, but allows for tax free growth and distribution, provided the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years and the account owner has reached age 59½. Roth IRA contribution limits are significantly lower than 401(k) contribution limits. For tax-years 2016 and 2017, individuals may contribute no more than $5,500 per year to a Roth IRA if under age 50, and $6,500 if age 50 or older. Additionally, Roth IRA contribution limits are reduced <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers</b> with a Modified Adjusted Gross Income (modified AGI) greater than $117,000 ($184,000 for married filing jointly), phasing out entirely for individuals with a modified AGI of $132,000 ($194,000 for married filing jointly), for 2016.

500|$|On 6 June 2012, the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{legislative}} {{proposal for a}} harmonised bank recovery and resolution mechanism.

The new legislation would give member states the power to impose losses, resulting from a bank failure, on the bondholders to minimise costs <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers.</b> The proposal is part of a new scheme in which banks will be compelled to [...] "bail-in" [...] their creditors whenever they fail, the basic aim being to prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts in the future. The public authorities would also be given powers to replace the management teams in banks even before the lender fails. Each institution would also be obliged to set aside at least one per cent of the deposits covered by their national guarantees for a special fund to finance the resolution of banking crisis starting in 2018.|$|E

She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England.

She had tea with the wife of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She would later admit to experiencing a [...] "moment of fear going into a battle zone", because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, [...] "Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire."

500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year <b>for</b> <b>taxpayers</b> to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 million of his own money in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E
