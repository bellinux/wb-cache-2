5|$|While {{predictions}} of the future can never be absolutely certain, present understanding in various fields allows for the prediction of far-future events, if only in the broadest outline. These fields include astrophysics, which <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 20%. Its surface {{composition}} {{is thought to}} be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 2550%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, on Callisto with the Hubble Space Telescope|year=1996|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI| url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc97/pdf/1852.PDF|page=1852|format=PDF}} and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock–ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.|$|E

5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> {{the presence}} of a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, who described the specimens, considered it to be a less derived species.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
5|$|Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, {{including}} mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, {{and other}} non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow {{parts of the}} RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} note is that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> {{that the very}} same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
