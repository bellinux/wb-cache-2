2500|$|Rosewood (of {{the family}} Leguminosae) {{generally}} has a deep, lustrous red coloration, whereas <b>ebony</b> (of the <b>family</b> Ebenaceae) has a dark, heavy fine wood grain. Malagasy rosewoods include Dalbergia baronii, D. louvelii, and the [...] "palissandre wood" [...] D. madagascariensis (which lacks the distinctive red coloration). These rare, endemic species are mainly {{found in the}} SAVA Region and the Makira-Masoala Landscape of Madagascar. Although rosewood species from other countries have traditionally been used for high-class musical instruments and furniture, these sources have been depleted, leaving Madagascar {{as one of the}} leading sources. Ebony, on the other hand, belongs to the large mostly tropical genus Diospyros. The rare, endemic ebony species of Madagascar grow primarily in the northwestern part of Madagascar, but some also grow in Marojejy and Masoala national parks. Both species are slow growing, and take as much as 300 years or more to reach maturity.|$|R
2500|$|The nut is {{a raised}} piece of wood, fitted where the {{fingerboard}} meets the pegbox, {{in which the}} strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered tuning pegs, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called [...] "friction pegs", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all {{other members of the}} violin <b>family.</b> <b>Ebony</b> is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as boxwood or rosewood, can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or [...] "ebonized" [...] to look like ebony, which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.|$|R

50|$|JUTAUN {{got their}} start by {{performing}} at talent shows and shopping malls in the Philadelphia and South Jersey area.

Their earliest promotional appearances include the <b>Ebony</b> <b>Family</b> Reunion concerts, Crest Latin Shows, and the Pantene Total You Tour 2006.|$|E
