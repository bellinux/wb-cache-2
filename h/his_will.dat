5|$|Although it is {{believed}} that relations between Umar and Khalid, cousins, were always something short of cordial, both of them apparently harboured no ill-will towards each other.

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> Sylvester had {{declared}} that royalties {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as the beneficiaries of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended <b>his</b> <b>will</b> in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in <b>his</b> <b>will.</b> A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E
5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main {{beneficiary}} of <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. <b>His</b> <b>will</b> {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace {{dates from}} work carried out while Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268, and never returned.

In <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> he left {{legacies}} to all the houses of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. <b>His</b> <b>will</b> had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps.

5|$|The {{inclusion}} of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit {{in a more}} moderate manner than Moreno. Those fights affected his health, {{and he had a}} mild heart attack on 28 January 1811. Fearing for his life, he wrote <b>his</b> <b>will</b> and received the Anointing of the Sick. Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes, and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house. He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicolás de Bari, as requested in <b>his</b> <b>will.</b> The death certificate states that he hadn't been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time. Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die.|$|E
5|$|A {{man named}} Gianni Schicchi is only briefly {{referred}} to in Dante's Inferno Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another.

5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

After a wedding breakfast with his new wife, Hitler dictated <b>his</b> <b>will</b> to his secretary Traudl Junge.

Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini, which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture.|$|E
5|$|After their father's {{death in}} 1906, Hogg and her {{brothers}} {{tried to sell}} the Varner plantation, but a provision in <b>his</b> <b>will</b> specified that the land be kept for 15years. On January 15, 1918, oil {{was found on the}} Varner plantation. A second strike the following year provided oil income amounting to $225,000 a month shared among the four siblings. According to Hogg biographer Gwendolyn Cone Neely, the Hoggs did not believe that the oil money was rightfully theirs, as it had come from the land and not hard work, and they were determined to use it for the good of Texas.|$|E

5|$|Alberti {{requested}} in <b>his</b> <b>will</b> {{to avoid}} pageantry or complex funerals, and inherited his properties (house, farm, furniture, slaves, clothing, books, etc.) to his siblings Juana María, Matilde, Casimira and Manuel Silvestre. His personal diaries are kept, {{but with some}} parts of them being lost due to poor keeping. Still, his personal bibliography is used by historians to reconstruct his influences and ideological background. It included many works of theology, studies of the Bible, scholastic theologists and juridical studies. Alberti's remains were lost when the chapel was demolished {{to make way for}} an expansion of 9 de Julio Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and <b>his</b> <b>will,</b> according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of <b>his</b> <b>will</b> indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable to him when he took the throne.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew.
