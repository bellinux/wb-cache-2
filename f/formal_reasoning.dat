Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

500|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} {{is based on}} the assumption that the process of human thought can be mechanized. The study of mechanical—or [...] "formal"—reasoning has a long history. Chinese, Indian and Greek philosophers all developed structured methods of formal deduction in the first millennium BCE. Their ideas were developed over the centuries by philosophers such as [...] Aristotle (who gave a formal analysis of the syllogism), [...] Euclid (whose Elements was a model of <b>formal</b> <b>reasoning),</b> al-Khwārizmī (who developed algebra and gave his name to [...] "algorithm") and European scholastic philosophers such as William of Ockham and Duns Scotus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} {{mechanical}} or [...] "formal" [...] reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic {{led directly to}} [...] Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of <b>formal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> {{is known as the}} Church–Turing thesis. Along with concurrent discoveries in neurology, information theory and cybernetics, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete [...] "artificial neurons".|$|E
60|$|In Geometry, as {{in other}} parts of mathematics, Peano and his disciples have done work of the very {{greatest}} merit as regards principles. Formerly, it was held by philosophers and mathematicians alike that the proofs in Geometry depended on the figure; nowadays, this is known to be false. In the best books there are no figures at all. The reasoning proceeds by the strict rules of formal logic from a set of axioms laid down to begin with. If a figure is used, all sorts of things seem obviously to follow, which no <b>formal</b> <b>reasoning</b> can prove from the explicit axioms, and which, as a matter of fact, are only accepted because they are obvious. By banishing the figure, it becomes possible to discover all the axioms that are needed; and in this way all sorts of possibilities, which would have otherwise remained undetected, are brought to light.|$|E

40|$|Current {{conceptions of}} expert problem solving depict physical/conceptual <b>reasoning</b> and <b>formal</b> {{mathematical}} <b>reasoning</b> as separate steps: a good problem solver first translates a physical Current conceptions of quantitative problem-solving expertise in physics incorporate conceptual reasoning in two ways: for selecting relevant equations (before manipulating them), and for checking whether a given quantitative solution is reasonable (after manipulating the equations). We {{make the case}} that problem-solving expertise should include opportunistically blending conceptual and <b>formal</b> mathematical <b>reasoning</b> even while manipulating equations. We present analysis of interviews with two students, Alex and Pat. Interviewed students were asked to explain a particular equation and solve a problem using that equation. Alex used and described the equation as a computational tool. By contrast, Pat found a shortcut to solve the problem. His shortcut blended mathematical operations with conceptual reasoning about physical processes, reflecting a view - expressed earlier in his explanation of the equation - that equations can express an overarching conceptual meaning. Using case studies of Alex and Pat, we argue that this opportunistic blending of conceptual and <b>formal</b> mathematical <b>reasoning</b> (i) is a part of problem-solving expertise, (ii) can be described in terms of cognitive elements called symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001), and (iii) is a feasible instructional target.

60|$|The great {{master of}} the art of <b>formal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> among the men of our own day, is an Italian, Professor Peano, of the University of Turin.[12] He has reduced the greater part of {{mathematics}} (and he or his followers will, in time, have reduced the whole) to strict symbolic form, in which there are no words at all. In the ordinary mathematical books, there are no doubt fewer words than most readers would wish. Still, little phrases occur, such as therefore, let us assume, consider, or hence it follows. All these, however, are a concession, and are swept away by Professor Peano. For instance, if we wish to learn the whole of Arithmetic, Algebra, the Calculus, and indeed all that is usually called pure mathematics (except Geometry), we must start with a dictionary of three words. One symbol stands for zero, another for number, and a third for next after. What these ideas mean, it is necessary to know if you wish to become an arithmetician. But after symbols have been invented for these three ideas, not another word is required in the whole development. All future symbols are symbolically explained by means of these three. Even these three can be explained by means of the notions of relation and class; but this requires the Logic of Relations, which Professor Peano has never taken up. It must be admitted that what a mathematician has to know to begin with is not much. There are at most a dozen notions out of which all the notions in all pure mathematics (including Geometry) are compounded. Professor Peano, who is assisted by a very able school of young Italian disciples, has shown how this may be done; and although the method which he has invented is capable of being carried a good deal further than he has carried it, the honour of the pioneer must belong to him.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{one will}} judge for himself of this romantic episode in Mill's career, {{according}} to such experience as he may possess of the philosophic mind {{and of the}} value of these curious but not infrequent relationships. It may have been a piece of infatuation, or, if we prefer to say so, {{it may have been the}} most gracious and the most human page in Mill's career. Mrs. Mill may have flattered her husband's vanity by echoing his opinions, or she may have indeed been an Egeria, full of inspiration and intellectual helpfulness. What usually happens in these cases,--although the philosopher himself, through his belief in the equality of the sexes, was debarred from thinking so,--is the extremely valuable action and reaction of two different classes and orders of mind. To any one whose thoughts have been occupied with the sphere of abstract speculation, the lively and vivid presentment of concrete fact comes as a delightful and agreeable shock. The instinct of the woman often enables her not only to apprehend but to illustrate a truth for which she would be totally unable to give the adequate philosophic reasoning. On the other hand, the man, with the more careful logical methods and the slow processes of <b>formal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> is apt to suppose that the happy intuition which leaps to the conclusion is really based on the intellectual processes of which he is conscious in his own case. Thus both parties to the happy contract are equally pleased. The abstract truth gets the concrete illustration; the concrete illustration finds its proper foundation in a series of abstract inquiries. Perhaps Carlyle's epithets of [...] "iridescent" [...] and [...] "vivid" [...] refer incidentally to Mrs. Mill's quick perceptiveness, and thus throw a useful light on the mutual advantages of the common work of husband and wife. But it savours almost of impertinence even to attempt to lift the veil on a mystery like this. It is enough to say, perhaps, that however much we may deplore the exaggeration of Mill's references to his wife, we recognise that, for whatever reason, the pair lived an ideally happy life.|$|E
