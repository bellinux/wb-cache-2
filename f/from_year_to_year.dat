Precipitation is highly variable <b>from</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>year</b> and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. In wet years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity <b>from</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>year,</b> but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E

In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
