40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Ergonomics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] regulations for field of view requirements in road vehicles are defined by 2 D areas projected on the ground plane. This paper discusses {{the development of a new}} software-based volumetric field of view projection tool and its implementation within an existing digital human modelling system. In addition, the exploitation of this new tool is highlighted through its use in a UK Department for Transport funded research project exploring the current concerns with driver vision. Focusing specifically on rearwards visibility in small and medium passenger vehicles, the volumetric approach is shown to provide a number of distinct advantages. The ability to explore multiple projections of both <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> (through <b>windows)</b> and indirect <b>vision</b> (through mirrors) provides a greater understanding of the field of view environment afforded to the driver whilst still maintaining compatibility with the 2 D projections of the regulatory standards. Practitioner Summary: Field of view requirements for drivers of road vehicles are defined by simplified 2 D areas projected onto the ground plane. However, driver vision is a complex 3 D problem. This paper presents the development of a new software-based 3 D volumetric projection technique and its implementation in the evaluation of driver vision in small- and medium-sized passenger vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This is a report. The {{research}} {{described in}} this report has been performed by Loughborough Design School (LDS) under the CLOCS programme funded by TfL. The project was specified to allow {{an understanding of the}} variability of blind spots in <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> through <b>windows</b> and indirect <b>vision</b> through mirrors for the top selling HGVs in the UK. The impetus for the research was the increasing number of accidents between Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) and HGVs in London. The aim was to compare the manufacturers’ most sold vehicle specifications to determine which vehicle design variables can affect the size of blind spots, and to explore issues that have been raised in previous research including the potential for construction HGVs to be involved in more accidents with VRUs than distribution variants of HGV designs. The LDS team have utilised a virtual modelling technique to explore this issue. This virtual approach allows multiple accident scenarios to be modelled and simulated. In order to allow the analysis of vehicle blind spots 19 vehicle models have been created by digitally scanning the real world vehicles. The vehicles that have been modelled include construction, distribution and long haul HGV designs, as well as ‘high vision’ low entry cab designs. These models have been used in combination with simulations of cyclist and pedestrian VRUs in a manner which recreates critical accident scenarios that have been defined through the analysis of accident data. This involves placing the simulated VRUs in a number of defined locations adjacent to the vehicle. Subsequently the simulated VRUs are moved away from the vehicle into a position where they ‘just can’t be seen’ by the driver of the vehicle, i. e. if they were moved further away they would be partially visible to the driver. The distance that the VRU simulation is away from the side or front of the vehicle cab determines the size of the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spot. In this way vehicle designs and configurations can be compared. In addition to this further testing was performed to determine if the VRUs located in the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spots could be viewed by the driver through the use of mirrors. The final analysis technique utilised a method which projects the volume of space that can be seen by a driver through the windows and mirrors on the surface of sphere. This provides a field of view value which can be used to compare the glazed area of HGVs and provides a method to distinguish between vehicles that perform at the same level in the VRU simulation. The results of the work highlight the follow key issues. 1. All standard vehicle configurations have blind spots which can hide VRUs from the driver’s <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> 2. The height of the cab above the ground is the key vehicle factor which affects the size of <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> and indirect vision blind spots 3. The design of window apertures and the driver location in relation to these window apertures can reduce the size of the identified blind spots. i. e. two different vehicle designs with the same cab height can have different results for blind spot size due to window design and driver seat location 4. Low entry cab designs, which are the lowest of the 19 vehicles tested, demonstrated real benefits in terms of reducing <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spots when compared to standard vehicle designs 5.

Methodology The root ends of 52 root filled canine teeth were filled with MTA or Sealer 26 under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> or optical microscope (n = 13). In each group, eight specimens were analysed by profilometry for measurement of the area and depth of gaps. In the other five specimens, gap area was measured using SEM to verify marginal adaptation and surface characteristic. Data were analysed by parametric (anova and Tukey) and non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn) tests. Results The assessment of the adaptation of both materials to dentine was not influenced by the mode of visualization, which was confirmed by both profilometry and SEM observations. The voids measured with profilometry for Sealer 26 under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> were significantly wider and deeper than those for MTA under <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> (P < 0. 05). In SEM, significantly larger gap areas were observed with Sealer 26 (P < 0. 05). Conclusion Root-end cavities filled with MTA had smaller gaps and better marginal adaptation than Sealer 26...|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} summarises a {{study by}} a research team from the Design School at Loughborough University for Transport for London (TfL) and Transport & Environment (T&E) on how lorry <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> could be improved. Previous {{research has shown that}} existing Category N 3 vehicle designs exhibit considerable <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> blind spots in front of and to the near (passenger) side of the vehicle. This research explores the potential to reduce these blind spots through changes to vehicle geometry made possible by the proposed increase to vehicle length. Using a concept vehicle designed in a project performed by FKA this research evaluates the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> afforded to the driver against a baseline DAF XF 105 and a range of iterations of the FKA concept to explore improvements to vision. The analyses are performed using a 3 D projection technique in the SAMMIE digital human modelling system. This allows the vehicle concepts to be populated with representative drivers and visual targets including vulnerable road users in the form of pedestrians and cyclists and a typical Category M 1 vehicle (a passenger car). The analysis has shown that these blind spots can be improved for the specific tests that have been performed in this research by the FKA concept and the iterations of the concept that have been produced by the LDS team. When compared to the baseline vehicle the original FKA concept improves <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> to vulnerable road users located at the centre of the vehicle front as the extended front effectively pushes the visual targets further away {{from the front of the}} vehicle allowing them to be seen. The visibility to the two front corners of the FKA concept and the lateral visibility through the driver and passenger doors remain problematic. The first iteration of the FKA concept reduces obscuration through the design of a compact instrument panel similar to those used in bus and coach designs. This iteration also improves <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> to the near side and front nearside corner of the vehicle through the use of additional glazed areas. The visibility of the offside front corner is still problematic. The second iteration of the FKA concept is a modified version of the first iteration with a reduction in the cab height of the vehicle by 230 mm. This results in the most successful concept analysed, with good <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> of all of the visual targets that have been defined in the research project. This reduction in height is possible with current vehicles but would result in a vehicle with reduced off road capabilities due to a reduction in ground clearance. The third iteration of the FKA concept explored the potential of a central driving position. This provides advantages to <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> through improved lateral visibility at the original height of the concept vehicle. However, this iteration also introduces new <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> issues. The project has shown that the potential to extend the front of category N 3 vehicles to include aerodynamic features has some benefit in terms of improved <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> for the design that has been analysed, but that more radical design solutions, such as lowering the vehicle cab, and adding glazed areas to the doors and below the windscreen bottom edge provide more effective solutions to the <b>direct</b> <b>vision</b> problem...|$|R
