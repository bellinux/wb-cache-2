40|$|Significant {{knowledge}} has been acquired by ORSTOM <b>documentalists</b> {{in the field}} of documentation engineering. This expertise has particularly increased with the development of the online HORIZON database, to which an ORSTOM server gives online access. A transfer of documentation engineering know-how has taken place in partnership with developing countries. At the ORSTOM centre located in Lome, Togo, an online bibliographic database server has been implemented on a workstation that can be accessed through the TOGOPAC network. Available databases are POPTOGO, developed by <b>documentalists</b> at the Demographic Research Unit at the University of Benin, and HORITOGO, developed by <b>documentalists</b> at the ORSTOM centre in Lome. Resources used show that low-cost documentation engineering partnerships are possible and that online access and data acquisition from producing countries is a reality in Africa.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is part of}} {{a global}} project to develop a {{recommender}} system of economic news articles. Its objectives are threefold: (i) automatically multi-classify the economic new articles, (ii) recommend the articles by comparing the profiles of the users and the multi-classification of the articles, and (iii) managing the vocabulary of the economic news domain to improve the system based on the seamlessly intervention of the <b>documentalists.</b> In this paper we focus on the automatic multi-classification of the articles and the respective description and justification to the <b>documentalists.</b> While several multi-classification solutions exist they are not automatically adaptable to the problem in hands as their description of the resulting multi-classification lacks substantial correlation with the <b>documentalists</b> perspective. In fact, we need to consider not only the automatic classification but also the supervision of the classification and its evolution based on the <b>documentalists</b> supervision of the automatic classification. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a mechanism that bridges the gap between the automatic classification mechanisms and the <b>documentalists</b> thesaurus, in order to support their seamless supervision of classification and of thesaurus management. Ontologies are central to our proposal, as they are used to represent and manage the thesaurus, to describe the content of the articles, and finally to automatically multi-classify them via inference process. Also, we adopt a machine learning approach for generating a prediction model for supporting the automatic classification. This paper presents a proposal for enriching the documentalist-oriented ontology with the model prediction rules, which provides the necessary capabilities to the DL reasoner for automatic multi-classification...|$|R
