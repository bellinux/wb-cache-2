5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome</b> were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome</b> indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
25|$|Occurrence in {{patients}} identified to be suffering symptoms of <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is not higher than occurrence {{in the normal}} population. However, due to the similarity in symptoms, patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In some cases, fructose malabsorption {{may be caused by}} several diseases which cause an intestinal damage, such as celiac disease.|$|E
40|$|For chronic {{musculoskeletal}} pain syndromes (CPS) {{is typical}} longterm persistent pain without an identifiable morphological cause. These CPS affect mostly older children and females. We recognise two {{different forms of}} CPS, diffuse, represented by fibromyalgia and, localised, which is represented by complex regional pain syndrome type 1. This work is primarily focused on juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS), which is characterised by widespread pain and numerous painful tender points upon palpation. Very often other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, headaches, <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndromes</b> and anxiety are presented. To succesful treat JPFS the multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This work describes posibilities of physiotherapy in JPFS {{as a key to}} succes of interdisciplinary teamwork.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) is an ubiquitary monoamine {{acting as}} one of the neurotransmitters at synapses of nerve cells. Serotonin acts through several {{receptor}} types and subtypes. The profusion of 5 -HT receptors should eventually allow {{a better understanding of the}} different and complex processes in which serotonin is involved. Its role is expected in the etiology of several diseases, including depression, schizophrenia, anxiety and panic disorders, migraine, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, eating disorders, vomiting and <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndromes.</b> In the past 20 years, seven distinct families of 5 -HT receptors have been identified and various subpopulations have been described for several of them. Increasing number of 5 -HT receptors has made it difficult to unravel the role of 5 -HT receptor subpopulations due to the lack of suitable selective agents. The present review describes the different populations and nomenclature of recently discovered 5 -HT receptors and their pharmacological relevance. Key word...|$|R

30|$|Analysis {{showed a}} {{statistically}} significant improvement in <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> symptoms and evacuation difficulty (Table  1). <b>Irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> symptoms was {{the second most common}} symptom reported preoperatively (n[*]=[*] 30; 96.77 %); 15 of the 30 patients with preoperative symptoms reported an improvement (p[*]=[*] 0.047) and in 14 patients, the symptom worsened after the surgery. Two (6.45 %) patients reported <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> symptoms to be unaffected by the slingplasty. Twenty of the 29 patients with preoperative symptoms reported significant improvement (p[*]=[*] 0.014).

25|$|No {{specific}} laboratory or imaging {{test can}} be performed to diagnose <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Diagnosis involves excluding conditions that produce IBS-like symptoms, and then following a procedure to categorize the patient's symptoms. Ruling out parasitic infections, lactose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and celiac disease is recommended for all patients before a diagnosis of <b>irritable</b> <b>bowel</b> <b>syndrome</b> is made. In patients over 50 years old, they are recommended to undergo a screening colonoscopy.
