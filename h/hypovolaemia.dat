However, the causative factors related to the development of typical MRI changes in CSF <b>hypovolaemia,</b> particu-larly DPMGE, are still unclear.

Similarly, <b>hypovolaemia</b> induced one month after two major blood vessels had been occluded led to ischaemic colitis. These findings suggest that states of low blood flow in the presence of previous arterial constriction or blockage may lead to enough reduction in mesenteric perfusion for intestinal ischaemia to develop. Using an electromagnetic flowmeter placed in the cranial mesenteric artery of the dog, it was shown that <b>hypovolaemia</b> may lead to 50 - 75 % reduction in mesenteric blood flow without producing any significant change in the systemic blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and {{systemic}} vascular resistance by the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex was studied in six conscious rabbits during states of acute hypervolaemia and acute <b>hypovolaemia.</b> These states were produced by infusing blood equal to 20 % and 40 %, and withdrawing blood equal to 20 % and 35 %, {{of the initial}} blood volume. The properties of the reflex were characterized by creating sinusoidal pressure changes across {{the wall of the}} carotid sinus at a frequency of 0. 01 Hz and amplitudes of 54 and 83 mmHg. From the effects of the lower-amplitude stimulus the dynamic gain of the reflex was calculated for blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. The higher-amplitude stimulus was used to determine the near maximal responses of the circulatory variables to changes in carotid sinus transmural pressure. The gain for systemic vascular resistance was reduced by hypervolaemia, and increased by 20 % <b>hypovolaemia.</b> The gains for heart rate and blood pressure were not affected by hypervolaemia or by 20 % <b>hypovolaemia.</b> 35 % <b>hypovolaemia</b> reduced the gain for heart rate, but the resting value was close to the upper limit of the reflex response. It also reduced the gain for cardiac output and blood pressure, and the increase in gain for systemic vascular resistance that had been caused by 20 % <b>hypovolaemia</b> was not sustained...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The haemodynamic {{response}} to critical care intubation {{is influenced by}} the use of sedation and relaxant drugs and the activation of the vagal reflex. It has been hypothesized that different disease states may have a contrasting effect on the cardiovascular {{response to}} vagal stimulation. Our objective was to determine whether the blood pressure response to vagal stimulation was modified by endotoxaemia or <b>hypovolaemia.</b> Methods: New Zealand White rabbits were anaesthetised with urethane before tracheotomy. The exposed left Vagus nerve of randomised groups of control (n = 11), endotoxin (n = 11, 1 mg/kg), <b>hypovolaemia</b> 40 % (n = 8) and <b>hypovolaemia</b> 20 % (n = 8) rabbits were subjected to 10 Hz pulsed electrical stimulations of 25 s duration every 15 min. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded from a catheter in the right carotid artery connected to an iWorx monitor. Serum catecholamines were measured every 30 min using reverse-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography. The change in blood pressure after vagal stimulation was compared to controls for one hour after the first death in the experimental groups. Results: 29 % of the rabbits died in the <b>hypovolaemia</b> 40 % group and 27 % in the endotoxin group. One rabbit died in the <b>hypovolaemia</b> 40 % group before vagal stimulation and was excluded. Following electrical stimulation of the Vagus nerve there was a fall in blood pressure in control rabbits. Blood pressure was conserved in the hypovolaemic rabbits compared to controls (p, 0. 01). For the endotoxaemic rabbits, there was a non-significant trend for the mean blood pressure to decreas...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hypovolaemia</b> is {{the most}} common cause of circulatory failure in children. Treatment {{consists}} of volume suppletion with a crystalloid or colloid solution; which agent is the best in children is not clear. This evidence-based practice guideline formulates recommendations as to which fluid should be used for volume suppletion in critically-ill neonates and children up to the age of 18 years with <b>hypovolaemia.</b> Before the guideline development first-choice fluid for volume resuscitation was in 50 % a colloid and in 50 % a crystalloid solution for both neonatologists and paediatric intensivists. The neonatologists used human albumin as a priority, and the paeditric intensivists predominantly used a synthetic colloid. The guideline was developed on the basis of a comprehensive search and analysis of the literature according to the principles of evidence-based guideline development. The recommendations were formulated by a committee based on evidence from the literature and, when evidence from the literature was insufficient, on consensus after discussion in the committee. Since colloids are much more expensive than crystalloids and can give an anaphylactic reaction, their added value over crystalloids must be proven. In sick neonates and children, insufficient clinical trials have been done to reach the conclusion that colloids are more effective than crystalloids in <b>hypovolaemia.</b> A number of meta-analyses in adults revealed excess mortality in the group treated with albumin, but one recent, large, randomised study showed no difference in mortality. No added value could be demonstrated for the administration of synthetic colloids. On the basis of data from the literature and considerations regarding the applicability of evidence in adults to children and neonates, the side effects of resuscitation fluids, pathophysiology and costs, the first-choice fluid for neonates and children with <b>hypovolaemia</b> is isotonic saline. Albumin should not be used for the treatment of <b>hypovolaemia.</b> The volume to be administered and the infusion rate depend on the severity of the <b>hypovolaemia</b> and should be determined on an individual basi...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{functional}} haemodynamic variables pulse {{pressure variation}} (PPV), stroke volume variation (SVV), and systolic pressure variation (SPV) {{are widely used}} to assess haemodynamic status. However, {{it is not known}} how these perform during acute lung injury (ALI). This study evaluated the effects of different ventilatory strategies on haemodynamic parameters in pigs with ALI during normovolaemia and <b>hypovolaemia.</b> Methods. Eight anaesthetized Agroceres pigs [40 (1. 9) kg] were instrumented with pulmonary artery, PiCCO, and arterial catheters and ventilated. Three ventilatory settings were randomly assigned for 10 min each: tidal volume (VT) 15 ml kg(- 1) and PEEP 5 cm H(2) O, VT 8 ml kg(- 1) and PEEP 13 cm H(2) O, or VT 6 ml kg(- 1) and PEEP 13 cm H(2) O. Data were collected at each setting at baseline, after ALI (lung lavage+Tween 1. 5 %), and ALI with <b>hypovolaemia</b> (haemorrhage to 30 % of estimated blood volume). Results. At baseline, high VT increased PPV, SVV, and SPV (P < 0. 05 for all). During ALI, high VT significantly increased PPV and SVV [(P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 008) respectively. ]. After ALI with <b>hypovolaemia,</b> ventilation at VT 6 ml kg(- 1) and PEEP 13 cm H(2) O decreased the accuracy of functional haemodynamic variables to predict <b>hypovolaemia,</b> with the exception of PPV (area under the curve 0. 875). The parameters obtained by PiCCO were less influenced by ventilatory changes. Conclusions. VT is the ventilatory parameter which influences functional haemodynamics the most. During ventilation with low VT and high PEEP, most functional variables are less able to accurately predict <b>hypovolaemia</b> secondary to haemorrhage, with the exception of PPV.

40|$|Objective. Hypoglycaemia is {{regularly}} accompanied by <b>hypovolaemia.</b> To suggest {{a mechanism for}} this phenomenon, we reviewed data from eight studies conducted by our group and examined {{the circumstances under which}} rebound hypoglycaemia develops after intravenous infusion of glucose solutions. Material and methods. Forty healthy volunteers and 40 patients received a total of 122 infusions of glucose solutions at different rates, volumes and concentrations. Plasma glucose and the haemodilution were measured repeatedly during and for at least 2 h after the infusions ended. Glucose kinetics was calculated using a one-compartment turnover model and the plasma volume expansion was estimated from changes in Hb. Results. A strong linear correlation was found between the glucose level and the plasma volume expansion in all series of experiments (p< 0. 001). After infusion, there was a risk of hypoglycaemia and <b>hypovolaemia</b> developing in healthy volunteers with a high glucose clearance and when infusing glucose solutions of higher concentrations than 2. 5 %. Few and mild hypoglycaemic events occurred in patients with insulin resistance, such as in diabetics and in those undergoing surgery. The immediate linear relationship between hypoglycaemia and <b>hypovolaemia</b> suggests an osmotic link between the two parameters. More specifically, infused fluid accompanies glucose during uptake into the cells, while volume expansion by the same fluid has already elicited an effective diuretic response. Conclusion. <b>Hypovolaemia</b> is a consequence of hypoglycaemia after intravenous infusion of glucose solution and is caused by the osmotic translocation of fluid from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid space that occurs despite effective renal elimination...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether oropharyngeal stimulation {{by drinking}} released the dehydration-induced suppression of cutaneous vasodilatation and decreased {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) in exercising subjects, and assessed the effects of <b>hypovolaemia</b> or hyperosmolality alone on these responses. Seven young males underwent four hydration conditions. These were two normal plasma volume (PV) trials: normal plasma osmolality (Posmol, control trial) and hyperosmolality (ΔPosmol = + 11 mosmol (kg H 2 O) − 1); and two low PV trials: isosmolality (ΔPV = − 310 ml) and hyperosmolality (ΔPV = − 345 ml; ΔPosmol = + 9 mosmol (kg H 2 O) − 1), attained by combined treatment with furosemide (frusemide), hypertonic saline and/or 24 h water restriction. In each trial, the subjects exercised at 60 % peak aerobic power for ∼ 50 min at 30 °C atmospheric temperature and 50 % relative humidity. When oesophageal temperature (Toes) reached a plateau after ∼ 30 min of exercise, the subjects drank 200 ml water at 37. 5 °C within a minute. Before drinking, forearm vascular conductance (FVC), calculated as forearm blood flow divided by MAP, was lowered by 20 – 40 % in <b>hypovolaemia,</b> hyperosmolality, or both, compared with that in the control trial, despite increased Toes. After drinking, FVC increased by ∼ 20 % compared with that before drinking (P < 0. 05) in both hyperosmotic trials, but it was greater in normovolaemia than in <b>hypovolaemia</b> (P < 0. 05). However, no increases occurred in either isosmotic trial. MAP fell by 4 – 8 mmHg in both hyperosmotic trials (P < 0. 05) after drinking, but more rapidly in normovolaemia than in <b>hypovolaemia.</b> PV and Posmol did not change during this period. Thus, oropharyngeal stimulation by drinking released the dehydration-induced suppression of cutaneous vasodilatation and reduced MAP during exercise, and this was accelerated when PV was restored...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{volume is}} {{frequently}} well maintained by oncotic forces {{even in the}} presence of significant extracellular and intracel-lular fluid losses. Intracellular fluid depletion develops rela-tively slowly and can lead to significant total body fluid deple-tion. Although not primarily <b>hypovolaemia,</b> induction of ana-esthesia can markedly inhibit the protective reflexes that main-tain ECF {{at the expense of the}} ICF and lead to rapid develop-ment of <b>hypovolaemia</b> without any apparent volume loss. There are a number of situations in which such intracellular volume depletion can arise, including dehydration, fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhoea, excessive sweating (particularly with pyrexia) etc. Drug therapy, notably with diuretics or ACE in-hibitors can also create this situation.

30|$|Introduction: The {{benefits}} of pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) are controversial. The {{timing of this}} intervention can be a difficult decision, particularly for conscious trauma patients with significant hypotension secondary to presumed <b>hypovolaemia.</b> Patients who are hypovolaemic prior to induction of anaesthesia {{are at risk of}} severe cardiovascular instability post induction, which may be difficult to manage.|$|E
30|$|Conclusions: Our {{results show}} an {{association}} between PHEA and mortality in awake hypotensive trauma patients, which is increased when hypotension is confirmed {{to be due to}} <b>hypovolaemia.</b> This study supports the hypothesis that where patients are hypovolaemic and awake on scene it might, where possible, be appropriate to delay induction of anaesthesia until after hospital arrival.|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} ranges {{for skin}} temperatures in infants weighing under 1000  g {{in the first}} five days of life.  METHOD—Abdominal skin and foot temperatures were automatically collected each second, averaged over 1  minute and stored on computer. A computer program analysed the data in 83  babies weighing under 1000  g at birth over the first five days of life and expressed the temperatures as means and standard deviation. The temperature patterns seen in these babies were also visually analysed. The relation between an increasing abdominal skin-foot temperature difference and other signs of <b>hypovolaemia</b> was also studied.  RESULTS—These babies all had similar temperature patterns. Just after birth there was little ability to vasoconstrict in the presence of cold stress and the babies behaved more like poikilothermic animals. Vasomotor tone developed in the first three days, resulting in a stabilisation of the abdominal skin temperature to a mean of 36. 90 C and a widening of the central-peripheral temperature difference (Td) to a mean of 1. 00 C.  A Td of >  20 C was associated with other evidence of <b>hypovolaemia</b> for only 11 % of the time.  CONCLUSIONS—Infants weighing under 1000  g have poor vasomotor control at birth and are at increased risk from cold stress. After the first two to three days of life, monitoring the central-peripheral temperature difference gives an early indication of cold stress.    Keywords: temperature control; central-peripheral temperature difference; <b>hypovolaemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{examine the}} effect of {{intravascular}} volume expansion for the treatment of <b>hypovolaemia</b> in sick preterm neonates.  METHODS—An intravenous infusion of 20 ml per kg of 4. 5 % albumin was given to 14 preterm neonates. The effects on systolic blood pressure, central peripheral temperature difference (c-pT), and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration (pAVP) were measured.  RESULTS—Thirteen babies showed a rise in systolic blood pressure. The six babies with the highest initial values of pAVP and c-pT showed a fall in both of these after infusion. The babies with lower initial pAVP (below 4 pmol/l) showed either a rise (two) or no change (six) after albumin infusion. There was a significant correlation between c-pT and log pAVP before (r 2 = 0. 61; p< 0. 05) and after infusion (r 2 = 0. 45; p< 0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS—Plasma AVP concentration is related to c-pT in unwell preterm newborns. This study suggests that clinical assessment of <b>hypovolaemia</b> in preterm newborns is poor and could be improved by using c-pT. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of the conjunctival oxygen tension (PCJO 2) monitor during the early assessment of injured patients in the A&E Department of a large District General Hospital. The conjunctival oxygen sensor provides a non-invasive continuous monitor of tissue oxygenation in the palpebral conjunctiva and has been shown to detect early <b>hypovolaemia</b> in animal and human studies. For this preliminary report PCJO 2 was recorded with initial clinical findings, standard cardiorespiratory parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Score) and final diagnosis. Low PCJO 2 (less than 45 mmHg) was associated with <b>hypovolaemia,</b> reduced cardiac output and chest injury. Normal PCJO 2 in patients with severe head injury requiring transfer to the Regional Neurosurgical Centre or patients from multivictim road traffic accidents (RTAs) indicated no early occult cardiorespiratory compromise and this was subsequently confirmed.

40|$|International audienceHigh-dose {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} glucose 5 % promotes rebound hypoglycaemia and <b>hypovolaemia</b> in healthy volunteers. To study whether such effects occur {{in response to}} glucose-insulin, 12 healthy firemen (mean age 39 years) received 3 infusions over 1 - 2 hours that contained 20 ml/kg of glucose 2. 5 %, 5 ml/kg of glucose 10 % with rapid-acting insulin 0. 05 U/kg, and 4 ml/kg of glucose 50 % with 1 U/kg of insulin. The plasma glucose concentration and plasma dilution were compared at 5 - 10 min intervals during 4 hours. Regardless {{of the amount of}} administered fluid and whether insulin was given, the plasma glucose concentration decreased to hypoglycaemic levels within 30 min after the infusion ended. Plasma dilution closely mirrored plasma glucose and became negative by about 5 %, which indicates a reduction of the plasma volume. These alterations were only partially restored during the follow-up period. A linear relationship between plasma glucose and plasma dilution was most apparent when the infused glucose had been dissolved in only a small amount of fluid. For the strongest glucose-insulin solution, this linear relationship had a correlation coefficient of 0. 77 (n= 386, P< 0. 0001). The findings indicate that a redistribution of water due to the osmotic strength of the glucose is the chief mechanism accounting for the <b>hypovolaemia.</b> It is concluded that infusions of glucose 2. 5 %, 10 % and 50 % with and without insulin in well-trained men were consistently followed by longstanding hypoglycaemia and also by <b>hypovolaemia,</b> which averaged 5 %.
