40|$|The {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the problem of cognitive dysfunctions in pediatric patients with rolandic epilepsy (benign partial epilepsy of childhood). Russian nootropic drug pantoham (<b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid)</b> was used for correction of cognitive deficit. Quantitative data obtained via psihomat testing computer system were utilised for verification of principle cognitive functions before and after treatment with <b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid</b> in school age patients undergoing basic antiepileptic therapy. Positive effect of the drug on studied cognitive functions' indices was demonstrated. Key words: children, epilepsy, cognitive functions, <b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid.</b> </strong...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results based {{on the experience of}} pant ham (<b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid)</b> application, in treatment of 21 patients aged 7 – 8 years, suffering from benign childhood epilepsy with centroctemporal spikes (rolandic epilepsy), accompanied with impairments of cognitive functions (CF). Utilizing the computer testing systems, basic CF parameters were analyzed before and after the course of pant ham treatment as an add on treatment to basic antiepileptic therapy. Statistically relevant positive effect of the medicine on CF parameters was demonstrated. The authors highly estimate the clinical efficacy of the medication under study. Basic pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of <b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid</b> are described.

40|$|One of 20 modern {{children}} and teenagers has {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). New diagnostic criteria of ADHD according to DSM-V classification which contain the following main changes are considered in the article: age of onset — to 12 years; the requirement to cross-situational character of symptoms is strengthened; the ADHD age dynamics is reflected and the threshold number of symptoms for adult patients is entered; the comorbidity with autism spectrum disorders is allowed. Peculiarities of examination of {{children and}} teenagers with ADHD are discussed. Treatment of a syndrome must be complex and should include methods of behavior correction, psychotherapy, neuropsychological correction. Medicinal therapy demands the sufficient duration as the improvement of a state has to extend not only on the main manifestations of ADHD, but also on a social psychological aspect of patients' life. As the examination of a group of children with ADHD showed, during long courses of treatment by <b>hopantenic</b> <b>acid</b> for overcoming not only the main symptoms, but also violations of adaptation and social psychological functioning (improvement of a self-assessment, communication with people around and social activity) treatment terms must be not less than 4 – 6 months. The development and application of complex correction under ADHD should be carried out in due time and have individual character. </em...|$|E
40|$|The {{search for}} {{nootropic}} medications, which don't aggravate {{the implications of}} the hyperactivity disorder and sleep disturbances, is an urgent issue in the children's neurology. For the purpose of pantohamium sirupus appraisal, the researchers examined 20 patient aged between 3 years old and 4 years 11 months old, suffering from epilepsy with cognitive disorders and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. All the patients underwent interviewing with the composite questionnaire, oddball tasks, mechanical memory tests (memorizing 3 – 4 words), dynamic memory tests (repeating 2 groups of words), colour test (for the children of 4 years old), as well as electroencephalography and by indications clinical and biochemical examination. After the course of panto hamium sirupus treatment the researchers discovered the general improvement of attention, mechanical and dynamic memory, anxiety reduction and compensation boost based on the colour test conducted among the children, suffering from epilepsy with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Most patients showed the improvement indices of the EEG background rhythm structure and normalization of background zone differences. The analysis of the obtained results allowed the researchers to conclude that pantohamium sirupus was safe and efficient in the complex therapy among the children, suffering from epilepsy with cognitive disorders and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
