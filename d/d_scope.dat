Mechanistic studies of the nature of this pathogenetic link, as well as of other mitochondrial transcription factors, are described. Major conclusions: Based on this, it is argued that transcription and translation in mitochondria are critical processes determining mitochondrial function in β-cells in health and disease...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Unintended as it was, the European Court of Justice (ECJ, the Court, the Court of the EU) {{has played}} an {{extremely}} {{important role in the}} construction of the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ). The AFSJ was set up by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 and only entered into force in May 1999. The fact that this is a new field of EU competence, poses afresh all the fundamental questions – both political and legal – triggered by European integration, namely in terms of: a) distribution of powers between the Union and its Member States, b) attribution of competences between the various EU Institutions, c) direct effect and supremacy of EU rules, <b>d)</b> <b>scope</b> of competence of the ECJ, and e) extent of the protection given to fundamental rights. The above questions have prompted judicial solutions which take into account both the extremely sensible fields of law upon which the AFSJ is anchored, and the EU’s highly inconvenient three-pillar institutional framework. 1 The ECJ is the body whose institutional role is to benefit most from this upcoming ‘depilarisation’, possibly more than that of the European Parliament. This structure is on the verge of being abandoned, provided the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. 2 However spectacular this formal boost of the Court’s competence, the changes in real terms are not going to be that dramatic. This apparent contradiction is explained, to a large extent, by the fact that the Court has in many ways ‘provoked’, or even ‘anticipated’, the depilarisation of its own jurisdictional role, already under the existing three-pillar structure. Simply put, under the new – post Treaty of Lisbon – regime, the Court will have full jurisdiction over all AFSJ matters, as those are going to be fully integrated in what is now the first pillar. Some limitations will continue to apply, however, while a special AFSJ procedure will be institutionalised. Indeed, if we look into the new Treaty we may identify general modifications to the Court’s structure and jurisdiction affecting the AFSJ (section 2), modifications in the field of the AFSJ stemming from the abolition of the pillar structure (section 3) and, finally, some rules specifically applicable to the AFSJ (section 4) ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. The {{study of}} the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) case law of the {{regarding}} the Area of Freedom Security and Justice (AFSJ) is fascinating in many ways. 1 First, almost {{the totality of the}} relevant case law is extremely recent, thereby marking the first ‘foundational’ steps in this field of law. This {{is the result of the}} fact that the AFSJ was set up by the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 and only entered into force in May 1999. 2 Second, as the AFSJ is a new field of EU competence, it sets afresh all the fundamental questions – both political and legal – triggered by European integration, namely in terms of: a) distribution of powers between the Union and its member states, b) attribution of competences between the various EU Institutions, c) direct effect and supremacy of EU rules, <b>d)</b> <b>scope</b> of competence of the ECJ, and e) measure of the protection given to fundamental rights. The above questions beg for answers which should take into account both the extremely sensible fields of law upon which the AFSJ is anchored, and the EU’s highly inconvenient three-pillar institutional framework. 3 Third, and as a consequence of the above, the vast majority of the ECJ’s judgments relating to the AFSJ are a) delivered by the Full Court or, at least, the Grand Chamber, b) with the intervention of great many member states and c) often obscure in content. This is due to the fact that the Court is called upon to set the foundational rules in a new field of EU law, often trying to accommodate divergent considerations, not all of which are strictly legal. 4 Fourth, the case law of the Court relating to the AFSJ, touches upon a vast variety of topics which are not necessarily related to one another. This is why it is essential to limit the scope of this study. The content of, and steering for, the AFSJ were given by the Tampere European Council, in October 1999. According to the Tampere Conclusions, the AFSJ should consist of four key elements: a) a common immigration and asylum policy, b) judicial cooperation in both civil and penal matters, c) action against criminality and d) external action of the EU in all the above fields. Moreover, the AFSJ is to a large extent based on the Schengen acquis. The latter has been ‘communautarised’ 5 by the Treaty of Amsterdam and further ‘ventilated’ between the first and third pillars by decisions 1999 / 435 and 1999 / 436. 6 Judicial cooperation in civil matters, mainly by means of international conventions (such as the Rome Convention of 1981 on the law applicable to contractual obligations) and regulations (such as (EC) 44 / 20017 and (EC) 1348 / 20008) also form part of the AFSJ. However, the relevant case law of the ECJ will not be examined in the present contribution. 9 Similarly, the judgments of the Court delivered in the course of Article 226 EC proceedings against member states, will be omitted. 10 Even after setting aside the above case law and notwithstanding the fact that the AFSJ only dates as far back as May 1999, the judgments of the ECJ are numerous. A simple (if not simplistic) categorisation may be between, on the one hand, judgments which concern the institutional setting of the AFSJ (para. 2) and, on the other, judgments which are related to some substantive AFSJ policy (para. 3) ...|$|E

Its strategy concerning tax incentives could also be strengthened to remove the barriers for extending the treaty network and enhancing regional coordination.

This document updates recommendations for HIV testing by laboratories in the United States and offers approaches for reporting test results to persons ordering HIV tests and {{to public health}} authorities. The recommended algorithm is a sequence of tests used in combination to improve {{the accuracy of the}} laboratory diagnosis of HIV based on testing of serum or plasma specimens. In brief, testing begins with a combination immunoassay that detects HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 antibodies and HIV- 1 p 24 antigen. All specimens reactive on this initial assay undergo supplemental testing with an immunoassay that differentiates HIV- 1 from HIV- 2 antibodies. Specimens that are reactive on the initial immunoassay and nonreactive or indeterminate on the antibody differentiation assay proceed to HIV- 1 nucleic acid testing for resolution. CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) have issued these recommendations based on HIV tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as of December 2012 and scientific evidence, laboratory experience, and expert opinion collected from 2007 through December 2013. These recommendations do not include the rapid HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 antigen/antibody combination test approved by the FDA in August 2013 (for which evidence of performance in the algorithm was insufficient) or HIV- 2 nucleic acid tests, which lack FDA approval. Because none of the assays in the recommended algorithm are FDA-approved for use with oral fluid or dried blood spot specimens, these updated recommendations do not supersede previous recommendations for testing of dried blood spots or oral fluid for HIV- 1 using the FDA-approved immunoassay and HIV- 1 Western blot for these specimen types.

If JVs facilitate knowledge exchange only through personal contacts for the operation of JVs, improved knowledge transfer may be limited to the specific business area. However, collaboration across different technological areas via JVs suggests the attenuation of opportunistic behavior by hostage at the firm level.

This approach accounts for a particular vexing problem in the articulation of digital politics. That is, the process of political disenfranchisement by corporations looking to profit, governments looking to regulate information flows, and coopted groups in civil society looking to appropriate the legitimate concerns of users for their own political and financial subsistence. The distinct features of this quasi-totalitarianism include a. the monopoly of digital planning on surveillance resting on back-channel and secret communication between government, tech corporate elites and, sometimes, NGOs; b. the role of civil society NGOs as mechanisms for circumventing democratic processes c. enterprise association politics that ensures that the dual goal of state (security) and capital (profit) continues unabated and unaccounted; <b>d.</b> the unprecedented <b>scope</b> in the form of total structural data acquisition by western intelligence matrixes; e. the persecution and prosecution of journalists, whistleblowers and transparency actors outside the scope of civil society groups and f. the significant if insufficient contestation by members of the public concerning the infringement on civil liberties.

40|$|Having {{software}} {{processes that}} fit technological, project, and business demands is one important prerequisite for software-developing organizations to operate successfully in a sustainable way. Therefore, process management needs to constantly evaluate the organization's processes {{to see whether}} they match the demands. In doing so, not only should the current demands be considered; future demands should also be anticipated and proactive support should be provided. Currently, there is little methodological support for selecting and evolving an organization's processes based on identified current and anticipated future demands. This often leads to unfocused development processes with unnecessary variability that only inadequately support current demands, and whose evolution to meet future challenges is very difficult. In order to address this problem, a solution should actively identify an organization's current and anticipated future demands. It should therefore analyze its products and projects in terms of their process demands, using existing knowledge where available. Based on this analysis, it should provide explicit support for defining and evolving the organization's processes, and be readily applicable in industrial practice. This thesis introduces the SCOPE approach for continuously focusing an organization's processes towards the relevant demands. In particular, the SCOPE approach facilitates (a) the determination of the process demands of current and future products and projects, (b) the analysis of processes for satisfying these demands, (c) scenario-based selection strategies that support decisions as to which processes to keep, which to discard, and how to prioritize process modifications, and (d) a prototype tool supporting the overall approach. The approach was validated by means of one controlled experiment and two industrial case studies. The validation was aimed at showing that SCOPE (a) allows for a greater reduction in unnecessary process variability than ad hoc selection; (b) allows for selecting processes that cover a broader range of demands than ad hoc selection; (c) allows for reducing process management effort compared to ad hoc methods; and (d) is fit for industrial application. The validation showed that (a) the application of the SCOPE approach in a controlled experiment led to a 46 % reduction in unnecessary process variability compared to ad hoc approaches and allowed for an 82 % reduction in an industrial case study; (b) SCOPE users identified 150 % more misalignments between processes and demands in a controlled experiment than when working ad hoc; (c) the application of the SCOPE approach allowed for a reduction in process management effort of 83 % in a controlled experiment and of 41 % in an industrial case study; and (<b>d)</b> the <b>SCOPE</b> approach and results were accepted by the engineers in two industrial case studies as a means for providing adequate support for process management...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Special Education, Washington State UniversityThere are a {{multitude}} of benefits associated with employment, which many individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) are not afforded due to their struggles to find and maintain work. These poor employment outcomes are in part being addressed by the over 240 post-secondary education (PSE) programs for students with ID that exist on college and university campuses in the U. S., many of which include work experience as a program component. A sequential mixed methods study, featuring a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews, was conducted to explore challenges faced by PSE program directors when facilitating work experience engagements, as well as strategies utilized to encourage employers to provide work experience opportunities for students. In addition, the study included a component designed to explore the existence of potential relationships between certain PSE program characteristics and barriers faced when facilitating paid work experiences. Findings include the identification of common barriers to facilitating paid work experience for students in PSE programs as being: (a) transportation issues, (b) employer perceptions of the abilities of people with disabilities, (c) inadequate number of staff hours to support students in the workplace, and (d) finding time in the student’s schedule. To increase paid work experience opportunities for students, PSE staff commonly use the following strategies: (a) solicit feedback from employer regarding the placement, (b) build a trusting relationship with the employer, (c) match student interests with their work experience position, (<b>d)</b> negotiate the <b>scope</b> of the job with employers so that it benefits both the business and student, (e) provide direct on-site training for {{the students in the}} workplace, (f) utilize natural supports in the workplace, and (g) provide students with an opportunity to relate what is learned in the workplace to what is learned in the instructional curriculum. The findings suggest that none of the program characteristics included in this study have a significant impact of the types of barriers faced by PSE staff when facilitating paid work experience. A discussion about these findings, including implications and recommendations for future research, has also been provided. Washington State University, Special Educatio...|$|R
