5|$|Before venom <b>immunotherapy,</b> {{whole body}} extract <b>immunotherapy</b> was widely used {{due to its}} {{apparent}} effectiveness, {{and it was the}} only <b>immunotherapy</b> used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract <b>immunotherapy</b> was later proven to be ineffective, and venom <b>immunotherapy</b> was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom <b>immunotherapy</b> was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that <b>immunotherapy</b> can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom <b>immunotherapy.</b> Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during <b>immunotherapy.</b> The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom <b>immunotherapy</b> is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract <b>immunotherapy,</b> where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect <b>immunotherapy</b> may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite <b>immunotherapy</b> being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E

40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is one of}} the most immunoresponsive human cancers. High-dose IL- 2 and Interferon-α were once the principle therapies for metastatic RCC, however they had harsh-tolerance profiles and limited response rates. In the last decade, targeted therapies have supplanted cytokine therapy due to higher response rates and more favorable toxicity profiles. Emerging <b>immunotherapies</b> targeting the PD- 1 receptor and PD-L 1 ligand have shown promising results. Likewise, other novel targeted <b>immunotherapies</b> are currently under evaluation. The safety profiles and response rates of new generation <b>immunotherapies</b> are encouraging and justify the progression of clinical trials. However, longer follow-up data are needed to confirm these promising results. In addition, it is still unclear if an optimal sequence or combinations of new <b>immunotherapies</b> paired with current targeted therapies will emerge...|$|R

5|$|Desensitisation (also called allergy <b>immunotherapy)</b> to {{the jack}} jumper sting venom has shown {{effectiveness}} in preventing anaphylaxis, but the standardisation of jack jumper venom {{is yet to}} be validated. Unlike bee and wasp sting <b>immunotherapy,</b> jack jumper <b>immunotherapy</b> lacks funding and no government rebate is available. Venom is available; however, no commercial venom extract is available {{that can be used for}} skin testing. Venom extract is only available through the Therapeutic Goods Administration Special Access Scheme.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{are given}} an {{injection}} of venom {{under the skin}} in small amounts. During <b>immunotherapy,</b> the first dose is small, but will gradually increase per injection.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{potential}} vaccines are currently being tested. Vaccination with Trypanosoma rangeli has produced positive results in animal models. More recently, the potential of DNA vaccines for <b>immunotherapy</b> of acute and chronic Chagas disease is being tested by several research groups.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy <b>immunotherapy)</b> is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During <b>immunotherapy,</b> patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of <b>immunotherapy</b> is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Most people recover uneventfully {{following}} a mild local reaction {{and up to}} about 3% of individuals suffer a severe localised reaction. Most individuals who suffer from severe localised reactions will most likely encounter another reaction if stung again. Fatalities are rare, and venom <b>immunotherapy</b> can prevent fatalities.|$|E

5|$|Efforts are {{underway}} {{to develop new}} drugs. Some of these involve targeted therapies against the cancer cells' molecular mechanisms. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic stroma and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence cell proliferation and metastasis. A further approach {{involves the use of}} <b>immunotherapy,</b> such as oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are not {{eligible}} for a stem cell transplant, <b>immunotherapy</b> with a combination of histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) and interleukin 2 (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained remission.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia stings {{are very}} potent, and the venoms from these ants {{are among the}} most toxic in the insect world. In Tasmania, 3% of the human {{population}} are allergic to the venom of M. pilosula and can suffer life-threatening anaphylactic reactions if stung; many human deaths have been recorded.

40|$|Globally, Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related death of high {{morbidity}} and mortality with poor prognosis, which needs some more effective and less toxic therapies. The <b>immunotherapies</b> offer a novel approach for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in both the adjuvant and palliative disease settings. A number of promising <b>immunotherapies</b> based on different mechanism have now been evaluated showing an increasing response rate. Moreover, further phase II/III clinical trials will be indicated to explore its value. These include checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA 4 antibody, anti-PD- 1 antibody, anti-PD-L 1 antibody), active vaccination (L-BLP 25 liposome vaccine, Belagenpumatucel-L vaccine, MAGE-A 3 protein vaccine) and adoptive vaccination (CIK cells).

40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} require signaling by the T {{cell receptor}} and by nonclonotypic cosignaling receptors. The costimulatory and inhibitory signals profoundly influence {{the course of}} immune responses by amplifying or reducing the transcriptional effects of T cell receptor triggering. The inhibitory receptors such as CTLA- 4, PD- 1, and BTLA have recently drawn much attention as potential targets for <b>immunotherapies.</b> This review focuses on the progress {{that has been made}} with the mentioned receptors in the field of <b>immunotherapies</b> for autoimmune diseases, malignancies, infectious diseases, and transplantation. </p...|$|R
5|$|Other <b>immunotherapy</b> {{treatments}} {{interfere with}} the binding of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) protein with its ligand PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} group's principal investigations concerned {{immunological tolerance}} (the body's acceptance of tissues, {{as opposed to}} rejection), autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals.

However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.|$|E
5|$|When {{the lesion}} is localized, it is {{generally}} curable. However, long-term survival for children with advanced disease older than 18 months of age is poor despite aggressive multimodal therapy (intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, differentiation agent isotretinoin also called 13-cis-retinoic acid, and frequently <b>immunotherapy</b> with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody therapy).|$|E
50|$|Today, Cellectis {{is focused}} on {{developing}} <b>immunotherapies</b> based on custom engineered CAR-T-cells (UCART), whose properties can be determined by genetic modification.

5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted <b>immunotherapy</b> as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. <b>Immunotherapy</b> or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} <b>immunotherapy</b> treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E
40|$|For over a century, inactivated or {{attenuated}} bacteria {{have been}} {{employed in the}} clinic as <b>immunotherapies</b> to treat cancer, starting with the Coley’s vaccines in the 19 th century and leading to the currently approved bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine for bladder cancer. While effective, the inflammation induced by these therapies is transient and not designed to induce long-lasting tumor-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses that have proven so adept at eradicating tumors. Therefore, {{in order to maintain}} the benefits of bacteria-induced acute inflammation but gain long-lasting anti-tumor immunity, many groups have constructed recombinant bacteria expressing tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) for the purpose of activating tumor-specific CTLs. One bacterium has proven particularly adept at inducing powerful anti-tumor immunity, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Lm is a gram-positive bacterium that selectively infects antigen-presenting cells wherein it is able to efficiently deliver tumor antigens to both the MHC Class I and II antigen presentation pathways for activation of tumor-targeting CTL-mediated immunity. Lm is a versatile bacterial vector as evidenced by its ability to induce therapeutic immunity against a wide-array of TAAs and specifically infect and kill tumor cells directly. It is for these reasons, among others, that Lm-based <b>immunotherapies</b> have delivered impressive therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of cancer for two decades and are now showing promise clinically. In this review, we will provide an overview of the history leading up to the development of current Lm-based <b>immunotherapies,</b> the advantages and mechanisms of Lm as a therapeutic vaccine vector, the preclinical experience with Lm-based <b>immunotherapies</b> targeting a number of malignancies, and the recent findings from clinical trials along with concluding remarks on the future of Lm-based tumor <b>immunotherapies...</b>|$|R
