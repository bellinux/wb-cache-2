50|$|Michel A. J. Georges {{is known}} for his {{research}} in the field of animal genetics and genomics, and in the development of tools and strategies for increasing the efficiency of genome analysis for livestock improvement. He has applied his methods to the identification and mapping of genes affecting economically important single-gene (e.g. polled, double-muscling, callipyge, weaver, congenital muscular distonia), as well as complex multi-gene traits (e.g. milk and <b>fattening</b> <b>yield</b> and quality, fertility, disease resistance). He has also established working relationships with the major breeding organizations in many countries, helping them to apply the results of his discoveries on a large scale, using so-called marker assisted selection to accelerate the otherwise slow process of farm animal improvement. He is also a pioneer in opening up the field of epigenetics for animals, a hereditary form that does not conform to simple Mendelian rules. He is considered a giant within the animal genetics and genomics community, both for his genius and for generously sharing his ideas.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a factors, that affect the final {{performance}} of turkeys for <b>fattening</b> of meat <b>yield.</b> It takes into account internal and external aspects based on essential needs of the modern commercial hybrids from well-known companies. The thesis brings a familiarization with origin and exterier of turkeys and mentions an essential breeds and types of turkeys. It includes a breeding and situation of turkey breeds in the Czech Republic. My thesis {{deals with a}} compare of general informations with practical experience and finding out that maximal performance of turkey connected with technological principles of fattening...|$|R
60|$|It has {{sometimes}} been said that our domestic races do not differ in constitutional peculiarities, but this cannot be maintained. In our improved cattle, pigs, etc., the period of maturity, including that of the second dentition, has been much hastened. The period of gestation varies much, and has been modified in a fixed manner {{in one or two}} cases. In some breeds of poultry and pigeons the period at which the down and the first plumage are acquired, differs. The number of moults through which the larvae of silk-moths pass, varies. The tendency to <b>fatten,</b> to <b>yield</b> much milk, to produce many young or eggs at a birth or during life, differs in different breeds. We find different degrees of adaptation to climate, and different tendencies to certain diseases, to the attacks of parasites, and to the action of certain vegetable poisons. With plants, adaptation to certain soils, the power of resisting frost, the period of flowering and fruiting, the duration of life, the period of shedding the leaves or of retaining them throughout the winter, the proportion and nature of certain chemical compounds in the tissues or seeds, all vary.|$|R

Fourteen ponds were converted for production of mud crab. Monoculture, polyculture and fattening methods are described. Production {{results of these}} trials vary from 1020 - 2440 kghalcmp, revealing the scope to improve high <b>yield.</b> <b>Fattening</b> of water crabs {{in a period of}} 7 - 8 weeks fetched an attractive revenue. Technology for production of gravid female which fetch a premium price in export trade was evolved. A high profit was realised in polyculture trials with milkfish as compatible species. Feed consists of low cost trash fish and gutted waqtes of squid, rays and chick. The hydrological and environmental conditions were conducive and its requirements are discussed. The growth, survival and production results vary according to the size and number of seed stocked...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a total merit index, the relative economic values of the traits considered must be known. Hence, {{the objective of this}} study was to derive economic values, defined by the value of one unit of superiority of a trait, for essential traits in dairy sheep based on a herd model. These traits included dairy (milk carrier = water, lactose and mineral nutrients, fat and protein <b>yield),</b> <b>fattening</b> (daily gain, dressing percentage, and EUROP grading score) and functional traits (stillbirth rate, losses until first mating, litter size, lambing interval, and functional longevity). To avoid double counting, the economic value for each trait was derived while keeping all other traits constant. A sheep herd with milk production, lamb fattening and rearing of young sheep for replacement was modelled. The following economic values (in â‚¬) per ewe place and year and genetic standard deviation were derived: 21. 45 (milk carrier yield), 11. 73 (fat yield), 16. 87 (protein yield); 3. 62 (daily gain), 1. 62 (dressing percentage), 1. 45 (EUROP-grading score), - 0. 28 (functional longevity), 3. 00 (litter size), 1. 77 (stillbirth), 5. 92 (losses before first mating), and 5. 35 (lambing interval). When setting functional longevity to zero, relative economic values for the trait complexes in % were as follows: dairy:meat:functional traits = 68. 8 : 9. 2 : 22. 0, respectively...|$|R
