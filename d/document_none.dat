40|$|This article {{reports on}} 18 months of action {{research}} that monitored British pupils ’ {{learning about the}} nature of science, using some aspects of history of science for the purpose. The action research took place within five classrooms and involved practicing teachers who used a set of historical materials specially written for this study. Preliminary findings about the common perceptions of the nature of science held by middle school pupils (age 11 - 14 years) guided the work, which was carried out using a variety of methodologies. The results obtained show some areas of substantial progress in the pupils ’ {{understanding of the nature of}} science, and others where little change seems to have been effected. Background to the Study This research was stimulated by the publication of the National Curriculum for England and Wales, which contained a section on the nature of science, including history of science (cf. Solomon, 1991 a). The appointment of two subsequent Secretaries of State for Education, and the experience of trial runs of the assessment process, have produced a shorter version of the curriculum for science that is still (at this writing-August, 1991) in its consultative phase. Although some aspects of history originally proposed are given a lower profile in the later <b>document,</b> <b>none</b> has been completely omitted. The general aims of the relevant part of the curriculum are stated as follows: Pupils should develop their knowledge and understanding of the ways in which scientific ideas change through time and how the nature of these ideas and the uses to which they are put are affected by the social, moral, spiritual and cultural contexts in which they are developed.

40|$|In the Semantic Web, the {{extension}} of the current Web, XML documents are used to provide information together with a well–definded structure to support effective data discovery and automation. Some years ago, they have mostly been used for exchanging data between different applications, hence the complete information was contained in a single document.

In addition to such inter–document links, the XML standard allows to add intra-documents links in-between elements of a single document (e. g., using attributes of type id and idref, or using an XLink that targets the document itself).

Obesity, high-fat diets, {{and lack of}} regular physical activity increase risk for breast cancer recurrence, comorbid conditions, and premature death. Eighty-two percent of African American women are overweight or obese, partly because of unhealthy eating and exercise patterns. Although successful weight loss and lifestyle interventions for breast cancer survivors are <b>documented,</b> <b>none</b> has considered the needs of African American breast cancer survivors. This study assessed the feasibility and impact of Moving Forward, a culturally tailored weight loss program for African American breast cancer survivors. MethodsThe study used a pre-post design with {{a convenience sample of}} 23 African American breast cancer survivors. The 6 -month intervention was theory-based and incorporated qualitative data from focus groups with the targeted community, urban African American breast cancer survivors. Data on weight, body mass index (BMI), diet, physical activity, social support, and quality of life were collected at baseline and at 6 months.

ConclusionThis is the first published report of Moving Forward, a weight loss intervention designed for African American breast cancer survivors.

Therefore, no co-registration has so far been used to match a myocardial perfusion defect with calcifications in the subtending coronary artery. To evaluate the prognostic value of integrating SPECT-MPI with CAC images were obtained from non-enhanced cardiac computed tomography (CT) for attenuation correction to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACE). METHODS AND RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained in 462 patients undergoing a 1 -day stress/rest (99 m) Tc-teterofosmin SPECT and non-enhanced cardiac CT for attenuation correction. Survival free of MACE was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. After integrating MPI and CT findings, patients were divided into three groups (i) MPI defect matched by calcification (CAC ≥ 1) in the subtending coronary artery (ii) unmatched MPI and CT finding (iii) normal finding by MPI and CT. At a mean follow-up of 34. 5 ± 13 months, a MACE was observed in 80 patients (33 death, 6 non-fatal myocardial infarction, 9 hospitalizations due to unstable angina, and 32 revascularizations). Survival analysis revealed the most unfavourable outcome (P < 0. 001 log-rank test) for patients with  a matched finding. CONCLUSION: In the present study, a novel approach using a combined integration of cardiac SPECT-CAC imaging allows for refined risk stratification, as a matched defect emerged as an independent predictor of MACE...|$|R
40|$|Background. Aim of {{this study}} was to assess the role of peritoneal fluid {{sampling}} for detection of bacterial infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) in women undergoing laparoscopic investigation. The potential link between microbiological positive result(s) and types of gynecological pathology was also evaluated. Materials and Methods. A large sample of women (n= 1377) with their peritoneal fluids taken laparoscopically was studied. Data of microbiological and clinical/histopathological findings were entered into a database from a retrospective chart review. Culture and/or microscopy were used to detect NG or MT infection, whereas CT infection was detected using a PCR-based test. Results and Conclusions. Of all the patients (14 to 50 years aged), 463 (33. 6 %) had endometriosis, 1179 (85. 6 %) had a pathology/condition other than endometriosis, and 71 (5. 2 %) had no pathology as histologically <b>documented.</b> <b>None</b> of the patients had peritoneal fluid samples positive for NG or MT. In contrast, 30 (2. 2 %) of 1377 patients had peritoneal fluid samples positive for CT. Except for 3 women with no histopathological alteration, all the CT positive patients had either endometriosis (n= 12) or non-endometriosis (n= 13) pathology. Two remaining patients were diagnosed with both the pathologies. Accordingly, no significant association (OR) was found between CT positivity and pathology [only endometriosis, 1. 13 (95 %CI, 0. 30 - 4. 20) ]; [only non-endometriosis, 0. 53 (95 %CI, 0. 15 - 1. 87) ].
