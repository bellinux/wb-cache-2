2500|$|The mercantile saltfish {{premises}} at Battle Harbour {{were established}} by the firm of John Slade and Company of Poole, England in the early 1770s. Lying {{just north of the}} old French Shore, Battle Harbour served as the gateway for Newfoundlanders seeking to fish in the resource rich waters of Labrador. The local population increased rapidly after 1820 when Newfoundland fishing schooners adopted Battle Harbour as their primary port of call and made it the recognized capital of the Labrador floater fishery. Battle Harbour remained in the hands of Slade and Co. until 1871, and during this time became a settled community, dominated by the fish merchants, but with its own evolving institutions, especially schools and churches. In 1871 the Slades sold Battle Harbour to Baine, Johnston and Company Ltd. who operated the site in much the same manner until 1955. The activity of these two firms at Battle Harbour serve as an accurate microcosm of the history of Newfoundland and Labrador's fishery over almost two centuries. In 1955 Baine, Johnston and Company Ltd. sold the premises to The Earle Freighting Service Ltd. who continued the site's operation until the decline in the <b>inshore</b> <b>fishery</b> {{at the start of the}} 1990s. At that time the site was donated [...] to the Battle Harbour Historic Trust. The community's permanent residents had been relocated under a government-sponsored resettlement program from 1965 to 1970, although a number of families still use the site as a seasonal home.|$|E

So alive did the people get to be to the profit and sport {{of this sort of}} business, that boats were constructed, and crews formed all over the colony, there being often as many as a dozen different parties out, taking whales near the coasts. The furor existed on the Peak, {{as well as in the}} low lands, and Bridget and Anne could not but marvel that men would quit the delicious coolness, the beautiful groves, and all the fruits and bountiful products of that most delightful plain, to go out on the ocean, in narrow quarters, and under a hot sun, to risk their lives in chase of the whale! This did the colonists, nevertheless, until the governor himself began to feel the necessity of striking a whale, if he would maintain his proper place in the public opinion.|$|E

40|$|In {{seeking to}} answer the {{question}} ‘who should be included in fisheries co-management?’, a constructive critique of the existing co-management literature is provided by filling the gaps of Habermas’s deliberative theory of democracy with Dewey’s pragmatism. Three conditions for ensuring democratic co-management are extrapolated from the theories: actors’ authority over decision making (empowerment), actors’ diversity (membership), and the right to self-nomination (procedures for external inclusion). The theoretical insights developed are supported with two examples of co-management institutions for <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the UK: Scottish <b>Inshore</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Groups (IFGs) and English <b>Inshore</b> <b>Fisheries</b> Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) ...|$|R

40|$|A social {{study of}} the shrimp {{fisheries}} of Galveston Bay, Tex., and Calcasieu Lake, La., was made {{during the summer of}} 1987 to examine the impacts of the seasonal closure of the Federal waters off Texas and to understand the infrastructure and demographic processes of these two diverse fisheries. Survey instruments were administered to 159 shrimp boat captains: 89 from Galveston Bay and 70 from Calcasieu Lake. Shrimp-house owners were interviewed in each region as well. The results suggest that the <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> (i. e., shrimpers and shrimp houses) are distinct from the offshore fisheries. The infrastructure of the two <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> examined differ in that the market distribution of shrimp from Galveston Bay was more diffuse than from Calcasieu Lake. Much more of the shrimp harvested from Galveston Bay was channelled into the surrounding community than from Calcasieu Lake. The distribution of age,years as a commercial fisherman, and family involvement in fishing suggest that participation in Calcasieu Lake's and Galveston Bay's <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries</b> have expanded concurrent with declining economies. While overall the Texas closure had little impact on either of the <b>inshore</b> <b>fisheries,</b> the Galveston Bay shrimpers experienced more of a direct impact on their livelihood than Calcasieu Lake shrimpers...|$|R
