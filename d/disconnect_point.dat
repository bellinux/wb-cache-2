The main obstacle to making this prediction is correctly treating the axion string cores. We develop a new algorithm for treating the axionic string cores correctly in 2 + 1 dimensions. When the axionic string cores are given their full physical string tension, axion production is about twice as efficient as in previous simulations. We argue that the string network in 2 + 1 dimensions should behave very differently than in 3 + 1 dimensions, so this result cannot be simply carried over to the physical case. We outline how to extend our method to 3 + 1 D axion string dynamics. Comment: 22 pages plus two appendices; 15 figures.

In the developing world, accurate diagnosis {{can be the}} most expensive and time-consuming aspect of health care. Healthcare cost can, however, be reduced by use of affordable rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). In the developed world, low-cost RDTs are being developed in many research laboratories; however, they are not being equally adopted in the developing countries. This <b>disconnect</b> <b>points</b> to a gap in the design philosophy, where parameterization of design variables ignores the most critical component of the system, the point-of-use stakeholders (e. g., doctors, nurses and patients). Herein, we demonstrated that a general focus on reducing cost (i. e., “low-cost”), rather than efficiency and reliability is misguided by the assumption that poverty reduces the value individuals place on their well-being. A case study of clinicians in Kenya showed that “zero-cost” is a low-weight parameter for point-of-use stakeholders, while reliability and standardization are crucial. We therefore argue that a user-driven, value-addition systems-engineering approach is needed for the design of RDTs to enhance adoption and translation into the field...|$|R

While these points accurately represent all the combinations of digitized bit patterns, each point is obtained from a separate trigger event, so {{there is no way to}} determine exact characteristics of any specific bit combination (Fig. 1 a). (a) (b) Fig. 1. Sequential sampling oscilloscopes show eye diagrams {{as a series}} of disconnected dots (a). Using the HP Eyeline display mode (b), the individual bit patterns can be distinguished. When sampling live data there is no alternative, but when sampling repetitive waveforms such as pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) patterns it is often possible to show the individual bit sequences. This is done by synchronizing the oscilloscope trigger with the pattern repetition rate. In this case, the oscilloscope repeatedly triggers at the same point in the pattern, so the display is a sampled representation of that segment of the pattern. This display mode, called pattern triggering, is commonly used in situations where the device under test can be stimulated with a digital pattern generator from a bit error rate tester (BERT). Pattern generators typically include a trigger output that can be set to produce a trigger pulse at the start of each pattern.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Recurrence is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in natural systems: A system enters and leaves a state, but after a given period of time, passes near that same state again. Many complex signals, such as weather cycles, heartbeats, or neuron firing patterns, all show recurrence. The recurrence plot (RP) displays all times j where a system returns near a state it has occupied at time i, giving rise to upward-sloping diagonal lines where a system follows a recurrent path, orthogonal lines when the system changes very slowly, or many <b>disconnected</b> <b>points</b> where a system's behavior is unpredictable. Investigation of the RP can then proceed through recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Three new measures for RQA were developed: diagonality, quantifying diagonal lines, verticality, quantifying vertical lines, and periodicity quantifying the arrangement of recurrence points in periodic structures. These new measures were applied alongside classical recurrence measures to explore trends in random data, identify periodicity and chaotic behavior in the logistic map, estimate the dimensionality of the Lorenz attractor, and discriminate between persistent data signals. In collaboration with biologist Dr. Michael Harris, RQA methods were applied to the discrimination of two neuron types: serotonergic cells are believed to stimulate respiration, while nonserotonergic cells are implicated in respiratory inhibition. Typical discrimination methods compare {{mean and standard deviation}} of firing rates to a reference line, which correctly classifies serotonergic cells but incorrectly classifies many nonserotonergic cells. Voltage signals from such cells were converted into inter-spike intervals. Convergence required trials containing over 300 spikes for biological methods, and over 1000 for full investigation using RQA. Whether such cells can be discriminated from baseline firing patterns remains an open question...|$|R

40|$|Fluvial {{deposits}} {{of the lower}} Williams Fork Formation (Mesaverde Group; Upper Cretaceous) form the main reservoirs at Grand Valley Field in the Piceance Basin of Colorado. In the eight-section study area, the lower Williams Fork Formation consists of approximately 1, 500 ft (457 m) of mudstone with numerous isolated-to-amalgamated, lenticular-to-channel-form sandstone deposited by meandering river systems within a coastal-plain setting. Given the uncertainty in the geometry and distribution of the fluvial reservoirs, this study addresses the field-scale architecture and distribution of the fluvial deposits by combining outcrop-analog data with 3 -D reservoir modeling using multipoint statistical simulation (MPS). Log data from 328 wells and core data from 10 wells were described to determine key facies (N= 12), facies associations, and architectural elements (point bar, crevasse splay, coal, floodplain). These observations and interpretations were compared to existing outcrop data and observations to evaluate stratigraphic variability within the area. Core-to-log comparison was used to develop criteria to calculate lithology logs and interpret architectural elements from conventional well logs. Both point bars and crevasse splays form reservoir-quality sandstones. The range in thickness for point bars is 2 - 30 ft (0. 6 - 9. 0 m) {{with an average of}} 5. 4 ft (1. 6 m). Crevasse splays range in thickness from 0. 5 - 20 ft (3 ̆c 0. 2 - 6. 1 m) with an average of 1. 7 ft (0. 5 m). For comparison, dimensional data from outcrops located approximately 20 mi (32 km) to the southwest show that point bars (N= 116) range in thickness from 3. 9 - 29. 9 ft (1. 2 - 9. 1 m) and from 44. 1 - 1699. 8 ft (13. 4 - 518. 1 m) in apparent width, and crevasse splays (N= 279) range in thickness from 0. 5 - 15. 0 ft (0. 2 - 4. 6 m) and from 40. 1 - 843. 3 ft (12. 2 - 257. 0 m) in apparent width.
