5|$|The Murray River and {{southern}} tributaries originally displayed {{a pattern of}} high flows in winter, high flows and floods in spring, and low flows in summer and autumn. The breeding of Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish was adapted to these natural <b>flow</b> <b>patterns.</b> River regulation for irrigation has reversed these natural <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> with negative effects on the breeding and recruitment of Murray cod. The Murray and most southern tributaries now experience high irrigation flows in summer and autumn and low flows in winter and spring. Small and medium floods including the once annual spring flood-pulse have been completely eliminated.|$|E

Lots of empirical correlations {{have been made to}} predict pressure drop in pipelines under multiphase condition. Example of correlation used to predict pressure drop is Petalas-Aziz correlation, Begss-Brill correlation and Flannigan correlation. Under multiphase condition, different types of <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> can happen. In predicting pressure drop <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> is considered because different <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> will give a different pressure drop. In this study <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> is consider to determine the <b>flow</b> <b>pattern.</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>pattern</b> used is intermittent, stratified, annular and bubble flow. After determining the <b>flow</b> <b>pattern,</b> three empirical correlations used to predict the pressure drop which is Petalas-Aziz correlation, Beggs and Brill correlation and Flannigan correlation. Thus, to determine the <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> and pressure drop mathematical programming software is used which is FORTRAN.

These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing climb and descent corridors under ATC positive control in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency transponder code 7700. Additionally, the NTSB strongly recommended that the FAA and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E
5|$|During the season, a {{total of}} sixteen {{tropical}} cyclones developed, featuring ten hurricanes, four tropical storms and two tropical depressions. These totals {{are close to the}} climatological averages established since 1966, when satellite surveillance began. However, the season was less active than 1990, which had a record 16 hurricanes (more than 1991). On the other hand, it ended late with the first November hurricane since 1966. On the other hand, the months of July and August, often the most active ones in this basin, only produced two tropical cyclones each. The activity in July is four systems below the average of six at that time due to unusual circulation patterns aloft over the tropical Pacific. A shorter gap from late August to early September was attributed to anomalous <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> near the Baja California Peninsula. Several tropical cyclones grew into specially long-lived and intense systems. For example, Hurricane Kevin endured as a hurricane for 12½ days to the east of 140°W, establishing a new record for longevity in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

25|$|Fluid {{dynamics}} {{also plays}} an important role in vascular remodelling. The shear stress applied to vessel walls is proportional to the viscosity and <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> of the fluid.

The primitive heart within the first few days of contraction is best described as a peristaltic pump, however after three days the flow becomes pulsatile.

25|$|Physical cues such as pressure, velocity, <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> and {{shear stress}} {{are known to}} act on the {{vascular}} network in a number of ways, including branching morphogenesis, enlargement of vessels in high-flow areas, angiogenesis, and the development of vein valves. The mechanotransduction of these physical cues to endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall can also trigger the promotion or repression of certain genes which are responsible for vasodilation, cell alignment, and other shear stress-mitigating factors. This relationship between genetics and environment is not clearly understood, but researchers are attempting to clarify it by combining reliable genetic techniques, such as genetically-ablated model organisms and tissues, with new technologies developed to measure and track <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> velocity profiles, and pressure fluctuations in vivo.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which different types of <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> and other physical cues have different effects on vascular remodelling in the embryo is called mechanotransduction. It is known that turbulent flow, which is commonplace in the developing vasculature, {{plays a role in}} the formation of cardiac valves which prevent backflows associated with turbulence. It has also been shown that heterogeneous <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> in large vessels can create asymmetry, perhaps by preferentially activating genes such as PITX2 {{on one side of the}} vessel, or perhaps by inducing circumferential stretch on one side, promoting regression on the other side. Laminar flow also has genetic effects, such as reducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, aligning cells in direction of flow, and regulating many cell signalling factors. Mechanotransduction may act either by positive or negative feedback loops, which may activate or repress certain genes to respond to the physical stress or strain placed on the vessel.|$|E
40|$|The {{predictive}} {{value of the}} left ventricular spatial <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> for thrombus formation was determined in 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction. A normal <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> by pulsed Doppler echocardiography was characterized by 1) simultaneous onset of blood motion at the mitral valve and apical level, and 2) a discontinuous Doppler signal along the lateral wall and interventricular septum. The <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> was assessed by these criteria, within 24 h after the onset of complaints and after 6 and 12 weeks. In 46 of the 62 patients, a normal <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> was found at the first examination; none of these 46 patients developed a thrombus during the study period.
