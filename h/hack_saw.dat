40|$|The {{identification}} of damage in structural systems, including characterization of damage location and severity, is of extreme {{interest to the}} structural engineering profession. To date, many damage detection methods have been proposed that utilize global structural response measurements in the time and frequency domains to hypothesize the existence of structural damage. The accuracy and robustness of current damage detection methodologies could be improved {{through the use of}} active sensors. Active sensors, such as piezoelectric pads, impart low-energy acoustic excitations into structural elements and can record the corresponding system behavior. In this study, a novel methodology utilizing the input-output behavior of actively sensed structural elements is proposed. The poles of ARX time-series models describing modal frequencies and damping ratios are plotted upon the discrete-time complex plane and Perceptron linear classifiers employed to determine if poles of the structural element in an unknown state (damaged or undamaged) can be separated with those of the undamaged structure. If poles of the unknown state are separable from those of the undamaged state, the system is diagnosed as damaged. A simple cantilevered aluminum plate damaged by <b>hack</b> <b>saw</b> cuts is actively sensed by piezoelectric pads to show the efficacy of the proposed damage detection methodology. Furthermore, the number of misclassified poles and the final value of the Perceptron criterion function can be shown to be correlated to the severity of the damage...|$|E

50|$|A {{specialty}} form {{of logging}} involving the felling of trees {{for the production}} of railroad ties was known as tie hacking. These lumberjacks, called tie <b>hacks,</b> used <b>saws</b> to fell trees and cut to length, and a broadaxe to flatten two or all four sides of the log to create railroad ties. Later, portable saw mills were used to cut and shape ties. Tie hacking was an important form of logging in Wyoming and northern Colorado and the remains of tie hacking camps can be found on National Forest land. The remains of flumes can be seen near Dubois, Wyoming and Old Roach, Colorado. In addition, a decaying splash dam exists near the Old Roach site as well. There tie hacks attempted to float logs down to the Laramie River for the annual spring tie drives, and the splash dam was used to collect winter snowmelt to increase the water flow for the tie drive.|$|R

2500|$|In 2010, sportswriter Joe Posnanski, {{writing for}} Sports Illustrated, named Paige as the hardest thrower {{in the history}} of baseball.

Oh, he named them {{different}} names—Bat Dodger, Midnight Rider, Midnight Creeper, Jump Ball, Trouble Ball—but essentially they were all fastballs. And he was still unhittable {{for the better part of}} 15 years. One pitch. It's a lot like Mariano Rivera, except he wasn't doing it for one inning at a time.

6000|$|We {{have already}} had {{occasion}} to observe that Mrs. Chirrup is an incomparable housewife. In all the arts of domestic arrangement and management, in all the mysteries of confectionery-making, pickling, and preserving, never was such a thorough adept as that nice little body. She is, besides, a cunning worker in muslin and fine linen, and a special hand at marketing to the very best advantage. But if there be one branch of housekeeping in which she excels to an utterly unparalleled and unprecedented extent, {{it is in the}} important one of carving. A roast goose is universally allowed to be the great stumbling-block in the way of young aspirants to perfection in this department of science; many promising carvers, beginning with legs of mutton, and preserving a good reputation through fillets of veal, sirloins of beef, quarters of lamb, fowls, and even ducks, have sunk before a roast goose, and lost caste and character for ever. To Mrs. Chirrup the resolving a goose into its smallest component parts is a pleasant pastime—a practical joke—a thing to be done in a minute or so, without the smallest interruption to the conversation of the time. No handing the dish over to an unfortunate man upon her right or left, no wild sharpening of the knife, no <b>hacking</b> and <b>sawing</b> at an unruly joint, no noise, no splash, no heat, no leaving off in despair; all is confidence and cheerfulness. The dish is set upon the table, the cover is removed; for an instant, and only an instant, you observe that Mrs. Chirrup’s attention is distracted; she smiles, but heareth not. You proceed with your story; meanwhile the glittering knife is slowly upraised, both Mrs. Chirrup’s wrists are slightly but not ungracefully agitated, she compresses her lips for an instant, then breaks into a smile, and all is over. The legs of the bird slide gently down into a pool of gravy, the wings seem to melt from the body, the breast separates into a row of juicy slices, the smaller and more complicated parts of his anatomy are perfectly developed, a cavern of stuffing is revealed, and the goose is gone! ...|$|R
40|$|Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru (your {{eyesight}} {{gets better}} and better in a short rate of time) – New works by Ian Dawson C&C Gallery London 27. 2. 14 - 25. 3. 14 First confronted with teetering steel structures, plinths; constructions of grey painted sup- ports. These butchered remains of trolleys and frames; welded and reconfigured relics assert {{their presence in the}} space from afar, the viewers eye piecing together the utilitarian frag- ments, a section of ladder or a slice of girder, caricatures of their former selves. The eye is drawn in toward a surface; which has been drilled, slashed, <b>hacked</b> and <b>sawn,</b> hu- man hands have chopped chunks off. The cast as a replica, a copy housing the identity of the original has been further destroyed. And on closer scrutiny these surfaces are inhabited by little manufactured people going about their ascribed business, these sculptures morph into landscapes, asking to be scrutinised in ever more depth for meaning. The pressure between abstraction and figuration is present within this cyclical drama. Abstraction an oppositional force of dreams and illusions which on the one hand offers the unadorned fact of the physicality of material and surface, {{yet at the same time}} performs that act of making ‘a space apart from life’, which in turn is re-populated by figures such as sunbather’s, perhaps passing the time unperturbed by this chain of events. The phenomena of the eye being drawn in to both delight and question the role of detail and surface continues in Dawson’s new paintings, these have an utter simplicity to them, a dot made up from lots of other dots. These paintings appear both randomized yet sequenced, with the viewer left wondering what form of optical illusion is at work as the eye attempts to discern an image. Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru (your eyesight gets {{better and better}} in a short rate of time), was the first publication of the magic eye pictures that briefly became all the rage in the 1990 ’s, those abstract all over patterns that would reveal a floating image (of a dinosaur or hemp plant for example) providing you had the determination to force your eyes out of focus with the pattern. Seeing one thing and then another thing within it, termed ‘(a) spect dawning’ by Wittgen- stein, raises apprehensions, of something that did not appear to be there before and it is per- haps the apprehension of this hiddenness that these works evoke. ?The brightly coloured dots of Dawson’s paintings coalesce sometimes clustering, forming cre- ating a pictorial relationship to cosmological constellations, of galaxies and star formations. Searching for a pattern within these dots, the viewer is perhaps reminded of the awe-inspiring moment of staring at the night sky, and perhaps what a distant memory this is. What would have carried meaning for tens of thousands of years is now a humbling yet detached experi- ence. By presenting both sets of works together for the first time, Dawson is posing intriguing questions, the viewers eyes are triangulated like a geographer between two different illusory bonds that of the flat terrain of the paintings and the occupied undulations of the sculptures. Miru Miru Mega Yokunaru, indeed, perhaps your eyesight will get better in a short rate of time. <br/...|$|R
