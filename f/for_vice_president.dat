Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana <b>for</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.|$|E
