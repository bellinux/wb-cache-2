5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) kills Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} sporadically, {{and is the}} only natural predator of the adult cockatoo. Carnaby's black cockatoo is occasionally parasitised by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei.

5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{good state of repair}} and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E

5|$|Only {{the white}} stone mosque, one village mill, the village health center, {{and a few}} {{partially}} destroyed houses remain on the site. The mosque has {{been converted into a}} carpentry workshop and one of the houses has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> neglected state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in the 1936 revolt, is clearly visible. The surrounding lands are planted with almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Hajja. The site is tightly fenced in and entry is blocked.|$|E
5|$|The {{design was}} {{reviewed}} by the Commission of Fine Arts, and in an April 29, 1976, letter, Commission member J. Carter Brown praised the design: I believe {{this would be a}} superb design for United States Coinage, rooted as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> great tradition, being based on the 'Liberty Cap cent' of 1794, following Augustin Dupré's Libertas Americana medal commemorating Saratoga and Yorktown (1777–1781).|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon {{the presence of a}} stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
