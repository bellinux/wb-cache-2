50|$|Quantum {{entanglement}} microscopes are {{a form of}} confocal-type differential interference contrast microscope. Entangled photon pairs {{and more}} generally, NOON states are used {{as the source of}} illumination. Two beams of photons are beamed at two adjacent spots on the <b>flat-surfaced</b> sample.

When the two beams hit the flat surface, they both travel the same length and produce a corresponding interference pattern. This interference pattern changes when the beams hit portion on the glass surface that are of a different height. The shape of the patterns can be resolved by analysing the interference pattern and phase difference. A standard optical microscope would be very unlikely to detect something so small. The difference when measured with entangled photons is precise, as one entangled photon gives information about the other. Therefore, they provide more information than independent photons, creating sharper images.|$|E

5000|$|Orohippus (Gr., [...] "mountain horse") is an extinct equid {{that lived}} in the Eocene (about 50 million years ago). [...] It is {{believed}} to have evolved from equids such as Eohippus, as the earliest evidence for Orohippus appears about 2 million years after the first appearance of Eohippus. The anatomical differences between the two are slight: they were the same size, but Orohippus had a slimmer body, a more elongated head, slimmer forelimbs and longer hind legs, all of which are characteristics of a good jumper. The upper premolars of Orohippus are more molariform (<b>flat-surfaced)</b> than in Eohippus, giving Orohippus more teeth for grinding, and the crests on the teeth are more pronounced, indicating that Orohippus probably fed on tougher plants. The outer toes of Eohippus are no longer present in Orohippus, hence on each forelimb there were four fingers (toes) and on each hind leg three toes.|$|E

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{effect of}} a nanostructured film, known as "moth-eye film," was investigated. The moth-eye film has artificially formed nano-pillars, consisting of hydrophilic resin with urethane acrylate and polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives, all over its surface that replicates a moth's eye. Experiments were performed to compare the moth-eye film with a <b>flat-surfaced</b> film produced from the same materials. The JIS Z 2801 film-covering method revealed that the two films produced a decrease in Staphylococcus aureus and Esherichia coli titers of over 5 and 3 logs, respectively. There was no marked difference in the antibacterial effects of the two surfaces. However, the antibacterial effects were reduced by immersion of the films in water. These results indicated that a soluble component(s) of the resin possessed the antibacterial activity, and this component was identified as PEG derivatives by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). When a small volume of bacterial suspension was dropped on the films as an airborne droplet model, both films showed antibacterial effects, but that of the moth-eye film was more potent. It was considered that the moth-eye structure allowed the bacteria-loaded droplet to spread and allow greater contact between the bacteria and the film surface, resulting in strong adherence of the bacteria to the film and synergistically enhanced bactericidal activity with chemical components. The antibacterial effect of the moth-eye film has been thus confirmed under a bacterial droplet model, and it appears attractive due to its antibacterial ability, which is considered to result not only from its chemical make-up but also from physical adherence...|$|E

40|$|Leak {{localization}} {{is essential}} for the safety and maintenance of storage vessels. This study proposes a novel circular acoustic emission sensor array to realize the continuous CO 2 leak localization from a circular hole on the surface of a large storage vessel in a carbon capture and storage system. Advantages of the proposed array are analyzed and compared with the common sparse arrays. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale stainless steel plate and leak signals were obtained from a circular hole in the center of this <b>flat-surface</b> structure. In order to reduce the influence of the ambient noise and dispersion of the acoustic wave on the localization accuracy, ensemble empirical mode decomposition is deployed to extract the useful leak signal. The time differences between the signals from the adjacent sensors in the array are calculated through correlation signal processing before estimating the corresponding distance differences between the sensors. A hyperbolic positioning algorithm is used to identify the location of the circular leak hole. Results show that the circular sensor array has very good directivity toward the circular leak hole. Furthermore, an optimized method is proposed by changing the position of the circular sensor array on the <b>flat-surface</b> structure or adding another circular sensor array to identify the direction of the circular leak hole.

40|$|Investigating Zirconia Catalysts = Handling Sensitive Materials B. S. Klose, R. E. Jentoft, A. Hahn, T. Ressler, X. Yang, F. C. Jentoft Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society Faradayweg 4 - 6, D- 14195 Berlin, Germany Introduction Sulfated {{zirconia}} (SZ) based catalysts {{are active}} for n-butane isomerization at 373 K [1]. Despite intense research, no convincing structure-activity relationship for these materials has evolved. Still {{in question is}} the role of the bulk phase of ZrO 2 which in its room temperature stable form is monoclinic [2], m-ZrO 2. The presence of sulfate [3] and the incorporation of cationic promoters such as Mn [4] increase the fraction of the tetragonal phase, t-ZrO 2. Transformations between the two phases are achieved for pure zirconia through ball milling [5] and pressing [6]. Our research focused on the influence of mechanical stress treatments on the catalytic activity. For SZ and manganese promoted SZ (MnSZ) the effect of milling, grinding, and pressing, on the bulk phase composition and the catalytic activity was investigated [7]. Experimental The precursor was (NH 4) 2 SO 4 doped hydrous zirconia (XZO 682 / 01, MEL Chemi-cals). The promoter was introduced by the incipient wetness method to give a Mn content of 0. 5 or 2. 0 wt%. The raw materials were calcined in 17 ml batches [8] in flowing air for 3 hours at 823 (SZ) or 923 K (MnSZ). For pressing, <b>flat-surfaced</b> stainless steel tools and a manually operated hydraulic press were used; milling was performed in a vibrating mill using 1. 5 ml stainless steel capsules and 300 mg of sample (all Perkin-Elmer). Grinding was performed manually in an agate mortar. X-ray diffractrograms were recorded using a STOE STADI-P-diffractometer, Debye-Scherrer geometry, and Cu K radiation. Catalytic tests were run in a fixed bed flow reactor. Samples (500 mg) were activated at 723 K in N 2. The feed was 1. 0 vol. % n-butane in N 2 (80 ml min- 1) at atmospheric pressure; reaction temperatures were 378 K (SZ), 323 K (2 wt% MnSZ), or 338 K (0. 5 wt% MnSZ). The effluent stream was analyzed by on-line GC with flame ionization detection. Further characterization in-cluded surface area and thermal analysis. Results and discussion During 10 min pressing at 540 MPa the phase composition of SZ changed from t-ZrO 2 to 33 wt% of m-ZrO 2. Also at more moderate pressing conditions (130 MPa, 1 min) an increase in the monoclinic fraction was detectable. For treatment of SZ and MnSZ (2. 0 wt% Mn) in a vibrating mill the fraction of m-ZrO 2 increased with increas-ing milling time from 2 h) remained unaffected. Ground 0. 5 wt% MnSZ showed a prolonged induc-tion period. The isomerization rate was never more than 30 % of values measured for the untreated catalyst. For many experiments (e. g. IR spectroscopic), powders need to be pressed or ground. All of these "standard laboratory practice" treatments alter not only the structural, but also the catalytic properties of sulfated zirconia catalysts. This can lead to problems in data correlation because data obtained in experiments that involve different sample handling procedures can reflect the properties of different materials.
