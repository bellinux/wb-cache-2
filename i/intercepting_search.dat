40|$|The {{calculation}} of a ray's intercept from an arbitrary point in space to a prescribed surface {{is a common}} task in computer simulations. The arbitrary point often represents an object that is moving according to the simulation, while the prescribed surface is fixed in a defined frame. For detailed simulations, this surface becomes complex, taking the form of real-world objects such as mountains, craters or valleys which require more advanced methods to accurately calculate a ray's intercept location. Incorporation of these complex surfaces has commonly been implemented in graphics systems that utilize highly optimized graphics processing units to analyze such features. This paper proposes a simplified method that does not require computationally intensive graphics solutions, but rather an optimized ray-tracing method for an assumed terrain dataset. This approach was developed for the Mars Science Laboratory mission which landed on the complex terrain of Gale Crater. First, this paper begins {{with a discussion of}} the simulation used to implement the model and the applicability of finding surface intercepts with respect to atmosphere modeling, altitude determination, radar modeling, and contact forces influencing vehicle dynamics. Next, the derivation and assumptions of the intercept finding method are presented. Key assumptions are noted making the routines specific to only certain types of surface data sets that are equidistantly spaced in longitude and latitude. The derivation of the method relies on ray-tracing, requiring discussion on the formulation of the ray with respect to the terrain datasets. Further discussion includes techniques for ray initialization in order to optimize the <b>intercept</b> <b>search.</b> Then, the model implementation for various new applications in the simulation are demonstrated. Finally, a validation of the accuracy is presented along with the corresponding data sets used in the validation. A performance summary of the method will be shown using the analysis from the Mars Science Laboratory's terminal descent sensing model. Alternate uses will also be shown for determining horizon maps and orbiter set times...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{widespread}} abusive practice of e-mail and Internet surveillance by employers in the American workplace. At present, U. S. employees in the private workplace have no constitutional, common law or statutory protection against abusive e-mail monitoring practices. In effect, American workers wave goodbye to their right to privacy as soon as they log onto their workplace computer because U. S. courts have formalistically applied a property rights regime to electronic surveillance of e-mail and Internet usage. This article uses the device of a hypothetical multi-national company to compare the diametrically opposed U. S. property-rights approach with the human rights approach to the European law of monitoring employees’ e-mail and Internet usage. Part I of this article reviews the case law and statutory developments for e-mail eavesdropping in the U. S. workplace. At present, American employers can lawfully <b>intercept,</b> <b>search,</b> and read any messages stored in workplace computers because courts have ruled that employees have no expectation of privacy in workplace electronic communications. Part II examines the European human rights tradition that accords workers a privacy expectation in the workplace. We explain the evolution of the human rights approach as a function of a wider social movement of worker’s co-determination in Europe. This part of the article next examines statutory and caselaw development from the Council of Europe and the European Union, as well as case studies of e-mail privacy rights in the United Kingdom and France, representing the common law and civil law traditions. In Part III, we propose that Congress enact the Electronic Monitoring Act of 2005, which is a proposed statute that will harmonize U. S. workplace monitoring law with European law. The model statute will provide U. S. workers with one-time written (?) supplemented by electronic notice of employer monitoring each time an employee boots up her computer. In addition, we propose civil remedies for non-compliance with the statute. The long-term impact of this model statute will be to appropriately balance the employers’ need to monitor with employee privacy. The long-term impact of the statute in the global economy will be to give American companies a competitive edge in cross-border transactions and reduce their liability costs. Our proposed Federal Electronic Monitoring Act is only the first step to harmonizing U. S. employment law with the rights that European employees have in an increasingly borderless global economy...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the periodic autocorrelation function (PACF) and periodic ambiguity function (PAF) for orthogonal continuous waveform (CW) modulations used in netted low probability of intercept (LPI) radar. Three orthogonal polyphase sequences and one frequency coding sequence are examined and their PACF and PAF characteristics are quantified. The Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and quadrature mirror filter bank (QMFB) timefrequency signal processing techniques and the cyclostationary bi-frequency technique (often used in non-cooperative intercept receivers) {{are used to}} detect the orthogonal CW signals and extract their parameters. The results shows {{that a combination of}} the techniques used were able to extract the basic signal parameters of bandwidth and code period from the polyphase waveforms and also the frequency hop slots and code length from the frequency coding sequence.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on the priming effect in conjunction search has shown that repeating the target and distractor features across displays speeds mean response times but does not improve search efficiency: Repetitions do not reduce the set size effect—that is, {{the effect of the}} number of distractor items—but only modulate the <b>intercept</b> of the <b>search</b> function. In the present study, we investigated whether priming modulates search efficiency when a conjunctively defined target randomly changes between red and green. The results from an eyetracking experiment show that repeating the target across trials reduced the set size effect and, thus, did enhance search efficiency. Moreover, the probability of selecting the target as the first item in the display was higher when the target-distractor displays were repeated across trials than when they changed. Finally, red distractors were selected more frequently than green distractors when the previous target had been red (and vice versa). Taken together, these results indicate that priming in conjunction search modulates processes concerned with guiding attention to the target, by assigning more attentional weight to features sharing the previous target 2 ̆ 7 s color...|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the first season, the Botties were unaware of K's reasons for chasing after robots, but eventually learned of the existence of Solex and soon began racing Dr. K in the <b>search,</b> <b>intercepting</b> the last few robots to possess it before he could extract it. Dr. K's plans were delayed when Kan-It unintentionally absorbed half the Solex he had collected, which ended up in the possession of the Botties. Needing more, K launched an attack on the Botties Pit to get the Solex in their possession, only for Cubix to drive them off while revealing that he possessed crystallized Solex. Changing tactics, Dr. K and the Alien devised a plan to deactivate Cubix and take some of his Solex crystals. Adding it to what he possessed, Dr. K was able to power a humongous EPU he had created, which he then used to transform his HQ into the Kulminator. In the end, Cubix sacrificed himself to defeat Kulmintor and destroy the Solex within them both. Cubix would then be revived by the last remaining traces of Solex (obtaining the ability to speak on his own in the process), ending the threat of Solex for good.|$|R
50|$|In November 1791, Perseverance was {{anchored}} {{under the}} guns of the Tellicherry Fort with the 38-gun Minerva and the 36-gun Phoenix, while the East India Company was carrying out operations against Tipoo Sahib.

Having searched the Résolue and found everything to be above board, the British would have returned to their ships and left, but the French captain refused to continue in his vessel and insisted on it being treated as a prize of war. Britain was not at war with France however so the merchant vessels were allowed to continue and the British towed Résolue to Mahé where she was left at anchor with her topmasts struck. The French commodore at Mahé was furious and complained bitterly, both to the British commodore, William Cornwallis, and his own superiors in Paris.
