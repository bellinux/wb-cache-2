40|$|A high {{performance}} solar collector {{was developed to}} modify agricultural building environment such as dairy, poultry farm buildings and greenhouses. Moreover it should be efficiently utilized as a solar <b>dryer</b> <b>for</b> drying various <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and by products. The materials used include steel sheet with {{high performance}} of reflecting light, absorber tube, and angle iron and fully insulated drying chamber. A CPTSC was a tilted at 340 south (Equivalent to the latitude of Peshawar) Pakistan. A CPTSC a total reflecting surface area was 2. 9 m 2 respectively. The absorber tube having a surface of 0. 376 m 2 was fixed {{in front of the}} reflector at the distance equal to the focal length. The total volume of drying chamber was 0. 3135 m 3. An experiment was conducted to enhance the efficiency of the CPTSC and two air mass flow rate treatments were tested with normal and convective mass air flow rate, 0. 6 kg. Min- 1 and 1. 72 kg. Min- 1 under the average temperature of the month (January, February and March, 2012). Moreover, the proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of the research}} presented in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} potential of using a commercial 2. 3 kW heat pump dehumidifier (HPD) simultaneously as a <b>dryer</b> <b>for</b> high-moisture <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and <b>for</b> other domestic dehumidification/heating applications. A drying system incorporating the HPD was designed and constructed, along with instrumentation to gather data on the properties of process air as well as real-time weight of the material being dried. The HPD was equipped with an external water-cooled condenser that rejected excess heat out of the system. The design of the system allowed for conducting drying with recirculation of air as well as use of electrical heaters. In an open mode, the drying could be carried out simultaneously with room dehumidification and water heating in the secondary condenser. The drying experiments were conducted with apple, tomato and agar gels. The system was found to be more effective in drying of material with higher amount of free moisture such as tomato. Comparisons were made between HPD assisted drying (partial and complete) and hot air drying (at 45 °C and 65 °C) in the same system using apple as the test material. Colour changes (L*a*b* values) in the samples were compared between treatments. It was observed that the degree of undesirable colour change was least in case of the HPD assisted system. The HPD dried fruit exhibited better rehydration properties than the hot air dried samples. Water activity of the HPD dried samples was noticeably lower than that of the hot air dried samples at the same water content, indicating that the residual moisture was probably held under higher tension. Histological observation indicated that there was a lesser degree of damage to the cellular structure of apple when dried with the HPD than when dried with hot air alone. In terms of energy consumption, the process of HPD assisted drying is more expensive. Much of the energy input is rejected at the secondary condenser as excess heat. Unless this heat is recovered for another purpose, or the system is modified to reuse it for drying, the drying process must carry this loss entirely. The specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) for apple was as low as 0. 1 kg per kWh with the HPD assisted system. The SMER values for drying at 45 °C was 0. 5 kg per kWh and was almost 0. 8 kg per kWh at 65 °C. The HPD assisted drying system demonstrated the ability of heat pumps to link different energy related activities viz., drying, space dehumidification and water heating. The energy expenditure is expected to be impressive when considered for all the related applications. The concept of utilizing heat pumps on farms to link up different energy streams for better utilization of the low-grade heat sources is discussed. A possible drying efficiency assessment in the form of energy-based evaluation is proposed...|$|R

Fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> are category of perishable product. Perishable products will decrease the level of quality and value of products in line with increasing time. In order <b>for</b> fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> produced by farmers can be consumed by consumers in the right quantity, right quality, right place, right time and right price, it is necessary to design a supply chain network model <b>for</b> fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> by taking into account the level of product quality. This paper discussed the model development of supply chain network <b>for</b> fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> in East Java by considering the level of product quality. Supply chain of fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> consists of farmers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers. Supply chain network optimization model has an objective of maximizing the total supply chain profits. A numerical example is presented as the application of supply chain network optimization model <b>for</b> fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> The optimal result of supply chain network can be a recommendation to the East Java provincial government in the regulation of the distribution system of fresh <b>agricultural</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R

On the basis of assumption that distribution demand points <b>for</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> in Shanghai are 117 towns, 13 district governments, 1 People's Government and 1 county government, The cluster analysis method and Floyd algorithm have been employed to achieve minimization of all paths to get the Shanghai <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> logistics distribution center alternatives. Combined with the Fuzzy AHP, a comprehensive analysis of Shanghai <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> logistics distribution center alternatives is performed.

However, there are large differences between different EU regions. River basins which are identified with high positive nVWi, agr values (net VW importer basins) include the densely populated and industrialised regions of western Europe like the Rhine, Elbe, Po, Seine, Scheldt or Thames basins. On the other hand high negative nVWi, agr values (net VW exporter basins) are observed for rural and sparsely populated river basins on the Iberian Peninsula (Guadiana, Ebro, Duero), in western France (Loire, Garonne) and the eastern Baltic region (Nemunas) ...|$|R
