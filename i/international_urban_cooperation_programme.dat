40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is based on}} the analysis of the sustainability aspects in cross-border <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes.</b> The importance of this research topic consists in presenting if the implementation of the activities of the projects submitted under cross-border <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> {{is based on the}} sustainability aspects. In this matter, the article will present theoretical aspects of sustainable development, territorial cohesion and cross-border development and focuses on practical questions related to sustainability aspects {{in the case of the}} Romania â€“ Republic of Serbia IPA Cross-border <b>Cooperation</b> <b>Programme.</b> One of the main challenges of the cross-border area is also environmental challenges. Sustainable development is represents the fundamental objective of the European Union and refers to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. Countries cannot develop without existing cooperation between them, therefore EU policy is based on economic, social and territorial cohesion. Methodologically, the research is based on identifying of appropriate theoretical concepts corresponding to the chosen theme, collecting and processing data. The paper concludes with answers to key questions related to the integration of sustainable development aspects in cross-border <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> and projects. The results of the research have implications that could contribute to the current problem of absorption rate of EU funds, offering information about IPA cross-border <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes</b> and increasing the capacity of potential applicants to elaborate and implement projects for obtaining and using financial EU funds. The added value of the paper results from the fact that EU financing is a topical issue of great interest to European and national level. To the best of our knowledge, this topic has not yet been researched within the national literature. The author contributed by performing methodology of qualitative research, a study case regarding the Romania-Republic of Serbia IPA CBC Programme, which can be very useful for a better understanding of the European Union financial allocations through cross-border <b>cooperation</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
