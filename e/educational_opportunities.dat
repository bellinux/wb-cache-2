40|$|Equal <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> for all {{students}} {{has long been a}} goal of public education in the United States. Realizing equality of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> for English language learners (ELLs), however, {{has proven to be a}} difficult task. This article examines 1 high school community 2 ̆ 7 s perception of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> and its approach to equalizing it. The findings reveal a community-wide endorsement of a policy of equal treatment for equalizing <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity.</b> This policy of difference blindness, however, was found to produce inequities for ELLs in at least 2 ways: restricted access to course content and inaccurate assessment and grading. Although teacher participants recognized inequities, they considered them temporary and tolerable. As <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> was accessible only through English, equal treatment, which was perceived to speed English acquisition, was viewed to be the most effective approach for equalizing <b>opportunity.</b> Equality of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> at the school site, therefore, required ELLs to be normalized through linguistic assimilation, and an ideology of difference blindness through difference erasure was evident. Implications include the need for educational institutions to rethink approaches to equalizing opportunity and a call for reenvisioning <b>educational</b> <b>opportunity</b> as a participatory concept...|$|R

5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} for girls than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. <b>Educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} f the Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant program at Oregon State University achieved its goal of providing equal access to the benefits of higher education for students who have low financial resources as compared to students not receiving student financial aid. Design: The study had two major segments. The first segment compared 150 Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients with 150 non-financial aid recipients. These two groups were pair-matched to control for predicted freshman year grade point average. The two groups were compared over a five year period with respect to the following variables related to persistence or non-persistence: 1) academic year grade point average, 2) academic year mean completed credit hours, 3) withdrawal rates, 4) suspension rates, 5) return rates for the next fall term, and 6) graduation rates. The second part of the study investigated the possible differences between the various Basic Grant award levels when Basic Grant recipients were compared on the six variables. The six variables were also studied in relation to the various type(s) of financial aid received in addition to the Basic Grant. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. There was no significant difference between the number of credit hours earned by Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients and non-financial aid recipients. 2. Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients and non-financial aid recipients did not have significantly different grade point averages. 3. There were no significant differences between Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients and non-financial aid recipients with respect to withdrawal and suspension rates. 4. There was no significant difference in the combined fourth and fifth year graduation rate between Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients and non-financial aid recipients. 5. There were no significant differences in the return rates in the second through fifth years of study between Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients and non-financial aid recipients. The return rate for the sixth year, fall term, 1980, was significantly higher for Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients. 6. There were no significant differences in the persistence of Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients when the various Basic Grant awards were compared. 7. Significant differences were found in the second year return rate and the fourth year graduation rate for Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant recipients when the different types of aid packages were compared. Summary: It may be concluded that the Basic <b>Educational</b> <b>Opportunity</b> Grant program has met its goal of providing equal access to the benefits of higher education at Oregon State University. The five year study indicated that students receiving the Basic Grant persisted at a rate at least equal to that of students of the same ability level who did not receive student financial assistance...|$|R
5|$|<b>Educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> in {{emergency}} medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program {{in emergency}} medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E

In 2012, Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, an index that measures several variables to provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries. Although the country's governance score was higher than the continental average, it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa. Its highest scores were for safety and rule of law, and its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity, with a ranking of 47th on the continent for <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011. Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger Arthur Peter Mutharika defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.|$|E
5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E

5|$|The <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> for {{secondary}} modern pupils were limited {{compared to those}} at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the selection system; grammar schools and the eleven plus were also criticised for alienating working-class families. A reluctance to improve secondary moderns or expand grammar schools under the Conservatives prompted the Labour Government to issue Circular 10/65 in 1965 which requested local education authorities convert to a comprehensive system. In 1971, Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. New plans were unveiled in 1973: the High School and the Secondary Modern sites were to become mixed 11–16 schools and Carre's would become a sixth form college. Parents voted for the plans (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout. The County Council approved them, but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised in 1974 so that Carre's and the High School became 11–18 schools; the secondary modern would be closed, Westholme absorbed by the High School and the Church Lane site by Carre's.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities,</b> Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught how to teach a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of Israeli forces, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> and civil services, provision of housing {{and the establishment of}} local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially {{become a part of the}} United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon {{the withdrawal}} of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.|$|E

5|$|While {{leading the}} Allied Forces during World War I, the British won {{control of the}} city during the Third Battle of Gaza in 1917. After the war, Gaza was {{included}} in Mandatory Palestine. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion. New neighborhoods were built along the coast and the southern and eastern plains. International organizations and missionary groups funded most of this construction. In the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, Gaza was assigned {{to be part of}} an Arab state in Palestine but was occupied by Egypt following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. In 1957, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser made a number of reforms in Gaza, which included expanding <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> and the civil services, providing housing, and establishing local security forces.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish and Cumbric {{languages}} {{were replaced}} by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> widened and a growth of lay education cumulated in the Education Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed {{to the development of}} the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>educational</b> <b>opportunities</b> for {{secondary}} modern pupils were limited {{compared to those}} at grammar schools, prompting criticism of the Tripartite system. In 1965, the Labour Government issued Circular 10/65 requesting Local Education Authorities implement comprehensive schooling. In 1971 Sleaford parents voted in favour of comprehensive education, but rejected the Council's proposals. A new plan which envisaged Carre's becoming a sixth form college was supported by parents in a vote (1,199 to 628), albeit with a 50% turnout; the County Council approved it but allowed governors a veto. Following negotiations with governors at Carre's, the scheme was revised so that Carre's would be an 11–18 school and adsorb Sleaford Secondary Modern's Church Lane site. Despite support from most staff and all three headteachers, Lincolnshire County Council voted to return the scheme for consultation in 1975. A new system was proposed which retained all three schools, and when the Government ordered the Council to choose a comprehensive scheme in 1977 it submitted that proposal, which had become popular with parents. The next year the government dismissed it on grounds that the Sixth Forms would be too small, but the council voted against the two-school system once more.|$|E
