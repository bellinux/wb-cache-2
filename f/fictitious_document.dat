40|$|It is {{well known}} that in web search, users access only a small {{fraction}} of the presented results. Increasing the result space of web users to provide them more relevant information but without expecting them to access more results is thus important as the amount of information published on the web is continuously growing. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a digest page, which is a <b>fictitious</b> <b>document</b> built from the clustering of result documents returned by a search engine as answers to a query, and where each cluster has its documents summarized into the digest page. This paper presents preliminary designs regarding the construction, the presentation, and the ranking of digest pages.

60|$|What {{happened}} to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist {{for the next year}} or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always been believed that he found his way to Europe and met with some curious adventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was the case. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for this chasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In a recent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that he enlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for about eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner, receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. This account is plausible, but will need further explanation of its many discrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documents cited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So many fables have been published about Poe, and even many <b>fictitious</b> <b>documents</b> quoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any new statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{techniques}} for document modelling provide means for transforming document representation in high dimensional word space to low dimensional semantic space. The representation with coarse resolution is often regarded as {{being able to}} capture intrinsic semantic struc-ture of the original documents. Probabilistic topic mod-els for document modelling attempt to search for richer representations {{of the structure of}} linguistic stimuli and as such support the process of human cognition. The topics inferred by the probabilistic topic models (latent topics) are represented as probability distributions over words. Although they are interpretable, the interpreta-tion is not sufficiently straightforward for human under-standing. Also, perhaps more importantly, relationships between the topics are difficult, if not impossible to in-terpret. Instead of directly operating on the latent top-ics, we extract topics with labels from a document col-lection and represent them using <b>fictitious</b> <b>documents.</b> Having trained the probabilistic topic models, we pro-pose a method for deriving relationships (more general or more specific) between the extracted topics in the se-mantic space. To ensure a reasonable accuracy of mod-eling in a given semantic space we have conducted ex-periments with various dimensionality of the semantic space to identify optimal parameter settings in this con-text. Evaluation and comparison show that our method outperforms the existing methods for learning concept or topic relationships using same dataset...|$|R

40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. (Afrikaans) The frame-story (Ger. Rahmenerzahlung, Fr. conte à cadre, Dutch kaderverhaal, Afr. raamvertelling) can {{be defined}} as an outer story or {{narration}} that frames one or more stories or narrations. According to Wellek and Warren "(t) he frame-story enclosing other stories is, historically, a bridge between anecdote and novel" (1978 : 221). Two main types of frame-story are differentiated. The first type is an outer story framing a single story or narration (Afr. Geraamde enkelvertelling), while the second type is a fragmented outer story framing a construction of several seperate (usually autonomous) tales or narrations (Afr. sikliese raamvertelling). These narrations or tales are usually punctuated by fragments of the frame. Sometimes <b>fictitious</b> <b>documents</b> such as a diary, an old manuscript, a chronicle, or a newspaper report are used by the narrator in the frame or outer story. These "documents" form the basis of the story {{that he or she is}} going to tell, and at the same time they serve as a device to authenticate this story. The function of the frame can vary. It can serve as a mount or generator for the inner story or stories; it can be a component deriving its meaning from the inner story; or it can be a component with its own plot. The narrative structures and the way in which elements are arranged determine the interdependence between the frame and the inner story or stories. There is a differentiation of styles as well as a time distinction between the frame and inner story or stories. Nevertheless certain actions and events that take place in the frame are often reflected in the inner story or stories, and one plot sometimes parallels the other so that they underline one another...|$|R

5000|$|In 2009 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) set up {{a series}} of {{undercover}} tests to determine whether the IRB system was vulnerable to unethical manipulation. In one test, a fake product [...] "Adhesiabloc" [...] was submitted to a number of IRBs for approval for human tests. The product, company, and CVs of the supposed researchers were all <b>fictitious</b> and <b>documents</b> were forged by the GAO.

50|$|Versailles Group plc was {{incorporated}} in 1990, providing trade finance primarily to businesses with poor credit history. The rates of interest charged were high: approximately 21% per annum with additional administration fees of 2.5% - 3.5% of the invoices’ value. Versailles grew rapidly: revenue increased from £46.6 million in 1995 to £232.4 million in 1999; operating profit rose from £2.8 million to £15.3 {{million over the}} same period. The share price jumped from 7.5p on flotation in 1995 to £2.50 in September 1999, representing a £600m market capitalization and 140% CAGR in share appreciation. In January 2000, the Serious Fraud Office investigated Versailles and its management following its financial collapse in which it owed its banks, led by Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, more than £70m.

500|$|First {{published}} in January 2008, the monthly Torchwood Magazine included Torchwood comic strips in which Gwen appeared. Gareth David-Lloyd's comic, [...] "Shrouded", includes a scene set after Children in Earth, which shows Gwen cradling her young child. As Gwen is busy, Rhys {{is required to}} team up with Captain John Hart to save the timeline. During series two, the Torchwood website hosted an interactive online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Eve Myles makes a brief appearance as Gwen {{towards the end of}} the game, alongside Gareth David-Lloyd, when her character and Ianto shut down a broadcast from the fictitious Dark Talk studio. Throughout both series one and two, the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Gwen and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell— an insider's look into Torchwood— collects much of this ancillary online literature in hardback form, along with new material, some of which expands on Gwen's background and life before Torchwood. Details are given of Gwen's university attendance, a previous boyfriend named Bruce, and her time with Andy in the police force. Photographs are provided of Gwen and Rhys, which were used as set dressing in the TV series, and <b>fictitious</b> in-universe <b>documents</b> such as Gwen's personnel form and her Torchwood case reports.

40|$|Despite wide research-based {{support for}} the {{implementation}} of inquiry-based science instruction, very few studies have closely examined its enactment across varied modes of instruction. Such studies can contribute to a finer understanding of the knowledge teachers must have in order to implement high-quality inquiry-based science instruction. This dissertation study investigated the enactment of three modes of inquiry-based science instruction by three guest teachers who were university-based researchers. The 50 fourth grade student participants were matched on achievement and prior content knowledge and {{randomly assigned to one of}} six small groups across three conditions employing different modes of inquiry-based science instruction: first-hand investigation, second-hand investigation, and an interplay of first- and second-hand investigation (Palincsar and Magnusson, 2001). Children in the first-hand investigation condition directly manipulated scientific phenomena, collected and reported data, and used these data to make knowledge claims. Children in the second-hand investigation condition studied the phenomena by following the investigations of a <b>fictitious</b> scientist who <b>documents</b> her study in an innovative notebook text. Children in the interplay condition experienced an interplay of the first- and second-hand investigations.   Guided by sociocognitive theories of learning, the first phase of data analysis identified the differential opportunities for students to engage with scientific practices and conceptual claims across the modes of instruction. The findings from this analytical phase showed that in the context of this study, instruction featuring second-hand investigations provided students with richer opportunities for engaging with scientific practices and conceptual claims as compared to instruction featuring first-hand investigation. Following this, three sets of contrastive case studies were analyzed that demonstrated how opportunities for learning were differentially mediated across conditions. A cross-case analysis integrated a logic of inquiry focusing on the following issues: participant structures, children’s connections to prior experiences, and argumentation. The findings from this analytical phase illuminated particular affordances of the second-hand investigation instructional mode and the way that these affordances were brought to life by specific teacher moves. Thus, the study shows how the interplay between curricular affordances and teacher moves can collectively lead to rich scientific literacy learning opportunities for upper elementary students...|$|R
