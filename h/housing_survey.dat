As regards housing markets the <b>housing</b> <b>surveys</b> revealed a rapid increase of prop-erty prices in the 1999 - 2003 period that contributed to the further polarisation of housing market price levels. Besides, this part of the paper gives an overview of the composition of housing market transactions by regions and building types. The last section of the paper analyses the consequences of the latest housing policy measures, with special attention to the extension of housing loan subsidies and the introduction of the so-called Rental Dwelling Programme.
