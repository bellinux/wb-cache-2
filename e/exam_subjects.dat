5000|$|After {{finishing}} {{secondary school}} students usually take a school-leaving exam (matura in German, [...] "maturita" [...] in Slovak), which is a basic prerequisite for visiting a school of higher education (college), especially a university. Before 1990 this included obligatory exams in mathematics (written nationwide standardized + oral), Slovak incl. literature (written nationwide standardized + oral) and Russian and in one subject of the students's choice. After 1990, the system was changed, so that every school prepared its own tests and questions - at gymnasia in the subjects: Slovak incl. literature (written and oral), a foreign language (written and oral), two subjects of the student's choice (oral). The obvious problem of this system was low or missing comparability of the results. The maturita system was modified in 2005 again. The new system is supposed to replace the current entrance examinations to schools of higher education (colleges) in the future. The main changes are: one additional exam subject (for gymnasia), nationwide unified written tests for languages and mathematics (other subjects are supposed {{to follow in the}} future), a high degree of standardization of other exams, as well as the possibility for the student to choose whether they want to pass an A-level exam (the simplest one), a B-level exam or a C-level exam (the most difficult one, only for languages). At gymnasia, the <b>exam</b> <b>subjects</b> include: Slovak incl. literature (written and oral), a foreign language (written and oral), a natural science subject, and two other subjects of the student's choice in Slovak: http://www.minedu.sk/VZPP/VYHLASKY/2004_510.pdf ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems in the training centers is presenting an exam timetabling due to enrolled subjects for each student with maximum spread between exams. In this paper, a special mathematical programming model is presented which its purpose is to minimize interference of the time period of each exam for each student. It is too difficult and even impossible to optimally solve the above problem in a reasonable computational time. Thus, an evolutionary computing, for example genetic algorithm, is used as one of the stochastic search methods for solving an exam timetabling problem. The problem is considered as the assignment of facilities (i. e., exam subject) to the specific locations (i. e., positions). In other word, the <b>exam</b> <b>subjects</b> are assigned within time periods to its optimal position. ...|$|E

For the analysis, subjects {{were divided into}} three groups according to age and compared with age-matched controls. Ten subjects had some degree of color vision loss, which was quite severe in seven cases. All subjects had normal luminance contrast sensitivity. The results suggest that color vision changes related to chronic alcoholism can occur {{in the absence of}} impairment of spatial luminance contrast sensitivity and thus is an important aspect to be considered in the clinical evaluation of this condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{inspiration}} for this diploma thesis is a stereotype that some individuals are more talented to program than others. We investigate the innate and acquired origin of abilities {{in general and}} in a more specific domain - whether {{is the ability of}} solving algorithmically based exercises, stated in literature as a necessary skill for successful learning how to program, innate or acquired by learning. The first part of the theoretical part of diploma thesis is therefore a summary and comparison of read literature on the subject. In {{the second part of the}} theoretical part of this diploma thesis we focus on the field of data mining, especially on decision tree induction, being the model later used in the empirical part. In the empirical part of this diploma thesis we then describe the method of acquiring needed data through designing a two-part questionnaire, one part of which was used to evaluate the successfulness of individuals at solving algorithmically based exercises. The other part was used to acquire the data about student characteristics, which we believed could be linked to individuals’ success at solving algorithmically based exercises. We also describe the process of data modeling, with the use of machine learning and data mining methods, and then discuss the findings, which indicate the connection between certain characteristics of individuals (for example: success at mathematics matura exam, the selection of matura <b>exam</b> <b>subjects,</b> the frequency of solving logical puzzles) and the success at a algorithmically based exercises solving test. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if scores on review quizzes delivered by an audience response system (ARS) correlate with in-training exam (ITE) scores. Methods: Prospective observational study of EM residents at 6 accredited EM residency programs. Subjects included residents {{who had taken}} previous in-training examinations. Subjects participated in bimonthly review sessions using an audience response system. Twelve review quizzes were administered, each consisting of 10 multiple choice questions. After the in-training <b>exam,</b> <b>subjects</b> completed an attitudinal survey consisting of six Likert scale items and one “yes/no” item. A mixed linear model was {{used to analyze the}} data accounting for prior 2012 in-training exam scores and nesting due to institution. Results: Among 192 participants, data from 135 (70. 3 %) participants were analyzed. Results from the mixed linear model indicate that the total mean score on the review quizzes was a significant [t(127) = 6. 68; p < 0. 001] predictor of the 2013 in-training exam score after controlling for the 2012 in-training exam score.   146 participants completed the attitudinal survey.   96 % of respondents stated that they would like ARS to be used more often in resident education. Respondents felt the sessions aided in learning (mean 7. 7 / 10), assisted in preparation for the in-training exam (mean 6. 7 / 10), and helped identify content areas of weakness (mean 7. 6 / 10).   Conclusion: Our results suggest that scores from review quizzes delivered by an audience response system correlate with in-training exam scores and is viewed positively by residents. ...|$|E
