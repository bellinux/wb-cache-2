5|$|Although {{they had}} minor {{supporting}} {{roles in the}} film, siblings Andrea, Jim, Sharon and Caroline Corr formed their own band, The Corrs, with the film's music coordinator John Hughes acting as their manager. The band has since achieved international stardom, releasing six studio albums and more than 60 million records worldwide. Andrea would again collaborate with Parker on his 1996 film adaptation of the musical Evita. Glen Hansard continued performing with his band, The Frames, and achieved greater success and critical acclaim with the 2005 film Once.

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that an {{interstellar}} mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate). On the other hand, Andrew <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now. Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum, whereas those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum.|$|E

This was Kennedy's first loss. In retaliation, Kennedy struck Guerrero over the head with the chair after the match.

5000|$|<b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> been a {{supporter}} of the Civil Rights Movement.

[...] In the Indiana primary, RFK secured 86% of the black vote. His performance was strongest in cities with the largest black populations. Richardson noted that Kennedy was appealing to low-earning black voters. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> received support from blacks by [...] "an overwhelming margin". Support amongst black voters was one of the key factors in Kennedy's victory in Indiana. Samuel Lubell argued that the victory was partially inspired by RFK's support for corporate attempts to hire blacks; he wrote that <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> largely won [...] "the Negro wards".|$|R
500|$|This {{novel was}} widely popular {{and led to}} García Márquez's Nobel Prize {{as well as the}} Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972.

Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: [...] "Most critics don't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude {{is a bit of a}} joke, full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{characteristics}} that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; [...] "He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose". <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part {{a product of the}} composer's poor health: [...] "the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance [...] "a spirit of practical comradeship... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible".|$|E

Elaine believes that <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> {{changed his mind and}} not bothered to see her. George then tells Elaine that Kennedy did come, but missed her and went with Marla. They then see Kramer with the naked woman across the street. That night, everyone sleeps well—especially Kramer, who is sleeping with the naked woman—but it is not explicitly stated who won. (In the fifth-season episode [...] "The Puffy Shirt", George mentions that he [...] "won a contest" [...] when discussing refraining from masturbation with a hand modeling agent.

500|$|Bowen has {{described}} Tippett as [...] "a composer of our time", one who [...] engaged with the social, {{political and cultural}} issues of his day. [...] Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of [...] "ultimately optimistic humanism". [...] Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works [...] to seek [...] "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, {{while at the same}} time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is A Child of Our Time, of which Clarke writes: [...] "he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett... this [...] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the [...] task that he had set himself of [...] "transmut his personal and private agonies into... something universal and impersonal". Michael <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> referred to Tippett's [...] "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or [...] techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.|$|E
500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E
