The band's new album, Havens Dumb, was released on 3 October 2014.|$|E

40|$|The sediments {{recovered}} on ODP Leg 104 {{have been}} reported to be characterized by <b>hiatuses.</b> The <b>hiatuses</b> were defined by biostratigraphy and were believed to be caused by erosion related to temporary changes of bottom current composition and velocity. They have been associated with major paleoenvironmental changes, reorganization of global deep water production, and increased bottom water flows. Because of the importance of <b>hiatuses</b> for ongoing research, we decided to closely investigate the sedimentation history for the most significant Pliocene and Miocene biostratigraphic <b>hiatuses</b> by sedimentologic and geochemical means. The sedimentologic studies include clay mineral distributions, grain size data, and organic carbon concentrations. The geochemical studies include determination of 87 / 86 Sr ratios, 10 Be and Ir concentrations. The results of the sedimentologic studies suggest either that paleoenvironmental changes associated with <b>hiatuses</b> are not represented in the preserved sediments, or that the <b>hiatuses</b> are an artifact of interpretation of the biostratigraphic data. Strontium isotopes indicate continuous sedimentation for the interval investigated at Site 642, an interpretation confirmed by the steady decline in 10 Be. 87 / 86 Sr ratios in the interval from above and below proposed <b>hiatuses</b> H 2. 2 / 2. 3 and H 2. 1 / 2. 2 at Site 643 display stronger changes with depth than expected by steady sedimentation. Ir data for this same interval indicate reduced sedimentation rates. Combining both, sedimentologic and geochemical evidence, the proposed <b>hiatuses</b> could not be confirmed and may represent preservation artifacts...|$|R
40|$|Erosion and {{deposition}} rates estimated {{from the}} stratigraphic record frequently exhibit a power-law dependence on measurement interval. This dependence {{can result from}} a power-law distribution of stratigraphic <b>hiatuses.</b> By representing the stratigraphic filter as a stochastic process called a reverse ascending ladder, we describe a likely origin of power-law <b>hiatuses,</b> and thus, rate scaling. While power-law <b>hiatuses</b> in certain environments can be {{a direct result of}} power-law periods of stasis (no deposition or erosion), they are more generally the result of randomness in surface fluctuations irrespective of mean subsidence or uplift. Autocorrelation in fluctuations can make <b>hiatuses</b> more or less heavy-tailed, but still exhibit power-law characteristics. In addition we show that by passing stratigraphic data backward through the filter, certain statistics of surface kinematics from their formative environments can be inferred...|$|R

5|$|Quiriguá {{suffered}} a <b>hiatus</b> from {{the turn of}} the 6th century that lasted through {{to the middle of the}} 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal <b>hiatus</b> of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal's defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá {{suffered a}}n attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors.

5|$|Ataxia {{released}} its second and final studio album, AW II in 2007. Following the Stadium Arcadium tour (early May 2006 to late August 2007), the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{agreed to a}} <b>hiatus</b> of indefinite length. In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this, citing exhaustion from constant work since Californication as the main reason. Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, {{two months after the}} band ended their <b>hiatus</b> in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month <b>hiatus</b> between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead of}} schedule. They said they would not solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the <b>hiatus</b> actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the <b>hiatus,</b> they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E

40|$|Growth <b>hiatuses</b> {{in massive}} corals are usually {{indicative}} of past ecological or environmental stresses. Among 37 fossil Porites colonies surveyed from the reef flat of Dadonghai fringing reef at Sanya, Hainan Island, northern South China Sea, {{seven of them}} were found to show clear evidence of past mortality, representing a population of - 19 %. Among these samples, two of them (SYO- 13 and SYO- 28) display clear growth <b>hiatuses</b> reflecting mortality followed by subsequent recruitment, and five others exhibit a well-preserved mortality surface and no subsequent recruitment. The growth <b>hiatuses</b> were dated using high-precision thermal ionisation mass spectrometry U-series techniques. The age results suggest all the dated corals formed and died in the mid Holocene. Multiple dates below the growth <b>hiatuses</b> suggest that SYO- 13 and SYO- 28 died at 6298 -±- 11 and 6929 -±- 19 a BP (i. e. years before AD 1950), respectively. Multiple dates above the growth <b>hiatuses</b> indicate that growth in SYO- 13 and SYO- 28 resumed at 6257 -±- 14 and 6898 -±- 20 a BP, respectively. The calculated durations of growth <b>hiatuses</b> are therefore 41 -±- 18 a for SYO- 13 and 31 -±- 28 a for SYO- 28, respectively, implying growth resumed within decades after the mortality events. U-series dating of four other samples with dead heads suggests that they died at 6035 -±- 53, 6059 -±- 23, 6127 -±- 22 and 6474 -±- 24 a BP, respectively. In addition, using solution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), monthly resolution Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios were determined for the annual growth bands below and above the growth <b>hiatuses</b> for three of the dated samples. The Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca profiles indicate that the three corals probably died in different seasons (from spring to autumn), and the mortality appears to be unrelated to anomalous sea surface temperature-induced bleaching. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The first {{detailed}} stratigraphic {{record from}} a deep-water carbonate mound in the Northeast Atlantic based on absolute datings (U/Th and AMS 14 C) and stable oxygen isotope records reveals that its top sediment sequences are condensed by numerous <b>hiatuses.</b> According to stable isotope data, mainly sediments with an intermediate signal are preserved on the mound, while almost all fully glacial and interglacial sediments have either not been deposited {{or have been}} eroded later. The resulting <b>hiatuses</b> reduce the Late Pleistocene sediment accumulation at Propeller Mound to amounts smaller than the background sedimentation. The <b>hiatuses</b> most likely result due to the sweeping of the mound in turn with the re-establishment of vigour interglacial circulation patterns after sluggish current regimes during glacials. Thus, within the discussion if internal, fluid-driven or external environmentally driven processes control the evolution of such carbonate mounds, our findings for Propeller Mound clearly point to environmental forcing as the dominant mechanism shaping deep-water carbonate mounds in the NE Atlantic during the Late Pleistocene and Holocen...|$|R
