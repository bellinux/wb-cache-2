50|$|In some cases, a {{so-called}} bypass valve {{acts as a}} relief valve by being used to return {{all or part of}} the fluid discharged by a pump or gas compressor back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or gas compressor. This is done to protect the pump or gas compressor and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the <b>fluid</b> <b>path).</b> Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.|$|E

30|$|Cassettes (Figure  4) are {{designed}} to contain all disposable components and <b>fluid</b> <b>paths,</b> eliminating the need to clean or customize the apparatus between syntheses. These molded polyurethane cassettes contain stainless steel needles (Vita Needle, Needham, MA, USA), tubing, chemically inert three-way stopcock valves (EW- 31200 - 80, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), and a custom polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated silicone gasket (Specialty Silicone Products, Inc., Ballston Spa, NY, USA, and Cannon Gasket, Upland, CA, USA) against which the reaction vessel is sealed. The <b>fluid</b> <b>paths</b> are shown in Figure  5. Preassembled cassettes slide along rails into the ELIXYS system which are then locked down by clamps.

30|$|The Darcy {{equation}} {{states that}} if the pressure decline remains constant throughout the <b>fluid’s</b> <b>path</b> (for example for having an active aquifer), fluid velocity will also be constant (v = Q/A) and water will replace produced oil.

5000|$|In 1962 and 1963 Oldsmobile built a {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 215. The small-diameter Garrett T5 turbocharger with integral wastegate was manufactured by Garrett AiResearch and produced a maximum of 5 psi (34 kPa) boost at 2200 rpm. The engine had 10.25:1 compression and a single-barrel carburetor. It was rated at [...] at 4600 rpm and [...] at 3200 rpm. In development, the high compression ratio combined with the charged load created problems with spark knock on hard throttle applications, which led Olds to develop and utilize a novel water-injection system that sprayed metered amounts of distilled water and methyl alcohol (dubbed [...] "Turbo-Rocket Fluid") into the intake manifold air-stream to cool the intake charge. If the fluid reservoir was empty, a complex double-float and valve assembly in the Turbo-Rocket <b>Fluid</b> <b>path</b> would set a second butterfly (positioned between the throttle butterfly and the turbocharger) into the closed position, limiting the amount of boost pressure. Unfortunately, many customers did not keep the reservoir filled, or had mechanical problems with the turbocharger system which resulted {{in many of the}} turbo-charger installations being removed and a conventional 4 barrel carburetor and manifold installed in its place.|$|E

50|$|Components of a {{hydraulic}} system (e.g. pumps), controls (e.g. valves) and actuators (e.g. cylinders) need connections that will contain and direct the hydraulic fluid without leaking or losing {{the pressure that}} makes them work. In some cases, the components {{can be made to}} bolt together with <b>fluid</b> <b>paths</b> built-in. In more cases, though, rigid tubing or flexible hoses are used to direct the flow from one component to the next. Each component has entry and exit points for the fluid involved (called ports) sized according to how much fluid is expected to pass through it.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{operation}} of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a connecting tube and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement {{at the opposite end}} of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>path,</b> providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a suspension component which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal brake line tubing, and the brake at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that braided stainless steel hose is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system.|$|E

The second <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> terminates {{in the vicinity of the}} primary jet and is adapted to direct a secondary jet of fluid at the primary jet to deflect the primary jet toward the input orifice of the second <b>fluid</b> <b>path.</b> The resultant positive fluid feedback in the second <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> causes the primary jet to latch in a first angular position relative to the maximum recovery position when the control signal reaches a predetermined value.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a pre-pressurization <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> (consisting a damping hole, a buffer chamber, and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the pre-pressurization <b>fluid</b> <b>path</b> on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|E
30|$|By using {{waveforms}} from a dense seismic network, we {{estimated the}} distribution of the zones of high reflection strengths (S wave reflectors) at depths of 25 – 30  km in the northern Kinki district. We found a zone of high reflection strengths dipping to the north and that low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) occurred near the edges of the zone at depths around the Moho discontinuity. It is inferred from these results that fluid is concentrated in this zone of high reflection strengths. It is likely that the zones of high reflection strengths are <b>fluid</b> <b>paths</b> from the mantle, together with the hypocentral region of the LFEs, located near the S wave reflector.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the class of d-dimensional diﬀusion processes known as semi-martingales reﬂecting Brownian motions (SRBMs). Such processes arise as approximations for open d-station queueing networks. The data for such a process are a drift vector θ, a non-singular d×d covariance matrix Σ, and a d×d reﬂection matrix R. A standard problem is to determine under what conditions the process is positive recurrent. Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for positive recurrence are easy to formulate for d = 2, but not for d > 2. Associated with the pair (θ,R) are ﬂuid paths, which are solutions of deterministic equations corresponding to the random equations of the SRBM. A standard result in literature states that when every <b>ﬂuid</b> <b>path</b> associated with the SRBM is attracted to the origin, the SRBM is positive recurrent. In this article the author provides a family of examples, in d = 6, for which the SRBM is positive recurrent, but possesses a divergent linear <b>ﬂuid</b> <b>path.</b> Leonardo Pasin...|$|E
