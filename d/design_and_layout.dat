40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to show some of the {{advantages}} for the asynchronous implementation of a major synchronous structure. Three people were involved with the design of an asynchronous microprocessor modeled after the MIPS R 3000 microprocessor. This microprocessor implemented all of the MIPS reduced instruction set, while {{eliminating the need for}} synchronous clocking throughout the chip. Paul Fanelli modeled the asynchronous processor using VHDL (hardware description language). Kevin Johnson created circuit level <b>designs</b> <b>and</b> <b>layouts</b> of the arithmetic logic unit and supporting hardware.

25|$|During British colonial rule, Singapore's road {{rules and}} {{legislature}} which govern the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> {{of the road}} signs were directly imported from Britain.

The interior <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> remained largely unchanged throughout their life. Some 300 class units were modified to provide guard’s accommodation or space for bikes when the 860 class trailers were withdrawn in 1987.

25|$|The {{success of}} the tube map {{as a piece of}} {{information}} design has led to many imitations of its format.

25|$|The game {{begins with}} a single {{accessible}} ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser. Eight further ships, one for each race, are unlocked by completing various optional objectives. All ships except for two have two additional layouts — different color schemes, equipment, and crew — that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> begin focused on different game play aspects; the ship roster has designs for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact. The game can be modified by the user to alter the various ship configurations.|$|E
25|$|The main {{contribution}} of Alpha to the microprocessor industry, {{and the main}} reason for its performance, was not so much the architecture but rather its implementation. At that time (as it is now), the microchip industry was dominated by automated <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> tools. The chip designers at Digital continued pursuing sophisticated manual circuit design {{in order to deal with}} the overly complex VAX architecture. The Alpha chips showed that manual circuit design applied to a simpler, cleaner architecture allowed for much higher operating frequencies than those that were possible with the more automated design systems. These chips caused a renaissance of custom circuit design within the microprocessor design community.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the {{advertorial}} emerged. Advertorials {{are most}} commonly {{recognized as an}} opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, {{a new form of}} laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.|$|E

25|$|Basic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of Randolph Field (renamed Randolph Air Force Base in 1948), as the {{training}} facility {{to be built}} at Schertz, Texas, for the newly created Air Corps, was drafted by 1st Lt. Harold L. Clark of Kelly Field in 1928 and approved by Brigadier General Frank Purdy Lahm. Clark's draft for the central building combined all administrative functions under one roof, including the water tower with a rotating beacon on the top. He later donated his drawings to the Library of Congress. Atlee B. Ayres and his son Robert M. Ayres were hired to draft the construction plans. The $252,027.50 facility designated as Building 100 was completed on July 15, 1931, and opened on October 5, 1931.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{physical}} {{problems with the}} estate. Whilst the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> had exacerbated {{some of the problems}} such as crime, there were also issues with the quality of construction of the buildings. The design of the estate was based around three main roads - Farnborough Road, Tangmere Drive and Yatesbury Avenue - which were wide and straight, lending themselves to joyriders. Many pockets of the estate were hidden from view allowing muggings to take place, as well as drug dealing and drug taking. They became litter traps and fly-tipping could occur with ease. The design of individual buildings was also of concern, {{with a wide range of}} issues such as the ease of access for arsonists to the rubbish chutes of the maisonettes, which posed a safety hazard to residents. Issues regarding the construction of the buildings were noticed early into the estate's life. In the early 1970s, many homes were starting to experience damp and others were flooded as a result of leaking roofs. In the maisonettes, heating bills were between £300-500 quarterly and the homes remained cold in the winter. These issues regarding the construction were not confined to just the estate, but most other estates constructed in the Bison construction system. Birmingham City Council was eventually depleted of funds for the maintenance of the blocks and lift breakdowns became common, and were further aggravated by repairers refusing to work without security enforcement. They were also reports of teenage troublemakers setting fire to the staircases in the tower blocks. In 1991, a large concrete panel fell from one of the tower blocks and, although nobody was injured, it was reported locally and helped spark efforts for the regeneration of the estate to begin.|$|E

500|$|The <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the island}} in The Witness has been nearly {{consistent}} {{since the start of}} the game's development, with the team working on populating the world with specific puzzles, and detailing the landscape and other art assets. Sam Machkovech, a writer for Ars Technica that had played a demo of the game in 2012 and again in 2015, noted that the island had remained familiar between these two sessions. One aspect of the design of the game world is the use of power cables running across the island, connecting puzzle panels to the mechanics they control. Blow found these to help in the initial parts of the game to provide [...] "extreme clarity" [...] of where the player was to go next, but discovered that this also made the game too much of a grind of repeating the same pattern. Over the course of development, the power cable aspects were still kept, but the designers changed up how easy they were to trace across the landscape as a means to guide the player towards potential objectives.|$|E
