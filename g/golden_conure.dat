50|$|The {{golden parakeet}} or <b>golden</b> <b>conure,</b> (Guaruba guarouba), is a {{medium-sized}} golden-yellow Neotropical parrot {{native to the}} Amazon Basin of interior northern Brazil.|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Mg) {{infection}} of wild native Brazilian psittacines (Psittaciformes) which died of any cause during sorting, rehabilitation, or conservation, was investigated by PCR. Two previously described PCR methodologies using Mg specific primers were employed for the analyses of 140 swab samples (cloaca, trachea, or palatine cleft). Average positive Mg detection in cloacal swabs was 51. 9 %, with 80. 0 % (n= 5) of Blue-and-yellow Macaws (Ara ararauna), 60. 0 % (n= 3) Dusky Parrots (Pionus fuscus), 52. 5 % (n= 59) Amazon Parrots (Amazona aestiva), 50. 0 % (n= 2) Orange-winged Parrots (Amazona amazonica), 50. 0 % (n= 2) Jandaya Parakeetsor Jandaya Conures (Aratinga jandaya), 0 % (n= 2) <b>Golden</b> <b>Conures</b> or <b>Golden</b> Parakeets (Guarouba guarouba), and 0 % (n= 2) Hyacinth Macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). Palatine cleft swab sampling was {{more sensitive to}} detect Mg, with 85. 4 % (n= 17) detection rate, as compared to 67. 4 % (n= 46) obtained with tracheal samples, and 53. 5 % (n= 77) with cloacal swabs. The surprisingly high Mg incidence in psittacines kept in conservation or triage environments is possibly due to the proximity or cohabitation with several bird species during confinement and housing psittacines of different origins together. The implementation of biosecurity measures and species-specific facilities is recommended...|$|R
50|$|Other {{species of}} note include: pink backed pelicans. Stanley or Blue Cranes, White Naped cranes, Cassowary, Marabou stork and <b>Golden</b> <b>Conure,</b> {{also known as}} a golden parakeet. (Birdland is part of an {{international}} breeding program for this vulnerable species.)Desert House - sparsely planted greenhouse to provide a suitable environment for birds that prefer near arid conditions. Species include: Desert Finch and Carmine Bee-Eater.|$|E
50|$|Serrette {{trees are}} also {{important}} for some animals in their habitat. The fruits are important in the diet of certain wildlife, such as the <b>golden</b> <b>conure</b> (Guaruba guarouba), while Byrsonima leaves are food {{for some of the}} curious American moth-butterflies (Hedylidae). B. crassifolia plantings in the dry savannas of Oaxaca may even be suitable as substitute habitat for the Tehuantepec jackrabbit (Lepus flavigularis), an endangered species presently only found in three small relict populations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>conure</b> or Queen of Bavaria conure, Guaruba guarouba (recently {{reclassified}} from Aratinga guarouba) is, as {{the name}} implies, covered all over with bright yellow feathers, except for the green wing-tip feathers and the greyish horn-colored beak. Golden conures {{are among the most}} expensive conures both to purchase and to care for, although many owners feel that the benefits outweigh the cost. It is one of the rarest conures in the wild in addition to the pet trade. Many experts believe that these birds should not be kept in captivity unless in a breeding program.|$|E
50|$|For {{many species}} of domesticated animal there are no {{international}} groups, but numerous unrelated national organizations, e.g. the American Poultry Association, and the New Zealand Cavy Club. They may commingle the interests of keepers of pet and show animals, and breeders of livestock and working animals (e.g. the British Horse Society), or focus on {{one or the other}} (e.g. the British Show Horse Association). For some species, there are few multi-breed organizations, but many breed-specific clubs, e.g. the Australian Stock Horse Society, the Parthenais Cattle Breeders Association, the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of New Zealand, etc. Single-breed clubs often exist regardless of the establishment of multi-breed groups, and may or may not affiliate with them, while national organizations often have subnational affiliates. Organizations at any level may combine the features of a breed registry, a fanciers' membership organization, a competition governing body, a trade association, a preservation group, and other categories, and may be nonprofits or commercial enterprises. Similar species-specific clubs exist for various non-domesticated species, e.g. the <b>Golden</b> <b>Conure</b> Society and the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association.|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of molecular markers for population studies {{is an important}} tool for biodiversity conservation. The family Psittacidae contains many endangered and vulnerable species and we tested three kinds of molecular markers for their potential use in population studies of five psitacid species: 43 hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), 42 blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna), 23 red-and-green macaws (Ara chloroptera), 19 red-spectacled amazons (Amazona pretrei); and 18 red-tailed amazons (Amazona brasiliensis). We tested 21 clones from a genomic library of <b>golden</b> <b>conure</b> (Guarouba guarouba) minisatellites and 12 pairs of microsatellite primers developed for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and A. hyacinthinus. We also tested seven tetranucleotide repeat primers {{for their ability to}} amplify regions between microsatellite loci (inter simple sequence repeats, ISSRs). We were able to select seven markers that were variable in different degrees for three species (A. hyacinthinus, A. chloroptera and A. ararauna). The mini and microsatellites produced more polymorphic patterns than the ISSRs. The genetic variability of the species studied seems to be correlated with their endangered status...|$|E
40|$|Golden conures or ararajubas (Guaruba guarouba) are {{endangered}} parrots {{endemic to}} the Brazilian Amazon forest. Body mass, blood cell counts, and total plasma protein were determined for 70 clinically healthy golden conures captive at zoologic parks and private breeder facilities in Brazil. Hematologic results (mean +/- SD) were: Erythrocytes 3. 6 +/- 0. 5 x 10 (6) cells/mm(3), hemoglobin 12. 8 +/- 1. 4 g/dl, {{packed cell volume}} 46 +/- 3. 8 %, mean corpuscular volume 132 +/- 20 fl, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 36 +/- 5. 7 pg, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 28 +/- 3. 5 %, thrombocytes 26. 3 +/- 9. 3 x 10 (3) cells/mm(3), leukocytes 11. 9 +/- 4. 5 x 10 (3) cells/mm(3), heterophils 6284 +/- 2715 cells/mm(3), lymphocytes 5473 +/- 2408 cells/mm(3), monocytes 113 +/- 162 cells/mm(3), eosinophils 10 +/- 42 cells/mm(3), basophils 27 +/- 64 cells/mm(3). Body mass was 254 +/- 24. 9 g and total plasma protein (TPP) was 3. 54 +/- 0. 58 g/dl. No statistical differences were observed between genders within age groups. Differences between juveniles (J) and adults (A) were identified for TPP A), and MCHC (J > A). These results provide reliable reference values for the clinical interpretation of hematologic results for the species. Hematology {{may be an important}} tool for population health investigations on free-ranging <b>golden</b> <b>conure</b> populations and will also be essential to survey the health of release candidates in future reintroduction programs...|$|E
