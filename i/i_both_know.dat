2500|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1983 – In the Doctor Who episode [...] "Mawdryn Undead", the Doctor {{mentions}} the theorem in passing (quoting it as [...] "a treeful of monkeys"), stating to Tegan that [...] "you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> {{at the end}} of a millennium they'd still be tapping out gibberish." [...] Tegan's response: [...] "And you'd be tapping it out right alongside them." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they can’t {{go back to}} the other [...] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
5000|$|Betty Box {{said she}} was [...] "very {{surprised}} Rank let me do it... because they were very politically conservative as an organisation. Perhaps they liked the Peter Finch character being so corrupt because, after all, he was left wing. I must say I liked it very much... I enjoyed making it very much. I loved working with Peter Finch. He was drunk some of the time, and not always very easy, but I was just very fond of him. Ralph and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{how to work with}} him." ...|$|R
60|$|I kept {{no record}} of the time, and I cannot now recall the exact date on which the first {{favorable}} change took place. I only remember that it was toward sunrise on a fine winter morning when we were relieved at last of our heavy burden of suspense. The surgeon happened to be by the bedside when his patient awoke. The first thing he did, after looking at Eustace, was to caution me by a sign to be silent and {{to keep out of}} sight. My mother-in-law and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> what this meant. With full hearts we thanked God together for giving us back the husband and the son.|$|R
60|$|My {{lady and}} Mr. Godfrey (not knowing what Mr. Franklin and <b>I</b> <b>knew)</b> <b>both</b> started, and both looked surprised.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do you {{fence with}} me?" [...] she persisted, drawing on her gloves. [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> {{so far as}} regards those peace terms, that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{the value}} of these things," [...] he went on, with a little sweep of the hand. [...] "We know {{the value of}} them because we were once {{accustomed}} to them, because we have both since experienced the passionate craving for them or the things they represent. Chippendale furniture, a Turkey carpet, roses in January, hothouse fruit, Bartolozzi prints, do not march with an income of fifty pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, between you, {{keep an eye}} on her," [...] Hunterleys advised. [...] "And, Sidney, I don't want to make {{a coward}} of you, and you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that if there's danger ahead it's our job to face it, but have a care up at the Villa Mimosa. I don't fancy the law of this Principality would see you out of any trouble if they got an idea that you were an English Secret Service man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not likely}} to forget that night," [...] he said. [...] "What <b>I</b> swore we <b>both</b> <b>know.</b> Well? <b>I</b> have begun to keep my word. You know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The queen wisheth {{nothing of}} this sort--neither do <b>I.</b> We <b>both</b> <b>know</b> thee as an {{accomplished}} Christian knight already, and, as thou hast just said, {{there is no}} one to meet thy lance, for no one hath met with the encouragement to justify the folly. It is through this Colon that thou art to win the royal consent." ...|$|R
500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have {{run as high}} as 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't think even he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was my impression, my strong impression." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] Mannering said, as the brougham drove off, [...] "that you and I are {{speaking}} together merely as friends. I have nothing official {{to say to}} you. It would be presumption on my part {{to assume that the}} time is ripe for anything definite while you are still at the head of an unbeaten Government. But one learns to read the signs of the times. I think that you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that you cannot last the session." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one has," [...] Crawshay replied bitterly, [...] "and you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> who it is, Miss Beverley. But," [...] he went on, {{holding the}} gangway railing {{as she turned}} to descend, [...] "it's only {{the first part of}} the game that's over. Our friend has won on the sea, but I have an idea that we shall have him on land. We shall have him yet, and we'll catch him red-handed if I have {{anything}} to do with it. Will you wish us luck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Lutchester," [...] he said, [...] "that {{the last}} thing we want is to find America dragged into this war. Such a {{happening}} would be nothing more nor less than a catastrophe in itself, {{to say nothing of the}} internal dissensions here. On the other hand, as things are now, Washington is becoming a perfect arena for diplomatic chicanery, and I have just an instinct--I can't define it in any way--which leads me to believe that some fresh trouble has started within the last twenty-four hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You speak, sir, as one {{beyond your}} station," [...] Cromwell said; [...] "and methinks <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>both</b> {{your face and}} figure, which are not easily {{forgotten}} when once seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wager, my friend," [...] says he, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>both</b> {{your name}} and your nickname. I divined these very clothes upon your hand of writing, Mr. Mackellar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, children, children'" [...] came sweetly from Sam. [...] "You mustn't quarrel {{about the}} dear girls. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>both</b> {{of you are}} as much gone as can be. But----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} know," [...] Deane said, [...] "how we are {{to continue}} this discussion. For some reason or other, you are sitting there within {{a few feet of}} me and denying something which we both know to be the truth. You have a motive, I suppose, but whatever that motive may be, you cannot imperil it by speaking openly here. We are absolutely alone. There is not a soul within hearing. You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> Miss Rowan, that you hold that paper to obtain which your brother risked his life and met with such misfortune. It would be his wish, I know, that you should give it to me. The terms I offered him for its recovery were surely liberal. If you think otherwise, tell me your price. We are alone. You are not giving yourself away. Tell me your price!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Harrison," [...] he said, [...] "I am engaged just now, as {{you have}} doubtless surmised, in certain {{investigations}} {{on behalf of the}} usual third party whom we need not name. Those investigations have reached a pitch which might possibly lead me into a position of some--well, I might almost say danger. You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that there are weapons in this place which can be made use of by persons wholly without scruples, which are scarcely available at home. I want you to keep your eyes open. I have very few friends here whom I can wholly trust. It is my purpose to call in here every morning at ten o'clock for my letters, and if I fail to arrive within half-an-hour of that time without having given you verbal notice, something will have happened to me. You understand what I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{honest man}} will deny it," [...] said the scout, a little nettled at the implied {{distrust}} of his {{explanation of the}} mystery of the tides; [...] "and I grant that it is true on the small scale, and where the land is level. But everything depends on what scale you look at things. Now, on the small scale, the 'arth is level; but on the large scale it is round. In this manner, pools and ponds, and even the great fresh-water lake, may be stagnant, as you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they are, having seen them; but when you come to spread water over a great tract, like the sea, where the earth is round, how in reason can the water be quiet? You might as well expect the river to lie still on the brink of those black rocks a mile above us, though your own ears tell you that it is tumbling over them at this very moment!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, after {{studying}} film at UCLA, Michael McGreevey collaborated with his father, John McGreevey, on {{the script for}} the 1978 made-for-TV movie Ruby and Oswald: [...] "In reality, the movie, although it's called Ruby and Oswald, is a three-way depiction of those four days in Dallas where we cut {{back and forth between}} the documentary footage of Kennedy and the recreated story with Ruby and Oswald. Dad and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> a man named Alan Landsburg, who had done a lot of documentaries. We went to him with the project first and he knew Mel Stuart, who had done an Academy Award-winning documentary called Four Days in November (1964). So, Mel was attached to direct it and we went into CBS and sold it right away as a three-hour special event movie. I was very proud of that movie; it was very well done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane Withersteen, either you're a fool or noble {{beyond my}} understandin'. Mebbe you're <b>both.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you're blind. What you meant is one thing--what {{you did was}} to make me love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last Monday," [...] Bellamy went on, {{leaning forward}} and {{speaking}} in a soft but very distinct undertone, [...] "a man was murdered late {{at night in the}} heart of the city--within one hundred yards of the Stock Exchange. The papers called it a mysterious murder. No one knows who the man was, or who committed the crime, or why. You and <b>I,</b> Laverick, <b>both</b> <b>know</b> a little more than the rest of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Jesen," [...] he said, [...] "and mademoiselle--I {{speak to}} you both, for I {{recognize}} that between you there is indeed a union of sympathy and souls. Mademoiselle, then, I address myself to you. On certain terms I have offered to purchase for Monsieur Paul here a two-thirds share of the newspaper upon which he works, that two-thirds share which he and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> is in the market at this moment. I am willing at mid-day to-morrow, or rather to-day, to place within his hands the sum required. I am willing to send my notary {{with him to the}} office, and the affair could be arranged at half-past twelve. From then he practically owns Le Jour. Its politics are his to control. I make him this offer, mademoiselle, and it is a greater one than it sounds, for the money which I place in his hands to make this purchase--five hundred thousand francs--is his completely and absolutely. You move at once into apartments befitting your new position. Monsieur Paul Jesen is no longer a struggling and ill-paid journalist. He is the proprietor of an important journal, through whose columns he shall help to guide the policy of your nation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{speaking}} to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> they can’t {{go back to}} the other 1967 borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done." [...] Kissinger replied [...] "I couldn't agree more" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Holdenough," [...] said Everard, [...] "you are, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>both</b> a {{good man}} and a bold one, and I saw you last night courageously go upon your sacred duty, when soldiers, and tried ones, seemed {{considerably}} alarmed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It never {{struck me}} to tell her your wife was coming," [...] said the skipper. [...] "Where we’re to put ’em <b>both</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>know.</b> I s’pose it’s quite certain your wife’ll come?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It never {{struck me}} to tell her your wife was coming," [...] said the skipper. [...] "Where we're to put 'em <b>both</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know.</b> I s'pose it's quite certain your wife'll come?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} by the CBC, Ticketmaster has been quoted as saying, [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> there is a {{thriving}} ticket-broker industry ... so the law is really a fiction ... We very strongly feel the law needs to be modernized to reflect the reality of internet commerce. By keeping a price cap in place, you're really just driving the resale business into the shadows." ...|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008 Graves {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} return to The Misfits if asked. [...] "Jerry and I do not have a dysfunctional working relationship. Him and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> and I know he knows that I am on board. It is a phone call away. I won't step back into what I walked away from, but the problem isn't with Jerry and I. The problem is with Doyle and with Chud." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rose derides Bernard's plan to Locke, but Locke is more sympathetic. Locke {{tells her}} that he's [...] "done with the hatch", but Rose is skeptical. Locke tells her that Jack {{diagnosed}} a four-week period of healing, but Rose says [...] "you and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> it's {{not going to}} take that long". This is in reference to the airport flashback, revealing that she knows his secret, which is that after the plane crash, he was able to walk immediately.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{trust to}} our heels," [...] said Beatrice, stealthily opening the door; [...] "the coast is clear, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>both</b> your mamma and my papa {{will not stop}} us if they can help it. One, two, three, and away!" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{father and}} Eustace rode {{with us from}} London to Dover, {{and all the time}} I kept close to them. M. de Bellaise was well enough to ride too. His uncle, the marquis, went in a great old coach with the ladies, wives of some of his suite, and I should have been there too, but that I begged so hard to ride with my father that he yielded, after asking M. le Vicomte whether he had any objection. M. le Vicomte opened great eyes, smiled, blushed and bowed, {{stammering}} something. I do not think that he had a quite realised previously that I was his wife, and belonged to him. My father made him ride with us, and talked to him; and out in the open air, riding with the wind in our cheeks, and his plume streaming in the breeze, he grew much less shy, and began to talk about the wolf-hunts and boar-hunts in the Bocage, and of all the places that my father and <b>I</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> as well as if we had seen them, from the grandam's stories.|$|R
6000|$|... "You think you're honest, mother--but don't you see you've {{become an}} {{unconscious}} hypnotist? It's your subconscious self deceiving us <b>both.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> {{how you do}} it, but I know {{it must be a}} fraud." ...|$|R
