5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> {{morphine}} injection {{earlier in}} the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that the dog had been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was}} no smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Netherlands, Peres had been a child prodigy who, before turning eighteen, had edited a Hebrew grammar, as well as a volume of proverbs written in five languages.

5|$|Bound for Glory {{is remembered}} for Nash being {{removed from the}} main event and for Rhino's impromptu {{championship}} victory. Rhino becoming champion was ranked by TNA as the 21st greatest moment in the company's history. The event was dedicated to Reggie Lisowski, who died the night prior. Bob Kapur of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 9 out of 10, higher than the 2006 edition. It also received a higher rating by the Canadian Online Explorer than WWE's WrestleMania 21 PPV event held on April3, 2005, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> 5 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain was {{not made}} a Privy Councillor. He also spurned advice from Lloyd George about his choice of advisors (apart from James Stevenson from the Ministry of Munitions who was briefly Deputy for Civil Recruiting), instead {{appointing}} cronies from Birmingham who were as out of their depth as he was. Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not been told or consulted, he read in the newspapers that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011, FX officially {{announced}} that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series from Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, with both Murphy and Falchuk writing and Murphy directing. Dante Di Loreto was announced as executive producer. Production on the series began in April 2011. In July 2011, FX officially announced the project <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> series order consisting of 13 episodes. In August 2011, it was {{announced that}} Tim Minear, Jennifer Salt, James Wong and Jessica Sharzer had joined the series as writers.|$|E

In May 2007, {{it was announced that}} Sandra Bullock <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> lead role for The Proposal. Julia Roberts was originally approached by producers for a lead role in the film, but later declined. Nearly two months after the announcement, it was reported that negotiations were being finalized for Ryan Reynolds to star opposite to Bullock. In January 2008, Touchstone Pictures signed Anne Fletcher to direct the film. It premiered on June 1, 2009 at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California.|$|E

5|$|Realising the {{potential}} public relations coup {{in having a}} star sportsman enlist, officers recommended that Nash be seconded to the Army School of Physical Training (where Don Bradman <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> commission), which offered greater pay and rank and ensured that Nash would not be posted overseas, away from family. Additionally, a medical examination detected osteoarthritis in both his knees, derived {{from the number of}} injuries he sustained throughout his footballing career. Nash refused, stating that he did not wish to be treated differently from ordinary recruits, and enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, gaining the rank of Trooper.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> large grant from the Rockefeller Foundation {{that allowed them to}} hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory IV {{is remembered}} for Sting winning the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and Team 3D forcing Abyss through a flaming table. There were 35,000 who {{purchased}} the event, {{as reported by}} The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Bound for Glory IV had an attendance of between 5,000 and 5,500 people. Chris and Bryan Sokol of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10, {{the same as the}} 2009 edition but lower than the 2007 edition's rating of 7.5.

5|$|By July 1944, Oppenheimer had {{concluded}} that plutonium {{could not be used}} in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E
5|$|On October 9, 1922, a road {{located in}} the general {{location}} of MT 87 {{was added to the}} Montana State Highway system. By at least 1924, an auto trail known as the Banff Grand Canyon Road ran along the highway in the general location of MT 87. The next year, the highway <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> graded dirt surface, and was designated as part of the Great White Way auto trail, as well as the Banff Grand Canyon Road. Between 1925 and 1927, the auto trail designations were removed from the stretch of highway near present-day MT 87. By 1937, the main highway had been shifted north of the location of MT 87, and had been numbered as State Highway 1. A road remained in the location of MT 87, although it was unnumbered. This road had also been extended several miles northward to Lyon.|$|E

5|$|Pleydell's father, William, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> 95-year lease of the Midgehall {{estate in}} Lydiard Tregoze by the Abbott of Stanley Abbey in 1534. A 1545 record, {{ordering}} Gabriel to pay 26 shillings and 8 pence in benevolence {{to the crown}} under King Henry VIII, indicates that he was soon managing Midgehall's financial affairs. His father entrusted him in 1549 with tenancy of the manor house at West Ilsley, Berkshire and in September 1553 a sublease of the Midgehall estate. William died in 1555, leaving Midgehall's full lease to his wife, Agnes. When she died in 1567, Gabriel unsuccessfully challenged his mother's will (an action which estranged his younger brother, John) despite inheriting tenancy of the estate. Pleydell's father originally intended two of his elder sons—Virgil and Tobias—to succeed ownership before Gabriel. Virgil died around 1559 and by 1567 Tobias had been resident in Chipping Faringdon for 11 years, prompting him to relinquish his inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Trade unionists Vernon Hartshorn and George Barker were vocal {{supporters}} of the suffrage movement, while James Grant a socialist propagandist and keen seller of The Suffragette was imprisoned for five days after being arrested for obstruction while lecturing in Treorchy Square. Mary Keating Hill, a forty-year old wife of a Cardiff insurance manager, spent three weeks in jail for resisting the police and disorderly conduct. She <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> similar conviction days prior but her brother paid the fine; but {{she was determined to}} be imprisoned. On 21 November 1911, after the failure of the Conciliation Bill, anger spilled over into direct action and 223 suffragettes were arrested during a campaign of window smashing. Among the arrests were seven women with Welsh connections, including Edith Mansell Moullin, Mildred Mansell, the sister of Ivor Guest, MP, and Janet Boyd, sister of Sybil Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance, a {{collection}} of Ennio Morricone's film scores from the 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had no input in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> list of films whose scores were available {{to use in the}} collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven-minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, {{was not included in the}} list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song.|$|E
