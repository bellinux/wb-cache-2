5|$|After President Juan Perón's {{overthrow}} in 1955, Menem {{was briefly}} incarcerated. He later joined {{the successor to}} the Peronist Party, the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (Partido Justicialista) (PJ). He {{was elected president of}} its La Rioja Province chapter in 1973. In that capacity, he was included in the flight to Spain that brought Perón back to Argentina after his long exile. According to the Peronist politician Juan Manuel Abal Medina, Menem played no special part in the event.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Kirchner {{was elected}} deputy for the provincial {{legislature}} of Santa Cruz in 1989. The <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PJ), led by Carlos Menem, {{returned to the}} presidency in the 1989 general elections. She served as interim governor of Santa Cruz {{for a couple of}} days, after the impeachment of Ricardo del Val in 1990. She organized Néstor's political campaign when he was elected governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. In 1994, she was elected to the constituent assembly that amended the Constitution of Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Cristina {{had not yet}} {{graduated}} {{when they}} moved to Río Gallegos, and completed the remaining subjects with distance education. There have been claims made that she never graduated, and {{that she may have}} worked as a lawyer without having a degree. This idea was proposed by the constitutionalist Daniel Sabsay, and fueled by the reluctance of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) to release her degree. She registered at the Tribunal Superior de Justicia of Santa Cruz in 1980, the Comodoro Rivadavia's chamber of appeals in 1985, and worked as an attorney for the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1983. There are also logs of minor cases where she acted as a lawyer. The claim has been sent to trial four times, and the judges Norberto Oyarbide, Ariel Lijo, Sergio Torres, and Claudio Bonadio all ruled that she has a degree.|$|E
50|$|Mayor: Dr. Gabriel Rébola, for the <b>Justicialist's</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
50|$|It also {{happened}} in 1991, when Reutemann won the elections with 488.105 votes and 46.8% of votes for <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party's</b> 17 sublemas, and Horacio Usandizaga received 601.304 votes, but only 40.5% for Unión Cívica Radical's (UCR) 3 sublemas.|$|R
50|$|Zavalía {{was elected}} to the Senate in 2001 and took his seat in January 2002. Later in 2002, he stood as the Radical {{candidate}} to be governor of Santiago del Estero Province. He came second with 12% of the votes, losing heavily to the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party's</b> Carlos Díaz. Zavalía left the Senate in 2007.|$|R
5|$|During {{his short}} time in office, Rodríguez Saá {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new currency, the argentino, which would have circulated alongside the peso and the dollar. The civil unrest of previous days resurfaced when he announced his cabinet, as it included Carlos Grosso as Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers. Grosso was a very unpopular former mayor of Buenos Aires. As a result, Rodríguez Saá gave up his whole cabinet before they could take office, with the sole exception of Rodolfo Gabrielli, in the Interior Ministry. He also declared a sovereign default on the Argentine national debt, which was celebrated by the chamber of deputies. It was the highest sovereign default in history. Those measures, uncharacteristic of an interim president with a brief term of office, were rescented by the leaders of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{played an}} active role in the 2008 {{government}} conflict with the agricultural sector, when Cristina Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports that raised custom taxes to soybean exports to 44%. At that time, he became president of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> and publicly supported his wife in the conflict; Kirchner accused the agricultural sector of attempting a coup d'état. He spoke in support of a bill to set the taxes by law at a demonstration at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Many senators who had supported the government rejected the proposal, and the voting was tied 36–36. Vice-President Julio Cobos, president of the Chamber of Senators, cast the decisive vote in opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|Eduardo Alberto Duhalde {{was born}} in Lomas de Zamora, in the Greater Buenos Aires. He {{graduated}} as a lawyer in 1970. He {{was elected to the}} city legislature the next year, and presided over it. He joined the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PJ), and soon became leader of its local branch. He was elected to the local legislature of Lomas de Zamora, and appointed its president. The legislature impeached the mayor Ricardo Ortiz, as well as Pedro Turner, who was appointed mayor afterwards. This was part of a political reorganization promoted by President Juan Perón. Duhalde was appointed mayor in 1973 as a result. Many members of the Peronist Youth were killed in Lomas de Zamora during the Pasco massacre, which Duhalde blamed on the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance. He was ousted from office during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état. He worked as a real estate broker during the following years.|$|E
5000|$|He would {{obtain the}} <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party's</b> {{nomination}} for Governor of Santa Fe as a compromise candidate chosen by feuding Peronist factions ahead of elections in 1983. Elected in October, his {{margin of victory}} was the closest of the 22 gubernatorial races that year, defeating UCR candidate Aníbal Reinaldo by around 15,000 votes, or 1%. The computerized tallying system failed during a recount of the close election, and Peronist officials themselves later acknowledged the possibility that Reinaldo would have prevailed by 12,000 votes.|$|R
5000|$|Free from litigation, Bussi ran as a {{candidate}} for the Tucumán Provincial Legislature in 1997 on the conservative, [...] "Provincial Defense/White Flag" [...] ticket. Obtaining a surprising 18% of the vote, the showing (and his base of support among large provincial landowners) encouraged him to form the Republican Force party and run for governor in 1991. He led the polls during much of the campaign, though the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party's</b> selection of a popular singer, Ramón [...] "Palito" [...] Ortega, led to his defeat. Support from sugar plantation owners, who created the [...] "Patriotic Fund" [...] for a 1995 campaign, and Ortega's own lackluster performance as governor, led to Bussi's election to the post in 1995. During his tenure, he had an important railyard cooperative in Tafí Viejo shuttered and faced charges of embezzlement for failing to disclose a Swiss bank account worth over US$ 100,000; when pressed on the issue, Bussi refused to confirm or deny the allegations.|$|R
30|$|The FPV is {{an electoral}} {{alliance}} that {{was founded in}} 2003 within the <b>Justicialist</b> (Peronist) <b>Party</b> by Néstor Kirchner, who ran for President the same year. The party won the election with an unimpressive 22 % of the vote. However, in the legislative election of 2005, the FPV secured a majority {{in both houses of}} Congress, and in the presidential election of 2007, it obtained 45 % of the vote— 22 % more than its nearest rival. In 2007 the FPV candidate was Mrs. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the incumbent president’s wife.|$|R
5|$|He ran in {{the primary}} {{elections}} of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PJ) for the 1989 presidential elections. Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, prevailed in both the primary and the main elections and became {{the new president of}} Argentina. Rodríguez Saá was elected to the Constituent Assembly that drafted the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. He attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election. Not seeing any chance of prevailing against the president, he abandoned his candidacy. He also attempted to run in the primary elections for the 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle {{conflict}} {{was still an}} unresolved problem with Chile, despite the 1978 Papal mediation. The military, troubled by {{the trial of the}} juntas, called for rejection of the proposed agreement and a continuation of the country's claim over the islands. Alfonsín called for a referendum to settle the dispute. Despite opposition from the military and the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>party,</b> who called for abstention, support for the resolution referendum reached 82%. The bill passed in the Senate by a single vote majority, as the PJ maintained its resistance. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina was signed the following year, ending the conflict. The human rights violations committed by the Chilean president Augusto Pinochet remained a contentious issue, as well as the revelation of Chilean help to British forces during the Falklands War. The Argentine church invited Pope John Paul II for a second visit to Argentina in 1987, to celebrate his successful mediation. He celebrated World Youth Day next to the Obelisk of Buenos Aires, and gave a mass at the Basilica of Our Lady of Luján.|$|E
5|$|The Dirty War {{eventually}} ended, and the National Reorganization Process allowed {{political activity}} {{in preparation for}} a return to democracy. Kirchner led one of the three internal factions of the local <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (PJ), but Peronist Arturo Puricelli prevailed in the primary elections. Kirchner founded the Ateneo Juan Domingo Perón organization, which supported deposed president Isabel Perón and promoted political dialogue with the military. Cristina Fernández became an attorney of the PJ in Santa Cruz, with the help of Rafael Flores, a former friend from the FURN. Raúl Alfonsín, who was running for president for the Radical Civic Union (UCR), denounced an agreement between the military and the Peronist unions which sought an amnesty for the military. Kirchner organized a rally on behalf of Rodolfo Ponce, a union leader mentioned by Alfonsín in his denouncement. Alfonsín won the 1983 presidential election, and Puricelli was elected governor of Santa Cruz. Puricelli sought to unify the local Peronist movement by adding members of the other factions into his government, and appointed Kirchner president of the provincial social-welfare fund.|$|E
5000|$|Menem's {{contentious}} {{divorce from}} his wife of 25 years, Zulema Yoma, reports of massive corruption surrounding his in-laws and the resignation under indictment of his Public Works Minister and privatizations guru, Roberto Dromi, could not overshadow the improving economic climate among the electorate at large. The <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party's</b> victory in the 1991 mid-term elections {{was not so much}} absolute as it was relative: the party made no inroads into their large majorities in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies or among the nation's governors; indeed, they lost 3 of their 17 governors elected in 1987. They did, however, increase their difference over the UCR, whose leader, former President Raúl Alfonsín, resigned amid scorn over the shadow his chaotic 1983-89 tenure seemed to cast over these polls. The UCR, in two upsets, wrested governorships in Catamarca and Chubut Provinces, however. The paramount Buenos Aires Province gave Vice-President Eduardo Duhalde a 2-to-1 victory over the UCR's gray eminence, former Economy Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese; in the Greater Buenos Aires area, on the other hand, one-time mutineer Col. Aldo Rico was able to translate voters' anger in the over rising illegal immigration and crime rates into an unexpected 3 seats in Congress for his far-right MODIN. These elections helped consolidate the scandal-plagued Menem's tenuous grasp on the presidency, making them (in his words) [...] "the day Menemism was born." ...|$|R
50|$|Drawing a {{contrast}} between {{his position and}} the lukewarm reproach by others {{in his own party}} and in other parties, Alfonsín, who had also opposed the Falklands War when few others in Argentina did, earned his party's nomination in July. The hastily organized convention was called only days after Bignone publicly announced the scheduling of elections (to be held on October 30, three months after the announcement). The UCR's only important opposition, the <b>Justicialist</b> (Peronist) <b>Party,</b> was hamstrung by voters' memories of President Isabel Perón's chaotic two years in office and by internal friction that dragged their nominating process on by nearly two months.|$|R
5|$|The {{elections}} were held on 30October. The Alfonsín–Martínez ticket won with 51.7% of the vote, followed by Luder–Bittel with 40.1%. It {{was the first}} time since the rise of Perón that the Peronist party was defeated in elections without electoral fraud or proscription. The UCR won 128 seats in the Assembly, forming a majority; and 18 seats in the Senate, constituting a minority. 18 provinces elected radical governors, and 17 elected governors from either the <b>Justicialist</b> or local <b>parties.</b> Alfonsín took office on 10December, and gave a speech from the Buenos Aires Cabildo.|$|R
5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, {{which led to the}} Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party.</b> He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá {{prepared}} a budget bill for 2002, which {{was sent to}} the Congress. It included an important decrease in the deficits, as requested by Anne Krueger from the International Monetary Fund. Krueger also requested a new coparticipation law, to determine the way the nation and the provinces manage tax revenues. Rodríguez Saá called for a meeting with governors in Chapadmalal, but only six governors out of twenty-three attended: Carlos Ruckauf, Juan Carlos Romero, Gildo Insfrán, Ángel Mazza, Carlos Rovira and Alicia Lemme. José Manuel de la Sota, governor of Córdoba, withdrew his support, suspecting that Rodríguez Saá had plans to cancel the elections and stay as president up to 2003. On December 30, he returned to San Luis with Daniel Scioli and resigned, alleging lack of support {{from the rest of the}} <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party.</b> Insfrán, Maza and minister Rodolfo Gabrielli tried to convince him to stay as president; his brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá supported his decision. In announcing his resignation in a Cadena nacional, he recounted the achievements of his one-week administration and accused Justicialist governors and legislators of meanness and shortsightedness. He dispatched his resignation from San Luis to Buenos Aires, and the Congress accepted it on January 1, 2002. The Senate chairman Ramón Puerta would have been the interim president, but resigned as well, so Eduardo Camaño, president of the Chamber of Deputies, was appointed interim president instead. After new deliberations, they elected Eduardo Duhalde as president, this time with a mandate that would fill the remaining time of delaRúa's mandate.|$|E
25|$|The current {{mayor is}} Julio Cesar Zamora, from the Renewal Front within the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
50|$|Her {{decision}} to cohost a 1982 television fundraiser {{devoted to the}} ongoing Falklands War cost the hostess professional clout following the advent of democracy in 1983, whose victorious UCR she supported, ironically. Continuing to host a number of radio and television shows, she relocated to Azul, where she hosted the nationally-broadcast La década del '80. Pinky became officially affiliated to the struggling, centrist Radical Civic Union following that party's 1995 election of Rodolfo Terragno as its President and, in 1999, she ran on the UCR-led Alliance for Mayor of La Matanza County, the most populous district in the Province of Buenos Aires. Claiming victory after early returns on election night put her narrowly ahead, {{she was forced to}} concede defeat later in the evening after a complete tally gave the <b>Justicialist</b> (Peronist) <b>Party</b> candidate, Alberto Balestrini, a narrow edge. Buenos Aires Mayor Enrique Olivera named her Secretary of Social Policy Promotion for the city in 2000, where she earned plaudits for her efforts against domestic violence. She returned to television to host Pinky y la conversación in 2001 and was awarded the prestigious Martín Fierro Award for Broadcasting Excellence in 2006. Having appeared for over 30,000 hours on Argentine television, she announced her intention to run for a seat in the Argentine Lower House of Congress to represent the San Justo area she was raised in and continued to live in. Running on the center-right Republican Proposal ticket founded by businessman (and current Buenos Aires Mayor) Mauricio Macri, Pinky was elected to Congress in October 2007. Her two sons, Leonardo and Gastón Satragno, formed Ultratango in 2003, a musical group performing in the Nuevo tango genre.|$|R
25|$|Elected in the March 1973 Peronist landslide, Garré {{became the}} {{youngest}} woman elected to Congress in Argentina to that date, and was among those on the flight that returned Perón to Argentina. She married Juan Manuel Abal Medina, who then was the Secretary-General of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party,</b> in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} still {{controversial}} figures, Juan and Evita Perón are nonetheless considered icons by the Peronists. The Peróns' followers praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and to dignify labour, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. The Peróns gave their name to the political movement known as Peronism, which in present-day Argentina is represented mainly by the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{there was}} a law {{proposal}} {{by the government to}} grant voting rights for all elections to legal foreign residents, as in Chile and Uruguay but with a residency requirement of 2 years. It was presented by <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> Senators Aníbal Fernández and Elena Corregido. A similar proposal had been rejected by the National Congress in 1890, reportedly from fear of anarchist and socialist immigrants.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from racing, Reutemann's popularity led the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> {{of the province}} of Santa Fe to invite him to run for governor. He won the election and ran the province for one four-year term (19911995). The provincial constitution {{does not allow for}} re-election, but after four years Reutemann presented again and won the governorship for the period 19992003. During those years, his profile grew and {{he became one of the}} leading politicians in Santa Fe and in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|After Evita Perón's {{death on}} 26 July 1952, Borges {{received}} {{a visit from}} two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE. Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained.|$|E
25|$|Soria was {{overwhelmingly}} reelected {{as mayor}} of General Roca in 2007, garnering 73% of the vote. He clinched the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> nomination for Governor of Río Negro in 2011, and ran {{with the support of}} the Front for Victory (FpV) faction of the party despite his long-standing alliance with the FpV's main rival, Duhalde. Soria's principal opponent in the race, UCR nominee César Barbeito, also professed his support of the FpV's standard-bearer, President Cristina Kirchner. The president formally endorsed Soria despite their past differences, however, while maintaining her distance from both candidates. Soria was elected governor in September with 51% of the vote, besting Barbeito by nearly 14%.|$|E
25|$|Elected by {{an ample}} margin, UCR leader Raúl Alfonsín {{excluded}} Frondizi {{from the economic}} policy discussions he held before taking office. In 1986 Frigerio succeeded the ailing Frondizi as President of the MID, though the former president remained influential in the party. The MID maintained a considerable following {{in a number of}} the less developed Argentine provinces, where voters had fond memories of the Frondizi administration's development projects. It helped elect allies within the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> (Peronists), in Formosa and Misiones Provinces, as well as Mayoral candidate Néstor Kirchner in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz Province; Kirchner was elected as governor and, in 2003, President of Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Cámpora and Vice President Vicente Solano Lima {{resigned}} in July 1973, {{paving the way}} for new elections, this time with Perón's participation as the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> nominee. Argentina faced mounting political instability, and Perón was viewed by many as the country's only hope for prosperity and safety. UCR leader Ricardo Balbín and Perón contemplated a Peronist-Radical joint government, but opposition in both parties made this impossible. Besides opposition among Peronists, Ricardo Balbín had to consider opposition within the UCR itself, led by Raúl Alfonsín, a leader among the UCR's center-left. Perón received 62% of the vote, returning him to the presidency. He began his third term on 12 October 1973, with Isabel, his wife, as Vice President.|$|E
25|$|The opposition's {{call for}} {{elections}} led to Levingston's replacement by General Alejandro Lanusse, in March 1971. Faced with strong opposition and social conflicts, General Lanusse declared {{his intention to}} restore constitutional democracy by 1973, though without Peronist participation. Lanusse proposed the Gran Acuerdo Nacional (Great National Agreement) in July 1971, which was to find an honorable exit for the military junta without allowing Peronism {{to participate in the}} election. The proposal was rejected by Perón, who formed the FRECILINA alliance (Frente Cívico de Liberación Nacional, Civic Front of National Liberation), headed by his new delegate Héctor José Cámpora (a member of the Peronist Left). The alliance gathered his <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Integration and Development Movement (MID), headed by Arturo Frondizi. FRECILINA pressed for free and unrestricted elections, which ultimately took place in March 1973.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 {{year was}} {{influenced}} by the general election in October. The youth organization Cámpora increased its influence in the government, disputing offices and candidacies with the traditional hierarchies of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> and the CGT. Cristina Fernández chose Daniel Filmus as her candidate for the mayor of Buenos Aires. On 21 June 2011, she announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora. She had highly publicized disagreements with Brazil regarding the trade quotas between the two countries. She also had a major dispute with the United States after seizing an American military airplane, accusing the U.S. of smuggling in undeclared firearms, surveillance equipment, and morphine for ulterior motives.|$|E
25|$|Following Perón's {{break with}} his party's left wing, Garré was {{among a group}} eight left-wing Peronists {{expelled}} from the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> caucus in the Lower House in January 1974. She remained in Congress until its dissolution by the military dictatorship installed during the March 1976 coup. Informed, as were most lawmakers, that leftist elected officials would be targeted for imprisonment or assassination, she sought refuge with her husband at the Mexican Embassy, where Abal Medina remained {{for the next six}} years. She later joined the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), a legal aid foundation established in 1979 to defend the human rights of those targeted by the dictatorship and request habeas corpus for these political prisoners. Obtaining safe conduct in 1982, Abal Medina sought exile in Mexico City and, after this separation, the couple were finally divorced.|$|E
500|$|Néstor Carlos Kirchner ( [...] ; 25 February 195027 October 2010) was an Argentine {{politician}} {{who served as}} President of Argentina from 2003 to 2007 and as Governor of Santa Cruz from 1991 to 2003. Ideologically a Peronist and social democrat, he served as President of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party</b> from 2008 to 2010, with his political approach being characterised as Kirchnerism.|$|E
500|$|Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner ( [...] ; born 19 February 1953), {{sometimes}} referred to by her initials CFK, is an Argentine lawyer and politician, who served as President of Argentina from 2007 to 2015. She was the second woman to serve as President of Argentina, the first directly elected female president, and the first woman re-elected to the office. Ideologically a Peronist and social democrat, {{she was a member}} of the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>Party,</b> with her political approach being characterised as Kirchnerism.|$|E
500|$|The CGT was {{splintered}} {{in internal}} factions at the time. Lorenzo Miguel had {{close ties to}} the <b>Justicialist</b> <b>party,</b> and led [...] "the 62 organisations" [...] faction. Saúl Ubaldini was more confrontational, distrusted the politicians of the PJ, and was eventually appointed secretary general of the CGT. His lack of political ties allowed him to work as a mediator between the union factions. Carlos Alderete led a faction closer to Alfonsín, named [...] "the15" [...] unions. The government sought to deepen the internal divisions between the unions by appointing Alderete as minister of labour and promoting legislation to benefit his faction. He was removed after the defeat in the 1987 midterm elections, but the government stayed on good terms with his faction.|$|E
