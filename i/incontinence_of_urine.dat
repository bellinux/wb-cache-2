40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare, in a {{randomized}} trial, {{the effects of}} individual and group physiotherapy for urinary incontinence in women referred by their general practitioner (GP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included {{women of all ages}} (mean 47. 8 years) with stress, urge or mixed incontinence; 126 received individual and 404 group treatment. Both groups undertook the same pelvic floor exercises and bladder training, and received the same information. The effects were measured soon after treatment and again 9 months later. The main outcome measures were objective changes in the severity <b>of</b> <b>incontinence,</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> loss and frequency <b>of</b> nocturnal <b>urine</b> loss. The trial was nationwide; 25 physiotherapists and 337 GPs participated. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} effect between the groups; after individual treatment the severity <b>of</b> <b>incontinence</b> improved in 60 % of the patients and the mean (95 % confidence interval, CI) frequency <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> loss decreased, by - 8. 7 (- 6. 4 to - 11. 1) times/week. After group therapy continence improved in 57 % and the frequency <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> loss decreased, by - 8. 4 (- 6. 8 to - 10. 0) times/week. For women who had nocturnal urine loss (at baseline), the frequency decreased after individual treatment by - 11. 2 (4 to - 26. 4) and after group therapy by - 14 (- 9. 1 to - 18. 9) times/month. All improvements persisted in full for up to 9 months. CONCLUSION: Individual and group physiotherapy are equally effective for at least 9 months in improving incontinence in women. Factors should be sought that can predict the effectiveness of therapy, and thus better select those patients most likely to benefit from therapy...|$|R

40|$|Aim. In {{this study}} we report our {{experience}} with microhematuria and its relation with bladder tumors in Iranian women. Materials and Methods. Overall 249 women were evaluated. Microscopic hematuria was defined as three or more red blood cells per high-power field {{on at least two}} different occasions. Patients with a history of gross hematuria or coagulation disorders, having organic diseases, urinary stones, urinary tract infections, nephrological diseases, and local lesions such as urethral caruncle were excluded from the study population. Final diagnosis of malignant tumors was done with cystoscopy and biopsy specimen pathological assessment in all cases. Results.

40|$|Context: Children {{older than}} {{the age of five}} with bladder {{dysfunction}} and fecal incontinence, often have a poor self-image, less social independence and more anxiety. Fecal incontinence frequently comes together with problems in behaviour and with a reduced quality of life of the child. To {{improve the quality of life}} of these children, tackling the fecal incontinence is very important. Aim: This feasibility research concerns a pilot for testing the quality of life of children who are treated for fecal <b>incontinence</b> as comorbidity <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> <b>incontinence</b> by day, on the basis of the dysfunction <b>of</b> bladder and <b>urine</b> tract. This study investigates the differences in perception of quality of life of the child before and after colon flush compared with children receiving treatment by oral laxatives. Method: The population, used for this study, consists of 20 children with constipation and urine incontinence by day, and their parents. To determine relevant elements of the current treatment and the perception of quality of life, four questionnaires were completed before and after the received treatment. After that, statistical analyses were conducted to reveal effects. Results: Despite considerable efforts to improve inclusion rates, in the end only 20 patients participated. This number is too small to test for statistical significance. Results will be tentativily presented by absolute numbers. Children who start with colon flush possibly show an improvement of quality of life at all questionnaires after the start of their treatment. The parents of these children seem to confirm this picture. Conclusion: At return to the central research questions, the absolute numbers seem to point at an improvement in children and their parents as to perception of quality of life, six till eight weeks after the children started with colon flush.

25|$|There is a {{continuous}} spectrum of different clinical presentations from <b>incontinence</b> <b>of</b> flatus (gas), through <b>incontinence</b> <b>of</b> mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term anal incontinence often {{is used to}} describe flatus incontinence, however it is also used as a synonym for FI generally. It may occur together with <b>incontinence</b> <b>of</b> liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus incontinence {{may be the first}} sign of FI. Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types. Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe <b>incontinence</b> <b>of</b> liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soilage, seepage and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree <b>of</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum.

Materials and Methods: Two double-blind, placebo controlled trials were conducted sequentially. Children 5 to 10 years old with <b>incontinence</b> suggestive <b>of</b> detrusor overactivity (1 or more diurnal incontinence episodes per 24 hours) were randomized to tolterodine (2 mg daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 12 in the number <b>of</b> <b>incontinence</b> episodes per week. Changes from baseline in the number of voids per 24 hours and volume <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> per void were also evaluated. Exploratory analyses were conducted to determine whether particular subsets of patients showed differential responses to treatment. Results: A total of 224 and 487 children (mean age 8 years) were randomized to placebo and tolterodine, respectively. Differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>incontinence</b> episodes per week, voids per 24 hours, and volume <b>of</b> <b>urine</b> per void between tolterodine and placebo did not reach statistical significance. This finding may be explained by a high placebo response and under dosage of tolterodine among children with greater body weight. Tolterodine was well tolerated. Conclusions: Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome did not reveal a statistically significant effect of treatment. However, secondary analyses demonstrated that tolterodine was well tolerated among 5 to 10 -year-old children with diurnal incontinence. Exploratory analyses also showed that children weighing 35 kg or less with detrusor overactivity characterized by incontinence and/or frequent voiding benefited most from tolterodine treatment, suggesting that a weight adjusted dosing regimen may be required for optimal response among older and heavier children...|$|R
