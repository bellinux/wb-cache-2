5|$|In October 1867, {{an agent}} for Swift & Co. {{negotiated}} a deal with Peru to purchase Catawba and her sister <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollars apiece. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, initially indicated that the company could repurchase the pair if it refunded the government's costs to build them, but {{changed his mind and}} said that he had no authority to do that. Congress debated the issue and ultimately decided that they would be appraised by a board of officers and that the highest competitive bid in equal to or in excess of the appraised value would be accepted. The ship was appraised at $375,000 and sold for that amount, possibly after a rigged bid, on 11 April 1868.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

In 1907, Cardiff's Coal Exchange was the first host to a business deal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> pounds Sterling.

500|$|A 2015 {{study of}} mammoth molars {{confirmed}} that M.columbi evolved from Eurasian M.trogontherii, not M.meridionalis {{as had been}} suggested earlier, and noted that M.columbi and M.trogontherii were so similar in morphology that their classification as separate species may be questionable. The study also suggested that the animals in the range where M.columbi and M.primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. In 2016, a genetic study of North American mammoth specimens confirmed that M.columbi and M.primigenius interbred extensively, were both descended from M.trogontherii, and concluded that morphological differences between fossils may therefore not be reliable for determining taxonomy. The authors also questioned whether M.columbi and M.primigenius should be considered [...] "good species", considering {{that they were able}} to interbreed after supposedly being separated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> years, but cautioned that more specimens need to be sampled.|$|E

500|$|How I Met Your Mother was {{inspired}} by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to [...] "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York," [...] where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E

In his rebuttal of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision, which made the same claim that the Earth's rotation could be stopped and then restarted, Carl Sagan noted that, [...] "the energy required to brake the Earth is not enough to melt it, although it would result in a noticeable increase in temperature: The oceans would [...] raised to the boiling point of water... how does the Earth get started up again, rotating at approximately the same rate of spin?

500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is that of Gaga getting kidnapped {{by a group of}} supermodels who drug her and then sell her off to the Russian mafia <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> rubles. It takes place in a {{fluorescent}} white bathhouse. The video begins with Gaga sitting on a white throne in a brightly-lit white room. The scene shows her wearing the razor-blade glasses and surrounded by people and a harlequin Great Dane. She has her finger on the mute button of an iPod speaker, and as she releases it, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] begins to play and a dimly-lit bathhouse is shown. A bright light pans across the walls, activating fluorescent lighting, which shines through a sign reading [...] "Bath Haus of GaGa". As the first hook of the song begins, a group of female dancers wearing white long-sleeved leotards with knee-high boots and matching crowns crawl out of white, coffin-like pods. The center pod has [...] "Mons†er" [...] written on it, and Gaga emerges wearing an outfit similar to those worn by the others, who begin to dance behind her. A pastiche of ensuing scenes alternates between Gaga singing to herself {{in front of a mirror}} and lying in a bathtub.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{returned}} to the Capitals for {{the last half of}} the 2009/2010 season. The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson, and in March 2011, she signed a contract <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> dollars to play in the WNBL. [...] This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country, with most of the top women earning only $50,000 a year. Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game, injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012–13 NBDL season. For the 2013–14 season, the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson and led her to play in China instead. Jackson was signed for the Capitals' next two seasons, and expected to join the team in November 2014, after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September. Jackson's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning. Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014–15 WNBL season, losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds. [...] Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates, and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee. During a double-header road trip in Victoria, Jackson's knee gave in. A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries, forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season. The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016.|$|E
