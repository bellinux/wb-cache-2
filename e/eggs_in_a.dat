5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share {{the tasks of}} incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi usually lays eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the}} top of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. P. schultzi has been seen laying <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rolled-up leaf in a web of Ischnothele karschi.|$|E
5|$|The female pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) {{will lay}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> willie wagtail nest, {{although}} the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful brood parasitism is rare.

5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover the eggs with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay the eggs on it, and then cover the eggs. In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E

5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> video game.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gelatinous mass, attaching them above or below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> batch, the less {{likely it is that}} any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake breeds from Britain and Ireland east through Europe {{to central}} Siberia. Although it has {{vanished}} from {{much of its}} historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye (Cleptornis marchei) is {{a species}} of bird in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis. The golden white-eye was once {{considered}} to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a white-eye, its position within that family is still uncertain. The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands, where it is sympatric (shares its range) and competes with the related bridled white-eye. The golden white-eye has golden plumage and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit, and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The bird is monogamous and lays two <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small cup nest.|$|E

5|$|Widespread across western, {{northern}} and eastern Australia, the brown honeyeater occupies {{a range of}} habitats from mangroves to eucalypt woodlands. It is seasonally nomadic within its local area, following flowering food plants. While it usually forages alone, it also feeds in small groups, or flocks of mixed honeyeater species. Nectar and insects form its diet. It occupies the same breeding territory each year, and lays two or three <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cup-shaped nest woven from grass and soft bark. Both sexes contribute to nest building and feeding the young. It has a loud, clear, musical song, described as {{the best of all}} the honeyeaters.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin <b>eggs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
